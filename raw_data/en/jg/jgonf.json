WAC 296 -62-07338 Appendix B --Substance technical guidelines for acrylonitrile. chemical data data: Boiling point (760 mm Hg): 77.3 C (171F); Specific gravity (water = 1): 0.81 (at 20 C or 68F); Vapor density (air = 1 at boiling po int of acrylonitrile): 1.83; Melting point: water, percent by weight @20 C (68\u00b0F): 7.35; Evaporation rate and Chapter 296 -62 WAC G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 26 Appearance and odor: Colorless to pale yellow liq uid with a pungent odor at concentrations above the permissible exposure level. Any detectable odor of acrylonitrile may indicate overexposure. (2) Fire, explosion, and reactivity hazard data . Lower: 3, Upper: 17. Extinguishing media: Alcohol foam, carbon dioxide, and dry chemical. Special fire -fighting procedures: Do not use a solid stream of water, since the stream will scatter and spread the fire. Use water to cool containers exposed to a fire. Unusual fire and explosion hazards: Acrylonitrile is a flammable liquid. Its vapors can easily form explosive mixtures with air. All ignition sources must be controlled where acryloni trile is handled, used, or stored in a manner that could create a potential fire or explosion hazard. Acrylonitrile vapors are heavier than air and may travel along the ground and be ignited by open flames or sparks at locations remote from the site at wh ich acrylonitrile is being handled. For purposes of compliance with the requirements of WAC 296-800-300, acrylonitrile is classified as a Class IB flammable liqui d. For example, 7,500 ppm, approximately one -fourth of the lower flammable limit, would be considered to pose a potential fire and explosion hazard. For purposes of compliance with WAC 296-800-280, acrylonitrile is classified as a Class B fire hazard. For purpose of compliance with WAC 296-800-280, locations classified as hazardous due to the presence of acrylonitrile must be Class I, Group D. (b) Reactivity: Conditions contributing to instability: Acrylonitrile will polymerize when hot, and the additional heat liberated by the polymerization may cause containers to explode. Pure AN may self -polymerize, with a rapid build -up of pressure, resulting in an explosion hazard. Inhibitors are added to the commercial product to prevent self -polymerization. Incompatibilities: Contact with strong oxidizers (especially bromine) and strong bases may cause fires and explosions. Contact with copper, copper alloys, ammonia, and amines may start serious decomposition. Hazardous decomposition products: Toxic gases and vapors (such as hydrogen cyanide, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxid e) may be released in a fire involving acrylonitrile and certain polymers made from acrylonitrile. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 27 Special precautions: Liquid acrylonitrile will attack some forms of plastics, rubbers, and coatings. (3) Spill, leak, and disposal procedures . (a) If acrylonitril e is spilled or leaked, the following steps should be taken: Remove all ignition sources. The area should be evacuated at once and re -entered only after the area has been thoroughly ventilated and washed down with water. If liquid acrylonitrile or polymer intermediate, collect for reclamation or absorb in paper, vermiculite, dry sand, earth, or similar material, or wash down with water into process sewer system. (b) Persons not wearing protective equipment should be restricted from areas of spills or leaks unti l clean -up has been completed. (c) Waste disposal methods: Waste materials must be disposed of in a manner that is not hazardous to employees or to the general population. Spills of acrylonitrile and flushing of such spills must be channeled for appropriate treatment or collection for disposal. They must not be channeled directly into the sanitary sewer system. In selecting the method of waste disposal, applicable local, state, and federal regulations should be consulted. (4) Monitoring and measurement procedur es. (a) Exposure above the permissible exposure limit: Eight -hour exposure evaluation: Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure under this section are best taken so that the average eight -hour exposure may be determined from a singl e eight -hour sample or two four -hour samples. Air samples should be taken in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent that inhaled by the employee). Ceiling evaluation: Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure under this section must be taken during periods of maximum expected airborne concentrations of acrylonitrile in the employee's breathing zone. A minimum of three measurements should be taken on one work shift. The average of all measurements tak en is an estimate of the employee's ceiling exposure. Monitoring techniques: The sampling and analysis under this section may be performed by collecting the acrylonitrile vapor on charcoal adsorption tubes or other composition adsorption tubes, with subse quent chemical analysis. Sampling and analysis may also be performed by instruments such as real -time continuous monitoring systems, portable direct -reading instruments, or passive dosimeters. Analysis of resultant samples should be by gas chromatograph.

NIOSH and OSHA have validated modifications of NIOSH Method S -156 (see Appendix D) under laboratory conditions for concentrations bel ow 1 ppm. The employer has the obligation of selecting a monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of the standard under their unique field conditions. The standard requires that methods of monitoring must be accurate, to a 95 -percent confidence level, to \u00b135 -percent for concentrations of AN at or above 2 ppm, and to \u00b150 -percent for concentrations below 2 ppm. In addition to the methods described in Appendix D, there are numerous other methods available for monitoring for AN i n the workplace. Details on these other methods have been submitted by various companies to the rulemaking record, and are available at the OSHA Docket Office. (b) Since many of the duties relating to employee exposure are dependent on the results of monitori ng and measuring procedures, employers must ensure that the evaluation of employee exposures is performed by a competent industrial hygienist or other technically qualified person. (5) Protective clothing . (a) Employees must be provided with and required to wear a ppropriate protective clothing to prevent any possibility of skin contact with liquid AN. Because acrylonitrile is absorbed through the skin, it is important to prevent skin contact with liquid AN. Protective clothing must include impermeable coveralls o r similar full - body work clothing, gloves, head -coverings, as appropriate to protect areas of the body which may come in contact with liquid AN. (b) Employers should ascertain that the protective garments are impermeable to acrylonitrile. Nonimpermeable cloth ing and shoes should not be allowed to become contaminated with liquid AN. If permeable clothing does become contaminated, it should be promptly removed, placed in a regulated area for removal of the AN, and not worn again until the AN is removed. If lea ther footwear or other leather garments become wet from acrylonitrile, they should be replaced and not worn again, due to the ability of leather to absorb acrylonitrile and hold it against the skin. Since there is no pain associated with the blistering wh ich may result from skin contact with liquid AN, it is essential that the employee be informed of this hazard so that he or she can be protected. (c) Any protective clothing which has developed leaks or is otherwise found to be defective must be repaired or re placed. Clean protective clothing must be provided to the employee as necessary to ensure its protectiveness. Whenever impervious clothing becomes wet with liquid AN, it must be washed down with water before being removed by the employee. Employees are also required to wear splash -proof safety goggles where there is any possibility of acrylonitrile contacting the eyes. (6) Housekeeping and hygiene facilities . For purposes of complying with WAC, 296-800- 220 and 296-800-230, the following items should be emphasized: (a) The workplace should be kept clean, orderly, and in a sanita ry condition. The employer is required to institute a leak and spill detection program for operations involving liquid AN in order to detect sources of fugitive AN emissions. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 29 (b) Dry sweeping and the use of compressed air is unsafe for the cleaning of floor s and other surfaces where liquid AN may be found. (c) Adequate washing facilities with hot and cold water are to be provided, and maintained in a sanitary condition. Suitable cleansing agents are also to be provided to ensure the effective removal of acrylon itrile from the skin. (d) Change or dressing rooms with individual clothes storage facilities must be provided to prevent the contamination of street clothes with acrylonitrile. Because of the hazardous nature of acrylonitrile, contaminated protective clothin g should be placed in a regulated area designated by the employer for removal of the AN before the clothing is laundered or disposed of. (7) Miscellaneous precautions . (a) Store acrylonitrile in tightly -closed containers in a cool, well -ventilated area and take necessary precautions to avoid any explosion hazard. (b) High exposures to acrylonitrile can occur when transferring the liquid from one container to another. (c) Nonsparking tools must be used to open and close metal acrylonitrile containers. These containers must be effectively grounded and bonded prior to pouring. (d) Never store uninhibited acrylonitrile. (e) Acrylonitrile vapors are not inhibited. They may form polymers and clog vents of storage tanks. (f) Use of supplied -air suits or other impervious coverings may be nece ssary to prevent skin contact with and provide respiratory protection from acrylonitrile where the concentration of acrylonitrile is unknown or is above the ceiling limit. Supplied -air suits should be selected, used, and maintained under the immediate sup ervision of persons knowledgeable in the limitations and potential life -endangering characteristics of supplied -air suits. (g) Employers must advise employees of all areas and operations where exposure to acrylonitrile could occur. (8) Common operations . Common o perations in which exposure to acrylonitrile is likely to occur include the following: Manufacture of the acrylonitrile monomer; synthesis of acrylic fibers, ABS, SAN, and nitrile barrier plastics and resins, nitrile rubber, surface coatings, specialty ch emicals; use as a chemical intermediate; use as a fumigant; and in the cyanoethylation of cotton. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens _____ Part G, Page 30 Appendix C --Medical surveillance guidelines for acrylonitrile. Route of entry . (a) Inhalation; (b) Skin absorption; (c) Ingestion. (2) Toxicology . (a) Acrylon itrile vapor is an asphyxiant due to inhibitory action on metabolic enzyme systems. Animals exposed to 75 or 100 ppm for seven hours have shown signs of anoxia; in some animals which died at the higher level, cyanomethemoglobin was found in the blood. Tw o human fatalities from accidental poisoning have been reported; one was caused by inhalation of an unknown concentration of the vapor, and the other was thought to be caused by skin absorption or inhalation. Most cases of intoxication from industrial exp osure have been mild, with rapid onset of eye irritation, headache, sneezing, and nausea. Weakness, lightheadedness, and vomiting may also occur. Exposure to high concentrations may produce profound weakness, asphyxia, and death. The vapor is a severe e ye irritant. Prolonged skin cont act with the liquid may result in absorption with systemic effects, and in the formation of large blisters after a latent period of several hours. Although there is usually little or no pain or inflammation, the affected s kin resembles a second -degree thermal burn. Solutions spilled on exposed skin, or on areas covered only by a light layer of clothing, evaporate rapidly, leaving no irritation, or, at the most, mild transient redness. Repeated spills on exposed skin may r esult in dermatitis due to solvent effects. (b) Results after one year of a planned two -year animal study on the effects of exposure to acrylonitrile have indicated that rats ingesting as little as 35 ppm in their drinking water develop tumors of the central n ervous system. The interim results of this study have been supported by a similar study being conducted by the same laboratory, involving exposure of rats by inhalation of acrylonitrile vapor, which has shown similar types of tumors in animals exposed to 80 ppm. (c) In addition, the preliminary results of an epidemiological study being performed by DuPont on a cohort of workers in their Camden, S.C. acrylic fiber plant indicate a statistically significant increase in the incidence of colon and lung cancers amo ng employees exposed to acrylonitrile. (3) Signs and symptoms of acute overexposure . Asphyxia and death can occur from exposure to high concentrations of acrylonitrile. Symptoms of overexposure include eye irritation, headache, sneezing, nausea and vomiting, weakness, and light -headedness. Prolonged skin contact can cause blisters on the skin with appearance of a second -degree burn, but with little or no pain. Repeated skin contact may produce scaling dermatitis. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 31 (4) Treatment of acute overexposure . Remove e mployee from exposure. Immediately flush eyes with water and wash skin with soap or mild detergent and water. If AN has been swallowed, and person is conscious, induce vomiting. Give artificial respiration if indicated. More severe cases, such as those associated with loss of consciousness, may be treated by the intravenous administration of sodium nitrite, followed by sodium thiosulfate, although this is not as effective for acrylonitrile poisoning as for inorganic cyanide poisoning. (5) Surveillance and p reventive considerations . (a) As noted above, exposure to acrylonitrile has been linked to increased incidence of cancers of the colon and lung in employees of the DuPont acrylic fiber plant in Camden, S.C. In addition, the animal testing of acrylonitrile has resulted in the development of cancers of the central nervous system in rats exposed by either inhalation or ingestion. The physician should be aware of the findings of these studies in evaluating the health of employees exposed to acrylonitrile. (b) Most re ported acute effects of occupational exposure to acrylonitrile are due to its ability to cause tissue anoxia and asphyxia. The effects are similar to those caused by hydrogen cyanide. Liquid acrylonitrile can be absorbed through the skin upon prolonged c ontact. The liquid readily penetrates leather, and will produce burns of the feet if footwear contaminated with acrylonitrile is not removed. (c) It is important for the physician to become familiar with the operating conditions in which exposure to acrylonit rile may occur. Those employees with skin diseases may not tolerate the wearing of whatever protective clothing may be necessary to protect them from exposure. In addition, those with chronic respiratory disease may not tolerate the wearing of negative -pressure respirators. (d) Surveillance and screening. Medical histories and laboratory examinations are required for each employee subject to exposure to acrylonitrile above the action level. The employer must screen employees for history of certain medical c onditions which might place the employee at increased risk from exposure. Central nervous system dysfunction. Acute effects of exposure to acrylonitrile generally involve the central nervous system. Symptoms of acrylonitrile exposure include headache, na usea, dizziness, and general weakness. The animal studies cited above suggest possible carcinogenic effects of acrylonitrile on the central nervous system, since rats exposed by either inhalation or ingestion have developed similar CNS tumors. Respiratory disease. The DuPont data indicate an increased risk of lung cancer among employees exposed to acrylonitrile. Gastrointestinal disease. The DuPont data indicate an increased risk of cancer of the colon among employees exposed to acrylonitrile. In additi on, the animal studies show possible tumor production in the stomachs of the rats in the ingestion study. Skin disease. Acrylonitrile can cause skin burns when prolonged skin contact with the liquid occurs. In addition, repeated skin contact with the liq uid can cause dermatitis. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 32 (e) General. The purpose of the medical procedures outlined in the standard is to establish a baseline for future health monitoring. Persons unusually susceptible to the effects of anoxia or those with anemia would be expected to be at increased risk. In addition to emphasis on the CNS, respiratory and gastro -intestinal systems, the cardiovascular system, liver, and kidney function should also be stressed. WAC 296 -62-07340 Appendix D --Sampling and analytical methods for acrylonit rile. (1) There are many methods available for monitoring employee exposures to acrylonitrile. Most of these involve the use of charcoal tubes and sampling pumps, with analysis by gas chromatograph. The essential differences between the charcoal tube methods include, among others, the use of different desorbing solvents, the use of different lots of charcoal, and the use of different equipment for analysis of the samples. (2) Besides charcoal, considerable work has been performed on methods using porous polymer sampling tubes and passive dosimeters. In addition, there are several portable gas analyzers and monitoring units available on the open market. (3) This appendix contains details for the methods which have been tested at OSHA Analytical Laboratory in Salt Lake City, and NIOSH in Cincinnati. Each is a variation on NIOSH Method S -156, which is also included for reference. This does not indicate that these methods are the only ones which will be satisfactory. There also may be workplace situations in which thes e methods are not adequate, due to such factors as high humidity. Copies of the other methods available to OSHA are available in the rulemaking record, and may be obtained from the OSHA docket office. These include, the Union Carbide, Monsanto, Dow Chemi cal and Dow Badische methods, as well as NIOSH Method P & CAM 127. (4) Employers who note problems with sample breakthrough should try larger charcoal tubes. Tubes of larger capacity are available, and are often used for sampling vinyl chloride. In addition, lower flow rates and shorter sampling times should be beneficial in minimizing breakthrough problems. (5) Whatever method the employer chooses, they must be ensured of the method's accuracy and precision under the unique conditions present in their workplace. (6) NIOSH Method S -156 (unmodified) desorption with methanol, GC. (a) Principle of the method. Reference (k)(i) of this subsection. A known volume of air is drawn through a charcoal tube to trap the organic vapors present. The charcoal in the tube is transferred to a small, stoppered sample container, and the analyte is desorbed with methanol. An aliquot of the desorbed sample is injected into a gas chromatograph. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 33 The area of the result ing peak is determined and compared with areas obtained for standards. (b) Range and sensitivity. This method was validated over the range of 17.5 -70.0 mg/cu m at an atmospheric temperature and pressure of 22\u00b0C and 760 mm Hg, using a twenty - liter sample. Unde r the conditions of sample size (20 liters) the probable useful range of this method is 4.5 -135 mg/cu m. The method is capable of measuring much smaller amounts if the desorption efficiency is adequate. Desorption efficiency must be determined over the r ange used. The upper limit of the range of the method is dependent on the adsorptive capacity of the charcoal tube. This capacity varies with the concentrations of acrylonitrile and other substances in the air. The first section of the charcoal tube was found to hold at least 3.97 mg of acrylonitrile when a test atmosphere containing 92.0 mg/cu m of acrylonitrile in air was sampled 0.18 liter per minute for 240 minutes; at that time the concentration of acrylonitrile in the effluent was less than 5 percen t of that in the influent. (The charcoal tube consists of two sections of activated charcoal separated by a section of urethane foam.) See (f)(ii) of this subsection. If a particular atmosphere is suspected of containing a large amount of contaminant, a smaller sampling volume should be taken. ) (c) Interference. When the amount of water in the air is so great that condensation actually occurs in the tube, organic vapors will not be trapped efficiently. Preliminary experiments using toluene indicate that hig h humidity severely decreases the breakthrough volume. When interfering compounds are known or suspected to be present in the air, such information, including their suspected identities, should be transmitted with the sample. It must be emphasized that any compound which has the same retention time as the analyte at the operating conditions described in this method is an interference. Retention time data on a single column cannot be considered proof of chemical identity. If the possibility of interference exists, separation conditions (column packing, temperature, etc.) must be changed to circumvent the problem. (d) Precision and accuracy. The coefficient of variation (CVt) for the total analytical and sampling method in the range of 17.5 -70.0 mg/cu m was 0.073 . This value corresponds to a 3.3 mg/cu m standard deviation at the (previous) OSHA standard level (20 ppm). Statistical information and details of the validation and experimental test procedures can be found in (k)(ii) of this subsection. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 34 On the avera ge the concentrations obtained at the 20 ppm level using the overall sampling and analytical method were 6.0 percent lower than the \"true\" concentrations for a limited number of laboratory experiments. Any difference between the \"found\" and \"true\" concent rations may not represent a bias in the sampling and analytical method, but rather a random variation from the experimentally determined \"true\" concentration. Therefore, no recovery correction should be applied to the final result in (j)(v) of this subsec tion. (e) Advantages and disadvantages of the method. The sampling device is small, portable, and involves no liquids. Interferences are minimal, and most of those which do occur can be eliminated by altering chromatographic conditions. The tubes are analyze d by means of a quick, instrumental method. The method can also be used for the simultaneous analysis of two or more substances suspected to be present in the same sample by simply changing gas chromatographic conditions. One disadvantage of the method is that the amount of sample which can be taken is limited by the number of milligrams that the tube will hold before overloading. When the sample value obtained for the backup section of the charcoal tube exceeds 25 percent of that found on the front sectio n, the possibility of sample loss exists. Furthermore, the precision of the method is limited by the reproducibility of the pressure drop across the tubes. This drop will affect the flow rate and cause the volume to be imprecise, because the pump is usual ly calibrated for one tube only. (f) Apparatus. A calibrated personal sampling pump whose flow can be determined within \u00b15 percent at the recommended flow rate. Reference (k)(iii) of this subsection. Charcoal tubes: Glass tubes with both ends flame sealed, 7 cm long with a 6 mm O.D. and a 4 mm I.D., containing 2 sections of 20/40 mesh activated charcoal separated by a 2 mm portion of urethane foam. The activated charcoal is prepared from coconut shells and is fired at 600\u00b0C prior to packing. The adsorbing s ection contains 100 mg of charcoal, the backup section 50 mg. A 3 mm portion of urethane foam is placed between the outlet end of the tube and the backup section. A plug of silicated glass wool is placed in front of the adsorbing section. The pressure d rop across the tube must be less than 1 inch of mercury at a flow rate of 1 liter per minute. Gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. Column (4 ft x 1/4 in stainless steel) packed with 50/80 mesh Poropak, type Q. An electronic integrat or or some other suitable method for measuring peak areas. Two-milliliter sample containers with glass stoppers or Teflon -lined caps. If an automatic sample injector is used, the associated vials may be used. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 35 Microliter syringes: Ten -microliter and oth er convenient sizes for making standards. Pipets: 1.0 ml delivery pipets. Volumetric flask: 10 ml or convenient sizes for making standard solutions. (g) Reagents. Chromatographic quality methanol. Acrylonitrile, reagent grade. Hexane, reagent grade. Purified nitrogen. Prepurified hydrogen. Filtered compressed air. (h) Procedure. Cleaning of equipment. All glassware used for the laboratory analysis should be detergent washed and thoroughly rinsed with tap water and distilled water. Calibration of personal pumps. Each personal pump must be calibrated with a representative charcoal tube in the line. This will minimize errors associated with uncertainties in the sample volume collected. Collection and shipping of samples. (A) Immediately before sampling, break the ends of the tube to provide an opening at least one -half the internal diameter of the tube (2mm). (B) The smaller section of charcoal is used as a backup and should be positioned nearest the sampling pump. (C) The charcoal tube should be placed in a vertical direction during sampling to minimize channeling through the charcoal. (D) Air being sampled should not be passed through any hose or tubing before entering the charcoal tube. (E) A maximum sample size of 20 liters is recommended. Sample at a flow of 0.20 liter per minute or less. The flow rate should be known with an accuracy of at least \u00b15 percent. (F) The temperature and pressure of the atmosphere being sampled should be recorded. If pressure reading is not available, record the elevation. (G) The charcoal tubes should be cap ped with the supplied plastic caps immediately after sampling. Under no circumstances should rubber caps be used. (H) With each batch of ten samples submit one tube from the same lot of tubes which was used for sample collection and which is subjected to exac tly the same handling as the samples except that no air is drawn through it. Label this as a blank. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 36 (I) Capped tubes should be packed tightly and padded before they are shipped to minimize tube breakage during shipping. (J) A sample of the bulk material should be submitted to the laboratory in a glass container with a Teflon -lined cap. This sample should not be transported in the same container as the charcoal tubes. Analysis of samples. (A) Preparation of samples. In preparation for analysis, each charcoal tube i s scored with a file in front of the first section of charcoal and broken open. The glass wool is removed and discarded. The charcoal in the first (larger) section is transferred to a 2 ml stoppered sample container. The separating section of foam is re moved and discarded; the second section is transferred to another stoppered container. These two sections are analyzed separately. (B) Desorption of samples. Prior to analysis, 1.0 ml of methanol is pipetted into each sample container. Desorption should be done for 30 minutes. Tests indicate that this is adequate if the sample is agitated occasionally during this period. If an automatic sample injector is used, the sample vials should be capped as soon as the solvent is added to minimize volatilization. (C) GC conditions. The typical operating conditions for the gas chromatograph are: (I) 50 ml/min (60 psig) nitrogen carrier gas flow. (II) 65 ml/min (24 psig) hydrogen gas flow to detector. (III) 500 ml/min (50 psig) air flow to detector. (IV) 235\u00b0C injector temperature. (V) 255\u00b0C man ifold temperature (detector). (VI) 155\u00b0C column temperature. (D) Injection. The first step in the analysis is the injection of the sample into the gas chromatograph. To eliminate difficulties arising from blowback or distillation within the syringe needle, one sh ould employ the solvent flush injection technique. The 10 -microliter syringe is first flushed with solvent several times to wet the barrel and plunger. Three microliters of solvent are drawn into the syringe to increase the accuracy and reproducibility of the injected sample volume. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 37 The needle is removed from the solvent, and the plunger is pulled back about 0.2 microliter to separate the solvent flush from the sample with a pocket of air to be used as a marker. The needle is then immersed in the sampl e, and a five microliter aliquot is withdrawn, taking into consideration the volume of the needle, since the sample in the needle will be completely injected. After the needle is removed from the sample and prior to injection, the plunger is pulled back 1 .2 microliters to minimize evaporation of the sample from the tip of the needle. Observe that the sample occupies 4.9 -5.0 microliters in the barrel of the syringe. Duplicate injections of each sample and standard should be made. No more than a 3 percent difference in area is to be expected. An automatic sample injector can be used if it is shown to give reproducibility at least as good as the solvent flush method. (E) Measurement of area. The area of the sample peak is measured by an electronic integrator or some other suitable form of area measurement, and preliminary results are read from a standard curve prepared as discussed below. Determination of desorption efficiency. (A) Importance of determination. The desorption efficiency of a particular compound ca n vary from one laboratory to another and also from one batch of charcoal to another. Thus, it is necessary to determine at least once the percentage of the specific compound that is removed in the desorption process, provided the same batch of charcoal i s used. (B) Procedure for determining desorption efficiency. (I) Activated charcoal equivalent to the amount in the first section of the sampling tube (100 mg) is measured into a 2.5 in., 4 mm I.D. glass tube, flame sealed at one end. This charcoal must be from t he same batch as that used in obtaining the samples and can be obtained from unused charcoal tubes. The open end is capped with Parafilm. A known amount of hexane solution of acrylonitrile containing 0.239 g/ml is injected directly into the activated cha rcoal with a microliter syringe, and tube is capped with more Parafilm. When using an automatic sample injector, the sample injector vials, capped with Teflon -faced septa, may be used in place of the glass tube. (II) The amount injected is equivalent to that p resent in a twenty -liter air sample at the selected level. (III) Six tubes at each of three levels (0.5X, 1X, and 2X of the standard) are prepared in this manner and allowed to stand for at least overnight to ensure complete adsorption of the analyte onto the charcoal. These tubes are referred to as the sample. A parallel blank tube should be treated in the same manner except that no sample is added to it. The sample and blank tubes are desorbed and analyzed in exactly the same manner as the sampling tube desc ribed in (h)(iv) of this subsection. Chapter 296 -62 WAC G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 38 (IV) Two or three standards are prepared by injecting the same volume of compound into 1.0 ml of methanol with the same syringe used in the preparation of the samples. These are analyzed with the samples. (V) The desorption e fficiency (D.E.) equals the average weight in mg recovered from the tube divided by the weight in mg added to the tube, or Average weight recovered (mg) D.E. = --------------------------------------- weight added (mg) (VI) The desorption efficiency is dependent on the amount of analyte collected on the charcoal. Plot the desorption efficiency versus weight of analyte found. This curve is used in (j)(iv) of this subsection to correct for adsorption losses. (i) Calibration and standards. It is convenient to express concentration of standards in terms of mg/1.0 ml methanol, because samples are desorbed in this amount of methanol. The density of the analyte is used to convert mg into microliters for easy measurement with a microliter syringe. A series of standards, varying in concentration over the range of interest, is prepared and analyzed under the same GC conditions and during the same time period as the unknown samples. Curves are established by plotting concentration in mg/1.0 ml versus peak area. Note : Since no internal standard is used in the method, standard solutions must be analyzed at the same time that the sample analysis is done. This will minimize the effect of known day -to-day variations and variations during the same day of the FID response. (j) Calcul ations. Read the weight, in mg, corresponding to each peak area from the standard curve. No volume corrections are needed, because the standard curve is based on mg/1.0 ml methanol and the volume of sample injected is identical to the volume of the standa rds injected. Corrections for the bank must be made for each sample. mg = mg sample -mg blank Where: mg sample = mg found in front section of sample tube. mg sample = mg found in front section of blank tube. Note : A similar procedure is followed for the bac kup sections. Add the weights found in the front and backup sections to get the total weight in the sample. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 39 Read the desorption efficiency from the curve (reference (h)(v)(B) of this subsection) for the amount found in the front section. Divide the tot al weight by this desorption efficiency to obtain the corrected mg/sample. Total weight Corrected mg/sample = -------------- D.E. The concentration of the analyte in the air sampled can be expressed in mg/cu m. 1,000 (liter/cu m) mg/cu m = Corrected mg (se e (j)(iv)) x ----------------------- ------------------- air volume sampled (liter) Another method of expressing concentration is ppm. ppm = mg/cu m x 24.45/M.W. x 760/P x T + 273/298 Where: P = Pressure (mm Hg) of air sampled. T = Temperature (\u00b0C) of air sampled. 24.45 = Molar volume (liter/mole) at 25\u00b0C and 760 mm Hg. M.W. = Molecular weight (g/mole) of analyte. 760 = Standard pressure (mm Hg). 298 = Standard temperature (\u00b0K). (k) References. White, L.

(7) NIOSH Modification of NIOSH Method S -156. The NIOSH recommended method for low levels for acrylonitrile is a modification of method S -156. It differs in the following respects: (a) Samples are desorbed using 1 ml of 1 percent aceto ne in CS2 rather than methanol. (b) The analytical column and conditions are: Column: 20 percent SP -1000 on 80/100 Supelcoport x 1/8 inch S.S. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens _____ Part (c) A 2 \u00b5l injection of the desorbed analyte is used. (d) A sampling rate of 100 ml/min is recommended. (8) OSHA Laboratory Modification of NIOSH Method S -156. (a) Analyte: Acrylonitrile. (b) Matrix: Procedure: Adsorption on charcoal, desorption with methanol, GC. (d) Principle of the method (subsection (1)(a) of this section). A known volume of air is drawn through a charcoal tube to trap the organic vapors present. The charcoal in the tube is transferre d to a small, stoppered sample vial, and the analyte is desorbed with methanol. An aliquot of the desorbed sample is injected into a gas chromatograph. The area of the resulting peak is determined and compared with areas obtained for standards. (e) Advantages and disadvantages of the method. The sampling device is small, portable, and involves no liquids. Interferences are minimal, and most of those which do occur can be eliminated by altering chromatographic conditions. The tubes are analyzed by means of a q uick, instrumental method. This method may not be adequate for the simultaneous analysis of two or more substances. The amount of sample which can be taken is limited by the number of milligrams that the tube will hold before overloading. When the sample value obtained for the backup section of the charcoal tube exceeds 25 percent of that found on the front section, the possibility of sample loss exists. The precision of the method is limited by the reproducibility of the pressure drop across the tubes. T his drop will affect the flow rate and cause the volume to be imprecise, because the pump is usually calibrated for one tube only.

Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 42 (C) The charcoal should be placed in a vertical position during sampling to minimize channeling through the charcoal. (D) Air being sampled should not be passed through any hose or tubing before entering the charcoal tube. (E) A sample size of 20 liters is recommended. Sample at a flow rate of approximately 0.2 liters per minute. The flow rate should be known with an accuracy of at least \u00b15 percent. (F) The temperature and pressure of the atmosphere being sampl ed should be recorded. (G) The charcoal tubes should be capped with the supplied plastic caps immediately after sampling. Rubber caps should not be used. (H) Submit at least one blank tube (a charcoal tube subjected to the same handling procedures, without having any air drawn through it) with each set of samples. (I) Take necessary shipping and packing precautions to minimize breakage of samples. Analysis of samples. (A) Preparation of samples. In preparation for analysis, each charcoal tube is scored with a file in fro nt of the first section of charcoal and broken open. The glass wool is removed and discarded. The charcoal in the first (larger) section is transferred to a 2 ml vial. The separating section of foam is removed and discarded; the section is transferred t o another capped vial. These two sections are analyzed separately. (B) Desorption of samples. Prior to analysis, 1.0 ml of methanol is pipetted into each sample container. Desorption should be done for 30 minutes in an ultrasonic bath. The sample vials are recapped as soon as the solvent is added. (C) GC conditions. The typical operating conditions for the gas chromatograph are: (I) 30 ml/min (60 psig) helium carrier gas flow. (II) 3.0 ml/min (30 psig) hydrogen gas flow to detector. (III) 50 ml/min (60 psig) air flow to dete ctor. temperature. (V) 200\u00b0C dejector temperature. (VI) 100\u00b0C column temperature. (D) Injection. Solvent flush technique or equivalent. (E) Measurement of area. The area of the sample peak is measured by an electronic integator or some other suitable form of area measurement, and preliminary results are read from a standard curve prepared as discussed below. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 43 Determination of desorption efficiency. (A) Importance of determination. The desorption efficiency of a particular compound can vary from one laboratory to another and also from one batch of charcoal to another. Thus, it is necessary to determine, at least once, the percentage of the specific compound that is removed in the desorption process, provided the same batch of charcoal is used. (B) Procedure for de termining desorption efficiency. The reference portion of the charcoal tube is removed. To the remaining portion, amounts representing 0.5X, 1X, and 2X (X represents TLV) based on a 20 l air sample are injected onto several tubes at each level. Dilution s of acrylonitrile with methanol are made to allow injection of measurable quantities. These tubes are then allowed to equilibrate at least overnight. Following equilibration they are analyzed following the same procedure as the samples. A curve of the desorption efficiency (amt recovered/amt added) is plotted versus amount of analyte found. This curve is used to correct for adsorption losses. (i) Calibration and standards. A series of standards, varying in concentration over the range of interest, is prep ared and analyzed under the same GC conditions and during the same time period as the unknown samples. Curves are prepared by plotting concentration versus peak area. Note : Since no internal standard is used in the method, standard solutions must be analy zed at the same time that the sample analysis is done. This will minimize the effect of known day -to-day variations and variations during the same day of the NPD response. Multiple injections are necessary. (j) Calculations. Read the weight, corresponding to each peak area from the standard curve, correct for the blank, correct for the desorption efficiency, and make necessary air volume corrections. (k) Reference.

Chapter 296 -62 WAC Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 58 (2) Fire explosion and reactivity hazard data . (a) Fire. Flash point: 170F (77C) Autoignition temperature: Data not available. Flammable limits in air, percent by volume: Data not available. Extinguishing media: Carbon dioxide, dry chemical. Special fire -fighting procedures: Do not use a solid stream of water since a stream will scatter and spread the fire. Use water spray to cool containers exposed to a fire. Unusual fire and explosion hazards: None known. For purposes of complying with t he requirements of WAC 296-24-330, liquid DBCP is classified as a Class III A combustible liquid. For the purpose of complying with chapter 296-24 WAC Part L, the classification of hazardous locations as described in article 500 of the National Electrical Code for DBCP shall be Class I, Group D. For the purpose of compliance with WAC 296-24-592, DBCP is classified as a Class B fire hazard. For the purpose of compliance with WAC 296-24-230, locations classified as hazardous locations due to the presence of DBCP shall be Class I, Group D. Sources of ignition are prohibited where DBCP presents a fire or explosion hazard. (b) Reactivity. Conditions con tributing to instability: None known. Incompatibilities: Reacts with chemically active metals, such as aluminum, magnesium and tin alloys. Hazardous decomposition products: Toxic gases and vapors (such as HBr, HC1 and carbon monoxide) may be released in a fire involving DBCP. Special precautions: DBCP will attack some rubber materials and coatings. (3) Spill, leak and disposal procedures . (a) If DBCP is spilled or leaked, the following steps should be taken: The area should be evacuated at once and re -entered o nly after thorough ventilation. Ventilate area of spill or leak. If in liquid form, collect for reclamation or absorb in paper, vermiculite, dry sand, earth or similar material. If in solid form, collect spilled material in the most convenient and safe man ner for reclamation or for disposal. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 59 (b) Persons not wearing protective equipment must be restricted from areas of spills or leaks until cleanup has been completed. (c) Waste disposal methods: For small quantities of liquid DBCP, absorb on paper towels, remove t o a safe place (such as a fume hood) and burn the paper. Large quantities can be reclaimed or collected and atomized in a suitable combustion chamber equipped with an appropriate effluent gas cleaning device. If liquid DBCP is absorbed in vermiculite, dr y sand, earth or similar material and placed in sealed containers it may be disposed of in a state -approved sanitary landfill. If in solid form, for small quantities, place on paper towels, remove to a safe place (such as a fume hood) and burn. Large quan tities may be reclaimed. However, if this is not practical, dissolve in a flammable solvent (such as alcohol) and atomize in a suitable combustion chamber equipped with an appropriate effluent gas cleaning device. DBCP in solid form may also be disposed in a state -approved sanitary landfill. (4) Monitoring and measurement procedures . (a) Exposure above the permissible exposure limit. Eight hour exposure evaluation: Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure under this section are best ta ken so that the average eight -hour exposure may be determined from a single eight -hour sample or two four -hour samples. Air samples should be taken in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent that inhaled by the employee). Monit oring techniques: The sampling and analysis under this section may be performed by collecting the DBCP vapor on petroleum based charcoal absorption tubes with subsequent chemical analyses. The method of measurement chosen should determine the concentrati on of airborne DBCP at the permissible exposure limit to an accuracy of plus or minus twenty -five percent. If charcoal tubes are used, a total volume of ten liters should be collected at a flow rate of 50 cc per minute for each tube. Analyze the resultan t samples as you would samples of halogenated solvent. (b) Since many of the duties relating to employee protection are dependent on the results of monitoring and measuring procedures, employers should assure that the evaluation of employee exposures is perfor med by a competent industrial hygienist or other technically qualified person. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 60 (5) Protective clothing . Employees should be required to wear appropriate protective clothing to prevent any possibility of skin contact with DBCP. Because DBCP is absorbed thro ugh the skin, it is important to prevent skin contact with both liquid and solid forms of DBCP. Protective clothing should include impermeable coveralls or similar full body work clothing, gloves, headcoverings, and workshoes or shoe coverings. Standard rubber and neoprene gloves do not offer adequate protection and should not be relied upon to keep DBCP off the skin. DBCP should never be allowed to remain on the skin. Clothing and shoes should not be allowed to become contaminated with the material; an d if they do, they should be promptly removed and not worn again until completely free of the material. Any protective clothing which has developed leaks or is otherwise found to be defective should be repaired or replaced. Employees should also be requi red to wear splashproof safety goggles where there is any possibility of DBCP contacting the eyes. (6) Housekeeping and hygiene facilities . (a) The workplace must be kept clean, orderly and in a sanitary condition. (b) Dry sweeping and the use of compressed air is uns afe for the cleaning of floors and other surfaces where DBCP dust or liquids are found. To minimize the contamination of air with dust, vacuuming with either portable or permanent systems must be used. If a portable unit is selected, the exhaust must be attached to the general workplace exhaust ventilation system, or collected within the vacuum unit equipped with high efficiency filters or other appropriate means of contamination removal and not used for other purposes. Units used to collect DBCP must be labeled. (c) Adequate washing facilities with hot and cold water must be provided, and maintained in a sanitary condition. Suitable cleansing agents should also be provided to assure the effective removal of DBCP from the skin. (d) Change or dressing rooms with individual clothes storage facilities must be provided to prevent the contamination of street clothes with DBCP. Because of the hazardous nature of DBCP, contaminated protective clothing must be stored in closed containers for cleaning or disposal. (7) Miscel laneous precautions . (a) Store DBCP in tightly closed containers in a cool, well -ventilated area. (b) Use of supplied -air suits or other impervious clothing (such as acid suits) may be necessary to prevent skin contact with DBCP. Supplied -air suits should be sele cted, used, and maintained under the supervision of persons knowledgeable in the limitations and potential life -endangering characteristics of supplied -air suits. (c) The use of air -conditioned suits may be necessary in warmer climates. (d) Advise employees of all areas and operations where exposure to DBCP could occur. (8) Common operations . Common operations in which exposure to DBCP is likely to occur are: During its production; and during its formulation into pesticides and fumigants. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens Part G, Page Appendix surveillance guidelines for DBCP. (1) Route of entry . (a) Inhalation; (b) Skin absorption. (2) Toxicology . Recent data collected on workers involved in the manufacture and formulation of DBCP has shown that DBCP can cause sterility at very low levels of expos ure. This finding is supported by studies showing that DBCP causes sterility in animals. Chronic exposure to DBCP resulted in pronounced necrotic action on the parenchymatous organs (i.e., liver, kidney, spleen) and on the testicles of rats at concentrat ions as low as 5 ppm. Rats that were chronically exposed to DBCP also showed changes in the composition of the blood, showing low RBC, hemoglobin, and WBC, and high reticulocyte levels as well as functional hepatic disturbance, manifesting itself in a long prothrombin time. Reznik et al., noted a single dose of 100 mg produced profound depression of the nervous system of rats. Their condition gradually improved. Acute exposure also resulted in the destruction of the sex gland activity of male rats as wel l as causing changes in the estrous cycle in female rats. Animal studies have also associated DBCP with an increased incidence of carcinoma. Olson, et al., orally administered DBCP to rats and mice five times per week at experimentally predetermined maxi mally tolerated doses and at half those doses. As early as ten weeks after initiation of treatment, DBCP induced a high incidence of squamous cell carcinomas of the stomach with metastases in both species. DBCP also induced mammary adenocarcinomas in the female rats at both dose levels. (3) Signs and symptoms . (a) Inhalation: Nausea, eye irritation, conjunctivitis, respiratory irritation, pulmonary congestion or edema, CNS depression with apathy, sluggishness, and ataxia. (b) Dermal: Erythema or inflammation and de rmatitis on repeated exposure. (4) Special tests . (a) Semen analysis: The following information excerpted from the document \"Evaluation of Testicular Function,\" submitted by the Corporate Medical Department of the Shell Oil Company (exhibit 39 -3), may be useful t o physicians conducting the medical surveillance program. In performing semen analyses certain minimal but specific criteria should be met: It is recommended that a minimum of three valid semen analyses be obtained in order to make a determination of an i ndividual's average sperm count. A period of sexual abstinence is necessary prior to the collection of each masturbatory sample. It is recommended that intercourse or masturbation be performed 48 hours before the actual specimen collection. A period of 4 8 hours of abstinence would follow; then the masturbatory sample would be collected. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 62 Each semen specimen should be collected in a clean, wide mouthed, glass jar (not necessarily pre -sterilized) in a manner designated by the examining physician. Any part of the seminal fluid exam should be initialed only after liquifaction is complete, i.e., 30 to 45 minutes after collection. Semen volume should be measured to the nearest 1/10 of a cubic centimeter. Sperm density should be determined using routine techniq ues involving the use of a white cell pipette and a hemocytometer chamber. The immobilizing fluid most effective and most easily obtained for this process is distilled water. Thin, dry smears of the semen should be made for a morphologic classification of the sperm forms and should be stained with either hematoxalin or the more difficult, yet more precise, Papanicolaou technique. Also of importance to record is obvious sperm agglutination, pyospermia, delayed liquifaction (greater than 30 minutes), and hy perviscosity. In addition, pH, using nitrazine paper, should be determined. A total morphology evaluation should include percentages of the following: (A) Normal (oval) forms, (B) Tapered forms, (C) Amorphous forms (include large and small sperm shapes), (D) Duplicated ( either heads or tails) forms, and (E) Immature forms. Each sample should be evaluated for sperm viability (percent viable sperm moving at the time of examination) as well as sperm motility (subjective characterization of \"purposeful forward sperm progression\" of the majority of those viable sperm analyzed) within two hours after collection, ideally by the same or equally qualified examiner. (b) Serum determinations: The following serum determinations should be performed by radiommuno -assay techniques using Nationa l Institutes of Health (NIH) specific antigen or antigen preparations of equivalent sensitivity: Serum follicle stimulating total estrogen (females only). (5) Treatment . Remove from exposure immediately , give oxygen or artificial resuscitation if indicated. Contaminated clothing and shoes should be removed immediately. Flush eyes and wash contaminated skin. If swallowed and the person is conscious, induce vomiting. Recovery from mild exposures is usu ally rapid and complete. (6) Surveillance and preventive considerations . (a) Other considerations. DBCP can cause both acute and chronic effects. It is important that the physician become familiar with the operating conditions in which exposure to DBCP occurs. Those with respiratory disorders may not tolerate the wearing of negative pressure respirators. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 63 (b) Surveillance and screening. Medical histories and laboratory examinations are required for each employee subject to exposure to DBCP. The employer should screen employees for history of certain medical conditions (listed below) which might place the employee at increased risk from exposure: Liver disease. The primary site of biotransformation and detoxification of DBCP is the liver. Liver dysfunctions likel y to inhibit the conjugation reactions will tend to promote the toxic actions of DBCP. These precautions should be considered before exposing persons with impaired liver function to DBCP. Renal disease. Because DBCP has been associated with injury to the kidney it is important that special consideration be given to those with possible impairment of renal function. Skin disease. DBCP can penetrate the skin and can cause erythema on prolonged exposure. Persons with pre -existing skin disorders may be more susceptible to the effects of DBCP. Blood dyscrasias. DBCP has been shown to decrease the content of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and leukocytes in the blood, as well as increase the prothrombin time. Persons with existing blood disorders may be more suscep tible to the effects of DBCP. Reproductive disorders. Animal studies have associated DBCP with various effects on the reproductive organs. Among these effects are atrophy of the testicles and changes in the estrous cycle. Persons with pre -existing repro ductive disorders may be at increased risk to these effects of DBCP.

(a) Determinations of employee exposure must be made from breathing zone air samples that are representative of the eight -hour TWA and fifteen -minute short -term exposures of each employee. (b) Representative eight -hour TWA e mployee exposure must be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing full -shift exposure for each shift for each job classification in each work area. Representative fifteen -minute short -term employee exposures must be determined on the ba sis of one or more samples representing fifteen -minute exposures associated with operations that are most likely to produce exposures above the excursion limit for each shift for each job classification in each work area. (c) Where the employer can document th at exposure levels are equivalent for similar operations in different work shifts, the employer need only determine representative employee exposure for that operation during one shift. (2) Initial monitoring . (a) Each employer who has a workplace or work operatio n covered by WAC 296 -62- 296 -62-07355(2) or (b) of this subsection, must perform initial monitoring to determine accurately the airborne concentrations of EtO to which employees may be exposed. (b) Where the employer has monitored after June 15, 1983, and the monitoring satisfies all other requirements of WAC 296 -62-07355 through 296 -62-07389, the employer may rely on such earlier monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of (a) of this subsection.

(d) If the monitoring required by sub section (2)(a) of this section reveals employee exposure above the fifteen -minute excursion limit, the employer shall repeat such monitoring for each such employee at least every three months, and more often as necessary to evaluate the employee's short -term exposures. (4) Termination of monitoring . (a) If the initial monitoring required by subsection (2)(a) of this section reveals employee exposure to be below the action level, the employer may discontinue TWA monitoring for those employees whose exposures are rep resented by the initial monitoring. (b) If the periodic monitoring required by subsection (3) of this section reveals that employee exposures, as indicated by at least two consecutive measurements taken at least seven days apart, are below the action level, th e employer may discontinue TWA monitoring for those employees whose exposures are represented by such monitoring. (c) If the initial monitoring required by subsection (2)(a) of this section reveals the employee exposure to be at or below the excursion limit, t he employer may discontinue excursion limit monitoring for those employees whose exposures are represented by the initial monitoring. (d) If the periodic monitoring required by subsection (3) of this section reveals that employee exposures, as indicated by at least two consecutive measurements taken at least seven days apart, are at or below the excursion limit, the employer may discontinue excursion limit monitoring for those employees whose exposures are represented by such monitoring. (5) Additional monitoring . Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (4) of this section, the employer must institute the exposure monitoring required under subsections (2)(a) and (3) of this section whenever there has been a change in the production, process, control equipment, personnel or work -practices that may result in new or additional exposures to EtO or when the employer has any reason to suspect that a change may result in new or additional exposures. (6) Accuracy of monitoring . (a) Monitoring must be accurate, to a confidence level of ninety -five percent, to within plus or minus twenty -five percent for airborne concentrations of EtO at the 1 ppm TWA and to within plus or minus thirty -five percent for airborne concentrations of EtO at the action level of 0.5 ppm.

The infor mation contained in the appendices is not intended by itself to create any additional obligations not otherwise imposed or to detract from any existing obligation. WAC 296 -62-07383 Appendix A --Substance safety data sheet for ethylene oxide (nonmandatory). (1) Substance identification . (a) Substance: Ethylene Ethylene oxide can be found as a liqui d or vapor. (d) EtO is used in the manufacture of ethylene glycol, surfactants, ethanolamines, glycol ethers, and other organic chemicals. EtO is also used as a sterilant and fumigant. (e) Appearance and odor: Colorless (51.3\u00b0F) or colorless gas with ether -like odor detected at approximately 700 parts EtO per million parts of air (700 ppm). (f) Permissible exposure: Exposure may not exceed 1 part EtO per million parts of air averaged over the 8 -hour work day. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 76 (2) Health hazard data . (a) Ethylene oxide can cause bodily harm if you inhale the vapor, if it comes into contact with your eyes or skin, or if you swallow it. (b) Effects of overexposure: Ethylene oxide in liquid form can cause eye irritation and injury to the cornea, frostbite, and severe irritation and blistering of the skin upon prolonged or confined contact. Ingestion of EtO can cause gastric irritation and liver injury. Acute effects from inhalation of EtO vapors include respiratory irritation and lung injury, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrh ea, shortness of breath, and cyanosis (blue or purple coloring of skin). Exposure has also been associated with the occurrence of cancer, reproductive effects, mutagenic changes, neurotoxicity, and sensitization. EtO has been shown to cause cancer in labo ratory animals and has been associated with higher incidences of cancer in humans. Adverse reproductive effects and chromosome damage may also occur from EtO exposure. (c) Reporting signs and symptoms: You should inform your employer if you develop any signs or symptoms and suspect that they are caused by exposure to EtO. (3) Emergency first aid procedures . (a) Eye exposure: If EtO gets into your eyes, wash your eyes immediately with large amounts of water, lifting the lower and upper eyelids. Get medical attention immediately. Contact lenses should not be worn when working with this chemical. (b) Skin exposure: If EtO gets on your skin, immediately wash the contaminated skin with water. If EtO soaks through your clothing, especially your shoes, remove the clothing i mmediately and wash the skin with water using an emergency deluge shower. Get medical attention immediately. Thoroughly wash contaminated clothing before reusing. Contaminated leather shoes or other leather articles should not be reused and should be di scarded. (c) Inhalation: If large amounts of EtO are inhaled, the exposed person must be moved to fresh air at once. If breathing has stopped, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Keep the affected person warm and at rest. Get medical attention immediate ly. (d) Swallowing: When EtO has been swallowed, give the person large quantities of water immediately. After the water has been swallowed, try to get the person to vomit by having him or her touch the back of the throat with their finger. Do not make an un conscious person vomit. Get medical attention immediately. (e) Rescue: Move the affected person from the hazardous exposure. If the exposed person has been overcome, attempt rescue only after notifying at least one other person of the emergency and putting into effect established emergency procedures. Do not become a casualty yourself. Understand your emergency rescue procedures and know the location of the emergency equipment before the need arises. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 77 (4) Respirators and protective clothing . (a) Respirators: You may be required to wear a respirator for nonroutine activities, in emergencies, while your employer is in the process of reducing EtO exposure through engineering controls, and in areas where engineering controls are not feasible. Only air supplied positiv e-pressure, full -facepiece respirators are approved for protection against EtO. If air -purifying respirators are worn in the future, they must have a label issued by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) under the provisions of 42 CFR part 84 stating that the respirators have been certified for use with ethylene oxide. For effective protection, respirators must fit your face and head snugly. Respirators must not be loosened or removed in work situations where their use is requ ired. EtO does not have a detectable odor except at levels well above the permissible exposure limits. If you can smell EtO while wearing a respirator, proceed immediately to fresh air. If you experience difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, t ell your employer. (b) Protective clothing: You may be required to wear impermeable clothing, gloves, a face shield, or other appropriate protective clothing to prevent skin contact with liquid EtO or EtO-containing solutions. Where protective clothing is req uired, your employer must provide clean garments to you as necessary to assure that the clothing protects you adequately. Replace or repair protective clothing that has become torn or otherwise damaged. EtO must never be allowed to remain on the skin. Clo thing and shoes which are not impermeable to EtO should not be allowed to become contaminated with EtO, and if they do, the clothing should be promptly removed and decontaminated. Contaminated leather shoes should be discarded. Once EtO penetrates shoes or other leather articles, they should not be worn again. (c) Eye protection: You must wear splashproof safety goggles in areas where liquid EtO or EtO -containing solutions may contact your eyes. In addition, contact lenses should not be worn in areas where eye contact with EtO can occur. (5) Precautions for safe use, handling, and storage . (a) EtO is a flammable liquid, and its vapors can easily form explosive mixtures in air. (b) EtO must be stored in tightly closed containers in a cool, well -ventilated area, away from heat, sparks, flames, strong oxidizers, alkalines, and acids, strong bases, acetylide forming metals such as copper, silver, mercury and their alloys. (c) Sources of ignition such as smoking material, open flames and some electrical devices are prohibited whe rever EtO is handled, used, or stored in a manner that could create a potential fire or explosion hazard. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 78 (d) You should use nonsparking tools when opening or closing metal containers of EtO, and containers must be bonded and grounded in the rare instances i n which liquid EtO is poured or transferred. (e) Impermeable clothing wet with liquid EtO or EtO -containing solutions may be easily ignited. If you are wearing impermeable clothing and are splashed with liquid EtO or EtO-containing solution, you should immedi ately remove the clothing while under an emergency deluge shower. (f) If your skin comes into contact with liquid EtO or EtO -containing solutions, you should immediately remove the EtO using an emergency deluge shower. (g) You should not keep food, beverages, or s moking materials in regulated areas where employee exposures are above the permissible exposure limits. (h) Fire extinguishers and emergency deluge showers for quick drenching should be readily available, and you should know where they are and how to operate t hem. (i) Ask your supervisor where EtO is used in your work area and for any additional plant safety and health rules. (6) Access to information . (a) Each year, your employer is required to inform you of the information contained in this standard and appendices for Et O. In addition, your employer must instruct you in the proper work -practices for using EtO emergency procedures, and the correct use of protective equipment. (b) Your employer is required to determine whether you are being exposed to EtO. You or your represe ntative has the right to observe employee measurements and to record the results obtained. Your employer is required to inform you of your exposure. If your employer determines that you are being overexposed, he or she is required to inform you of the ac tions which are being taken to reduce your exposure to within permissible exposure limits. (c) Your employer is required to keep records of your exposures and medical examinations. These exposure records must be kept by the employer for at least thirty years. Medical records must be kept for the period of your employment plus thirty years. (d) Your employer is required to release your exposure and medical records to your physician or designated representative upon your written request. (7) Sterilant use of EtO in hos pitals and health care facilities . (a) This section of Appendix A, for informational purposes, sets forth EPA's recommendations for modifications in workplace design and practice in hospitals and health care facilities for which the Environmental Protection Ag ency has registered EtO for uses as a sterilant or fumigant under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 79 Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq. These new recommendations, published in the Federal Register by EPA at 49 FR 15268, as modified in today's R egister, are intended to help reduce the exposure of hospital and health care workers to EtO to 1 ppm. EPA's recommended workplace design and workplace practice are as follows: Workplace design . (A) Installation of gas line hand valves. Hand valves must be i nstalled on the gas supply line at the connection to the supply cylinders to minimize leakage during cylinder change. Installation of capture boxes. Sterilizer operations result in a gas/water discharge at the completion of the process. This discharge is routinely piped to a floor drain which is generally located in an equipment or an adjacent room. When the floor drain is not in the same room as the sterilizer and workers are not normally present, all that is necessary is that the room be well ventilate d. The installation of a \"capture box\" will be required for those work place layouts where the floor drain is located in the same room as the sterilizer or in a room where workers are normally present. A \"capture box\" is a piece of equipment that totally encloses the floor drain where the discharge from the sterilizer is pumped. The \"capture box\" is to be vented directly to a nonrecirculating or dedicated ventilation system. Sufficient air intake should be allowed at the bottom of the box to handle the volume of air that is ventilated from the top of the box. The \"capture box\" can be made of metal, plastic, wood or other equivalent material. The box is intended to reduce levels of EtO discharged into the work room atmosphere. The use of a \"capture box \" is not required if: (I) The vacuum pump discharge floor drain is located in a well-ventilated equipment or other room where workers are not normally present or (II) the water sealed vacuum pump discharges directly to a closed sealed sewer line (check lo cal plumbing codes). (B) If it is impractical to install a vented \"capture box\" and a well -ventilated equipment or other room is not feasible, a box that can be sealed over the floor drain may be used if: (I) The floor drain is located in a room where workers are not normally present and EtO cannot leak into an occupied area, and (II) the sterilizer in use is less than 12 cubic feet in capacity (check local plumbing codes). Ventilation of aeration units. (A) Existing aeration units. Existing units must be vented to a nonrecirculating or dedicated system or vented to an equipment or other room where workers are not normally present and which is well ventilated. Aerator units must be positioned as close as possible to the sterilizer to minimize the exposure from th e off-gassing of sterilized items. (B) Installation of new aerator units (where none exist). New aerator units must be vented as described above for existing aerators. Aerators must be in place by July 1, 1986. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 80 Ventilation during cylinder change. Workers may be exposed to short but relatively high levels of EtO during the change of gas cylinders. To reduce exposure from this route, users must select one of three alternatives designed to draw off gas that may be released when the line from the sterilizer t o the cylinder is disconnected: (A) Location of cylinders in a well -ventilated equipment room or other room where workers are not normally present. (B) Installation of a flexible hose (at least four inches in diameter) to a nonrecirculating or dedicated ventilatio n system and located in the area of cylinder change in such a way that the hose can be positioned at the point where the sterilizer gas line is disconnected from the cylinder. (C) Installation of a hood that is part of a nonrecirculating or dedicated system and positioned no more than one foot above the point where the change of cylinders takes place. Ventilation of sterilizer door area. One of the major sources of exposure to EtO occurs when the sterilizer door is opened following the completion of the steril ization process. In order to reduce this avenue of exposure, a hood or metal canopy closed on each end must be installed over the sterilizer door. The hood or metal canopy must be connected to a nonrecirculating or dedicated ventilation system or one tha t exhausts gases to a well -ventilated equipment or other room where workers are not normally present. A hood or canopy over the sterilizer door is required for use even with those sterilizers that have a purge cycle and must be in place by July 1, 1986. Ventilation of sterilizer relief valve. Sterilizers are typically equipped with a safety relief device to release gas in case of increased pressure in the sterilizer. Generally, such relief devices are used on pressure vessels. Although these pressure re lief devices are rarely opened for hospital and health care sterilizers, it is suggested that they be designed to exhaust vapor from the sterilizer by one of the following methods: (A) Through a pipe connected to the outlet of the relief valve ventilated direc tly outdoors at a point high enough to be away from passersby, and not near any windows that open, or near any air conditioning or ventilation air intakes. (B) Through a connection to an existing or new nonrecirculating or dedicated ventilation system. (C) Through a connection to a well -ventilated equipment or other room where workers are not normally present. Ventilation systems. Each hospital and health care facility affected by this notice that uses EtO for the sterilization of equipment and supplies must have a ventilation system which enables compliance with the requirements of (a)(i)(B) through (v) of this subsection in the manner described in these sections and within the timeframes allowed. Thus, each affected hospital and health care facility must have or install a nonrecirculating or dedicated ventilation equipment or other room where workers are not normally present in which to vent EtO. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 81 Installation of alarm systems. An audible and visual indicator alarm system must be installed to alert personnel of v entilation system failures, i.e., when the ventilation fan motor is not working. (b) Workplace practices All the workplace practices discussed in this unit must be permanently posted near the door of each sterilizer prior to use by any operator. Changing of su pply line filters. Filters in the sterilizer liquid line must be changed when necessary, by the following procedure: (A) Close the cylinder valve and the hose valve. (B) Disconnect the cylinder hose (piping) from the cylinder. (C) Open the hose valve and bleed slowly into a proper ventilating system at or near the in -use supply cylinders. (D) Vacate the area until the line is empty. (E) Change the filter. (F) Reconnect the lines and reverse the valve position. (G) Check hoses, filters, and valves for leaks with a fluorocarbon leak det ector (for those sterilizers using the eighty -eight percent chlorofluorocarbon, twelve percent ethylene oxide mixture (12/88)). Restricted access area. (A) Areas involving use of EtO must be designated as restricted access areas. They must be identified with signs or floor marks near the sterilizer door, aerator, vacuum pump floor drain discharge, and in -use cylinder storage. (B) All personnel must be excluded from the restricted area when certain operations are in progress, such as discharging a vacuum pump, empt ying a sterilizer liquid line, or venting a nonpurge sterilizer with the door ajar or other operations where EtO might be released directly into the face of workers. Door opening procedures. (A) Sterilizers with purge cycles. A load treated in a sterilizer eq uipped with a purge cycle should be removed immediately upon completion of the cycle (provided no time is lost opening the door after cycle is completed). If this is not done, the purge cycle should be repeated before opening door. (B) Sterilizers without pur ge cycles. For a load treated in a sterilizer not equipped with a purge cycle, the sterilizer door must be ajar six inches for fifteen minutes, and then fully opened for at least another fifteen minutes before removing the treated load. The length of tim e of the second period should be established by peak monitoring for one hour after the two fifteen -minute periods suggested. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 82 (C) If the level is above 10 ppm time -weighted average for eight hours, more time should be added to the second waiting period (door wide open). However, in no case may the second period be shortened to less than fifteen minutes. Chamber unloading procedures. (A) Procedures for unloading the chamber must include the use of baskets or rolling carts, or baskets and rolling tables to transfer treated loads quickly, thus avoiding excessive contact with treated articles, and reducing the duration of exposures. (B) If rolling carts are used, they should be pulled not pushed by the sterilizer operators to avoid offgassing exposure. Maintenance. A wri tten log should be instituted and maintained documenting the date of each leak detection and any maintenance procedures undertaken. This is a suggested use practice and is not required. Leak detection. Sterilizer door gaskets, cylinder and vacuum piping, hoses, filters, and valves must be checked for leaks under full pressure with a Fluorocarbon leak detector (for 12/88 systems only) every two weeks by maintenance personnel. Also, the cylinder piping connections must be checked after changing cylinders. Particular attention in leak detection should be given to the automatic solenoid valves that control the flow of EtO to the sterilizer. Specifically, a check should be made at the EtO gasline entrance port to the sterilizer, while the sterilizer door is open and the solenoid valves are in a closed position. Maintenance procedures. Sterilizer/aerator door gaskets, valves, and fittings must be replaced when necessary as determined by maintenance personnel in their biweekly checks; in addition, visual inspe ction of the door gaskets for cracks, debris, and other foreign substances should be conducted daily by the operator. WAC 296 -62-07385 Appendix B --Substance technical guidelines for ethylene oxide (nonmandatory). (1) Physical and chemical data : (a) Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 83 (b) Physical data: Boiling point (760 mm Hg): 10.70C (51.3\u00b0F); Specific gravity (water = 1): 0.87 or 68\u00b0F); Vapor density (air or 51.3\u00b0C with ether -like odor above 700 ppm. (2) Fire, explosion, and reactivity hazard data : (a) Fire: Flash point; Less than 0\u00b0F (open cup); Stability: Decomposes violently at temperatures above 800\u00b0F; Flammable limits percent by volume: Lower: 3, Upper: 100; Extinguishing media: Carbon dioxide for small fires, polymer or alcohol foams for large fires; Special firefighting procedures: Dilution of ethylene oxide with 23 volumes of water renders it nonflammable; Unusual fire and explosion hazards: Vapors of EtO will burn without the presence of air or other oxidizers. EtO vapors are heavier than air and may travel along the ground and be ignited by open flames or sparks at locations remote from the site at which EtO is being used. For purposes of complian ce with the requirements of WAC 296-24-330, EtO is classified as a flammable gas. For example, 7,500 ppm, approximately one - fourth of the lower flammable limit, w ould be considered to pose a potential fire and explosion hazard. For purposes of compliance with WAC 296-24-585, EtO is classified as a Class B fire hazard. For p urpose of compliance with chapter 296-24 WAC Part L, and WAC 296- 800-280, locations classified as hazardous due to the presence of EtO shall be Class I. (b) Reactivity: Conditions contributing to instability: EtO will polymerize violently if contaminated with aqueous alkalies, amines, mineral acids, metal chlorides, or metal o xides. Violent decomposition will also occur at temperatures above 800\u00b0F; Incompatibilities: Alkalines and acids; Hazardous decomposition products: Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 84 (3) Spill, leak, and disposal procedures : (a) If EtO is spilled or leaked, the following steps should be taken: Remove all ignition sources. The area should be evacuated at once and re -entered only after the area has been thoroughly ventilated and washed down with water. (b) Persons not wearing appropriate protective equipment should be restricted from areas of spills or leaks until cleanup has been completed. (c) Waste disposal method: Waste material should be disposed of in a manner that is not hazardous to employees or to the general population. In selecting the method of waste dispo sal, applicable local, state, and federal regulations should be consulted. (4) Monitoring and measurement procedures : (a) Exposure above the permissible exposure limit: Eight -hour exposure evaluation: Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exp osure under this section are best taken with consecutive samples covering the full shift. Air samples should be taken in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent that inhaled by the employee.) Monitoring techniques: The samplin g and analysis under this section may be performed by collection of the EtO vapor on charcoal adsorption tubes or other composition adsorption tubes, with subsequent chemical analysis. Sampling and analysis may also be performed by instruments such as rea l time continuous monitoring systems, portable direct reading instruments, or passive dosimeters as long as measurements taken using these methods accurately evaluate the concentration of EtO in employees' breathing zones. Appendix D describes the validate d method of sampling and analysis which has been tested by OSHA for use with EtO. Other available methods are also described in Appendix D. The employer has the obligation of selecting a monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requiremen ts of the standard under their unique field conditions. The standard requires that the method of monitoring should be accurate, to a 95 percent confidence level, to plus or minus 25 percent for concentrations of EtO at 1 ppm, and to plus or minus 35 perce nt for concentrations at 0.5 ppm. In addition to the method described in Appendix D, there are numerous other methods available for monitoring for EtO in the workplace. Details on these other methods have been submitted by various companies to the rulema king record, and are available at the OSHA Docket Office. (b) Since many of the duties relating to employee exposure are dependent on the results of measurement procedures, employers should assure that the evaluation of employee exposures is performed by a tec hnically qualified person. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 85 (5) Protective clothing and equipment : (a) Employees should be provided with and be required to wear appropriate protective clothing wherever there is significant potential for skin contact with liquid EtO or EtO-containing solutions. Protective clothing shall include impermeable coveralls or similar full -body work clothing, gloves, and head coverings, as appropriate to protect areas of the body which may come in contact with liquid EtO or EtO -containing solutions. (b) Employers should asc ertain that the protective garments are impermeable to EtO. Permeable clothing, including items made of rubber, and leather shoes should not be allowed to become contaminated with liquid EtO. If permeable clothing does become contaminated, it should be i mmediately removed, while the employer is under an emergency deluge shower. If leather footwear or other leather garments become wet from EtO they should be discarded and not be worn again, because leather absorbs EtO and holds it against the skin. (c) Any pr otective clothing that has been damaged or is otherwise found to be defective should be repaired or replaced. Clean protective clothing should be provided to the employee as necessary to assure employee protection. Whenever impermeable clothing becomes w et with liquid EtO, it should be washed down with water before being removed by the employee. Employees are also required to wear splashproof safety goggles where there is any possibility of EtO contacting the eyes. (6) Miscellaneous precautions : (a) Store EtO in tightly closed containers in a cool, well -ventilated area and take all necessary precautions to avoid any explosion hazard. (b) Nonsparking tools must be used to open and close metal containers. These containers must be effectively grounded and bonded. (c) Do no t incinerate EtO cartridges, tanks or other containers. (d) Employers should advise employees of all areas and operations where exposure to EtO occurs. (7) Common operations : Common operations in which exposure to EtO is likely to occur include the following: (a) Manufacture of EtO, (b) surfactants, (c) ethanolamines, (d) glycol ethers, (e) specialty chemicals, and (f) use as a sterilant in the hospital, health product and spice industries. WAC 296 -62-07387 Appendix C --Medical surveillance guidelines (nonmandatory). (1) Route of entry: Inhalation . (2) Toxicology : Chapter 296 -62 WAC G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 86 (a) Clinical evidence of adverse effects associated with the exposure to EtO is present in the form of increased incidence of cancer in laboratory animals (leukemia, stomach, brain), mutation in offspring in animals, and resorptions and spontaneous abortions in animals and human populations respectively. Findings in humans and experimental animals exposed to airborne concentrations of EtO also indicate damage to the genetic material (DNA). Thes e include hemoglobin alkylation, unscheduled DNA synthesis, sister chromatid exchange chromosomal aberration, and functional sperm abnormalities. (b) Ethylene oxide in liquid form can cause eye irritation and injury to the cornea, frostbite, severe irritation, and blistering of the skin upon prolonged or confined contact. Ingestion of EtO can cause gastric irritation and liver injury. Other effects from inhalation of EtO vapors include respiratory irritation and lung injury, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrh ea, dyspnea and cyanosis. (3) Signs and symptoms of acute overexposure : (a) The early effects of acute overexposure to EtO are nausea and vomiting, headache, and irritation of the eyes and respiratory passages. The patient may notice a \"peculiar taste\" in the mou th. Delayed effects can include pulmonary edema, drowsiness, weakness, and incoordination. Studies suggest that blood cell changes, an increase in chromosomal aberrations, and spontaneous abortion may also be casually related to acute overexposure to EtO . (b) Skin contact with liquid or gaseous EtO causes characteristic burns and possible even an allergic -type sensitization. The edema and erythema occurring from skin contact with EtO progress to vesiculation with a tendency to coalesce into blebs with desqua mation. Healing occurs within three weeks, but there may be a residual brown pigmentation. A 40 -80% solution is extremely dangerous, causing extensive blistering after only brief contact. Pure liquid EtO causes frostbite because of rapid evaporation. I n contrast, the eye is relatively insensitive to EtO, but there may be some irritation of the cornea. (c) Most reported acute effects of occupational exposure to EtO are due to contact with EtO in liquid phase. The liquid readily penetrates rubber and leather , and will produce blistering if clothing or footwear contaminated with EtO are not removed. (4) Surveillance and preventive considerations : (a) As noted above, exposure to EtO has been linked to an increased risk of cancer and reproductive effects including decre ased male fertility, fetotoxicity, and spontaneous abortion. EtO workers are more likely to have chromosomal damage than similar groups not exposed to EtO. At the present, limited studies of chronic effects in humans resulting from exposure to EtO sugges t a causal association with leukemia. Animal studies indicate leukemia and cancers at other sites (brain, stomach) as well. The physician should be aware of the findings of these studies in evaluating the health of employees exposed to EtO. (b) Adequate scre ening tests to determine an employee's potential for developing serious chronic diseases, such as cancer, from exposure to EtO do not presently exist. Laboratory tests may, however, give evidence to suggest that an employee is potentially overexposed to E tO. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 87 It is important for the physician to become familiar with the operating conditions in which exposure to EtO is likely to occur. The physician also must become familiar with the signs and symptoms that indicate a worker is receiving otherwise unrecog nized and unacceptable exposure to EtO. These elements are especially important in evaluating the medical and work histories and in conducting the physical exam. When an unacceptable exposure in an active employee is identified by the physician, measures taken by the employer to lower exposure should also lower the risk of serious long -term consequences. (c) The employer is required to institute a medical surveillance program for all employees who are or will be exposed to EtO at or above the action level (0. 5 ppm) for at least 30 days per year, without regard to respirator use. All examinations and procedures must be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed physician at a reasonable time and place for the employee and at no cost to the employee. (d) Although broad latitude in prescribing specific tests to be included in the medical surveillance program is extended to the examining physician, WISHA requires inclusion of the following elements in the routine examination: Medical and work histories with s pecial emphasis directed to symptoms related to the pulmonary, hematologic, neurologic, and reproductive systems and to the eyes and skin. Physical examination with particular emphasis given to the pulmonary, hematologic, neurologic, and reproductive syste ms and to the eyes and skin. Complete blood count to include at least a white cell count (including differential cell count), red cell count, hematocrit, and hemoglobin. Any laboratory or other test which the examining physician deems necessary by sound me dical practice. (e) If requested by the employee, the medical examinations shall include pregnancy testing or laboratory evaluation of fertility as deemed appropriate by the physician. (f) In certain cases, to provide sound medical advice to the employer and the e mployee, the physician must evaluate situations not directly related to EtO. For example, employees with skin diseases may be unable to tolerate wearing protective clothing. In addition those with chronic respiratory diseases may not tolerate the wearing of negative pressure (air purifying) respirators. Additional tests and procedures that will help the physician determine which employees are medically unable to wear such respirators should include: An evaluation of cardiovascular function, a baseline c hest x-ray to be repeated at five year intervals, and a pulmonary function test to be repeated every three years. The pulmonary function test should include measurement of the employee's forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1), as well as calculation of the ratios of FEV 1 to FVC, and measured FVC and measured FEV 1 to expected values corrected for variation due to age, sex, race, and height. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 88 (g) The employer is required to make the prescribed tests available at least annuall y to employees who are or will be exposed at or above the action level, for 30 or more days per year; more often than specified if recommended by the examining physician; and upon the employee's termination of employment or reassignment to another work area. While little is known about the long -term consequences of high short -term exposures, it appears prudent to monitor such affected employees closely in light of existing health data. The employer shall provide physician recommended examinations to any e mployee exposed to EtO in emergency conditions. Likewise, the employer shall make available medical consultations including physician recommended exams to employees who believe they are suffering signs or symptoms of exposure to EtO. (h) The employer is requi red to provide the physician with the following information: A copy of this standard and its appendices; a description of the affected employee's duties as they relate to the employee exposure level; and information from the employee's previous medical ex aminations which is not readily available to the examining physician. Making this information available to the physician will aid in the evaluation of the employee's health in relation to assigned duties and fitness to wear personal protective equipment, when required. (i) The employer is required to obtain a written opinion from the examining physician containing the results of the medical examinations; the physician's opinion as to whether the employee has any detected medical conditions which would place th e employee at increased risk of material impairment of their health from exposure to EtO; any recommended restrictions upon the employee's exposure to EtO, or upon the use of protective clothing or equipment such as respirators; and a statement that the employee has been informed by the physician of the results of the medical examination and of any medical conditions which require further explanation or treatment. This written opinion must not reveal specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to occupational exposure to EtO, and a copy of the opinion must be provided to the affected employee. (j) The purpose in requiring the examining physician to supply the employer with a written opinion is to provide the employer with a medical basis to aid in the determinatio n of initial placement of employees and to assess the employee's ability to use protective clothing and equipment. WAC 296 -62-07389 Appendix D --Sampling and analytical methods for ethylene oxide (nonmandatory). (1) A number of methods are available for monito ring employee exposures to EtO. Most of these involve the use of charcoal tubes and sampling pumps, followed by analysis of the samples by gas chromatograph. The essential differences between the charcoal tube methods include, among others, the use of di fferent desorbing solvents, the use of different lots of charcoal, and the use of different equipment for analysis of the samples. Besides charcoal, methods using passive dosimeters, gas sampling bags, impingers, and detector tubes have been utilized for determination of EtO exposure. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 89 In addition, there are several commercially available portable gas analyzers and monitoring units. This appendix contains details for the method which has been tested at the OSHA Analytical Laboratory in Salt Lake City. I nclusion of this method in the appendix does not mean that this method is the only one which will be satisfactory. Copies of descriptions of other methods available are available in the rulemaking record, and may be obtained from the OSHA Docket Office. These include the Union Carbide, Dow Chemical, 3M, and DuPont methods, as well as NIOSH Method S -286. These methods are briefly described at the end of this appendix. (2) Employers who note problems with sample breakthrough using the OSHA or other charcoal me thods should try larger charcoal tubes. Tubes of larger capacity are available. In addition, lower flow rates and shorter sampling times should be beneficial in minimizing breakthrough problems. Whatever method the employer chooses, he/she must assure himself/herself of the method's accuracy and precision under the unique conditions present in his workplace. (3) Ethylene oxide : (a) Method No.: 30. (b) Matrix: Air. Target concentration: 1.0 ppm (1.8 mg/m3) Procedure: Samples are collected on two charcoal tubes in series and desorbed with 1% CS2 in benzene. The samples are derivatized with HBr and treated with sodium carbonate. Analysis is done by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. Recommended air volume and sampling rate: 1 liter and 0.05 Lpm . Detection limit of the overall procedure: 13.3 ppb (0.024 mg/m3) (based on 1.0 Reliable quantitation limit: 52.2 ppb (0.094 mg/m3) (based on 1.0 liter air sample). Standard error of estimate: 6.59% (see backup section 4.6). Special requirements: Samples must be analyzed within 15 days of sampling date. Status of method: The sampling and analytical method has been subject to the established evaluation procedures of the Organic Method Evaluations Branch. (c) Date: August 1981. (d) Chemist: Wayne D. Potter (e) Organic Solvents Branch, OSHA Analytical Laboratory, Salt Lake City, Utah (f) General discussion: Background. (A) History of procedure. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 90 (I) Ethylene oxide samples analyzed at the OSHA laboratory have normally been collected on activated charcoal and desorbed with carbon disulfide. The analysis is performed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a FID (flame ionization detector) as described in NIOSH Method S286 (Ref. (3)(j)(i)). This method is based on a PEL of 50 ppm and has a detection limit of a bout 1 ppm. (II) Recent studies have prompted the need for a method to analyze and detect ethylene oxide at very low concentrations. (III) Several attempts were made to form an ultraviolet (UV) sensitive derivative with ethylene oxide for analysis with HPLC. Among those tested that gave no detectable product were: p -anisidine, methylimidazole, aniline, and 2,3,6 -trichlorobenzoic acid. as triethylamine, aluminum chloride, methylene chloride and sulfuric acid but no detectable deri vative was produced. (IV) The next derivatization attempt was to react ethylene oxide with HBr to form 2 -bromoethanol. This reaction was successful. An ECD (electron capture detector) gave a very good response for 2 - bromoethanol due to the presence of bromine . The use of carbon disulfide as the desorbing solvent gave too large a response and masked the 2 -bromoethanol. Several other solvents were tested for both their response on the ECD and their ability to desorb ethylene oxide from the charcoal. Among tho se tested were toluene, xylene, ethyl benzene, hexane, cyclohexane and benzene. Benzene was the only solvent tested that gave a suitable response on the ECD and a high desorption. It was found that the desorption efficiency was improved by using 1% CS2 w ith the benzene. The carbon disulfide did not significantly improve the recovery with the other solvents. SKC Lot 120 was used in all tests done with activated charcoal. (B) Physical properties (Ref. (3)(j)(ii) --CH2; Chapter Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 91 Limit defining parameters: (A) Detection limit of the analytical procedure. The detection limit of the analytical procedure is 12.0 picograms of ethylene oxide per injection. This is the a mount of analyte which will give a peak whose height is five times the height of the baseline noise. (See backup data section (3)(i)(i).) (B) Detection limit of the overall procedure. (I) The detection limit of the overall procedure is 24.0 ng of ethylene oxide p er sample. (II) This is the amount of analyte spiked on the sampling device which allows recovery of an amount of analyte equivalent to the detection limit of the analytical procedure. (See backup data section (3)(i)(ii).) (C) Reliable quantitation limit. (I) The reli able quantitation limit is 94.0 nanograms of ethylene oxide per sample. This is the smallest amount of analyte which can be quantitated within the requirements of 75% recovery and 95% confidence limits. (See backup data section (3)(i)(ii).) (II) It must be re cognized that the reliable quantitation limit and detection limits reported in the method are based upon optimization of the instrument for the smallest possible amount of analyte. When the target concentration of an analyte is exceptionally higher than these limits, they may not be attainable at the routine operating parameters. In this case, the limits reported on analysis reports will be based on the operating parameters used during the analysis of the samples. (D) Sensitivity. (I) The sensitivity of the analy tical procedure over a concentration range representing 0.5 to 2 times the target concentration based on the recommended air volume is 34105 area units per \u00b5g/mL. The sensitivity is determined by the slope of the calibration curve (see backup data sectio n (3)(i)(iii)). (II) The sensitivity will vary somewhat with the particular instrument used in the analysis. (E) Recovery. The recovery of analyte from the collection medium must be 75% or greater. The average recovery from spiked samples over the range of 0.5 to 2 times the target concentration is 88.0% (see backup section (3)(i)(iv)). At lower concentrations the recovery appears to be nonlinear. (F) Precision (analytical method only). The pooled coefficient of variation obtained from replicate determination of ana lytical standards at 0.5X, 1X and 2X the target concentration is 0.036 (see backup data section (3)(i)(v)). Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 92 (G) Precision (overall procedure). (I) The overall procedure must provide results at the target concentration that are 25% or better at the 95% confidence level. The precision at the 95% confidence level for the 15 day storage test is plus or minus 12.9% (see backup data section(3)(i)(vi)). (II) This includes an additional plus or minus 5% for sampling error. Advantages. (A) The sampling procedure is convenient. (B) The analytical procedure is very sensitive and reproducible. (C) Reanalysis of samples is possible. (D) Samples are stable for at least 15 days at room temperature. (E) Interferences are reduced by the longer GC retention time of the new derivative. Disadvantages. (A) Two t ubes in series must be used because of possible breakthrough and migration. (B) The precision of the sampling rate may be limited by the reproducibility of the pressure drop across the tubes. The pumps are usually calibrated for one tube only. (C) The use of benz ene as the desorption solvent increases the hazards of analysis because of the potential carcinogenic effects of benzene. (D) After repeated injections there can be a buildup of residue formed on the electron capture detector which decreases sensitivity. (E) Recov ery from the charcoal tubes appears to be nonlinear at low concentrations. (g) Sampling procedure. Apparatus. (A) A calibrated personal sampling pump whose flow can be determined within plus or minus 5% of the recommended flow. (B) SKC Lot 120 Charcoal tubes: Glass t ube with both ends flame sealed, 7 cm long with a 6 mm O.D. and a 4 -mm I.D., containing 2 sections of coconut shell charcoal separated by a 2 -mm portion of urethane foam. The adsorbing section contains 100 mg of charcoal, the backup section 50 mg. A 3-mm portion of urethane foam is placed between the outlet end of the tube and the backup section. A plug of silylated glass wool is placed in front of the adsorbing section. Reagents. None required. Sampling technique. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 93 (A) Immediately before sampling, break t he ends of the charcoal tubes. All tubes must be from the same lot. (B) Connect two tubes in series to the sampling pump with a short section of flexible tubing. A minimum amount of tubing is used to connect the two sampling tubes together. The tube closer to the pump is used as a backup. This tube should be identified as the backup tube. (C) The tubes should be placed in a vertical position during sampling to minimize channeling. (D) Air being sampled should not pass through any hose or tubing before entering the charcoal tubes. (E) Seal the charcoal tubes with plastic caps immediately after sampling. Also, seal each sample with OSHA seals lengthwise. (F) With each batch of samples, submit at least one blank tube from the same lot used for samples. This tube should be su bjected to exactly the same handling as the samples (break, seal, transport) except that no air is drawn through it. (G) Transport the samples (and corresponding paperwork) to the lab for analysis. (H) If bulk samples are submitted for analysis, they should be tra nsported in glass containers with Teflon -lined caps. These samples must be mailed separately from the container used for the charcoal tubes. Breakthrough. The breakthrough (5% breakthrough) volume for a 3.0 mg/m3 ethylene oxide sample stream at approximat ely 85% relative humidity, 22\u00b0C and 633 mm is 2.6 liters sampled at 0.05 liters per minute. This is equivalent to 7.8 \u00b5g of ethylene oxide. Upon saturation of the tube it appeared that the water may be displacing ethylene oxide during sampling. Desorptio n efficiency. (A) The desorption efficiency, from liquid injection onto charcoal tubes, averaged 88.0% from 0.5 to 2.0 x the target concentration for a 1.0 liter air sample. At lower ranges it appears that the desorption efficiency is nonlinear (see backup da ta section (3)(i)(ii)). (B) The desorption efficiency may vary from one laboratory to another and also from one lot of charcoal to another. Thus, it is necessary to determine the desorption efficiency for a particular lot of charcoal. Recommended air volume a nd sampling rate. (A) The recommended air volume is 1.0 liter. (B) The recommended maximum sampling rate is 0.05 Lpm. Interferences.

(B) Suspected in terferences should be listed on the sample data sheets. (C) The relative humidity may affect the sampling procedure. Safety precautions. (A) Attach the sampling equipment to the employee so that it does not interfere with work performance. (B) Wear safety glasses when breaking the ends of the sampling tubes. (C) If possible, place the sampling tubes in a holder so the sharp end is not exposed while sampling. (h) Analytical method. Apparatus. (A) Gas chromatograph equipped with a linearized electron capture detector. (B) GC column capa ble of separating the derivative of ethylene oxide (2 - bromoethanol) from any interferences and the 1% CS2 in benzene solvent. The column used for validation studies was: 10 ft. x 1/8 inch stainless steel 20% SP -2100, .1% Carbowax 1500 on 100/120 Supelcop ort. (C) An electronic integrator or some other suitable method of measuring peak areas. (D) Two milliliter vials with Teflon -lined caps. (E) Gas tight syringe --500 \u00b5L or other convenient sizes for preparing standards. (F) Microliter syringes --10 \u00b5L or other convenient si zes for diluting standards and 1 \u00b5L for sample injections. (G) Pipets for dispensing the 1% CS2 in benzene solvent. The Glenco 1 mL dispenser is adequate and convenient. (H) Volumetric flasks --5 mL and other convenient sizes for preparing standards. (I) Disposable Pa steur pipets. Reagents.

(F) Desorbing reagent, 99% Benzene/1% CS2. Sample preparation. (A) The f ront and back sections of each sample are transferred to separate 2 - mL vials. (B) Each sample is desorbed with 1.0 mL of desorbing reagent. (C) The vials are sealed immediately and allowed to desorb for one hour with occasional shaking. (D) Desorbing reagent is drawn off the charcoal with a disposable pipet and put into clean 2 -mL vials. (E) One drop of HBr is added to each vial. Vials are resealed and HBr is mixed well with the desorbing reagent. (F) About 0.15 gram of sodium carbonate is carefully added to each vial. Vials are again resealed and mixed well. Standard preparation. (A) Standards are prepared by injecting the pure ethylene oxide gas into the desorbing reagent. (B) A range of standards are prepared to make a calibration curve. A concentration of 1.0 \u00b5L of ethylene oxid e gas per 1 mL desorbing reagent is equivalent to 1.0 ppm air concentration (all gas volumes at 25\u00b0C and 760 mm) for the recommended 1 liter air sample. This amount is uncorrected for desorption efficiency (see backup data section (3)(i)(ii), for desorpti on efficiency corrections). (C) One drop of HBr per mL of standard is added and mixed well. (D) About 0.15 grams of sodium carbonate is carefully added for each drop of HBr (a small reaction will occur). Analysis. (A) GC conditions. Nitrogen flow rate --10mL/min. Injec tor temperature --250\u00b0C Detector temperature --300\u00b0C Injection size --0.8 \u00b5L Elution time --3.9 minutes (B) Peak areas are measured by an integrator or other suitable means. (C) The integrator results are in area units and a calibration curve is set up with concentration vs. area units. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 96 Interferences. (A) Any compound having the same retention time of 2 -bromoethanol is a potential interference. Possible interferences should be listed on the sample data sheets. (B) GC parameters may be changed to ci rcumvent interferences. (C) There are usually trace contaminants in benzene. (D) These contaminants, however, posed no problem of interference. (E) Retention time date on a single column is not considered proof of chemical identity. Samples over the 1.0 ppm target le vel should be confirmed by GC/Mass Spec or other suitable means. Calculations. (A) The concentration in \u00b5g/mL for a sample is determined by comparing the area of a particular sample to the calibration curve, which has been prepared from analytical standards. (B) The amount of analyte in each sample is corrected for desorption efficiency by use of a desorption curve. (C) Analytical results, A, from the two tubes that compose a particular air sample are added together. (D) The concentration for a sample is calculated by the following equation: A x B EtO, mg/m3 = ---------------- C where: A = \u00b5g/mL B = desorption volume in milliliters C = air volume in liters. (E) To convert mg/m3 to parts per million (ppm) the following relationship is volume at 25\u00b0C and 760mm Hg 44.05 = molecular weight of EtO. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 97 Safety precaution. (A) Ethylene oxide and benzene are potential carcinogens and care must be exercised when working with t hese compounds. (B) All work done with the solvents (preparation of standards, desorption of samples, etc.) should be done in a hood. (C) Avoid any skin contact with all of the solvents. (D) Wear safety glasses at all times. (E) Avoid skin contact with HBr because it is h ighly toxic and a strong irritant to eyes and skin. (i) Backup data. Detection limit data. The detection limit was determined by injecting 0.8 \u00b5L of a 0.015 \u00b5g/mL standard of ethylene oxide into 1% CS2 in benzene. The detection limit of the analytical procedu re is taken to be 1.20 x 10 -5 \u00b5g per injection. This is equivalent to 8.3 ppb (0.015 mg/m3) for the recommended air volume. Desorption efficiency. Ethylene oxide was spiked into charcoal tubes and the following recovery data was obtained: Amount Spiked ( \u00b5g) Amount Recovered (\u00b5g) Percent Recovery 4.5 3.0 2.25 1.5 1.6 .75 .375 .375 .1875 .094 4.32 2.61 2.025 1.365 1.38 .6525 amounts the recovery appears to be nonlinear .

OSHA believes that several other typ es of monitoring equipment and techniques exist for monitoring time -weighted averages. Considerable research and method development is currently being performed, which will lead to improvements and a wider variety of monitoring techniques. A combination of monitoring procedures can be used. There probably is no one best method for monitoring personal exposure to ethylene oxide in all cases. There are advantages, disadvantages, and limitations to each method. The method of choice will depend on the need and requirements. Some commonly used methods include the use of charcoal tubes, passive dosimeters, Tedler gas sampling bags, detector tubes, photoionization detection units, infrared detection units and gas chromatographs. A number of these methods are described below.

Qazi -Ketcham method (Ex -11-133)--This method consists of collecting EtO on Columbia JXC activated carbon, desorbing the EtO with carbon disulfide and analyzing by gas chromatography with flame ionizati on detection. Union Carbide has recently updated and revalidated this monitoring procedure. This method is capable of determining both eight -hour time -weighted average exposures and short -term exposures. The method was validated to 0.5 ppm. Like other charcoal collecting procedures, the method requires considerable analytical expertise. ASTM -proposed method --The Ethylene Oxide Industry Council (EOIC) has contracted with Clayton Environmental Consultants, Inc. to conduct a collaborative study for the pro posed method. The ASTM -Proposed method is similar to the method published by Qazi and Ketcham in the November 1977 American Industrial Hygiene Association Journal, and to the method of Pilney and Coyne, presented at the 1979 American Industrial Hygiene Co nference. After the air to be sampled is drawn through an activated charcoal tube, the ethylene oxide is desorbed from the tube using carbon disulfide and is quantitated by gas chromatography utilizing a flame ionization detector. The ASTM -proposed metho d specifies a large two -section charcoal tube, shipment in dry ice, storage at less than -5\u00b0C, and analysis within three weeks to prevent migration and sample loss. Two types of charcoal tubes are being tested -- Pittsburgh Coconut -Based (PCB) and Columbia JXC charcoal. This collaborative study will give an indication of the inter - and intralaboratory precision and accuracy of the ASTM/proposed method. Several laboratories have considerable expertise using the Qazi -Ketcham and Dow methods. (b) Passive monitors --Ethylene oxide diffuses into the monitor and is collected in the sampling media. The DuPont Pro -Tek badge collects EtO in an absorbing solution, which is analyzed colorimetrically to determine the amount of EtO present. The 3M 350 badge collects the Et O on chemically treated charcoal. Other passive monitors are currently being developed and tested. Both 3M and DuPont have submitted data indicating their dosimeters meet the precision and accuracy requirements of the proposed ethylene oxide standard. B oth presented laboratory validation data to 0.2 ppm (Exs. 11 -65, 4 -20, 108, 109, 130). (c) Tedlar gas sampling bags -samples are collected by drawing a known volume of air into a Tedlar gas sampling bag. The ethylene oxide concentration is often determined on-site using a portable gas chromatograph or portable infrared spectometer. (d) Detector tubes --A known volume of air is drawn through a detector tube using a small hand pump. The concentration of EtO is related to the length of stain developed in the tube. De tector tubes are economical, easy to use, and give an immediate readout. Unfortunately, partly because they are nonspecific, their accuracy is often questionable. Since the sample is taken over a short period of time, they may be useful for determining t he source of leaks. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 102 (e) Direct reading instruments: There are numerous types of direct reading instruments, each having its own strengths and weaknesses (Exs. 135B, 135C, 107, 11 -78, 11 -153). Many are relatively new, offering greater sensitivity and specifi city. Popular ethylene oxide direct reading instruments include infrared detection units, photoionization detection units, and gas chromatographs. Portable infrared analyzers provide an immediate, continuous indication of a concentration value; making the m particularly useful for locating high concentration pockets, in leak detection and in ambient air monitoring. In infrared detection units, the amount of infrared light absorbed by the gas being analyzed at selected infrared wavelengths is related to the concentration of a particular component. Various models have either fixed or variable infrared filters, differing cell pathlengths, and microcomputer controls for greater sensitivity, automation, and interference elimination. A fairly recent detection sy stem is photoionization detection. The molecules are ionized by high energy ultraviolet light. The resulting current is measured. Since different substances have different ionization potentials, other organic compounds may be ionized. The lower the lam p energy, the better the selectivity. As a continuous monitor, photoionization detection can be useful for locating high concentration pockets, in leak detection, and continuous ambient air monitoring. Both portable and stationary gas chromatographs are available with various types of detectors, including photoionization detectors. A gas chromatograph with a photoionization detector retains the photoionization sensitivity, but minimizes or eliminates interferences. For several GC/PID units, the sensitiv ity is in the 0.1 -0.2 ppm EtO range. The GC/PID with microprocessors can sample up to 20 sample points sequentially, calculate and record data, and activate alarms or ventilation systems. Many are quite flexible and can be configured to meet the specific analysis needs for the workplace. DuPont presented their laboratory validation data of the accuracy of the Qazi - Ketcham charcoal tube, the PCB charcoal tube, Miran 103 IR analyzer, 3M #3550 monitor and the DuPont C -70 badge. Quoting Elbert V. Kring: We a lso believe that OSHA's proposed accuracy in this standard is appropriate. At plus or minus 25 percent at one part per million, and plus or minus 35 percent below that. And, our data indicates there's only one monitoring method, right now, that we've tes ted thoroughly, that meets that accuracy requirements. That is the DuPont Pro -Tek badge* * *. We also believe that this kind of data should be confirmed by another independent laboratory, using the same type dynamic chamber testing (Tr. 1470). Additional data by an independent laboratory following their exact protocol was not submitted. However, information was submitted on comparisons and precision and accuracy of those monitoring procedures which indicate far better precision and accuracy of those moni toring procedures than that obtained by DuPont (Ex. 4 -20, 130, 11 -68, 11 -133, 130, 135A). Chapter 296 -62 WAC General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 103 The accuracy of any method depends to a large degree upon the skills and experience of those who not only collect the samples but also those who analyze the samples . Even for methods that are collaboratively tested, some laboratories are closer to the true values than others. Some laboratories may meet the precision and accuracy requirements of the method; others may consistently far exceed them for the same . WAC 296 -62-074 Cadmium . WAC 296 -62-07401 Scope.

Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 104 WAC 296 -62-07405 Permissible exposure limit (PEL). The employer must ensure that no employee is exposed to an airbo rne concentration of cadmium in excess of five micrograms per cubic meter of air (5 \u00b5g/m3), calculated as an 8 -hour time - weighted average exposure (TWA). WAC 296 -62-07407 Exposure monitoring. (1) General . (a) Each employer who has a workplace or work operation co vered by this section must determine if any employee may be exposed to cadmium at or above the action level. (b) Determinations of employee exposure must be made from breathing zone air samples that reflect the monitored employee's regular, daily 8 -hour TWA ex posure to cadmium. (c) 8-hour TWA exposures must be determined for each employee on the basis of one or more personal breathing zone air samples reflecting full shift exposure on each shift, for each job classification, in each work area. Where several em ployees perform the same job tasks, in the same job classification, on the same shift, in the same work area, and the length, duration, and level of cadmium exposures are similar, an employer may sample a representative fraction of the employees instead of all employees in order to meet this requirement. In representative sampling, the employer must sample the employee(s) expected to have the highest cadmium exposures. (2) Specific . (a) Initial monitoring. Except as provided for in (b) and (c) of this subsection, the employer must monitor employee exposures and must base initial determinations on the monitoring results. (b) Where the employer has monitored after September 14, 1991, under conditions that in all important aspects closely resemble those currently prevail ing and where that monitoring satisfies all other requirements of this section, including the accuracy and confidence levels of subsection (6) of this section, the employer may rely on such earlier monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of WAC 296 -62-07427 (2)(a). (c) Where the employer has objective data, as defined in WAC 296 -62-07427(2), demonstrating that employee exposure to cadmium will not exceed the action level under the expected conditions of processing, use, or handling, the employer may rely upon such data instead of implementing initial monitoring. (3) Monitoring frequency (periodic monitoring) . (a) If the initial monitoring or periodic monitoring reveals employee exposures to be at or above the action level, the employer must monitor at a frequency and pattern needed to represent the levels of exposure of employees and where exposures are above the PEL to ensure the adequacy of respiratory selection and the effectiveness of engineering and work -practice controls. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 105 However, such exposure monitoring must be performed at least every six months. The employer, at a minimum, must continue these semiannual measurements unless and until the conditions set out in (b) of this subsection are met. (b) If the initial monitoring or the periodic monitoring indicates that employee exposures are below the action level and that result is confirmed by the results of another monitoring taken at least seven days later, the employer may discontinue the monitoring for those employees whose exposures are represented by such mo nitoring. (4) Additional monitoring . The employer also must institute the exposure monitoring required under (2)(a) and (3) of this section whenever there has been a change in the raw materials, equipment, personnel, work -practices, or finished products that may result in additional employees being exposed to cadmium at or above the action level or in employees already exposed to cadmium at or above the action level being exposed above the PEL, or whenever the employer has any reason to suspect that any other change might result in such further exposure. (5) Employee notification of monitoring results . (a) Within fifteen working days after the receipt of the results of any monitoring performed under this section, the employer must notify each affected employee individu ally in writing of the results. In addition, within the same time period the employer must post the results of the exposure monitoring in an appropriate location that is accessible to all affected employees. (b) Wherever monitoring results indicate that emplo yee exposure exceeds the PEL, the employer must include in the written notice a statement that the PEL has been exceeded and a description of the corrective action being taken by the employer to reduce employee exposure to or below the PEL. (6) Accuracy of mea surement . The employer must use a method of monitoring and analysis that has an accuracy of not less than plus or minus twenty -five percent, with a confidence level of ninety -five percent, for airborne concentrations of cadmium at or above the action level, the permissible exposure limit (PEL), and the separate engineering control air limit (SECAL). WAC 296 -62-07409 Regulated areas. (1) Establishment . The employer must establish a regulated area wherever an employee's exposure to airborne concentrations of c admium is, or can reasonably be expected to be in excess of the permissible exposure limit (PEL). (2) Demarcation . Regulated areas must be demarcated from the rest of the workplace in any manner that adequately establishes and alerts employees of the boundari es of the regulated area. (3) Access . Access to regulated areas must be limited to authorized persons. (4) Provision of respirators . Each person entering a regulated area must be supplied with and required to use a respirator, selected in accordance with WAC 296 -62-07413(2).

(c) The employer must instruct the physician not to reveal orally or in the written medical opinion given to the employer specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to occu pational exposure to cadmium. (11) Medical removal protection (MRP) . (a) General. The employer must temporarily remove an employee from work where there is excess exposure to cadmium on each occasion that medical removal is required under subsection (3), (4), or (6 ) of this section and on each occasion that a physician determines in a written medical opinion that the employee should be removed from such exposure. The physician's determination may be based on biological monitoring results, inability to wear a respir ator, evidence of illness, other signs or symptoms of cadmium -related dysfunction or disease, or any other reason deemed medically sufficient by the physician. The employer must medically remove an employee in accordance with this subsection regardless of whether at the time of removal a job is available into which the removed employee may be transferred. Whenever an employee is medically removed under this subsection, the employer must transfer the removed employee to a job where the exposure to cadmium is within the permissible levels specified in that subsection as soon as one becomes available. For any employee who is medically removed under the provisions of (a) of this subsection, the employer must provide follow -up biological monitoring in accordance with subsection (2)(b)(ii) of this section at least every three months and follow -up medical examinations semiannually at least every six months until in a written medical opinion the examining physician determines that either the employee may be returned to their former job status as specified under (d) through (e) of this subsection or the employee must be permanently removed from excess cadmium exposure. The employer may not return an employee who has been medically removed for any reason to their former job status until a physician determines in a written medical opinion that continued medical removal is no longer necessary to protect the employee's health. (b) Where an employee is found unfit to wear a respirator under subsection (6)(b) of this section, the employer must remove the employee from work where exposure to cadmium is above the PEL. (c) Where removal is based on any reason other than the employee's inability to wear a respirator, the employer must remove the employee from work where exposure to cadmiu m is at or above the action level. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 121 (d) Except as specified in (e) of this subsection, no employee who was removed because their level of CdU, CdB and/or \u00df2 -M exceeded the medical removal trigger levels in subsection (3) or (4) of this section may be returned to work with exposure to cadmium at or above the action level until the employee's levels of CdU fall to or below 3 \u00b5g/g Cr, CdB falls to or below 5 \u00b5g/lwb, and \u00df2 -M falls to or below 300 \u00b5g/g Cr. (e) However, when in the examining physician's opinion continu ed exposure to cadmium will not pose an increased risk to the employee's health and there are special circumstances that make continued medical removal an inappropriate remedy, the physician must fully discuss these matters with the employee, and then in a written determination may return a worker to their former job status despite what would otherwise be unacceptably high biological monitoring results. Thereafter, the returned employee must continue to be provided with medical surveillance as if they were still on medical removal until the employee's levels of CdU fall to or below 3 \u00b5g/g Cr, CdB falls to or below 5 \u00b5g/lwb, and \u00df2 -M falls to or below 300 \u00b5g/g Cr. (f) Where an employer, although not required by (a) through (c) of this subsection to do so, remove s an employee from exposure to cadmium or otherwise places limitations on an employee due to the effects of cadmium exposure on the employee's medical condition, the employer must provide the same medical removal protection benefits to that employee under subsection (12) of this section as would have been provided had the removal been required under (a) through (c) of this subsection. (12) Medical removal protection benefits (MRPB) . (a) The employer must provide MRPB for up to a maximum of eighteen months to an empl oyee each time and while the employee is temporarily medically removed under subsection (11) of this section. (b) For purposes of this section, the requirement that the employer provide MRPB means that the employer must maintain the total normal earnings, seni ority, and all other employee rights and benefits of the removed employee, including the employee's right to their former job status, as if the employee had not been removed from the employee's job or otherwise medically limited. (c) Where, after eighteen mont hs on medical removal because of elevated biological monitoring results, the employee's monitoring results have not declined to a low enough level to permit the employee to be returned to their former job status: The employer must make available to the emp loyee a medical examination pursuant in order to obtain a final medical determination as to whether the employee may be returned to their former job status or must be permanently removed from excess cadmium exposure; and The employer must ensure that the f inal medical determination indicates whether the employee may be returned to their former job status and what steps, if any, should be taken to protect the employee's health. (d) The employer may condition the provision of MRPB upon the employee's participatio n in medical surveillance provided in accordance with this section.

WAC 296 -62-07441 Appendix A --substance safety data sheet . (a) Substance: Cadmium. (b) 8-Hour, time -weighted -average, permissible exposure limit (TWA PEL): (c) TWA PEL: Five micrograms of cadmium per cubic meter of air 5 \u00b5g/m3, time - weighted average (TWA) for an 8 -hour workday. (d) Appearance: Cadmium metal --soft, blue -white, malleable, lustrous metal or grayish - white powder. Some cadmium compounds may also appear as a brow n, yellow, or red powdery substance. (2) Health hazard data . (a) Routes of exposure. Cadmium can cause local skin or eye irritation. Cadmium can affect your health if you inhale it or if you swallow it. (b) Effects of overexposure. Short -term (acute) exposure: Cadm ium is much more dangerous by inhalation than by ingestion. High exposures to cadmium that may be immediately dangerous to life or health occur in jobs where workers handle large quantities of cadmium dust or fume; heat cadmium -containing compounds or cad mium - coated surfaces; weld with cadmium solders or cut cadmium -containing materials such as bolts. Severe exposure may occur before symptoms appear. Early symptoms may include mild irritation of the upper respiratory tract, a sensation of constriction of the throat, a metallic taste and/or a cough. A period of one to ten hours may precede the onset of rapidly progressing shortness of breath, chest pain, and flu - like symptoms with weakness, fever, headache, chills, sweating, and muscular pain. Acute pulmo nary edema usually develops within twenty -four hours and reaches a maximum by three days. If death from asphyxia does not occur, symptoms may resolve within a week. Long -term (chronic) exposure. Repeated or long -term exposure to cadmium, even at relative ly low concentrations, may result in kidney damage and an increased risk of cancer of the lung and of the prostate. (c) Emergency first aid procedures. Eye exposure: Direct contact may cause redness or pain. Wash eyes immediately with large amounts of water, lifting the upper and lower eyelids. Get medical attention immediately. Skin exposure: Direct contact may result in irritation. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes immediately. Wash affected area with soap or mild detergent and large amounts of wat er. Get medical attention immediately. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 128 Ingestion: Ingestion may result in vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and sore throat. Treatment for symptoms must be administered by medical personnel. Under no circumstances should the employe r allow any person whom they retain , employ, supervise, or controls to engage in therapeutic chelation. Such treatment is likely to translocate cadmium from pulmonary or other tissue to renal tissue. Get medical attention immediately. Inhalation: If lar ge amounts of cadmium are inhaled, the exposed person must be moved to fresh air at once. If breathing has stopped, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Administer oxygen if available. Keep the affected person warm and at rest. Get medical attention immediately. Rescue: Move the affected person from the hazardous exposure. If the exposed person has been overcome, attempt rescue only after notifying at least one other person of the emergency and putting into effect established emergency procedures. Do not become a casualty yourself. Understand your emergency rescue procedures and know the location of the emergency equipment before the need arises. (3) Employee information . (a) Protective clothing and equipment. Respirators: You may be required to wear a re spirator for nonroutine activities; in emergencies; while your employer is in the process of reducing cadmium exposures through engineering controls; and where engineering controls are not feasible. If air -purifying respirators are worn , they must have a label issued by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) under the provisions of 42 CFR part 84 stating that the respirators have been certified for use with cadmium. Cadmium does not have a detectable odor except at levels well above the permissible exposure limits. If you can smell cadmium while wearing a respirator, proceed immediately to fresh air. If you experience difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, tell your employer. Protective clothing: You may be required to wear impermeable clothing, gloves, foot gear, a face shield, or other appropriate protective clothing to prevent skin contact with cadmium. Where protective clothing is required, your employer must provide clean garments to you as necessary to assure that the clothing protects you adequately. The employer must replace or repair protective clothing that has become torn or otherwise damaged. Eye protection: You may be required to wear splash -proof or dust resistant goggles to prevent eye contact with c admium. (b) Employer requirements. Medical: If you are exposed to cadmium at or above the action level, your employer is required to provide a medical examination, laboratory tests and a medical history according to the medical surveillance provisions under W AC 296-62-07423. (See summary chart and tables in this section, appendix A.) Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 129 These tests must be provided without cost to you. In addition, if you are accidentally exposed to cadmium under conditions known or suspected to constitute toxic exposure to c admium, your employer is required to make special tests available to you. Access to records: All medical records are kept strictly confidential. You or your representative are entitled to see the records of measurements of your exposure to cadmium. Your medical examination records can be furnished to your personal physician or designated representative upon request by you to your employer. Observation of monitoring: Your employer is required to perform measurements that are representative of your exposu re to cadmium and you or your designated representative are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are entitled to observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure, and to record the results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is takin g place in an area where respirators or personal protective clothing and equipment are required to be worn, you or your representative must also be provided with, and must wear the protective clothing and equipment. (c) Employee requirements. You will not be able to smoke, eat, drink, chew gum or tobacco, or apply cosmetics while working with cadmium in regulated areas. You will also not be able to carry or store tobacco products, gum, food, drinks, or cosmetics in regulated areas because these products easil y become contaminated with cadmium from the workplace and can therefore create another source of unnecessary cadmium exposure. Some workers will have to change out of work clothes and shower at the end of the day, as part of their workday, in order to was h cadmium from skin and hair. Handwashing and cadmium -free eating facilities must be provided by the employer and proper hygiene should always be performed before eating. It is also recommended that you do not smoke or use tobacco products, because among other things, they naturally contain cadmium. For further information, read the labeling on such products. (4) Physician information . (a) Introduction. The medical surveillance provisions of WAC 296 -62-07423 generally are aimed at accomplishing three main inter related purposes: First, identifying employees at higher risk of adverse health effects from excess, chronic exposure to cadmium; second, preventing cadmium -induced disease; and third, detecting and minimizing existing cadmium -induced disease. The core o f medical surveillance in this standard is the early and periodic monitoring of the employee's biological indicators of: Recent exposure to cadmium; Cadmium body burden; and Potential and actual kidney damage associated with exposure to cadmium. The main adverse health effects associated with cadmium overexposure are lung cancer and kidney dysfunction. It is not yet known how to adequately biologically monitor human beings to specifically prevent cadmium -induced lung cancer. By contrast, the kidney can be monitored to provide prevention and early detection of cadmium -induced kidney damage. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 130 Since, for noncarcinogenic effects, the kidney is considered the primary target organ of chronic exposure to cadmium, the medical surveillance provisions of this stan dard effectively focus on cadmium -induced kidney disease. Within that focus, the aim, where possible, is to prevent the onset of such disease and, where necessary, to minimize such disease as may already exist. The by - products of successful prevention of kidney disease are anticipated to be the reduction and prevention of other cadmium -induced diseases. (b) Health effects. The major health effects associated with cadmium overexposure are described below. Kidney: The most prevalent nonmalignant disease obser ved among workers chronically exposed to cadmium is kidney dysfunction. Initially, such dysfunction is manifested as proteinuria. The proteinuria associated with cadmium exposure is most commonly characterized by excretion of low - molecular weight protein s (15,000 to 40,000 MW) accompanied by loss of electrolytes, uric acid, calcium, amino acids, and phosphate. The compounds commonly excreted include: beta -2-microglobulin (\u00df2 chains, and lysozyme. Excretion of low molecular weight proteins are characteristic of damage to the proximal tubules of the kidney (Iwao et al., 1980). It has also been observed that exposure to cadmium may lead to urinary excretion of high -molecular weight proteins such as albumin, immunoglobulin G, and glycoproteins (Ex. 29). Excretion of high - molecular weight proteins is typically indicative of damage to the glomeruli of the kidney. Bernard et al., (1979) suggest that damage to the glomeruli and damage to the proximal tub ules of the kidney may both be linked to cadmium exposure but they may occur independently of each other. Several studies indicate that the onset of low -molecular weight proteinuria is a sign of irreversible kidney damage 1974; Piscator 1984; Elinder et al., 1985; Smith et al., 1986). Above specific levels of \u00df2 -M associated with cadmium exposure it is unlikely that \u00df2 -M levels return to normal even when cadmium exposure is eliminated by removal of the individual from the cadmium work environment (Friberg, Ex. 29, 1990). Some studies indicate that such proteinuria may be progressive; levels of \u00df2 -M observed in the urine increase with time even after cadmium exposure has ceased. See, for example, Elinder et al., 1985. Such observations, however, are not universal, and it has been suggested that studies in which proteinuria has not been observed to progress may not have tracked patients for a sufficiently long time interval (Jarup, Ex. 8 -661). When cadmium exposure co ntinues after the onset of proteinuria, chronic nephrotoxicity may occur (Friberg, Ex. 29). Uremia results from the inability of the glomerulus to adequately filter blood. This leads to severe disturbance of electrolyte concentrations and may lead to various clinical complications including kidney stones (L -140-50). After prolonged exposure to cadmium, glomerular proteinuria, 4 -28, 14-18). Phosphate, calcium, glucose, and amino acids are essential to life, and under normal conditions, their excretion should be regulated by the kidney. Once low molecular weight proteinuria has developed, these elements dissipate from the human body. Loss of glomerular function may also occur, manifested by decreased glomerular filtration rate and increased serum creatinine. Severe Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 131 cadmium -induced renal damage may eventually develop into chronic renal failure and uremia (Ex. 55). Studies in which animals are chronically exposed to cad mium confirm the renal effects observed in humans (Friberg et al., 1986). Animal studies also confirm problems with calcium metabolism and related skeletal effects which have been observed among humans exposed to cadmium in addition to the renal effects. Other effects commonly reported in chronic animal studies include anemia, changes in liver morphology, immunosuppression and hypertension. Some of these effects may be associated with co -factors. Hypertension, for example, appears to be associated with diet as well as cadmium exposure. Animals injected with cadmium have also shown testicular necrosis (Ex. 8 - 86B). Biological markers. It is universally recognized that the best measures of cadmium exposures and its effects are measurements of cadmium in biological fluids, especially urine and blood. Of the two, CdU is conventionally used to determine body burden of cadmium in workers without kidney disease. CdB is conventionally used to monitor for recent exposure to cadmium. In addition, levels of CdU and CdB historically have been used to predict the percent of the population likely to develop kidney disease (Thun et al., Ex. L -140-50; WHO, Ex. 8 -674; ACGIH, Exs. 8 -667, 140 -50). The third biological parameter upon which WISHA relies for medical su rveillance is beta -2-microglobulin in urine (\u00df2-M), a low molecular weight protein. Excess \u00df2 -M has been widely accepted by physicians and scientists as a reliable indicator of functional damage to the proximal tubule of the kidney. (Exs. 8 -140-45, when the proximal tubules can no longer reabsorb this protein in a normal manner. This failure of the proximal tubules is an early stage of a kind of kidney disease that commonly occurs among workers with e xcessive cadmium exposure. Used in conjunction with biological test results indicating abnormal levels of CdU and CdB, the finding of excess \u00df2 -M can establish for an examining physician that any existing kidney disease is probably cadmium -related (Trs. 6 /6/90, pp. 82-86, 122, 134). The upper limits of normal levels for cadmium in urine and cadmium in blood are 3 \u00b5g Cd/gram creatinine in urine and 5 \u00b5g Cd/liter whole blood, respectively. These levels were derived from broad -based population studies. Th ree issues confront the physicians in the use of \u00df2 -M as a marker of kidney dysfunction and material impairment. First, there are a few other causes of elevated levels of \u00df2 -M not related to cadmium exposures, some of which may be rather common diseases a nd some of which are serious diseases (e.g., myeloma or transient flu, Exs. 29 and 8 -086). These can be medically evaluated as alternative causes (Friberg, Ex. 29). Also, there are other factors that can cause \u00df2 -M to degrade so that low levels would res ult in workers with tubular dysfunction. For example, regarding the degradation of \u00df2 -M, workers with acidic urine (pH<6) might have \u00df2 -M levels that are within the \"normal\" range when in fact kidney dysfunction has occurred (Ex. L -140-1) and the low mole cular weight proteins are degraded in acid urine. Thus, it is very important that the pH of urine be measured, that urine samples be buffered as necessary (See WAC 296 -62-07451, appendix F.), and that urine samples be handled correctly, i.e., measure the p H of freshly voided urine samples, then if necessary, buffer to Ph>6 (or above for shipping purposes), Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 132 measure Ph again and then, perhaps, freeze the sample for storage and shipping. (See also WAC 296 -62-07451, appendix F.) Second, there is debate over t he pathological significance of proteinuria, however, most world experts believe that \u00df2 -M levels greater than 300 \u00b5g/g Cr are abnormal (Elinder, Ex. 55, Friberg, Ex. 29). Such levels signify kidney dysfunction that constitutes material impairment of heal th. Finally, detection of \u00df2 -M at low levels has often been considered difficult, however, many laboratories have the capability of detecting excess \u00df2 -M using simple kits, such as the Phadebas Delphia test, that are accurate to levels of 100 \u00b5g \u00df2 -M/g Cr U (Ex. L -140-1). Specific recommendations for ways to measure \u00df2 -M and proper handling of urine samples to prevent degradation of \u00df2 -M have been addressed by WISHA in WAC 296 -62-07451, appendix F, in the section on laboratory standardization. All biolo gical samples must be analyzed in a laboratory that is proficient in the analysis of that particular analyte, under WAC 296 -62-07423 (1)(d), the employer is to ensure that t he collecting and handling of biological samples of cadmium in urine (CdU), cadmium in blood (CdB), and beta -2 microglobulin in urine (\u00df2 -M) taken from employees is collected in a manner that ensures reliability. The employer must also ensure that analysi s of biological samples of cadmium in urine (CdU), cadmium in blood (CdB), and beta -2 microglobulin in urine (\u00df2 -M) taken from employees is performed in laboratories with demonstrated proficiency for that particular analyte. (See WAC 296 -62-07451, appendi x F). Lung and prostate cancer. The primary sites for cadmium -associated cancer appear to be the lung and the prostate (L -140-50). Evidence for an association between cancer and cadmium exposure derives from both epidemiological studies and animal experi ments. Mortality from prostate cancer associated with cadmium is slightly elevated in several industrial cohorts, but the number of cases is small and there is not clear dose -response relationship. More substantive evidence exists for lung cancer. The major epidemiological study of lung cancer was conducted by Thun et al., (Ex. 4 -68). Adequate data on cadmium exposures were available to allow evaluation of dose -response relationships between cadmium exposure and lung cancer. A statistically significan t excess of lung cancer attributed to cadmium exposure was observed in this study even when confounding variables such as co -exposure to arsenic and smoking habits were taken into consideration (Ex. L -140-50). The primary evidence for quantifying a link between lung cancer and cadmium exposure from animal studies derives from two rat bioassay studies; one by Takenaka et al., (1983), which is a study of cadmium chloride and a second study by Oldiges and Glaser (1990) of four cadmium compounds. Based on th e above cited studies, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified cadmium as \"B1\", a probable human carcinogen, in 1985 (Ex. 4 -4). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 1987 also recommended that cadmium be listed as \"2A \", a probable human carcinogen (Ex. 4 -15). The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has recently recommended that cadmium be labeled as a carcinogen. Since 1984, NIOSH has concluded that cadmium is possibly a human carcinogen and has recommended that exposures be controlled to the lowest level feasible. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 133 Noncarcinogenic effects. Acute pneumonitis occurs 10 to 24 hours after initial acute inhalation of high levels of cadmium fumes with symptoms such as fever and chest pain (Exs . 30, 8 -86B). In extreme exposure cases pulmonary edema may develop and cause death several days after exposure. Little actual exposure measurement data is available on the level of airborne cadmium exposure that causes such immediate adverse lung effect s, nonetheless, it is reasonable to believe cadmium concentration of approximately 1 mg/m3 over an eight hour period is \"immediately dangerous\" (55 FR 4052, ANSI; Ex. 8 - 86B). In addition to acute lung effects and chronic renal effects, long term exposure to cadmium may cause other severe effects on the respiratory system. Reduced pulmonary function and chronic lung disease indicative of emphysema have been observed in workers who have had prolonged exposure to cadmium dust or fumes (Exs. 4 -29, 4 -22, 4 -42, 4-50, 4 -63). In a study of workers conducted by Kazantzis et al., a statistically significant excess of worker deaths due to chronic bronchitis was found, which in his opinion was directly related to high cadmium exposures of 1 mg/m3 or more (Tr. 6/8/90 , pp. 156 -157). Cadmium need not be respirable to constitute a hazard. Inspirable cadmium particles that are too large to be respirable but small enough to enter the tracheobronchial region of the lung can lead to bronchoconstriction, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer of that portion of the lung. All of these diseases have been associated with occupational exposure to cadmium (Ex. 8 - 86B). Particles that are constrained by their size to the extra -thoracic regions of the respiratory system such as t he nose and maxillary sinuses can be swallowed through mucocillary clearance and be absorbed into the body (ACGIH, Ex. 8 - 692). The impaction of these particles in the upper airways can lead to anosmia, or loss of sense of smell, which is an early indicati on of overexposure among workers exposed to heavy metals. This condition is commonly reported among cadmium -exposed workers (Ex. 8 -86-B). (c) Medical surveillance. In general, the main provisions of the medical surveillance section of the standard, under WA C 296 -62-07423 (1) through (16), are as follows: Workers exposed above the action level are covered; Workers with intermittent exposures are not covered; Past workers who are covered receive biological monitoring for at least one year; Initial examinations include a medical questionnaire and biological monitoring of cadmium in blood (CdB), cadmium in urine (CdU), and Beta -2- microglobulin in urine (\u00df2 -M); Biological monitoring of these three analytes is performed at least annually; full medical examinations are performed biennially; Until five years from the effective date of the standard, medical removal is required when CdU is greater than 15 \u00b5g/gram creatinine (g Cr), or CdB is greater than 15 \u00b5g/liter whole blood (lwb), or \u00df2 -M is greater than 1500 \u00b5g/g Cr, and CdB is greater than 5 \u00b5g/lwb or CdU is greater than 3 \u00b5g/g Cr; Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 134 Beginning five years after the standard is in effect, medical removal triggers will be reduced; Medical removal protection benefits are to be provided for up to eighteen months; Limite d initial medical examinations are required for respirator usage; Major provisions are fully described under WAC 296 -62-07423; they are outlined here as follows: (A) Eligibility.

The above mentioned summary of the medical surveillance provisions, the summary chart, and tables for the actions triggered at different levels of CdU, CdB and \u00df2 -M (in subsection (5) of this section, Attachment 1) are included only for th e purpose of facilitating understanding of the provisions of WAC 296-62-07423(3) of the final cadmium standard. The summary of the provisions, the summary chart, and the tables do not add to or reduce the requirements in WAC 296 -62-07423(3). Chapter 296 -62 WAC Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 135 (d) Recommendat ions to physicians. It is strongly recommended that patients with tubular proteinuria are counseled on: The hazards of smoking; avoidance of nephrotoxins and certain prescriptions and over -the-counter medications that may exacerbate kidney symptoms; how t o control diabetes and/or blood pressure; proper hydration, diet, and exercise (Ex. 19 -2). A list of prominent or common nephrotoxins is attached. (See subsection (6) of this section, Attachment 2.) DO NOT CHELATE; KNOW WHICH DRUGS ARE NEPHROTOXINS OR ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NEPHRITIS. The gravity of cadmium -induced renal damage is compounded by the fact there is no medical treatment to prevent or reduce the accumulation of cadmium in the kidney (Ex. 8 -619). Dr. Friberg, a leading world expert on cadmium toxicity, indicated in 1992, that there is no form of chelating agent that could be used without substantial risk. He stated that tubular proteinuria has to be treated in the same way as other kidney disorders (Ex. 29). After the results of a workers' biologi cal monitoring or medical examination are received the employer is required to provide an information sheet to the patient, briefly explaining the significance of the results. (See subsection (7) of this section.)

(a) Summary chart: WAC 296 -62-07423(3) Medical surveillance --Categorizing biological monitoring results. Biological monitoring results categories are set forth in Table A for the periods ending December 31, 1998, and for the period beginning Jan uary 1, 1999. The results of the biological monitoring for the initial medical exam and the subsequent exams must determine an employee's biological monitoring result category. (b) Actions triggered by biological monitoring. The actions triggered by biological monitoring for an employee are set forth in Table B. The biological monitoring results for each employee under WAC 296 -62- 07423(3) must determine the actions required for that employee.

(a) The biological monitoring program has been designed for three main purposes: To identify employees at risk of adverse health effects from excess, chronic exposure to cadmium; To prevent cadmium -induced disease(s); and To detect and mini mize existing cadmium -induced disease(s). (b) The levels of cadmium in the urine and blood provide an estimate of the total amount of cadmium in the body. The amount of a specific protein in the urine (beta -2- microglobulin) indicates changes in kidney functio n. All three tests must be evaluated together. A single mildly elevated result may not be important if testing at a later time indicates that the results are normal and the workplace has been evaluated to decrease possible sources of cadmium exposure. T he levels of cadmium or beta -2- microglobulin may change over a period of days to months and the time needed for those changes to occur is different for each worker. (c) If the results for biological monitoring are above specific \"high levels\" (cadmium urine gr eater than 10 micrograms per gram of creatinine \u00b5g/ Cr), cadmium blood greater than 10 micrograms per liter of whole blood (\u00b5g/lwb), or beta -2- microglobulin greater than 1000 micrograms per gram of creatinine (\u00b5g/g Cr), the worker has a much greater chance of developing other kidney diseases. (d) One way to measure for kidney function is by measuring beta -2-microglobulin in the urine. Beta -2-microglobulin is a protein which is normally found in the blood as it is being filtered in the kidney, and the kidney re absorbs or returns almost all of the beta - 2-microglobulin to the blood. A very small amount (less than 300 \u00b5g/g Cr in the urine) of beta -2-microglobulin is not reabsorbed into the blood, but is released in the urine. If cadmium damages the kidney, the am ount of beta -2-microglobulin in the urine increases because the kidney cells are unable to reabsorb the beta -2- microglobulin normally. An increase in the amount of beta -2-microglobulin in the urine is a very early sign of kidney dysfunction. A small incr ease in beta -2- microglobulin in the urine will serve as an early warning sign that the worker may be absorbing cadmium from the air, cigarettes contaminated in the workplace, or eating in areas that are cadmium contaminated. (e) Even if cadmium causes permanen t changes in the kidney's ability to reabsorb beta -2- microglobulin, and the beta -2-microglobulin is above the \"high levels,\" the loss of kidney function may not lead to any serious health problems. Also, renal function naturally declines as people age. T he risk for changes in kidney function for workers who have biological monitoring results between the \"normal values\" and the \"high levels\" is not well known. Some people are more cadmium -tolerant, while others are more cadmium -susceptible. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 141 (f) For anyone w ith even a slight increase of beta -2-microglobulin, cadmium in the urine, or cadmium in the blood, it is very important to protect the kidney from further damage. Kidney damage can come from other sources than excess cadmium - exposure so it is also recomme nded that if a worker's levels are \"high\" they should receive counseling about drinking more water; avoiding cadmium -tainted tobacco and certain medications (nephrotoxins, acetaminophen); controlling diet, vitamin intake, blood pressure and diabetes; etc. WAC 296 -62-07443 Appendix B --Substance technical guidelines for cadmium.

Similar products from other sources can be substituted. (1) Introduction . (a) Scope. This method describes t he collection of airborne elemental cadmium and cadmium compounds on 0.8 \u00b5m mixed cellulose ester membrane filters and their subsequent analysis by either flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) or flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy using a heated graphite furnace atomizer (AAS -HGA). It is applicable for both TWA and action level TWA permissible exposure level (PEL) measurements. The two atomic absorption analytical techniques included in the method do not differentiate between cadmium fume and c admium dust samples. They also do not differentiate between elemental cadmium and its compounds. (b) Principle. Airborne elemental cadmium and cadmium compounds are collected on a 0.8 \u00b5m mixed cellulose ester membrane filter (MCEF). The air filter samples ar e digested with concentrated nitric acid to destroy the organic matrix and dissolve the cadmium analytes. After digestion, a small amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to help dissolve other metals which may be present. The samples are dilut ed to volume with deionized water and then aspirated into the oxidizing air/acetylene flame of an atomic absorption spectrophotometer for analysis of elemental cadmium. If the concentration of cadmium in a sample solution is too low for quantitation by th is flame AAS analytical technique, and the sample is to be averaged with other samples for TWA calculations, aliquots of the sample and a matrix modifier are later injected onto a L'vov platform in a pyrolytically -coated graphite tube of a Zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer/graphite furnace assembly for analysis of elemental cadmium. The matrix modifier is added to stabilize the cadmium metal and minimize sodium chloride as an interference during the high temperature charring step of the analysis subsection (5)(a) and (b) of this section. (c) History. Previously, two OSHA sampling and analytical methods for cadmium were used concurrently WAC 296 -62-07449 (5)(c) and (d). Both of these methods also required 0.8 \u00b5m mixed cellulose ester membrane filters for the collection of air samples. These cadmium air filter samples were analyzed by either flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (subsection (5)(c) of this (ICP -AES) (subsection (5)(d) of this section). Neither of these two analytical methods have adequate sensitivity for measuring workplace exposure to airborne cadmium at the new lower TWA and action level TWA PEL levels when Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 152 consecutive samples are taken on one employee and the sampl e results need to be averaged with other samples to determine a single TWA. The inclusion of two atomic absorption analytical techniques in the new sampling and analysis method for airborne cadmium permits quantitation of sample results over a broad range of exposure levels and sampling periods. The flame AAS analytical technique included in this method is similar to the previous procedure given in the General Metals Method ID -121 (subsection (5)(c) of this section) with some modifications. The sensitiv ity of the AAS -HGA analytical technique included in this method is adequate to measure exposure levels at 1/10 the action level TWA, or lower, when less than full-shift samples need to be averaged together. (d) Properties (subsection (5)(e) of this section). Elemental cadmium is a silver -white, blue -tinged, lustrous metal which is easily cut with a knife. It is slowly oxidized by moist air to form cadmium oxide. It is insoluble in water, but reacts readily with dilute nitric acid. Some of the physical proper ties and other descriptive information of elemental cadmium are given below: CAS No 7440 -43-9 Atomic Number 48 Atomic Symbol Cd Atomic Weight 112.41 Melting Point 321C Boiling Point 765\u00b0C Density 8.65 g/mL (25\u00b0C) The properties of specific cadmium compounds are described in reference subsection (5)(e) of this section. (e) Method performance. A synopsis of method performance is presented below. Further information can be found in subsection (4) of this section. The qualitative and quantitative detection limits for the flame AAS analytical technique are 0.04 \u00b5g (0.004 \u00b5g/mL) and 0.14 \u00b5g (0.014 \u00b5g/mL) cadmium, respectively, for a 10 mL solution volume. These correspond, respectively, to 0.2 \u00b5g/m3 and 0.70 \u00b5g/m3 for a 200 L air volume. The qualitative and quantitative detection limits for the AAS -HGA analytical technique are 0.44 ng (0.044 ng/mL) and 1.5 ng (0.15 ng/mL) cadmium, respectively, for a 10 mL solution volume. These correspond, respectively, to 0.007 \u00b5g/m3 and 0.025 \u00b5g/m3 for a 60 L air volume. The average recovery by the flame AAS analytical technique of 17 spiked MCEF samples containing cadmium in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 times the TWA target concentration of 5 \u00b5g/m3 (assuming a 400 L air volume) was 104.0% with a pooled coefficient of variation (CV 1) of 0.010. The flame analytical technique exhibited a positive bias of +4.0% for the validated concentration range. The overall analytical error (OAE) for the flame AAS analytical technique was \u00b16.0%. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 153 The average recovery by the AAS -HGA analytica l technique of 18 spiked MCEF samples containing cadmium in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 times the action level TWA target concentration of 2.5 \u00b5g/m3 (assuming a 60 L air volume) was 94.2% with a pooled coefficient of variation (CV 1) of 0.043. The AAS -HGA analytical technique exhibited a negative bias of -5.8% for the validated concentration range. The overall analytical error (OAE) for the AAS -HGA analytical technique was \u00b114.2%. Sensitivity in flame atomic absorption is defined as the characteristic concentr ation of an element required to produce a signal of 1% absorbance (0.0044 absorbance units). Sensitivity values are listed for each element by the atomic absorption spectrophotometer manufacturer and have proved to be a very valuable diagnostic tool to de termine if instrumental parameters are optimized and if the instrument is performing up to specification. The sensitivity of the spectrophotometer used in the validation of the flame AAS analytical technique agreed with the manufacturer specifications (su bsection (5)(f) of this section); the 2 \u00b5g/mL cadmium standard gave an absorbance reading of 0.350 abs. units. Sensitivity in graphite furnace atomic absorption is defined in terms of the characteristic mass, the number of picograms required to give an int egrated absorbance value of 0.0044 absorbance -second (subsection (5)(g) of this section). Data suggests that under stabilized temperature platform furnace (STPF) conditions (see (f)(ii) of this subsection), characteristic mass values are transferable betw een properly functioning instruments to an accuracy of about twenty percent (subsection (5)(b) of this section). The characteristic mass for STPF analysis of cadmium with Zeeman background correction listed by the manufacturer of the instrument used in th e validation of the AAS -HGA analytical technique was 0.35 pg. The experimental characteristic mass value observed during the determination of the working range and detection limits of the AAS -HGA analytical technique was 0.41 pg. (f) Interferences. High conce ntrations of silicate interfere in determining cadmium by flame AAS (subsection (5)(f) of this section). However, silicates are not significantly soluble in the acid matrix used to prepare the samples. Interferences, such as background absorption, are red uced to a minimum in the AAS -HGA analytical technique by taking full advantage of the stabilized temperature platform furnace (STPF) concept. STPF includes all of the following parameters (subsection (5)(b) of this section): (A) Integrated absorbance; (B) Fast i nstrument electronics and sampling frequency; (C) Background correction; (D) Maximum power heating; (E) Atomization off the L'vov platform in a pyrolytically coated graphite tube; Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 154 (F) Gas stop during atomization; (G) Use of matrix modifiers. (g) Toxicology (subsection (5)(n) o f this section). Information listed within this section is synopsis of current knowledge of the physiological effects of cadmium and is not intended to be used as the basis for WISHA policy. IARC classifies cadmium and certain of its compounds as Group 2A carcinogens (probably carcinogenic to humans). Cadmium fume is intensely irritating to the respiratory tract. Workplace exposure to cadmium can cause both chronic and acute effects. Acute effects include tracheobronchitis, pneumonitis, and pulmonary ed ema. Chronic effects include anemia, rhinitis/anosmia, pulmonary emphysema, proteinuria and lung cancer. The primary target organs for chronic disease are the kidneys (noncarcinogenic) and the lungs (carcinogenic). (2) Sampling . (a) Apparatus. Filter cassette un it for air sampling: A 37 -mm diameter mixed cellulose ester membrane filter with a pore size of 0.8 \u00b5m contained in a 37 -mm polystyrene two- or three -piece cassette filter holder (part no.

A calibrated personal sampling pump whose flow is determined to an accuracy of \u00b15% at the recommended flow rate with the filter cassette unit in line. (b) Procedur e Attach the prepared cassette to the calibrated sampling pump (the backup pad should face the pump) using flexible tubing. Place the sampling device on the employee such that air is sampled from the breathing zone. Collect air samples at a flow rate of 2 .0 L/min. If the filter does not become overloaded, a full -shift (at least seven hours) sample is strongly recommended for TWA and action level TWA measurements with a maximum air volume of 960 L. If overloading occurs, collect consecutive air samples fo r shorter sampling periods to cover the full workshift. Replace the end plugs into the filter cassettes immediately after sampling. Record the sampling conditions. Securely wrap each sample filter cassette end -to-end with a sample seal. Submit at least on e blank sample. With each set of air samples. The blank sample should be handled the same as the other samples except that no air is drawn through it. Ship the samples to the laboratory for analysis as soon as possible in a suitable container designed to prevent damage in transit.

Prepare monthly. (i) Sample preparation. Carefully transfer each sample filter with forceps from its filter cassette unit to a clean, separate 125 -mL Phillips beaker along with any loose dust found in the cassette. Label each Phillips beaker with the appropriate sample number. Digest the sample by adding 5 mL of concentrated nitric acid (HNO 3) to each Phillips beaker containing an air filter sample. Place the Phillips beakers on a hot plate in an exhaust hood and heat the samples until approximately 0.5 mL remains. The sample solution in each Phillips beaker should become clear. If it is not clear, digest the sample with another portion of concentrated nitric acid. After completing the HNO 3 digestion and cooling the samples, add 40 \u00b5L (2 drops) of concentrated HCl to each air sample solution and then swirl the contents. Carefully add about 5 mL of deionized water by pouring it down the inside of each beaker.

(j) Flame AAS analysis. Analyze all of the air samples for their cadmium content by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS ) according to the instructions given below. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 159 Set up the atomic absorption spectrophotometer for the air/acetylene flame analysis of cadmium according to the SOP (subsection (5)(h) of this section) or the manufacturer's operational instructions. For the source lamp, use the cadmium hollow cathode or electrodeless discharge lamp operated at the manufacturer's recommended rating for continuous operation. Allow the lamp to warm up ten to twenty minutes or until the energy output stabilizes. Optimize condit ions such as lamp position, burner head alignment, fuel and oxidant flow rates, etc. See the SOP or specific instrument manuals for details. Instrumental parameters for the Perkin -Elmer Model 603 used in the validation of this method are given in subsect ion (6) of this section. Aspirate and measure the absorbance of a standard solution of cadmium. The standard concentration should be within the linear range. For the instrumentation used in the validation of this method a 2 \u00b5g/mL cadmium standard gives a net absorbance reading of about 0.350 abs. units (see subsection (1)(e)(v) of this section) when the instrument and the source lamp are performing to manufacturer specifications. To increase instrument response, scale expand the absorbance reading of the aspirated 2 \u00b5g/mL working standard approximately four times. Increase the integration time to at least three seconds to reduce signal noise. Autozero the instrument while aspirating a deionized water blank. Monitor the variation in the baseline absorbanc e reading (baseline noise) for a few minutes to insure that the instrument, source lamp and associated equipment are in good operating condition. Aspirate the working standards and samples directly into the flame and record their absorbance readings. Aspi rate the deionized water blank immediately after every standard or sample to correct for and monitor any baseline drift and noise. Record the baseline absorbance reading of each deionized water blank. Label each standard and sample reading and its accomp anying baseline reading. It is recommended that the entire series of working standards be analyzed at the beginning and end of the analysis of a set of samples to establish a concentration -response curve, ensure that the standard readings agree with each other and are reproducible. Also, analyze a working standard after every five or six samples to monitor the performance of the spectrophotometer. Standard readings should agree within \u00b110 to 15% of the readings obtained at the beginning of the analysis. Bracket the sample readings with standards during the analysis. If the absorbance reading of a sample is above the absorbance reading of the highest working standard, dilute the sample with diluting solution and reanalyze. Use the appropriate dilution fac tor in the calculations. Repeat the analysis of approximately ten percent of the samples for a check of precision.

Record the final i nstrument settings at the end of the analysis. Date and label the output. (k) AAS -HGA analysis. Initially analyze all of the air samples for their cadmium content by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) according to the instructions given in (j) of this subsection. If the concentration of cadmium in a sample solution is less than three times the quantitative detection limit (0.04 \u00b5g/mL (40 ng/mL) for the instrumentation used in the validation) and the sample results are to be averaged with other samples for TWA calculations, proceed with the AAS -HGA analysis of the sample as described below. Set up the atomic absorption spectrophotometer and HGA for flameless atomic absorption analysis of cadmium according to the SOP (subsection (5)(i) of this section) o r the manufacturer's operational instructions and allow the instrument to stabilize. The graphite furnace atomizer is equipped with a pyrolytically coated graphite tube containing a pyrolytic platform. For the source lamp, use a cadmium hollow cathode or electrodeless discharge lamp operated at the manufacturer's recommended setting for graphite furnace operation. The Zeeman background corrector and EDL are recommended for use with the L'vov platform. Instrumental parameters for the Perkin -Elmer Model 5 100 spectrophotometer and Zeeman HGA -600 graphite furnace used in the validation of this method are given in subsection (7) of this section. Optimize the energy reading of the spectrophotometer at 228.8 nm by adjusting the lamp position and the wavelength according to the manufacturer's instructions. Set up the autosampler to inject a 5 -\u00b5L aliquot of the working standard, sample or reagent blank solution onto the L'vov platform along with a 10 -\u00b5L overlay of the matrix modifier. Analyze the reagent blank (di luting solution, (e)(vi) of this subsection) and then autozero the instrument before starting the analysis of a set of samples. It is recommended that the reagent blank be analyzed several times during the analysis to assure the integrated absorbance (pea k area) reading remains at or near zero. Analyze a working standard approximately midway in the linear portion of the working standard range two or three times to check for reproducibility and sensitivity (see subsection (1)(e)(v) and (vi) of this section) before starting the analysis of samples. Calculate the experimental characteristic mass value from the average integrated absorbance reading and injection volume of the analyzed working standard. Compare this value to the manufacturer's suggested value as a check of proper instrument operation. Analyze the reagent blank, working standard, and sample solutions. Record and label the peak area (abs -sec) readings and the peak and background peak profiles on the printer/plotter. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 161 It is recommended the entir e series of working standards be analyzed at the beginning and end of the analysis of a set of samples. Establish a concentration -response curve and ensure standard readings agree with each other and are reproducible. Also, analyze a working standard aft er every five or six samples to monitor the performance of the system. Standard readings should agree within \u00b115% of the readings obtained at the beginning of the analysis. Bracket the sample readings with standards during the analysis. If the peak area reading of a sample is above the peak area reading of the highest working standard, dilute the sample with the diluting solution and reanalyze. Use the appropriate dilution factor in the calculations. Repeat the analysis of approximately ten percent of th e samples for a check of precision. If possible, analyze quality control samples from an independent source as a check of analytical recovery and precision. Record the final instrument settings at the end of the analysis. Date and label the output. (l) Calcul ations. Note : Standards used for HGA analysis are in ng/mL. Total amounts of cadmium from calculations will be in ng (not \u00b5g) unless a prior conversion is made. Correct for baseline drift and noise in flame AAS analysis by subtracting each baseline absor bance reading from its corresponding working standard or sample absorbance reading to obtain the net absorbance reading for each standard and sample. Use a least squares regression program to plot a concentration -response curve of net absorbance reading (o r peak area for HGA analysis) versus concentration (\u00b5g/mL or ng/mL) of cadmium in each working standard. Determine the concentration (\u00b5g/mL or ng/mL) of cadmium in each sample from the resulting concentration -response curve. If the concentration of cadmiu m in a sample solution is less than three times the quantitative detection limit (0.04 \u00b5g/mL (40 ng/mL) for the instrumentation used in the validation of the method) and if consecutive samples were taken on one employee and the sample results are to be ave raged with other samples to determine a single TWA, reanalyze the sample by AAS -HGA as described in (k) of this subsection and report the AAS -HGA analytical results.

The purpose of this evaluation is to determine the analytical method recovery, working standard range, and qualitative and quantitative d etection limits of the two atomic absorption analytical techniques included in this method. The evaluation consisted of the following experiments: (A) An analysis of twenty -four samples (six samples each at 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 times the TWA -PEL) for the analyti cal method recovery study of the flame AAS analytical technique. (B) An analysis of eighteen samples (six samples each at 0.5, 1 and 2 times the action level TWA -PEL) for the analytical method recovery study of the AAS -HGA analytical technique. (C) Multiple analys es of the reagent blank and a series of standard solutions to determine the working standard range and the qualitative and quantitative detection limits for both atomic absorption analytical techniques. The analytical method recovery results at all test le vels were calculated from concentration -response curves and statistically examined for outliers at the ninety -nine percent confidence level. Possible outliers were determined using the Treatment of Outliers test (subsection (5)(j) of this section). In ad dition, the sample results of the two analytical techniques, at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 times their target concentrations, were tested for homogeneity of variances also at the ninety -nine percent confidence level. Homogeneity of the coefficients of variation was determined using the Bartlett's test (subsection (5)(k) of this section). The overall analytical error (OAE) at the ninety -five percent confidence level was calculated using the equation (subsection (5)(l) of this section): OAE = 1 (pooled))(100%)] Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 163 A derivation of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) detection limit equation (subsection (5)(m) of this section) was used to determine the qualitative an d quantitative detection limits for both atomic absorption analytical techniques: Cld = k(sd)/m (Equation 1) Where: Cld = the smallest reliable detectable concentration an analytical instrument can determine at a given confidence level. k = 3 for the Quali tative Detection Limit at the 99.86% Confidence Level k = 10 for the Quantitative Detection Limit at the 99.99% Confidence Level. sd = standard deviation of the reagent blank (Rbl) readings. m = analytical sensitivity or slope as calculated by linear regre ssion. Collection efficiencies of metallic fume and dust atmospheres on 0.8 -\u00b5m mixed cellulose ester membrane filters are well documented and have been shown to be excellent (subsection (5)(k) of this section). Since elemental cadmium and the cadmium comp onent of cadmium compounds are nonvolatile, stability studies of cadmium spiked MCEF samples were not performed. (b) Equipment. A Perkin -Elmer (PE) Model 603 spectrophotometer equipped with a manual gas control system, a stainless steel nebulizer, a burner mix ing chamber, a flow spoiler and a 10 cm (one -slot) burner head was used in the experimental validation of the flame AAS analytical technique. A PE cadmium hollow cathode lamp, operated at the manufacturer's recommended current setting for continuous opera tion (4 mA), was used as the source lamp. Instrument parameters are listed in subsection (6) of this section. A PE Model 5100 spectrophotometer, HGA autosampler were used in the experimental validation of the AAS -HGA analytical technique. The spectrophotometer was equipped with a PE Series 7700 professional computer and Model PR -310 printer. A PE System 2 cadmium electrodeless discharge lamp, operated at the manufacturer's recommended current setting for modulated operation (170 mA), was used as the source lamp. Instrument parameters are listed in subsection (7) of this section. (c) Reagents. J.T. Baker Chem. Co. (Analyzed grade) concentrated nitric acid, 69.0 -71.0%, and concentrated hydrochloric acid, 36.5 -38.0%, were used to prepare the samples and standards. Ammonium phosphate, monobasic, NH 4H2PO 4 and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, Mg(NO 3)2.6 H 2O both manufactured by the Mallinckrodt Chem. Co., were used to prepare the matrix modifier for AAS -HGA analysis.

Dilute stock solutions: Prepared 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 \u00b5g/mL cadmium standard stock solutions by making appropriate serial dilutions of a commercially available 1,000 \u00b5g/mL cadmium standard stock solution (RICCA Chemical Co., Lot# A102) with the diluting solution (4% HNO 3, 0.4% HCl). Analyzed standards: Prepared cadmium standards in the range of 0.001 to 2.0 \u00b5g/mL by pipetting 2 to 10 mL of the appropriate dilute cadmium stock solution into a 100 -mL volum etric flask and diluting to volume with the diluting solution. (See subsection (3)(g)(ii) of this section). (e) Standard preparation for AAS -HGA analysis. Dilute stock solutions: Prepared 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 ng/mL cadmium standard stock solutions by making appropriate serial dilutions of a commercially available 1,000 \u00b5g/mL cadmium standard stock solution (J.T. Baker Chemical Co., HCl). Analyzed standards: Prepared cadmium standards in the range of 0.1 to 40 ng/mL by pipetting 2 to 10 mL of the appropriate dilute cadmium stock solution into a 100 -mL volumetric flask and diluting to volume with the diluting solution. (See subsection (3)(h)(ii) of this section). (f) Detection limits and stand ard working range for flame AAS analysis. Analyzed the reagent blank solution and the entire series of cadmium standards in the range of 0.001 to 2.0 \u00b5g/mL three to six times according to the instructions given in subsection (3)(j) of this section. The di luting solution (4% HNO 3, 0.4% HCl) was used as the reagent blank. The integration time on the PE 603 spectrophotometer was set to 3.0 seconds and a four -fold expansion of the absorbance reading of the 2.0 \u00b5g/mL cadmium standard was made prior to analysis . The 2.0 \u00b5g/mL standard gave a net absorbance reading of 0.350 abs. units prior to expansion in agreement with the manufacturer's specifications (subsection (5)(f) of this section). The net absorbance readings of the reagent blank and the low concentrati on Cd standards from 0.001 to 0.1 \u00b5g/mL and the statistical analysis of the results are shown in Table 1. The standard deviation, sd, of the six net absorbance readings of the reagent blank is 1.05 abs. units. The slope, m, as calculated by a linear regr ession plot of the net absorbance readings (shown in Table 2) of the 0.02 to 1.0 \u00b5g/mL cadmium standards versus their concentration is 772.7 abs. units/(\u00b5g/mL). If these values for sd and the slope, m, are used in Eqn. 1 ((a)(ii) of this subsection), the q ualitative and quantitative detection limits as determined by the IUPAC Method are: Cld = (3)(1.05 abs. units)/(772.7 abs. the detection units)/(772.7 abs. units/(\u00b5g/mL)) = 0.014 quantitative detection limit. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 165 The qualitative and quantitative detection limits for the flame AAS analytical technique are 0.041 \u00b5g and 0.14 \u00b5g cadmium, respectively, for a 10 mL solution volume. These correspond, respectively, to 0.2 \u00b5g/m3 and 0.70 \u00b5g/m3 for a 200 L air volume. The recommended Cd standard working range for flame AAS analysis is 0.02 to 2.0 \u00b5g/mL. The net absorbance readings of the reagent blank and the recommended working range standards and the statistical analysis of the results are shown in Table 2. The standard of lowest concentration in the working range, 0.02 \u00b5g/mL, is slightly greater than the calculated quantitative detection limit, 0.014 \u00b5g/mL. The standard of highest concentration in the working range, 2.0 \u00b5g/mL, is at the upper end of the linear working range suggested by the manufacturer (subsection (5)(f) of this section). Although the standard net absorbance readings are not strictly linear at concentrations above 0.5 \u00b5g/mL, the deviation from linearity is on ly about ten percent at the upper end of the recommended standard working range. The deviation from linearity is probably caused by the four -fold expansion of the signal suggested in the method. As shown in Table 2, the precision of the standard net abso rbance readings are excellent throughout the recommended working range; the relative standard deviations of the readings range from 0.009 to 0.064. (g) Detection limits and standard working range for AAS -HGA analysis. Analyzed the reagent blank solution and th e entire series of cadmium standards in the range of 0.1 to 40 ng/mL according to the instructions given in subsection (3)(k) of this section. The diluting solution (4% HNO 3, 0.4% HCl) was used as the reagent blank. A fresh aliquot of the reagent blank a nd of each standard was used for every analysis. The experimental characteristic mass value was 0.41 pg, calculated from the average peak area (abs -sec) reading of the 5 ng/mL standard which is approximately midway in the linear portion of the working standard range. This agreed within twenty percent with the characteristic mass value, 0.35 pg, listed by the manufacturer of the instrument (subsection (5)(b) of this section). The peak area (abs -sec) readings of the reagent blank and the low concentration Cd standards from 0.1 to 2.0 ng/mL and statistical analysis of the results are shown in Table 3. Five of the reagent blank peak area readings were zero and the sixth reading was 1 and was an outlier. The near lack of a blank signal does not satisfy a stri ct interpretation of the IUPAC method for determining the detection limits. Therefore, the standard deviation of the six peak area readings of the 0.2 ng/mL cadmium standard, 0.75 abs -sec, was used to calculate the detection limits by the IUPAC method. T he slope, m, as calculated by a linear regression plot of the peak area (abs -sec) readings (shown in Table 4) of the 0.2 to 10 ng/mL cadmium standards versus their concentration is 51.5 abs - sec/(ng/mL). If 0.75 abs -sec (sd) and 51.5 abs -sec/(ng/mL) (m) are used in Eqn. 1 ((a)(iii) of this subsection), the qualitative and quantitative detection limits as determined by the IUPAC method are: Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 166 abs -sec)/(51.5 abs -sec/(ng/mL) = 0.044 ng/mL the detection limit. Cld = (10)(0.75 abs -sec)/(51.5 abs -sec/(ng/mL) = 0.15 ng/mL for the quantitative detection limit. The qualitative and quantitative detection limits for the AAS -HGA analytical technique are 0.44 ng and 1.5 ng cadmium, respectively, for a 10 mL solution volume. These correspon d, respectively, to 0.007 \u00b5g/m3 and 0.025 \u00b5g/m3 for a 60 L air volume. The peak area (abs -sec) readings of the Cd standards from 0.2 to 40 ng/mL and the statistical analysis of the results are given in Table 4. The recommended standard working range for A AS-HGA analysis is 0.2 to 20 ng/mL. The standard of lowest concentration in the recommended working range is slightly greater than the calculated quantitative detection limit, 0.15 ng/mL. The deviation from linearity of the peak area readings of the 20 n g/mL standard, the highest concentration standard in the recommended working range, is approximately ten percent. The deviations from linearity of the peak area readings of the thirty and forty ng/mL standards are significantly greater than ten percent. As shown in Table 4, the precision of the peak area readings are satisfactory throughout the recommended working range; the relative standard deviations of the readings range from 0.025 to 0.083. (h) Analytical method recovery for flame AAS analysis. Four sets of spiked MCEF samples were prepared by injecting 20 \u00b5L of 10, 50, 100 and 200 \u00b5g/mL dilute cadmium stock solutions on 37 mm diameter filters (part No. AAWP 037 00, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) with a calibrated micropipet. The dilute stock solutions wer e prepared by making appropriate serial dilutions of a commercially available 1,000 \u00b5g/mL cadmium standard stock solution (RICCA Chemical Co., Lot # A102) with the diluting solution (4% HNO 3, 0.4% HCl). Each set contained six samples and a sample blank. The amount of cadmium in the prepared sets were equivalent to 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 times the TWA PEL target concentration of 5 \u00b5g/m3 for a 400 L air volume. The air -dried spiked filters were digested and analyzed for their cadmium content by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) following the procedure described in subsection (3) of this section. The 0.02 to 2.0 \u00b5g/mL cadmium standards (the suggested working range) were used in the analysis of the spiked filters. The results of the analysis are given in Table 5. One result at 0.5 times the TWA PEL target concentration was an outlier and was excluded from statistical analysis. Experimental justification for rejecting it is that the outlier value was probably due to a spiking error. The coefficients of variation for the three test levels at 0.5 to 2.0 times the TWA PEL target concentration passed the Bartlett's test and were pooled. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 167 The average recovery of the six spiked filter samples at 0.1 times the TWA PEL target concentration was 118.2% with a coefficient of variation (CV 1) of 0.128. The average recovery of the spiked filter samples in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 times the TWA target concentration was 104.0% with a pooled coefficient of variation (CV 1) of 0.010. Consequently, the analytical bias f ound in these spiked sample results over the tested concentration range was +4.0% and the OAE was \u00b16.0%. (i) Analytical method recovery for AAS -HGA analysis. Three sets of spiked MCEF samples were prepared by injecting 15 \u00b5L of 5, 10 and 20 \u00b5g/mL dilute cadmiu m stock solutions on 37 mm diameter filters (part no. AAWP 037 00, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) with a calibrated micropipet. The dilute stock solutions were prepared by making appropriate serial dilutions of a commercially available certified 1,000 \u00b5g/m L cadmium standard stock solution (Fisher Chemical Co., Lot# 913438 -24) with the diluting solution (4% HNO 3, 0.4% HCl). Each set contained six samples and a sample blank. The amount of cadmium in the prepared sets were equivalent to 0.5, 1 and 2 times th e action level TWA target concentration of 2.5 \u00b5g/m3 for a 60 L air volume. The air -dried spiked filters were digested and analyzed for their cadmium content by flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy using a heated graphite furnace atomizer following the procedure described in subsection (3) of this section. A five -fold dilution of the spiked filter samples at 2 times the action level TWA was made prior to their analysis. The 0.05 to 20 ng/mL cadmium standards were used in the analysis of the spiked fil ters. The results of the analysis are given in Table 6. There were no outliers. The coefficients of variation for the three test levels at 0.5 to 2.0 times the action level TWA PEL passed the Bartlett's test and were pooled. The average recovery of the spiked filter samples was 94.2% with a pooled coefficient of variation (CV 1) of 0.043. Consequently, the analytical bias was -5.8% and the OAE was \u00b114.2%. (j) Conclusions. The experiments performed in this evaluation show the two atomic absorption analytical techniques included in this method to be precise and accurate and have sufficient sensitivity to measure airborne cadmium over a broad range of exposure levels and sampling periods.

Appendix F is not included in this standard due to limited employer/employee application. The following is a brief synopsis of the content of Appendix F to 29 CFR 1910.1027, Cadmium. (1) The medical monitoring program for cadmium re quires that blood and urine samples must be collected at defined intervals from workers by physicians responsible for medical monitoring. These samples are sent to commercial laboratories that perform the required analyses and report results of these anal yses to the responsible physicians. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of these laboratory analyses, the laboratories to which samples are submitted should participate in an ongoing and efficacious proficiency testing program. (2) This nonmandatory protoc ol is intended to provide guidelines and recommendations for physicians and laboratories to improve the accuracy and reliability of the procedures used to analyze the biological samples collected as part of the medical monitoring program for cadmium. This protocol provides procedures for characterizing and maintaining the quality of analytic results derived from the analyses of cadmium in blood (CDB), cadmium in urine (CDU), and beta -2-microglobulin in urine (B2MU) by commercial laboratories. Laboratories conforming to the provisions of this nonmandatory protocol shall be known as \"participating laboratories.\" Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 176 (3) This protocol describes procedures that may be used by the responsible physicians to identify laboratories most likely to be proficient in the ana lysis of samples used in the biological monitoring of cadmium. It also provides procedures for record keeping and reporting by laboratories participating in proficiency testing programs, and recommendations to assist these physicians in interpreting analy tical results determined by participating laboratories.

(1) Scope and application . (a) This section applies to all occupational exposures to 1,3 -Butadiene (BD), Chemical Abstracts Service Registry No. 106-99-0, except as provided in (b) of this subsection. (b) Except for the recordkeeping provisions in subsection (13)(a) of this section, this section does not apply to the processing, use, or handling of products containing BD or to other work operations an d streams in which BD is present where objective data are reasonably relied upon that demonstrate the work operation or the product or the group of products or operations to which it belongs may not reasonably be foreseen to release BD in airborne concentr ations at or above the action level or in excess of the STEL under the expected conditions of processing, use, or handling that will cause the greatest possible release or in any plausible accident. This section also does not apply to work operations, prod ucts or streams where the only exposure to BD is from liquid mixtures containing 0.1% or less of BD by volume or the vapors released from such liquids, unless objective data become available that show that airborne concentrations generated by such mixtures can exceed the action level or STEL under reasonably predictable conditions of processing, use or handling that will cause the greatest possible release. Except for labeling requirements and requirements for emergency response, this section does not apply to the storage, transportation, distribution or sale of BD or liquid mixtures in intact containers or in transportation pipelines sealed in such a manner as to fully contain BD vapors or liquids. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 177 (c) Where products or processes containing BD are exempted un der (b) of this subsection, the employer must maintain records of the objective data supporting that exemption and the basis for the employer's reliance on the data, as provided in subsection (13)(a) of this section.

Regulated area . Any are a where airborne concentrations of BD exceed or can reasonably be expected to exceed the 8 -hour time -weighted average (8 -hr TWA) exposure of 1 ppm or the short -term exposure limit (STEL) of 5 ppm for 15 minutes. This section . This 1,3 -butadiene standard. Chapter 296 -62 WAC General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 178 (3) Permissible exposure limits (PELs) . (a) Time -weighted average (TWA) limit. The employer must ensure that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of BD in excess of one part BD per million parts of air (ppm) measured as an eight (8) -hour time -weighted average. (b) Short -term exposure limit (STEL). The employer must ensure that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of BD in excess of five parts of BD per million parts of air (5 ppm) as determined over a sampling period of fifteen minutes . (4) Exposure monitoring . (a) General. (i) Determinations of employee exposure must be made from breathing zone air samples that are representative of the 8 -hour TWA and 15 -minute short -term exposures of each employee. (ii) Representative 8 -hour TWA employee exposure must be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing full -shift exposure for each shift and for each job classification in each work area. (iii) Representative 15 -minute short -term employee exposures must be determined on the basis of one or more samp les representing 15 -minute exposures associated with operations that are most likely to produce exposures above the STEL for each shift and for each job classification in each work area. (iv) Except for the initial monitoring required under (b) of this subsecti on, where the employer can document that exposure levels are equivalent for similar operations on different work shifts, the employer need only determine representative employee exposure for that operation from the shift during which the highest exposure i s expected. (b) Initial monitoring. (i) Each employer who has a workplace or work operation covered by this section, must perform initial monitoring to determine accurately the airborne concentrations of BD to which employees may be exposed, or must rely on object ive data pursuant to subsection (1)(b)(i) of this section to fulfill this requirement. The initial monitoring required under this subitem must be completed within 60 days of the introduction of BD into the workplace. (ii) Where the employer has monitored withi n two years prior to the effective date of this section and the monitoring satisfies all other requirements of this section, the employer may rely on such earlier monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of (b)(i) of this subsection, provided that th e conditions under which the initial monitoring was conducted have not changed in a manner that may result in new or additional exposures. (c) Periodic monitoring and its frequency. (i) If the initial monitoring required by (b) of this subsection reveals employee exposure to be at or above the action level but at or below both the 8 -hour TWA limit and the STEL, the employer must repeat the representative monitoring required by (a) of this subsection every twelve months. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 179 (ii) If the initial monitoring required by (b) o f this subsection reveals employee exposure to be above the 8 -hour TWA limit, the employer must repeat the representative monitoring required by (a)(ii) of this subsection at least every three months until the employer has collected two samples per quarter (each at least 7 days apart) within a two -year period, after which such monitoring must occur at least every six months. (iii) If the initial monitoring required by (b) of this subsection reveals employee exposure to be above the STEL, the employer must repeat the representative monitoring required by (a)(iii) of this subsection at least every three months until the employer has collected two samples per quarter (each at least 7 days apart) within a two -year period, after which such monitoring must occur at least every six months. (iv) The employer may alter the monitoring schedule from every six months to annually for any required representative monitoring for which two consecutive measurements taken at least 7 days apart indicate that employee exposure has decreased to or below the 8 -hour TWA, but is at or above the action level. (d) Termination of monitoring. (i) If the initial monitoring required by (b) of this subsection reveals employee exposure to be below the action level and at or below the STEL, the employer may disc ontinue the monitoring for employees whose exposures are represented by the initial monitoring. (ii) If the periodic monitoring required by (c) of this subsection reveals that employee exposures, as indicated by at least two consecutive measurements taken at le ast 7 days apart, are below the action level and at or below the STEL, the employer may discontinue the monitoring for those employees who are represented by such monitoring. (e) Additional monitoring. (i) The employer must institute the exposure monitoring requir ed under subsection (4) of this section whenever there has been a change in the production, process, control equipment, personnel or work -practices that may result in new or additional exposures to BD or when the employer has any reason to suspect that a c hange may result in new or additional exposures. (ii) Whenever spills, leaks, ruptures or other breakdowns occur that may lead to employee exposure above the 8 -hr TWA limit or above the STEL, the employer must monitor (using leak source, such as direct reading instruments, area or personal monitoring), after the cleanup of the spill or repair of the leak, rupture or other breakdown, to ensure that exposures have returned to the level that existed prior to the incident. (f) Accuracy of monitoring. Monitoring must be accurate, at a confidence level of 95 percent, to within plus or minus 25 percent for airborne concentrations of BD at or above the 1 ppm TWA limit and to within plus or minus 35 percent for airborne concentrations of BD at or above the action level of 0.5 ppm and below the 1 ppm TWA limit.

(b) The requirements of subsections (3) through (13) of this section, including feasible work -practice controls but not including engineering controls specified in subsection (6)(a) of this section, must be complied with immediately. (15) Appendices . Appendices A, B, C, D, and F to this section are informational and are not intended to create any additional obl igations not otherwise imposed or to detract from any existing obligations. Appendix A. Substance Safety Data Sheet For 1,3 -Butadiene (Non (1) Substance (c) BD can be found as a gas or liquid. (d) BD is used in production of styrene -butadiene rubber and polybutadiene rubber for the tire industry. Other uses include copolymer latexes for carpet backing and paper coating, as well as resins and polymers for pipes and automobile and appliance parts. It is also used as an intermediate in the production of such chemicals as fungicides. (e) Appearance and odor: BD is a colorless, non -corrosive, flammable gas with a mild aromatic odor at standard ambient temperature and pressure. (f) Permissible exposure: Exposure may not exceed 1 part BD per million parts of air averaged over the 8 -hour workday, nor may short -term exposu re exceed 5 parts of BD per million parts of air averaged over any 15 -minute period in the 8 -hour workday. (2) Health Hazard Data . (a) BD can affect the body if the gas is inhaled or if the liquid form, which is very cold (cryogenic), comes in contact with the eye s or skin. (b) Effects of overexposure: Breathing very high levels of BD for a short time can cause central nervous system effects, blurred vision, nausea, fatigue, headache, decreased blood pressure and pulse rate, and unconsciousness. There are no recorded cases of accidental exposures at high levels that have caused death in humans, but this could occur. Breathing lower levels of BD may cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. Skin contact with liquefied BD can cause irritation and frostbite. (c) Long -term (chronic) exposure: BD has been found to be a potent carcinogen in rodents, inducing neoplastic lesions at multiple target sites in mice and rats. A recent study of BD -exposed workers showed that exposed workers have an increased risk of developing leukemia. The risk of leukemia increases with increased exposure to BD. OSHA has concluded that there is strong evidence that workplace exposure to BD poses an increased risk of death from cancers of the lymphohematopoietic system. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 192 (d) Reporting signs and s ymptoms: You should inform your supervisor if you develop any of these signs or symptoms and suspect that they are caused by exposure to BD. (3) Emergency First Aid Procedures . In the event of an emergency, follow the emergency plan and procedures designated for your work area. If you have been trained in first aid procedures, provide the necessary first aid measures. If necessary, call for additional assistance from co -workers and emergency medical personnel. (a) Eye and Skin Exposures: If there is a potential that liquefied BD can come in contact with eye or skin, face shields and skin protective equipment must be provided and used. If liquefied BD comes in contact with the eye, immediately flush the eyes with large amounts of water, occasionally lifting the lower and the upper lids. Flush repeatedly. Get medical attention immediately. Contact lenses should not be worn when working with this chemical. In the event of skin contact, which can cause frostbite, remove any contaminated clothing and flush the af fected area repeatedly with large amounts of tepid water. (b) Breathing: If a person breathes in large amounts of BD, move the exposed person to fresh air at once. If breathing has stopped, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if you have been trained i n this procedure. Keep the affected person warm and at rest. Get medical attention immediately. (c) Rescue: Move the affected person from the hazardous exposure. If the exposed person has been overcome, call for help and begin emergency rescue procedures. Use extreme caution so that you do not become a casualty. Understand the plant's emergency rescue procedures and know the locations of rescue equipment before the need arises. (4) Respirators and Protective Clothing . Respirators: Good industrial hygiene pra ctices recommend that engineering and work -practice controls be used to reduce environmental concentrations to the permissible exposure level. However, there are some exceptions where respirators may be used to control exposure. Respirators may be used w hen engineering and work -practice controls are not technically feasible, when such controls are in the process of being installed, or when these controls fail and need to be supplemented or during brief, non -routine, intermittent exposure. Respirators may also be used in situations involving non -routine work operations which are performed infrequently and in which exposures are limited in duration, and in emergency situations. In some instances cartridge respirator use is allowed, but only with strict tim e constraints. For example, at exposure below 5 ppm BD, a cartridge (or canister) respirator, either full or half face, may be used, but the cartridge must be replaced at least every 4 hours, and it must be replaced every 3 hours when the exposure is betw een 5 and 10 ppm. If the use of respirators is necessary, the only respirators permitted are those that have been approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In addition to respirator selection, a complete respiratory pr otection program must be instituted which includes regular training, maintenance, fit testing, inspection, cleaning, and evaluation of respirators. If you can smell BD while wearing a respirator, proceed immediately to fresh air, and change cartridge (or canister) before re-entering an area where there is BD exposure. If you experience difficulty in breathing while wearing a respirator, tell your supervisor. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 193 (a) Protective Clothing: Employees should be provided with and required to use impervious clothing, g loves, face shields (eight -inch minimum), and other appropriate protective clothing necessary to prevent the skin from becoming frozen by contact with liquefied BD (or a vessel containing liquid BD). Employees should be provided with and required to use sp lash-proof safety goggles where liquefied BD may contact the eyes. (5) Precautions for Safe Use, Handling, and Storage . (a) Fire and Explosion Hazards: BD is a flammable gas and can easily form explosive mixtures in air. It has a lower explosive limit of 2%, and an upper explosive limit of 11.5%. It has an autoignition temperature of 420 deg. C (788 deg. F). Its vapor is heavier than air (vapor density, 1.9) and may travel a considerable distance to a source of ignition and flash back. Usually it contains inhi bitors to prevent self - polymerization (which is accompanied by evolution of heat) and to prevent formation of explosive peroxides. At elevated temperatures, such as in fire conditions, polymerization may take place. If the polymerization takes place in a container, there is a possibility of violent rupture of the container. (b) Hazard: Slightly toxic. Slight respiratory irritant. Direct contact of liquefied BD on skin may cause freeze burns and frostbite. (c) Storage: Protect against physical damage to BD con tainers. Outside or detached storage of BD containers is preferred. Inside storage should be in a cool, dry, well - ventilated, noncombustible location, away from all possible sources of ignition. Store cylinders vertically and do not stack. Do not store with oxidizing material. (d) Usual Shipping Containers: Liquefied BD is contained in steel pressure apparatus. (e) Electrical Equipment: Electrical installations in Class I hazardous locations, as defined in Article 500 of the National Electrical Code, should b e in accordance with Article 501 of the Code. If explosion -proof electrical equipment is necessary, it shall be suitable for use in Group B. Group D equipment may be used if such equipment is isolated in accordance with Section 501 -5(a) by sealing all co nduit 1/2 -inch size or larger. See Venting of Deflagrations (NFPA No. 68, 1994), National Electrical Code (NFPA No. 70, 1996), Static Electricity (NFPA No. 77, 1993), Lightning Protection Systems (NFPA No. 780, 1995), and Fire Hazard Properties of Flammab le Liquids, Gases and Volatile Solids (NFPA No. 325, 1994). (f) Firefighting: Stop flow of gas. Use water to keep fire -exposed containers cool. Fire extinguishers and quick drenching facilities must be readily available, and you should know where they are a nd how to operate them. (g) Spill and Leak: Persons not wearing protective equipment and clothing should be restricted from areas of spills or leaks until clean -up has been completed. If BD is spilled or leaked, the following steps should be taken: Eliminate all ignition sources. Ventilate area of spill or leak. If in liquid form, for small quantities, allow to evaporate in a safe manner. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 194 Stop or control the leak if this can be done without risk. If source of leak is a cylinder and the leak cannot be stopp ed in place, remove the leaking cylinder to a safe place and repair the leak or allow the cylinder to empty. (h) Disposal: This substance, when discarded or disposed of, is a hazardous waste according to Federal regulations (40 CFR part 261). It is listed as hazardous waste number D001 due to its ignitability. The transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal of this waste material must be conducted in compliance with 40 CFR parts 262, 263, 264, 268 and 270. Disposal can occur only in properly permitted facilities. Check state and local regulation of any additional requirements as these may be more restrictive than federal laws and regulation. (i) You should not keep food, beverages, or smoking materials in areas where there is BD exposure, nor should you ea t or drink in such areas. (j) Ask your supervisor where BD is used in your work area and ask for any additional plant safety and health rules. (6) Medical Requirements . Your employer is required to offer you the opportunity to participate in a medical screening and surveillance program if you are exposed to BD at concentrations exceeding the action level (0.5 ppm BD as an 8 -hour TWA) on 30 days or more a year, or at or above the 8 -hr TWA (1 ppm) or STEL (5 ppm for 15 minutes) on 10 days or more a year. Exposure fo r any part of a day counts. If you have had exposure to BD in the past, but have been transferred to another job, you may still be eligible to participate in the medical screening and surveillance program. The WISHA rule specifies the past exposures that would qualify you for participation in the program. These past exposure are work histories that suggest the following: (a) That you have been exposed at or above the PELs on 30 days a year for 10 or more years; (b) That you have been exposed at or above the actio n level on 60 days a year for 10 or more years; or (c) That you have been exposed above 10 ppm on 30 days in any past year. Additionally, if you are exposed to BD in an emergency situation, you are eligible for a medical examination within 48 hours. The basic medical screening program includes a health questionnaire, physical examination, and blood test. These medical evaluations must be offered to you at a reasonable time and place, and without cost or loss of pay. (7) Observation of Monitoring . Your employer is required to perform measurements that are representative of your exposure to BD and you or your designated representative are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are entitled to observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure, and to r ecord the results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking place in an area where respirators or personal protective clothing and equipment are required to be worn, you or your representative must also be provided with, and must wear, the protect ive clothing and equipment. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 195 (8) Access to Information . (a) Each year, your employer is required to inform you of the information contained in this appendix. In addition, your employer must instruct you in the proper work - practices for using BD, emergency proced ures, and the correct use of protective equipment. (b) Your employer is required to determine whether you are being exposed to BD. You or your representative has the right to observe employee measurements and to record the results obtained. Your employer is required to inform you of your exposure. If your employer determines that you are being overexposed, he or she is required to inform you of the actions which are being taken to reduce your exposure to within permissible exposure limits and of the schedule to implement these actions. (c) Your employer is required to keep records of your exposures and medical examinations. These records must be kept by the employer for at least thirty (30) years. (d) Your employer is required to release your exposure and medical re cords to you or your representative upon your request. Appendix B. Substance Technical Guidelines for 1,3 -Butadiene (Non -Mandatory) (1) Physical and mm Hg): -4.7 deg. C (23.5 deg. F). Specific gravity (water = 1): 0.62 at 20 deg. C (68 deg. F). Vapor density (air = 1 at boiling point of BD): 1.87. Vapor pressure at 20 deg. C (68 deg. F): 910 mm Hg. Solubility in water, g/100 g water at 20 deg. C (68 deg. F): 0.05. Appearance and odor: Colorless, flammable ga s with a mildly aromatic odor. Liquef ied BD is a colorless liquid with a mildly aromatic odor. (2) Fire, Explosion, and Reactivity Hazard Data . Not applicable to BD gas. Stability: A stabilizer is added to the monomer to inhi bit formation of polymer during storage. Forms explosive peroxides in air in absence of inhibitor. Flammable limits in air, percent by volume: Lower: 2.0; Upper: 11.5. Chapter 296 -62 Occupational Health Standards ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 196 Extinguishing media: Carbon dioxide for small fires, polymer or alcohol foams for large fires. Special firefighting procedures: Fight fire from protected location or maximum possible distance. Stop flow of gas before extinguishing fire. Use water spray to keep fire -exposed cylinders cool. Unusual fire and explosion hazards: BD vapors are heavier than air and may travel to a source of ignition and flash back. Closed containers may rupture violently when heated. For purposes of compliance with the requirements of WAC 296-24-330, BD is classified as a flammable gas. For example, 7,500 ppm, approximately one -fourth of the lower flammable limit, would be considered to pose a potential fire and explosion hazard. For purposes of compliance with WAC 296-24-585, BD is classified as a Class B fire hazard. For purposes of compliance with WAC 296-24-956 and 296-800-280, locations classified as hazardous due to the presence of BD shall be Class I. (b) Reactivity: Conditions contributing to instability: Heat. Peroxides are formed when inhibitor concentration is not maintained at proper level. At elevated temperatures, such as in fire conditions, polymerization may take place. Incompatibilities: Contact with strong oxidizing agents may cause fires and explosions. The contacting of crude BD (not BD monomer) with copper and copper alloys may cause formations of explosive copper compounds. Hazardous decomposition products: Toxic gases (such as carbon monoxide) may be released in a fire i nvolving BD. Special precautions: BD will attack some forms of plastics, rubber, and coatings. BD in storage should be checked for proper inhibitor content, for self - polymerization, and for formation of peroxides when in contact with air and iron. Pipin g carrying BD may become plugged by formation of rubbery polymer. (c) Warning Properties: Odor Threshold: An odor threshold of 0.45 ppm has been reported in The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Report, Odor Thresholds for Chemicals with Establis hed Occupational Health Standards. (Ex. 32 -28C). Eye Irritation Level: Workers exposed to vapors of BD (concentration or purity unspecified) have complained of irritation of eyes, nasal passages, throat, and lungs. Dogs and rabbits exposed experimental ly to as much as 6700 ppm for 7 1/2 hours a day for 8 months have developed no histologically demonstrable abnormality of the eyes. Chapter 296 -62 WAC G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 197 Evaluation of Warning Properties: Since the mean odor threshold is about half of the 1 ppm PEL, and more than 10 -fold bel ow the 5 ppm STEL, most wearers of air purifying respirators should still be able to detect breakthrough before a significant overexposure to BD occurs. (3) Spill, Leak, and Disposal Procedures . (a) Persons not wearing protective equipment and clothing should be r estricted from areas of spills or leaks until cleanup has been completed. If BD is spilled or leaked, the following steps should be taken: Eliminate all ignition sources. Ventilate areas of spill or leak. If in liquid form, for small quantities, allow to evaporate in a safe manner. Stop or control the leak if this can be done without risk. If source of leak is a cylinder and the leak cannot be stopped in place, remove the leaking cylinder to a safe place and repair the leak or allow the cylinder to empty. (b) Disposal: This substance, when discarded or disposed of, is a hazardous waste according to Federal regulations (40 CFR part 261). It is listed by the EPA as hazardous waste number D001 due to its ignitability. The transportation, storage, treatment, an d disposal of this waste material must be conducted in compliance with 40 CFR parts 262, 263, 264, 268 and 270. Disposal can occur only in properly permitted facilities. Check state and local regulations for any additional requirements because these may be more restrictive than federal laws and regulations. (4) Monitoring and Measurement Procedures . (a) Exposure above the Permissible Exposure Limit (8 -hr TWA) or Short -Term Exposure Limit (STEL): 8-hr TWA exposure evaluation: Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure under this standard are best taken with consecutive samples covering the full shift. Air samples must be taken in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent that inhaled by the employee). STEL exposu re evaluation: Measurements must represent 15 minute exposures associated with operations most likely to exceed the STEL in each job and on each shift. Monitoring frequencies: Table 1 gives various exposure scenarios and their required monitoring frequen cies, as required by the final standard for occupational exposure to butadiene. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 198 Table 1 Five Exposure Scenarios and Their Associated Monitoring Frequencies Action Level 8-hr TWA STEL Required Monitoring Activity __* __ __ __ __ 8-hr TWA annually. + __ __ No STEL monitoring required.

Footnote(*) Exposure Scenario, Limit Exceeded: + = Yes, - = No. Footnote(**) The empl oyer may decrease the frequency of exposure monitoring to annually when at least 2 consecutive measurements taken at least 7 days apart show exposures to be below the 8 -hr TWA, but at or above the action level. Monitoring techniques: Appendix D describes the validated method of sampling and analysis which has been tested by OSHA for use with BD. The employer has the obligation of selecting a monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of the standard under their unique field cond itions. The standard requires that the method of monitoring must be accurate, to a 95 percent confidence level, to plus or minus 25 percent for concentrations of BD at or above 1 ppm, and to plus or minus 35 percent for concentrations below 1 ppm. (5) Persona l Protective Equipment . (a) Employees should be provided with and required to use impervious clothing, gloves, face shields (eight -inch minimum), and other appropriate protective clothing necessary to prevent the skin from becoming frozen from contact with liq uid BD. (b) Any clothing which becomes wet with liquid BD should be removed immediately and not re -worn until the butadiene has evaporated. (c) Employees should be provided with and required to use splash proof safety goggles where liquid BD may contact the eyes. (6) Housekeeping and Hygiene Facilities . For purposes of complying with WAC 296-800-220 and 296-800-230, the following items should be emphasized: (a) The workplace should be kept clean, orderly, and in a sanitary condition. (b) Adequate washing facilities with hot and cold water are to be provided and maintained in a sanitary conditi on. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 199 (7) Additional Precautions . (a) Store BD in tightly closed containers in a cool, well -ventilated area and take all necessary precautions to avoid any explosion hazard. (b) Non-sparking tools must be used to open and close metal containers. These containers must b e effectively grounded. (c) Do not incinerate BD cartridges, tanks or other containers. (d) Employers must advise employees of all areas and operations where exposure to BD might occur. Appendix C. Medical Screening and Surveillance for 1,3 -Butadiene (Non - Mandato ry). (1) Basis for Medical Screening and Surveillance Requirements . (a) Route of Entry Inhalation. (b) Toxicology. Inhalation of BD has been linked to an increased risk of cancer, damage to the reproductive organs, and fetotoxicity. Butadiene can be converted via oxi dation to epoxybutene and diepoxybutane, two genotoxic metabolites that may play a role in the expression of BD's toxic effects. BD has been tested for carcinogenicity in mice and rats. Both species responded to BD exposure by developing cancer at multip le primary organ sites. Early deaths in mice were caused by malignant lymphomas, primarily lymphocytic type, originating in the thymus. Mice exposed to BD have developed ovarian or testicular atrophy. Sperm head morphology tests also revealed abnormal sp erm in mice exposed to BD; lethal mutations were found in a dominant lethal test. In light of these results in animals, the possibility that BD may adversely affect the reproductive systems of male and female workers must be considered. Additionally, anem ia has been observed in animals exposed to butadiene. In some cases, this anemia appeared to be a primary response to exposure; in other cases, it may have been secondary to a neoplastic response. (c) Epidemiology. Epidemiologic evidence demonstrates that BD exposure poses an increased risk of leukemia. Mild alterations of hematologic parameters have also been observed in synthetic rubber workers exposed to BD. (2) Potential Adverse Health Effects . (a) Acute. Skin contact with liquid BD causes characteristic burns or frostbite. BD in gaseous form can irritate the eyes, nasal passages, throat, and lungs. Blurred vision, coughing, and drowsiness may also occur. Effects are mild at 2,000 ppm and pronounced at 8,000 ppm for exposures occurring over the full workshift. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 200 At very high concentrations in air, BD is an anesthetic, causing narcosis, respiratory paralysis, unconsciousness, and death. Such concentrations are unlikely, however, except in an extreme emergency because BD poses an explosion hazard at these levels. (b) Chronic. The principal adverse health effects of concern are BD -induced lymphoma, leukemia and potential reproductive toxicity. Anemia and other changes in the peripheral blood cells may be indicators of excessive exposure to BD. (c) Reproductive. Workers ma y be concerned about the possibility that their BD exposure may be affecting their ability to procreate a healthy child. For workers with high exposures to BD, especially those who have experienced difficulties in conceiving, miscarriages, or stillbirths, appropriate medical and laboratory evaluation of fertility may be necessary to determine if BD is having any adverse effect on the reproductive system or on the health of the fetus. (3) Medical Screening Components At -A-Glance . (a) Health Questionnaire. The most important goal of the health questionnaire is to elicit information from the worker regarding potential signs or symptoms generally related to leukemia or other blood abnormalities. Therefore, physicians or other licensed health care professionals should be aware of the presenting symptoms and signs of lymphohematopoietic disorders and cancers, as well as the procedures necessary to confirm or exclude such diagnoses. Additionally, the health questionnaire will assist with the identification of workers at greatest risk of developing leukemia or adverse reproductive effects from their exposures to BD. Workers with a history of reproductive difficulties or a personal or family history of immune deficiency syndromes, blood dyscrasias, lymphoma, or leukemia, an d those who are or have been exposed to medicinal drugs or chemicals known to affect the hematopoietic or lymphatic systems may be at higher risk from their exposure to BD. After the initial administration, the health questionnaire must be updated annuall y. (b) Complete Blood Count (CBC). The medical screening and surveillance program requires an annual CBC, with differential and platelet count, to be provided for each employee with BD exposure. This test is to be performed on a blood sample obtained by phleb otomy of the venous system or, if technically feasible, from a fingerstick sample of capillary blood. The sample is to be analyzed by an accredited laboratory. Abnormalities in a CBC may be due to a number of different etiologies. The concern for workers exposed to BD includes, but is not limited to, timely identification of lymphohematopoietic cancers, such as leukemia and non -Hodgkin's lymphoma. Abnormalities of portions of the CBC are identified by comparing an individual's results to those of an esta blished range of normal values for males and females. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 201 A substantial change in any individual employee's CBC may also be viewed as \"abnormal\" for that individual even if all measurements fall within the population - based range of normal values. It is sugg ested that a flowsheet for laboratory values be included in each employee's medical record so that comparisons and trends in annual CBCs can be easily made. A determination of the clinical significance of an abnormal CBC shall be the responsibility of the examining physician, other licensed health care professional, or medical specialist to whom the employee is referred. Ideally, an abnormal CBC should be compared to previous CBC measurements for the same employee, when available. Clinical common sense ma y dictate that a CBC value that is very slightly outside the normal range does not warrant medical concern. A CBC abnormality may also be the result of a temporary physical stressor, such as a transient viral illness, blood donation, or menorrhagia, or la boratory error. In these cases, the CBC should be repeated in a timely fashion, i.e., within 6 weeks, to verify that return to the normal range has occurred. A clinically significant abnormal CBC should result in removal of the employee from further expo sure to BD. Transfer of the employee to other work duties in a BD -free environment would be the preferred recommendation. (c) Physical Examination. The medical screening and surveillance program requires an initial physical examination for workers exposed to BD; this examination is repeated once every three years. The initial physical examination should assess each worker's baseline general health and rule out clinical signs of medical conditions that may be caused by or aggravated by occupational BD exposure . The physical examination should be directed at identification of signs of lymphohematopoietic disorders, including lymph node enlargement, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. Repeated physical examinations should update objective clinical findings that coul d be indicative of interim development of a lymphohematopoietic disorder, such as lymphoma, leukemia, or other blood abnormality. Physical examinations may also be provided on an as needed basis in order to follow up on a positive answer on the health que stionnaire, or in response to an abnormal CBC. +Physical examination of workers who will no longer be working in jobs with BD exposure are intended to rule out lymphohematopoietic disorders. The need for physical examinations for workers concerned about a dverse reproductive effects from their exposure to BD should be identified by the physician or other licensed health care professional and provided accordingly. For these workers, such consultations and examinations may relate to developmental toxicity and reproductive capacity. Physical examination of workers acutely exposed to significant levels of BD should be especially directed at the respiratory system, eyes, sinuses, skin, nervous system, and any region associated with particular complaints. If the worker has received a severe acute exposure, hospitalization may be required to assure proper medical management. Since this type of exposure may place workers at greater risk of blood abnormalities, a CBC must be obtained within 48 hours and repeated at one, two, and three months . Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 202 Appendix D: Sampling and Analytical Method for 1,3 -Butadiene (Non -Mandatory) . OSHA ppm (2.21 mg/m3). Procedure: Air samples are collected by drawing known volumes of a ir through sampling tubes containing charcoal adsorbent which has been coated with 4 -tert- butylcatechol. The samples are desorbed with carbon disulfide and then analyzed by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector. Recommended sampling rate an d air volume: 0.05 L/min and 3 L. Detection limit of the overall procedure: 90 ppb (200 \u00b5g/m3) (based on 3 L air volume). Reliable quantitation limit: 155 ppb (343 \u00b5g/m3) (based on 3 L air volume). Standard error of estimate at the target concentration: 6.5%. Special requirements: The sampling tubes must be coated with 4 -tert-butylcatechol. Collected samples should be stored in a freezer. Status of method: A sampling and analytical method has been subjected to the established evaluation procedures of the Organic Methods Evaluation Branch, OSHA Analytical Laboratory, Salt Lake City, Utah 84165. (1) Background . This work was undertaken to develop a sampling and analytical procedure for BD at 1 ppm. The current method recommended by OSHA for collecting BD u ses activated coconut shell charcoal as the sampling medium (Ref. 5.2). This method was found to be inadequate for use at low BD levels because of sample instability. The stability of samples has been significantly improved through the use of a specially cleaned charcoal which is coated with 4 -tert-butylcatechol (TBC). TBC is a polymerization inhibitor for BD (Ref. 5.3). (a) Toxic effects. Symptoms of human exposure to BD include irritation of the eyes, nose and throat. It can also cause coughing, drowsine ss and fatigue. Dermatitis and frostbite can result from skin exposure to liquid BD. (Ref. 5.1) NIOSH recommends that BD be handled in the workplace as a potential occupational carcinogen. This recommendation is based on two inhalation studies that res ulted in cancers at multiple sites in rats and in mice. BD has also demonstrated mutagenic activity in the presence of a liver microsomal activating system. It has also been reported to have adverse reproductive effects. (Ref. 5.1) (b) Potential workplace e xposure. About 90% of the annual production of BD is used to manufacture styrene -butadiene rubber and Polybutadiene rubber. Other uses include: chemical intermediates. (Ref. 5.1) Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 203 (c) Physical properties (Ref. 5.1). CAS No.: 106-99-0 Freezing point: -108.9 C Vapor pressure: 2 atm (a) 15.3 deg. C; 5 atm (a) 47 deg. C Explosive limits: 2 to 11.5% (by volume in air) Odor vinylethylene. (d) Limit defining parameters. The analyte air concentrations listed throughout this method are based on an air volume of 3 L and a desorption volume of 1 mL. Air concentrations listed in ppm are referenced to 25 deg. C and 760 mm Hg. (e) Detection limit of the analytical procedure. The detection limit of the analytical procedure was 304 pg per injection. This was th e amount of BD which gave a response relative to the interferences present in a standard. (f) Detection limit of the overall procedure. The detection limit of the overall procedure was 0.60 ug per sample (90 ppb or 200 ug/m3). This amount was determined graph ically. It was the amount of analyte which, when spiked on the sampling device, would allow recovery approximately equal to the detection limit of the analytical procedure. (g) Reliable quantitation limit. The reliable quantitation limit was 1.03 \u00b5g per sampl e (155 ppb or 343 \u00b5g/m3). This was the smallest amount of analyte which could be quantitated within the limits of a recovery of at least 75% and a precision (+/ - 1.96 SD) of +/ - 25% or better. (h) Sensitivity.(1) Footnote(1) The reliable quantitation limit an d detection limits reported in the method are based upon optimization of the instrument for the smallest possible amount of analyte. When the target concentration of an analyte is exceptionally higher than these limits, they may not be attainable at the r outine operation parameters. The sensitivity of the analytical procedure over a concentration range representing 0.6 to 2 times the target concentration, based on the recommended air volume, was 387 area units per \u00b5g/mL. This value was determined from the slope of the calibration curve. The sensitivity may vary with the particular instrument used in the analysis. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 204 (i) Recovery. The recovery of BD from samples used in storage tests remained above 77% when the samples were stored at ambient temperature and abo ve 94% when the samples were stored at refrigerated temperature. These values were determined from regression lines which were calculated from the storage data. The recovery of the analyte from the collection device must be at least 75% following storage . (j) Precision (analytical method only). The pooled coefficient of variation obtained from replicate determinations of analytical standards over the range of 0.6 to 2 times the target concentration was 0.011. (k) Precision (overall procedure). The precision at th e 95% confidence level for the refrigerated temperature storage test was +/ - 12.7%. This value includes an additional +/ - 5% for sampling error. The overall procedure must provide results at the target concentrations that are +/ - 25% at the 95% confidenc e level. (l) Reproducibility. Samples collected from a controlled test atmosphere and a draft copy of this procedure were given to a chemist unassociated with this evaluation. The average recovery was 97.2% and the standard deviation was 6.2%. (2) Sampling proced ure. (a) Apparatus. Samples are collected by use of a personal sampling pump that can be calibrated to within +/ - 5% of the recommended 0.05 L/min sampling rate with the sampling tube in line. (b) Samples are collected with laboratory prepared sampling tubes. Th e sampling tube is constructed of silane -treated glass and is about 5 -cm long. The ID is 4 mm and the OD is 6 mm. One end of the tube is tapered so that a glass wool end plug will hold the contents of the tube in place during sampling. The opening in th e tapered end of the sampling tube is at least one -half the ID of the tube (2 mm). The other end of the sampling tube is open to its full 4 -mm ID to facilitate packing of the tube. Both ends of the tube are fire -polished for safety. The tube is packed w ith 2 sections of pretreated charcoal which has been coated with TBC. The tube is packed with a 50 - mg backup section, located nearest the tapered end, and with a 100 -mg sampling section of charcoal. The two sections of coated adsorbent are separated and retained with small plugs of silanized glass wool. Following packing, the sampling tubes are sealed with two 7/32 inch OD plastic end caps. Instructions for the pretreatment and coating of the charcoal are presented in Section 4.1 of this method. (c) Reagen ts. None required. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 205 (d) Technique. Properly label the sampling tube before sampling and then remove the plastic end caps. Attach the sampling tube to the pump using a section of flexible plastic tubing such that the larger front section of the sampling tube i s exposed directly to the atmosphere. Do not place any tubing ahead of the sampling tube. The sampling tube should be attached in the worker's breathing zone in a vertical manner such that it does not impede work performance. After sampling for the appro priate time, remove the sampling tube from the pump and then seal the tube with plastic end caps. Wrap the tube lengthwise. Include at least one blank for each sampling set. The blank should be handled in the same manner as the samples with the exception that air is not drawn through it. List any potential interferences on the sample data sheet. The samples require no special shipping precautions under normal conditions. The samples should be refrigerated if they are to be exposed to higher than normal a mbient temperatures. If the samples are to be stored before they are shipped to the laboratory, they should be kept in a freezer. The samples should be placed in a freezer upon receipt at the laboratory. (e) Breakthrough. (Breakthrough was defined as the rel ative amount of analyte found on the backup section of the tube in relation to the total amount of analyte collected on the sampling tube. Five -percent breakthrough occurred after sampling a test atmosphere containing 2.0 ppm BD for 90 min. at 0.05 L/min. At the end of this time 4.5 L of air had been sampled and 20.1 \u00b5g of the analyte was collected. The relative humidity of the sampled air was 80% at 23 deg. C.) Breakthrough studies have shown that the recommended sampling procedure can be used at air co ncentrations higher than the target concentration. The sampling time, however, should be reduced to 45 min. if both the expected BD level and the relative humidity of the sampled air are high. (f) Desorption efficiency. The average desorption efficiency for B D from TBC coated charcoal over the range from 0.6 to 2 times the target concentration was 96.4%. The efficiency was essentially constant over the range studied. (g) Recommended air volume and sampling rate. (h) The recommended air volume is 3 L. (i) The recommended sampling rate is 0.05 L/min. for 1 hour. (j) Interferences. There are no known interferences to the sampling method.

(3) Analytical procedure . (a) Apparatus. A gas chromatograph (GC), equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).(2) Footnote(2) A Hewlett -Packard Model 5840A GC was used for this evaluation. Injections were performed using a Hewlett -Packard Model 7671A automatic sampler. A GC column capable of resolving the analytes from any interference.(3) Footnote(3) A 20-ft x mesh Chroma bsorb W -AW-DMCS was used for this evaluation. Vials, glass 2 -mL for preparing and standards, making dilutions and performing injections. (b) Reagents. Carbon disulfide.(4) Footnote(4) Fisher Scientific Company A.C.S. Reagent Grade solvent was used in this evaluation. The benzene contaminant that was present in the carbon disulfide was used as an internal standard (ISTD) in this evaluation. Nitrogen, hydrogen and air, GC grade. BD of known high purity.(5) Footnote(5) Matheson Gas Products, CP Grade 1,3 -butadiene was used in this study. (c) Standard preparation. Prepare standards by diluting known volumes of BD gas with carbon disulfide. This can be accomplished by injecting the appropriate volume of BD into the headspace above the 1 -mL of carbon disulfide contained in sealed 2 -mL vial. Shake the vial after the needle is removed from the septum.(6) Footnote(6) A standard containing 7.71 \u00b5g/mL (at ambient temperatur e and pressure) was prepared by diluting 4 \u00b5L of the gas with 1 -mL of carbon disulfide. The mass of BD gas used to prepare standards can be determined by use of the following equations: MV = (760/BP)(273+t)/(273)(22.41) Where: MV = ambient molar volume BP = ambient barometric pressure T = ambient temperature \u00b5g/L = 54.09/MV \u00b5g/standard = ( \u00b5g/\u00b5L)(\u00b5L) the standard. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 207 (d) Sample preparation. Transfer the 100 -mg section of the sampling tube to a 2 -mL vial. Place the 50 -mg section in a separate via l. If the glass wool plugs contain a significant amount of charcoal, place them with the appropriate sampling tube section. Add 1 -mL of carbon disulfide to each vial. Seal the vials with Teflon -lined caps and then allow them to desorb for one hour. Shake the vials by hand vigorously several times during the desorption period. If it is not possible to analyze the samples within 4 hours, separate the carbon disulfide from the charcoal, using a disposable Pasteur -type pipet, following the one hour. This sep aration will improve the stability of desorbed samples. Save the used sampling tubes to be cleaned and repacked with fresh adsorbent. (e) Analysis. GC Conditions. Column temperature: deg. C Chromabsorb W -AW-DMCS. Chromatogram. See Section 4.2. Use a suitable method, such as electronic or pea k heights, to measure detector response. Prepare a calibration curve using several standard solutions of different concentrations. Prepare the calibration curve daily. Program the integrator to report the results in \u00b5g/mL. Bracket sample concentrations w ith standards. (f) Interferences (analytical). Any compound with the same general retention time as the analyte and which also gives a detector response is a potential interference. Possible interferences should be reported by the industrial hygienist to the laboratory with submitted samples. GC parameters (temperature, column, etc.) may be changed to circumvent interferences. A useful means of structure designation is GC/MS. It is recommended that this procedure be used to confirm samples whenever possible. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 208 (g) Calculations. Results are obtained by use of calibration curves. Calibration curves are prepared by plotting detector response against concentration for each standard. The best line through the data points is determined by curve fitting. The concentrat ion, in \u00b5g/mL, for a particular sample is determined by comparing its detector response to the calibration curve. If any analyte is found on the backup section, this amount is added to the amount found on the front section. Blank corrections should be pe rformed before adding the results together. The BD air concentration can be expressed using the following equation: mg/m3 = (A)(B)/(C)(D) Where: A = \u00b5g/mL from Section 3.7.2 B = volume C = L of air sampled D = efficiency The following equation can be used to convert results in mg/m3 to ppm: ppm = (mg/m3)(24.46)/54.09 Where: mg/m3 = result from Section 3.7.3. 24.46 = molar volume of an ideal gas at 760 mm Hg and 25 deg. C. (h) Safety precautions (analytical). Avoid skin contact and inhalation of all chemicals. Restrict the use of all chemicals to a fume hood whenever possible. Wear safety glasses and a lab coat in all laboratory areas. (4) Additional Information . (a) A procedure to prepare specially cleaned charcoal coated with TBC. Apparatus.

(C) Specially cleaned coconut shell charcoal, 20/40 mesh.(11) Footnote(11) Specially cleaned charcoal was obtained from Supelco, Inc. for use in this evaluation. The cleaning process used by Supelco is proprietary. (D) Nitrogen gas, GC g rade. Procedure. Weigh 30g of charcoal into a 500 -mL Erlenmeyer flask. Add about 250 mL of 10% phosphoric acid to the flask and then swirl the mixture. Stir the mixture for 1 hour using a magnetic stirrer. Filter the mixture using a fitted Buchner funne l. Wash the charcoal several times with 250 -mL portions of deionized water to remove all traces of the acid. Transfer the washed charcoal to the tube furnace quartz tube. Place the quartz tube in the furnace and then connect the nitrogen gas purge to th e tube. Fire the charcoal to 700 deg. C. Maintain that temperature for at least 1 hour. After the charcoal has cooled to room temperature, transfer it to a tared beaker. Determine the weight of the charcoal and then add an amount of TBC which is 10% o f the charcoal, by weight. CAUTION -TBC is toxic and should only be handled in a fume hood while wearing gloves. Carefully mix the contents of the beaker and then transfer the mixture to a 4 -oz bottle. Stopper the bottle with a clean rubber stopper which h as been wrapped with Teflon tape. Clamp the bottle in a water bath so that the water level is above the charcoal level. Gently heat the bath to 60 deg. C and then maintain that temperature for 1 hour. Cool the charcoal to room temperature and then trans fer the coated charcoal to a suitable container. The coated charcoal is now ready to be packed into sampling tubes. The sampling tubes should be stored in a sealed container to prevent contamination. Sampling tubes should be stored in the dark at room te mperature. The sampling tubes should be segregated by coated adsorbent lot number. (b) Chromatograms. The chromatograms were obtained using the recommended analytical method. The chart speed was set at 1 cm/min. for the first three min. and then at 0.2 cm/mi n. for the time remaining in the analysis. The peak which elutes just before BD is a reaction product between an impurity on the charcoal and TBC. This peak is always present, but it is easily resolved from the analyte. The peak which elutes immediately before benzene is an oxidation product of TBC. (5) References .

Do This occupational health standard establishes requirements for employers to control occupational exposure to methylene chloride (MC). Employees exposed to MC are at increased risk of developing cancer, adverse effects on the heart, central nervous system and liver, and skin or eye irritation. Exposure may occur through inhalation, by absorption through the skin, or through contact with the skin. MC is a solvent which is used in many different types of work activities, such a s paint stripping, polyurethane foam manufacturing, and cleaning and degreasing. Under the requirements of subsection (4) of this section, each covered employer must make an initial determination of each employee's exposure to MC. If the employer determi nes that employees are exposed below the action level, the only other provisions of this section that apply are that a record must be made of the determination, the employees must receive information and training under subsection (12) of this section and, where appropriate, employees must be protected from contact with liquid MC under subsection (8) of this section. The provisions of the MC standard are as follows: (1) Scope and application . This section applies to all occupational exposures to methylene chlor ide (MC), Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number 75 -09-2, in general industry, construction and shipyard employment. (2) Definitions . For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: Action level . A concentration of airborne MC of 12.5 parts per million (ppm) calculated as an eight (8) -hour time -weighted average (TWA). Authorized person Any person specifically authorized by the employer and required by work duties to be present in regulated areas, or any person entering such an ar ea as a designated representative of employees for the purpose of exercising the right to observe monitoring and measuring procedures under subsection (4) of this section, or any other person authorized by the WISH Act or regulations issued under the act. Director . The director of the department of labor and industries, or designee. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 218 Emergency . Any occurrence, such as, but not limited to, equipment failure, rupture of containers, or failure of control equipment, which results, or is likely to result in a n uncontrolled release of MC. If an incidental release of MC can be controlled by employees such as maintenance personnel at the time of release and in accordance with the leak/spill provisions required by subsection (6) of this section, it is not conside red an emergency as defined by this standard. Employee exposure . Exposure to airborne MC which occurs or would occur if the employee were not using respiratory protection. Methylene chloride (MC) An organic compound with chemical formula, CH 2C12. Its Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number is 75 -09-2. Its molecular weight is 84.9 g/mole. Physician or other licensed health care professional An individual whose legally permitted scope of practice (i.e., license, registration, or certification) allows them to independently provide or be delegated the responsibility to provide some or all of the health care services required by subsection (10) of this section. Regulated area . An area, demarcated by the employer, where an employee's exposure to airborne concentrations of MC exceeds or can reasonably be expected to exceed either the 8 -hour TWA PEL or the STEL. Symptom . Central nervous system effects such as headaches, disorientation, dizziness, fatigue, and decreased attention span; skin effects such as c happing, erythema, cracked skin, or skin burns; and cardiac effects such as chest pain or shortness of breath. This section . This methylene chloride standard. (3) Permissible exposure limits (PELs) . (a) Eight -hour time -weighted average (TWA) PEL. The employer must ensure that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of MC in excess of twenty -five parts of MC per million parts of air (25 ppm) as an 8 -hour TWA. (b) Short -term exposure limit (STEL). The employer must ensure that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of MC in excess of one hundred and twenty -five parts of MC per million parts of air (125 ppm) as determined over a sampling period of fifteen minutes. (4) Exposure monitoring . (a) Characterization of employee exposure. Where MC is present in the workplace, the employer must determine each employee's exposure by either: (A) Taking a personal breathing zone air sample of each employee's exposure; or (B) Taking personal breathing zone air samples that are representative of each employee's exposure. Repr esentative samples. The employer may consider personal breathing zone air samples to be representative of employee exposures when they are taken as follows: Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 219 (A) 8-hour TWA PEL. The employer has taken one or more personal breathing zone air samples for at l east one employee in each job classification in a work area during every work shift, and the employee sampled is expected to have the highest MC exposure. (B) Short -term exposure limits. The employer has taken one or more personal breathing zone air samples w hich indicate the highest likely 15 -minute exposures during such operations for at least one employee in each job classification in the work area during every work shift, and the employee sampled is expected to have the highest MC exposure. (C) Exception. Per sonal breathing zone air samples taken during one work shift may be used to represent employee exposures on other work shifts where the employer can document that the tasks performed and conditions in the workplace are similar across shifts. Accuracy of mo nitoring. The employer must ensure that the methods used to perform exposure monitoring produce results that are accurate to a confidence level of 95 percent, and are: (A) Within plus or minus 25 percent for airborne concentrations of MC above the 8 -hour TWA PEL or the STEL; or (B) Within plus or minus 35 percent for airborne concentrations of MC at or above the action level but at or below the 8 -hour TWA PEL. (b) Initial determination. Each employer whose employees are exposed to MC must perform initial exposure mon itoring to determine each affected employee's exposure, except under the following conditions: Where objective data demonstrate that MC cannot be released in the workplace in airborne concentrations at or above the action level or above the STEL. The objective data must represent the highest MC exposures likely to occur under reasonably foreseeable conditions of processing, use, or handling. The employer must document the objective data exemption as specified in subsection (13) of this section; Where the employer has performed exposure monitoring within twelve months prior to December 1, and that exposure monitoring meets all other requirements of this section, and was conducted under conditions substantially equivalent to existing conditions; or Where emp loyees are exposed to MC on fewer than 30 days per year (e.g., on a construction site), and the employer has measurements by direct reading instruments which give immediate results (such as a detector tube) and which provide sufficient information regardin g employee exposures to determine what control measures are necessary to reduce exposures to acceptable levels. (c) Periodic monitoring. Where the initial determination shows employee exposures at or above the action level or above the STEL, the employer must establish an exposure monitoring program for periodic monitoring of employee exposure to MC in accordance with Table 1: Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 220 Table 1 Six Initial Determination Exposure Scenarios and their Associated Monitoring Frequencies Exposure scenario Required monito ring activity Below the action level and at or below the STEL. No eight -hour TWA or STEL monitoring required. Below the action level and above the STEL. No eight -hour TWA monitoring required, monitor STEL exposures every three months. At or above the ac tion level, at or below the TWA, and at or below the STEL. Monitor eight -hour TWA exposures every six months. At or above the action level, at or below the TWA, and above the STEL. Monitor eight -hour TWA exposures every six months and monitor STEL exposur es every three months. Above the TWA and at or below the STEL Monitor eight -hour TWA exposures every three months. In addition, without regard to the last sentence of the note to subsection (3) of this section, the following employers must monitor STEL e xposures every three months until either the date by which they must achieve the eight - hour TWAs PEL under subsection (3) of this section or the date by which they in fact achieve the eight -hour TWA PEL, whichever comes first. Employers engaged in polyuret hane foam manufacturing; Foam fabrication; Furniture refinishing; General aviation aircraft stripping; Product formulation; Use of MC -based adhesives for boat building and repair; Recreational vehicle manufacture, van conversion, or upholstery, and use of MC in construction work for restoration and preservation of buildings, painting and paint removal, cabinet making, or floor refinishing and resurfacing. Above the TWA and above the STEL Monitor both eight -hour TWA exposures and STEL exposures every three months. (Note to subsection (4)(c) of this section: The employer may decrease the frequency of exposure monitoring to every six months when at least 2 consecutive measurements taken at least 7 days apart show exposures to be at or below the 8 -hour TWA PE L. The employer may discontinue the periodic 8 -hour TWA monitoring for employees where at least two consecutive measurements taken at least 7 days apart are below the action level. The employer may discontinue the periodic STEL monitoring for employees w here at least two consecutive measurements taken at least 7 days apart are at or below the STEL.) Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 221 (d) Additional monitoring. The employer must perform exposure monitoring when a change in workplace conditions indicates that employee exposure may have increas ed. Examples of situations that may require additional monitoring include changes in production, process, control equipment, or work -practices, or a leak, rupture, or other breakdown. Where exposure monitoring is performed due to a spill, leak, rupture or equipment breakdown, the employer must clean up the MC and perform the appropriate repairs before monitoring. (e) Employee notification of monitoring results. The employer must , within 15 working days after the receipt of the results of any monitoring perform ed under this section, notify each affected employee of these results in writing, either individually or by posting of results in an appropriate location that is accessible to affected employees. Whenever monitoring results indicate that employee exposure is above the 8 -hour TWA PEL or the STEL, the employer must describe in the written notification the corrective action being taken to reduce employee exposure to or below the 8 -hour TWA PEL or STEL and the schedule for completion of this action. (f) Observation of monitoring. Employee observation. The employer must provide affected employees or their designated representatives an opportunity to observe any monitoring of employee exposure to MC conducted in accordance with this section. Observation procedures. When observation of the monitoring of employee exposure to MC requires entry into an area where the use of protective clothing or equipment is required, the employer must provide, at no cost to the observer(s), and the observer(s) must use such clothing an d equipment and must comply with all other applicable safety and health procedures. (5) Regulated areas . (a) The employer must establish a regulated area wherever an employee's exposure to airborne concentrations of MC exceeds or can reasonably be expected to exce ed either the 8 -hour TWA PEL or the STEL. (b) The employer must limit access to regulated areas to authorized persons. (c) The employer must supply a respirator, selected in accordance with subsection (7)(c) of this section, to each person who enters a regulated a rea and must require each affected employee to use that respirator whenever MC exposures are likely to exceed the 8 -hour TWA PEL or STEL. (Note to subsection (5)(c) of this section : An employer who has implemented all feasible engineering, work -practice a nd administrative controls (as required in subsection (6) of this section), and who has established a regulated area (as required by subsection (5)(a) of this section) where MC exposure can be reliably predicted to exceed the 8 -hour TWA PEL or the STEL onl y on certain days (for example, because of work or process schedule) would need to have affected employees use respirators in that regulated area only on those days.) Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 222 (d) The employer must ensure that, within a regulated area, employees do not engage in nonwor k activities which may increase dermal or oral MC exposure. (e) The employer must ensure that while employees are wearing respirators, they do not engage in activities (such as taking medication or chewing gum or tobacco) which interfere with respirator seal o r performance. (f) The employer must demarcate regulated areas from the rest of the workplace in any manner that adequately establishes and alerts employees to the boundaries of the area and minimizes the number of authorized employees exposed to MC within the regulated area. (g) An employer at a multi -employer worksite who establishes a regulated area must communicate the access restrictions and locations of these areas to all other employers with work operations at that worksite. (6) Methods of compliance . (a) Engineerin g and work -practice controls. The employer must institute and maintain the effectiveness of engineering controls and work -practices to reduce employee exposure to or below the PELs except to the extent that the employer can demonstrate that such controls are not feasible. (b) Wherever the feasible engineering controls and work -practices which can be instituted are not sufficient to reduce employee exposure to or below the 8 -TWA PEL or STEL, the employer must use them to reduce employee exposure to the lowest levels achievable by these controls and must supplement them by the use of respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of subsection (7) of this section. (c) Prohibition of rotation. The employer must not implement a schedule of employee rotatio n as a means of compliance with the PELs. (d) Leak and spill detection. The employer must implement procedures to detect leaks of MC in the workplace. In work areas where spills may occur, the employer must make provisions to contain any spills and to safely dispose of any MC -contaminated waste materials. The employer must ensure that all incidental leaks are repaired and that incidental spills are cleaned promptly by employees who use the appropriate personal protective equipment and are trained in proper met hods of cleanup. (Note to subsection (6)(d)(ii) of this section : See Appendix A of this section for examples of procedures that satisfy this requirement. Employers covered by this standard may also be subject to the hazardous waste and emergency response provisions contained in chapter 296-843 WAC. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 223 (7) Respiratory protection . (a) General requirements. For employees who use respirators required by this section, the emp loyer must provide each employee an appropriate respirator that complies with the requirements of this subsection. Respirators must be used during: Periods when an employee's exposure to MC exceeds or can reasonably be expected to exceed the 8 -hour TWA PE L or the STEL for example, when an employee is using MC in a regulated area); Periods necessary to install or implement feasible engineering and work -practice controls; In a few work operations, such as some maintenance operations and repair activities, fo r which the employer demonstrates that engineering and work - practice controls are infeasible; Work operations for which feasible engineering and work -practice controls are not sufficient to reduce exposures to or below the PELs; Emergencies. (b) Respirator pro gram. The employer must develop, implement and maintain a respiratory protection program as required by chapter 296-842 WAC, Respirators, which covers each employ ee required by this chapter to use a respirator, except for the requirements in Table 5 of WAC 296-842-13005 that address gas or vapor cartridge change schedules and end -of-service -life indicators (ESLIs). Employers who provide employees with gas masks with organic -vapor canisters for the purpose of emergency escape must replace the canisters after any emergency use and before the gas masks are returned to service. (c) Respirator selection. The employer must: Select and provide to employees appropriate respirators according to this section and WAC 296-842 13005 found in the re spirator rule. Make sure half -facepiece respirators aren't selected or used for protection against MC. This is necessary to prevent eye irritation or damage from MC exposure. Provide to employees, for emergency escape, one of the following respirator options: (A) A self -contained breathing apparatus operated in the continuous -flow or pressure -demand mode. (B) A gas mask equipped with an organic vapor canister. (d) Medical evaluation. Before having an employee use a supplied -air respirator in the negative -pressure mod e, or a gas mask with an organic -vapor canister for emergency escape, the employer must: Have a physician or other licensed health care professional (PLHCP) evaluate the employee's ability to use such respiratory protection; Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 224 Ensure that the PLHCP provide s their findings in a written opinion to the employee and the employer. Note : See WAC 296-842-14005 for medical evaluation requirements for employees using respir ators. (8) Protective work clothing and equipment . (a) Where needed to prevent MC - induced skin or eye irritation, the employer must provide clean protective clothing and equipment which is resistant to MC, at no cost to the employee, and must ensure that each af fected employee uses it. Eye and face protection shall meet the requirements of WAC 296-800-160, as applicable. (b) The employer must clean, launder, repair and repl ace all protective clothing and equipment required by this subsection as needed to maintain their effectiveness. (c) The employer must be responsible for the safe disposal of such clothing and equipment. (Note to subsection (8)(c) of this section : See Appendi x A for examples of disposal procedures that will satisfy this requirement.) (9) Hygiene facilities . (a) If it is reasonably foreseeable that employees' skin may contact solutions containing 0.1 percent or greater MC (for example, through splashes, spills or impro per work - practices), the employer must provide conveniently located washing facilities capable of removing the MC, and must ensure that affected employees use these facilities as needed. (b) If it is reasonably foreseeable that an employee's eyes may contact s olutions containing 0.1 percent or greater MC (for example through splashes, spills or improper work -practices), the employer must provide appropriate eyewash facilities within the immediate work area for emergency use, and must ensure that affected employ ees use those facilities when necessary. (10) Medical surveillance . (a) Affected employees. The employer must make medical surveillance available for employees who are or may be exposed to MC as follows: At or above the action level on 30 or more days per year, or above the 8 -hour TWA PEL or the STEL on 10 or more days per year; Above the 8 -TWA PEL or STEL for any time period where an employee has been identified by a physician or other licensed health care professional as being at risk from cardiac disease or from some other serious MC -related health condition and such employee requests inclusion in the medical surveillance program; During an emergency. (b) Costs. The employer must provide all required medical surveillance at no cost to affected employees, without los s of pay and at a reasonable time and place. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 225 (c) Medical personnel. The employer must ensure that all medical surveillance procedures are performed by a physician or other licensed health care professional, as defined in subsection (2) of this section. (d) Frequency of medical surveillance. The employer must make medical surveillance available to each affected employee as follows: Initial surveillance. The employer must provide initial medical surveillance under the schedule provided by subsection (14)(b)(iii) of this section, or before the time of initial assignment of the employee, whichever is later . Periodic medical surveillance. The employer must update the medical and work history for each affected employee annually. The employer must provide periodic physical examinations, including appropriate laboratory surveillance, as follows: (A) For employees 45 years of age or older, within 12 months of the initial surveillance or any subsequent medical surveillance; and (B) For employees younger than 45 years of age, wi thin 36 months of the initial surveillance or any subsequent medical surveillance. Termination of employment or reassignment. When an employee leaves the employer's workplace, or is reassigned to an area where exposure to MC is consistently at or below th e action level and STEL, medical surveillance must be made available if six months or more have elapsed since the last medical surveillance. Additional surveillance. The employer must provide additional medical surveillance at frequencies other than those listed above when recommended in the written medical opinion. (For example, the physician or other licensed health care professional may determine an examination is warranted in less than 36 months for employees younger than 45 years of age based upon ev aluation of the results of the annual medical and work history.) (e) Content of medical surveillance. Medical and work history. The comprehensive medical and work history must emphasize neurological symptoms, skin conditions, history of hematologic or liver d isease, signs or symptoms suggestive of heart disease (angina, coronary artery disease), risk factors for cardiac disease, MC exposures, and work -practices and personal protective equipment used during such exposures. (Note to subsection (10)(e)(i) of this section : See Appendix B of this section for an example of a medical and work history format that would satisfy this requirement.) Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 226 Physical examination. Where physical examinations are provided as required above, the physician or other licensed health care professional must accord particular attention to the lungs, cardiovascular system (including blood pressure and pulse), liver, nervous system, and skin. The physician or other licensed health care professional must determine the extent and nature of the physical examination based on the health status of the employee and analysis of the medical and work history. Laboratory surveillance. The physician or other licensed health care professional must determine the extent of any required laboratory survei llance based on the employee's observed health status and the medical and work history. (Note to subsection (10)(e)(iii) of this section : See Appendix B of this section for information regarding medical tests. Laboratory surveillance may include before -and after -shift carboxyhemoglobin determinations, resting ECG, hematocrit, liver function tests and cholesterol levels.) Other information or reports. The medical surveillance must also include any other information or reports the physician or other licens ed health care professional determines are necessary to assess the employee's health in relation to MC exposure. (f) Content of emergency medical surveillance. The employer must ensure that medical surveillance made available when an employee has been exposed to MC in emergency situations includes, at a minimum: Appropriate emergency treatment and decontamination of the exposed employee; Comprehensive physical examination with special emphasis on the nervous system, cardiovascular system, lungs, liver and skin , including blood pressure and pulse; Updated medical and work history, as appropriate for the medical condition of the employee; and Laboratory surveillance, as indicated by the employee's health status. (Note to subsection (10)(f)(iv) of this section : See Appendix B for examples of tests which may be appropriate.) (g) Additional examinations and referrals. Where the physician or other licensed health care professional determines it is necessary, the scope of the medical examination must be expanded and the appropriate additional medical surveillance, such as referrals for consultation or examination, must be provided. (h) Information provided to the physician or other licensed health care professional. The employer must provide the following information to a ph ysician or other licensed health care professional who is involved in the diagnosis of MC -induced health effects: A copy of this section including its applicable appendices; Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 227 A description of the affected employee's past, current and anticipated future duties as they relate to the employee's MC exposure; The employee's former or current exposure levels or, for employees not yet occupationally exposed to MC, the employee's anticipated exposure levels and the frequency and exposure levels anticipated to be a ssociated with emergencies; A description of any personal protective equipment, such as respirators, used or to be used; and Information from previous employment -related medical surveillance of the affected employee which is not otherwise available to the physician or other licensed health care professional. (i) Written medical opinions. For each physical examination required by this section, the employer must ensure that the physician or other licensed health care professional provides to the employer and to t he affected employee a written opinion regarding the results of that examination within 15 days of completion of the evaluation of medical and laboratory findings, but not more than 30 days after the examination. The written medical opinion must be limite d to the following information: (A) The physician's or other licensed health care professional's opinion concerning whether exposure to MC may contribute to or aggravate the employee's existing cardiac, hepatic, neurological (including stroke) or dermal diseas e or whether the employee has any other medical conditions(s) that would place the employee's health at increased risk of material impairment from exposure to MC; (B) Any recommended limitations upon the employee's exposure to MC, removal from MC exposure, or upon the employee's use of protective clothing or equipment and respirators; (C) A statement that the employee has been informed by the physician or other licensed health care professional that MC is a potential occupational carcinogen, of risk factors for hea rt disease, and the potential for exacerbation of underlying heart disease by exposure to MC through its metabolism to carbon monoxide; and (D) A statement that the employee has been informed by the physician or other licensed health care professional of the r esults of the medical examination and any medical conditions resulting from MC exposure which require further explanation or treatment. The employer must instruct the physician or other licensed health care professional not to reveal to the employer, orall y or in the written opinion, any specific records, findings, and diagnoses that have no bearing on occupational exposure to MC. (Note to subsection (10)(h)(ii) of this section : The written medical opinion may also include information and opinions generate d to comply with other OSHA health standards.) Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 228 (j) Medical presumption. For purposes of this subsection (10), the physician or other licensed health care professional must presume, unless medical evidence indicates to the contrary, that a medical condition i s unlikely to require medical removal from MC exposure if the employee is not exposed to MC above the 8 -hour TWA PEL. If the physician or other licensed health care professional recommends removal for an employee exposed below the 8 -hour TWA PEL, the phys ician or other licensed health care professional must cite specific medical evidence, sufficient to rebut the presumption that exposure below the 8 -hour TWA PEL is unlikely to require removal, to support the recommendation. If such evidence is cited by th e physician or other licensed health care professional, the employer must remove the employee. If such evidence is not cited by the physician or other licensed health care professional, the employer is not required to remove the employee. (k) Medical removal protection (MRP). Temporary medical removal and return of an employee. (A) Except as provided in (j) of this subsection, when a medical determination recommends removal because the employee's exposure to MC may contribute to or aggravate the employee's existin g cardiac, hepatic, neurological (including stroke), or skin disease, the employer must provide medical removal protection benefits to the employee and either: (I) Transfer the employee to comparable work where methylene chloride exposure is below the action l evel; or (II) Remove the employee from MC exposure. (B) If comparable work is not available and the employer is able to demonstrate that removal and the costs of extending MRP benefits to an additional employee, considering feasibility in relation to the size of th e employer's business and the other requirements of this standard, make further reliance on MRP an inappropriate remedy, the employer may retain the additional employee in the existing job until transfer or removal becomes appropriate, provided: (I) The employ er ensures that the employee receives additional medical surveillance, including a physical examination at least every 60 days until transfer or removal occurs; and (II) The employer or PLHCP informs the employee of the risk to the employee's health from contin ued MC exposure. (C) The employer must maintain in effect any job -related protective measures or limitations, other than removal, for as long as a medical determination recommends them to be necessary. End of MRP benefits and return of the employee to former j ob status. (A) The employer may cease providing MRP benefits at the earliest of the following: Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 229 (I) Six months; (II) Return of the employee to the employee's former job status following receipt of a medical determination concluding that the employee's exposure to MC n o longer will aggravate any cardiac, hepatic, neurological (including stroke), or dermal disease; (III) Receipt of a medical determination concluding that the employee can never return to MC exposure. (B) For the purposes of this subsection (10), the requirement tha t an employer return an employee to the employee's former job status is not intended to expand upon or restrict any rights an employee has or would have had, absent temporary medical removal, to a specific job classification or position under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. (l) Medical removal protection benefits. For purposes of this subsection (10), the term medical removal protection benefits means that, for each removal, an employer must maintain for up to six months the earnings, seniority, and other employment rights and benefits of the employee as though the employee had not been removed from MC exposure or transferred to a comparable job. During the period of time that an employee is removed from exposure to MC, the employer may condition the provision of medical removal protection benefits upon the employee's participation in follow -up medical surveillance made available pursuant to this section. If a removed employee files a workers' compensation claim for a MC -related disability, the em ployer must continue the MRP benefits required by this section until either the claim is resolved or the 6 -month period for payment of MRP benefits has passed, whichever occurs first. To the extent the employee is entitled to indemnity payments for earning s lost during the period of removal, the employer's obligation to provide medical removal protection benefits to the employee must be reduced by the amount of such indemnity payments. The employer's obligation to provide medical removal protection benefits to a removed employee must be reduced to the extent that the employee receives compensation for earnings lost during the period of removal from either a publicly or an employer -funded compensation program, or receives income from employment with another e mployer made possible by virtue of the employee's removal. (m) Voluntary removal or restriction of an employee. Where an employer, although not required by this section to do so, removes an employee from exposure to MC or otherwise places any limitation on an employee due to the effects of MC exposure on the employee's medical condition, the employer must provide medical removal protection benefits to the employee equal to those required by (l) of this subsection. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 230 (n) Multiple health care professional review mec hanism. If the employer selects the initial physician or licensed health care professional (PLHCP) to conduct any medical examination or consultation provided to an employee under (k) of this subsection, the employer must notify the employee of the right t o seek a second medical opinion each time the employer provides the employee with a copy of the written opinion of that PLHCP. If the employee does not agree with the opinion of the employer -selected PLHCP, notifies the employer of that fact, and takes ste ps to make an appointment with a second PLHCP within 15 days of receiving a copy of the written opinion of the initial PLHCP, the employer must pay for the PLHCP chosen by the employee to perform at least the following: (A) Review any findings, determinations or recommendations of the initial PLHCP; and (B) Conduct such examinations, consultations, and laboratory tests as the PLHCP deems necessary to facilitate this review. If the findings, determinations or recommendations of the second PLHCP differ from those of the initial PLHCP, then the employer and the employee must instruct the two health care professionals to resolve the disagreement. If the two health care professionals are unable to resolve their disagreement within 15 days, then those two health care prof essionals must jointly designate a PLHCP who is a specialist in the field at issue. The employer must pay for the specialist to perform at least the following: (A) Review the findings, determinations, and recommendations of the first two PLHCPs; and (B) Conduct su ch examinations, consultations, laboratory tests and discussions with the prior PLHCPs as the specialist deems necessary to resolve the disagreements of the prior health care professionals. The written opinion of the specialist must be the definitive medic al determination. The employer must act consistent with the definitive medical determination, unless the employer and employee agree that the written opinion of one of the other two PLHCPs must be the definitive medical determination. The employer and the employee or authorized employee representative may agree upon the use of any expeditious alternate health care professional determination mechanism in lieu of the multiple health care professional review mechanism provided by this section so long as the al ternate mechanism otherwise satisfies the requirements contained in this section. (11) Hazard communication -General . (a) Chemical manufacturers, importers, distributors, and employers must comply with all requirements of the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS), WAC 296-901-140 for MC. Chapter 296 -62 Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 231 (b) In classifying the hazards of MC at least the following hazards are to be addressed: Cancer, cardiac effects (including elevation of carbo xyhemoglobin), central nervous system effects, liver effects, and skin and eye irritation.

(e) The employer must retrain each affected employee as necessary to ensure that each employee exposed above the action level or the STEL maintains the requisite understanding of the principles of safe use and handling of MC in the workplace. (f) Whenever there are workplace changes, such as modifications of tasks or procedures or the institution of new tasks or procedures, which increase employee exposure, and where those exposures exceed or can reason ably be expected to exceed the action level, the employer must update the training as necessary to ensure that each affected employee has the requisite proficiency. (g) An employer whose employees are exposed to MC at a multi -employer worksite must notify the other employers with work operations at that site in accordance with the requirements of the Hazard Communication Standard, WAC 296-901-140, as appropriate. (h) The e mployer must provide to the director, upon request, all available materials relating to employee information and training. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 232 (13) Recordkeeping . (a) Objective data. Where an employer seeks to demonstrate that initial monitoring is unnecessary through reasonable rel iance on objective data showing that any materials in the workplace containing MC will not release MC at levels which exceed the action level or the STEL under foreseeable conditions of exposure, the employer must establish and maintain an accurate record of the objective data relied upon in support of the exemption. This record must include at least the following information: (A) The MC -containing material in question; (B) The source of the objective data; (C) The testing protocol, results of testing, and/or analysis of the material for the release of MC; (D) A description of the operation exempted under subsection (4)(b)(i) of this section and how the data support the exemption; and (E) Other data relevant to the operations, materials, processing, or employee exposures covere d by the exemption.

(e) Unless otherwise specified in this subsection, all other requirements of this section must be complied with immediately. (15) Appendices . The information contained in the appendices does not, by itself, create any additional obligations not otherwise imposed or detract from any existing obligation. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens _____ Part G, Page 235 WAC 296 -62-07473 Appendix A. Substance Safety Data Sheet and Technical Guidelines for Methylene Chloride I. Substance data: 1. Molecular weight: 84.9. 2. Boiling point (760 mm Hg): 39.8 deg.C (104 deg.F). 3. Specific gravity (water = 1): 1.3. 4. Vapor density (air = 1 at boi ling point): 2.9. 5. Vapor pressure at 20 deg. C (68 deg. F): 350 mm Hg. 6. Solubility in water, g/100 g water at 20 deg. C (68 deg. F) = 1.32. 7. Appearance and odor: colorless liquid with a chloroform -like odor. D. Uses: MC is used as a solvent, espe cially where high volatility is required. It is a good solvent for oils, fats, waxes, resins, bitumen, rubber and cellulose acetate and is a useful paint stripper and degreaser. It is used in paint removers, in propellant mixtures for aerosol containers, as a solvent for plastics, as a degreasing agent, as an extracting agent in the pharmaceutical industry and as a blowing agent in polyurethane foams. Its solvent property is sometimes increased by mixing with methanol, petroleum naphtha or tetrachloroeth ylene. E. Appearance and odor: MC is a clear colorless liquid with a chloroform -like odor. It is slightly soluble in water and completely miscible with most organic solvents. F. Permissible exposure: Exposure may not exceed 25 parts MC per million parts of air (25 ppm) as an eight -hour time -weighted average (8 -hour TWA PEL) or 125 parts of MC per million parts of air (125 ppm) averaged over a 15 -minute period (STEL). II. Health Hazard Data A. MC can affect the body if it is inhaled or if the liquid comes in contact with the eyes or skin. It can also affect the body if it is swallowed. B. Effects of overexposure: 1. Short -term Exposure: MC is an anesthetic. Inhaling the vapor may cause mental confusion, light - headedness, nausea, vomiting, and headache. Continued exposure may cause increased light -headedness, staggering, unconsciousness, and even death. High vapor concentrations may also cause irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract. Exposure to MC may make the symptoms of angina (chest pains) wo rse. Skin exposure to liquid MC may cause irritation. If liquid MC remains on the skin, it may cause skin burns. Splashes of the liquid into the eyes may cause irritation. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 236 2. Long -term (chronic) exposure: The best evidence that MC causes cancer is from laboratory studies in which rats, mice and hamsters inhaled MC 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for 2 years. MC exposure produced lung and liver tumors in mice and mammary tumors in rats. No carcinogenic effects of MC were found in hamsters. There ar e also some human epidemiological studies which show an association between occupational exposure to MC and increases in biliary (bile duct) cancer and a type of brain cancer. Other epidemiological studies have not observed a relationship between MC expos ure and cancer. WISHA interprets these results to mean that there is suggestive (but not absolute) evidence that MC is a human carcinogen. C. Reporting signs and symptoms: You should inform your employer if you develop any signs or symptoms and suspect t hat they are caused by exposure to MC. D. Warning Properties: 1. Odor Threshold: Different authors have reported varying odor thresholds for MC. Kirk -Othmer and Sax both reported 25 to 50 ppm; Summer and May both reported 150 ppm; Spector reports 320 ppm . Patty, however, states that since one can become adapted to the odor, MC should not be considered to have adequate warning properties. 2. Eye Irritation Level: Kirk -Othmer reports that \"MC vapor is seriously damaging to the eyes.\" Sax agrees with Kirk -Othmer's statement. The ACGIH Documentation of TLVs states that irritation of the eyes has been observed in workers exposed to concentrations up to 5000 ppm. 3. Evaluation of Warning Properties: Since a wide range of MC odor thresholds are reported (25 -320 ppm), and human adaptation to the odor occurs, MC is considered to be a material with poor warning properties. III. Emergency First Aid Procedures In the event of emergency, institute first aid procedures and send for first aid or medical assistance. A. Eye and Skin Exposures: If there is a potential for liquid MC to come in contact with eye or skin, face shields and skin protective equipment must be provided and used. If liquid MC comes in contact with the eye, get medical attention. Contact lenses should not be worn when working with this chemical. B. Breathing: If a person breathes in large amounts of MC, move the exposed person to fresh air at once. If breathing has stopped, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Keep the affected person warm a nd at rest. Get medical attention as soon as possible. C. Rescue: Move the affected person from the hazardous exposure immediately. If the exposed person has been overcome, notify someone else and put into effect the established emergency rescue procedu res. Understand the facility's emergency rescue procedures and know the locations of rescue equipment before the need arises. Do not become a casualty yourself. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 237 IV. Respirators, Protective Clothing, and Eye Protection A. Respirators: Good industrial h ygiene practices recommend that engineering controls be used to reduce environmental concentrations to the permissible exposure level. However, there are some exceptions where respirators may be used to control exposure. Respirators may be used when engi neering and work -practice controls are not feasible, when such controls are in the process of being installed, or when these controls fail and need to be supplemented. Respirators may also be used for operations which require entry into tanks or closed ve ssels, and in emergency situations. If the use of respirators is necessary, the only respirators permitted are those that have been approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Supplied -air respirators are required becau se air -purifying respirators do not provide adequate respiratory protection against MC. In addition to respirator selection, a complete written respiratory protection program should be instituted which includes regular training, maintenance, inspection, c leaning, and evaluation. If you can smell MC while wearing a respirator, proceed immediately to fresh air. If you experience difficulty in breathing while wearing a respirator, tell your employer. B. Protective Clothing: Employees must be provided with and required to use impervious clothing, gloves, face shields (eight -inch minimum), and other appropriate protective clothing necessary to prevent repeated or prolonged skin contact with liquid MC or contact with vessels containing liquid MC. Any clothing which becomes wet with liquid MC should be removed immediately and not reworn until the employer has ensured that the protective clothing is fit for reuse. Contaminated protective clothing should be placed in a regulated area designated by the employer for removal of MC before the clothing is laundered or disposed of. Clothing and equipment should remain in the regulated area until all of the MC contamination has evaporated; clothing and equipment should then be laundered or disposed of as appropriate. C. Eye Protection: Employees should be provided with and required to use splash -proof safety goggles where liquid MC may contact the eyes. V. Housekeeping and Hygiene Facilities For purposes of complying with WAC 296-800-220 and 296-800-230, the following items should be emphasized: A. The workplace should be kept clean, o rderly, and in a sanitary condition. The employer should institute a leak and spill detection program for operations involving liquid MC in order to detect sources of fugitive MC emissions. B. Emergency drench showers and eyewash facilities are recommende d. These should be maintained in a sanitary condition. Suitable cleansing agents should also be provided to assure the effective removal of MC from the skin. C. Because of the hazardous nature of MC, contaminated protective clothing should be placed in a regulated area designated by the employer for removal of MC before the clothing is laundered or disposed of. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 238 VI. Precautions for Safe Use, Handling, and Storage A. Fire and Explosion Hazards: MC has no flash point in a conventional closed tester, but it forms flammable vapor -air mixtures at approximately 100 deg. C (212 deg.F), or higher. It has a lower explosion limit of 12%, and an upper explosion limit of 19% in air. It has an autoignition temperature of 556.1 deg. C (1033 deg. F), and a boiling point of 39.8 deg. C (104 deg.F). It is heavier than water with a specific gravity of 1.3. It is slightly soluble in water. B. Reactivity Hazards: Conditions contributing to the instability of MC are heat and moisture. Contact with strong oxidizers, caus tics, and chemically active metals such as aluminum or magnesium powder, sodium and potassium may cause fires and explosions. Special precautions: Liquid MC will attack some forms of plastics, rubber, and coatings. C. Toxicity: Liquid MC is painful and irritating if splashed in the eyes or if confined on the skin by gloves, clothing, or shoes. Vapors in high concentrations may cause narcosis and death. Prolonged exposure to vapors may cause cancer or exacerbate cardiac disease. D. Storage: Protect aga inst physical damage. Because of its corrosive properties, and its high vapor pressure, MC should be stored in plain, galvanized or lead lined, mild steel containers in a cool, dry, well -ventilated area away from direct sunlight, heat source and acute fir e hazards. E. Piping Material: All piping and valves at the loading or unloading station should be of material that is resistant to MC and should be carefully inspected prior to connection to the transport vehicle and periodically during the operation. F. Usual Shipping Containers: Glass bottles, 5 - and 55 -gallon steel drums, tank cars, and tank trucks. Note : This section addresses MC exposure in marine terminal and longshore employment only where leaking or broken packages allow MC exposure that is not a ddressed through compliance with WAC 296-56. G. Electrical Equipment: Electrical installations in Class I hazardous locations as defined in Article 500 of the Na tional Electrical Code, should be installed according to Article 501 of the code; and electrical equipment should be suitable for use in atmospheres containing MC vapors. See Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code (NFPA No. 325M), Chemical Safety Data She et SD -86 (Manufacturing Chemists' Association, Inc.). H. Firefighting: When involved in fire, MC emits highly toxic and irritating fumes such as phosgene, hydrogen chloride and carbon monoxide. Wear breathing apparatus and use water spray to keep fire -exposed containers cool. Water spray may be used to flush spills away from exposures. Extinguishing media are dry chemical, carbon dioxide, foam. For purposes of compliance with WAC 296-24-957, locations classified as hazardous due to the presence of MC shall be Class I. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 239 I. Spills and Leaks: Persons not wearing protective equipment and clothing should be restricted from areas of spills or leaks until cleanup has been completed. If MC has spilled or leaked, the following steps should be taken: 1. Remove all ignition sources. 2. Ventilate area of spill or leak. 3. Collect for reclamation or absorb in vermiculite, dry sand, earth, or a similar material. J. Methods of Waste Disposal: Small spills should be absorbed onto sand and taken to a safe area for atmospheric evaporation. Incineration is the preferred method for disposal of large quantities by mixing with a combustible solvent and spraying into an incinerator equipped with acid scrubbers to remove hydrogen chloride gases formed. Complete combustion will convert carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. Care should be taken for the presence of phosgene. K. You should not keep food, beverage, or smoking materials, or eat or smoke in regulated areas where MC concentrations are above the permissible exposure limits. L. Portable heating units should not be used in confined areas where MC is used. M. Ask your supervisor where MC is used in your work area and for any addit ional plant safety and health rules. VII. Medical Requirements Your employer is required to offer you the opportunity to participate in a medical surveillance program if you are exposed to MC at concentrations at or above the action level (12.5 ppm 8 -hour TWA) for more than 30 days a year or at concentrations exceeding the PELs (25 ppm 8 -hour TWA or 125 ppm 15 -minute STEL) for more than 10 days a year. If you are exposed to MC at concentrations over either of the PELs, your employer will also be required t o have a physician or other licensed health care professional ensure that you are able to wear the respirator that you are assigned. Your employer must provide all medical examinations relating to your MC exposure at a reasonable time and place and at no cost to you. VIII. Monitoring and Measurement Procedures A. Exposure above the Permissible Exposure Limit: 1. Eight -hour exposure evaluation: Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure under this section are best taken with consec utive samples covering the full shift. Air samples must be taken in the employee's breathing zone. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 240 2. Monitoring techniques: The sampling and analysis under this section may be performed by collection of the MC vapor on two charcoal adsorption tubes in series or other composition adsorption tubes, with subsequent chemical analysis. Sampling and analysis may also be performed by instruments such as real -time continuous monitoring systems, portable direct reading instruments, or passive dosimeters as lon g as measurements taken using these methods accurately evaluate the concentration of MC in employees' breathing zones. OSHA method 80 is an example of a validated method of sampling and analysis of MC. Copies of this method are available from OSHA or can be downloaded from the Internet at http://www.osha.gov. The employer has the obligation of selecting a monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of the standard under their unique field conditions. The standard requires that the method of monitoring must be accurate, to a 95 percent confidence level, to plus or minus 25 percent for concentrations of MC at or above 25 ppm, and to plus or minus 35 percent for concentrations at or below 25 ppm. In addition to OSHA method 80, the re are numerous other methods available for monitoring for MC in the workplace. B. Since many of the duties relating to employee exposure are dependent on the results of measurement procedures, employers must assure that the evaluation of employee exposure is performed by a technically qualified person. IX. Observation of Monitoring Your employer is required to perform measurements that are representative of your exposure to MC and you or your designated representative are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are entitled to observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure, and to record the results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking place in an area where respirators or personal protective clothing and equipment are require d to be worn, you or your representative must also be provided with, and must wear, protective clothing and equipment. Access To Information A. Your employer is required to inform you of the information contained in this Appendix. In addition, your employ er must instruct you in the proper work -practices for using MC, emergency procedures, and the correct use of protective equipment. B. Your employer is required to determine whether you are being exposed to MC. You or your representative has the right to o bserve employee measurements and to record the results obtained. Your employer is required to inform you of your exposure. If your employer determines that you are being over exposed, he or she is required to inform you of the actions which are being tak en to reduce your exposure to within permissible exposure limits. C. Your employer is required to keep records of your exposures and medical examinations. These records must be kept by the employer for at least thirty (30) years. D. Your employer is requi red to release your exposure and medical records to you or your representative upon your request. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 241 E. Your employer is required to provide labels and safety data sheets (SDS) for all materials, mixtures or solutions composed of greater than 0.1 percent MC . These materials, mixtures or solutions would be classified and labeled in accordance with WAC 296-901-140. X. Common Operations and Controls The following list includes some common operations in which exposure to MC may occur and control methods which may be effective in each case: Operations Controls Use as solvent in paint and varnish removers cold cleaning and ultrasonic cleaning, and as a solvent in furnit ure stripping. General dilution ventilation; local; manufacture of aerosols; cold cleaning exhaust ventilation; personal protective equipment; substitution. Use as solvent in vapor degreasing. Process enclosure; local exhaust ventilation, chilling coils; substitution Use as a secondary refrigerant in air. Scientific testing. General dilution ventilation; local conditioning and exhaust ventilation; personal protective equipment. 296 -62-07475 Appendix B. Medical Surveillance for Methylene Chloride Entry Inhalation . . Methylene Chloride (MC) is primarily an inhalation hazard. The principal acute hazardous effects are the depressant action on the central nervous system, possible cardiac toxicity and possible liver toxi city. The range of CNS effects are from decreased eye/hand coordination and decreased performance in vigilance tasks to narcosis and even death of individuals exposed at very high doses. Cardiac toxicity is due to the metabolism of MC to carbon monoxide, and the effects of carbon monoxide on heart tissue. Carbon monoxide displaces oxygen in the blood, decreases the oxygen available to heart tissue, increasing the risk of damage to the heart, which may result in heart attacks in susceptible individuals. Susceptible individuals include persons with heart disease and those with risk factors for heart disease. Elevated liver enzymes and irritation to the respiratory passages and eyes have also been reported for both humans and experimental animals exposed t o MC vapors. MC is metabolized to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide via two separate pathways. Through the first pathway, MC is metabolized to carbon monoxide as an end -product via the P -450 mixed function oxidase pathway located in the microsomal fracti on of the cell. This biotransformation of MC to carbon monoxide occurs through the process of microsomal oxidative dechlorination which takes place primarily in the liver. The amount of conversion to carbon monoxide is significant as measured by the conc entration of carboxyhemoglobin, up to 12% measured in the blood following occupational exposure of up to 610 ppm. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 242 Through the second pathway, MC is metabolized to carbon dioxide as an end product (with formaldehyde and formic acid as metabolic intermedia tes) via the glutathione dependent enzyme found in the cytosolic fraction of the liver cell. Metabolites along this pathway are believed to be associated with the carcinogenic activity of MC. MC has been tested for carcinogenicity in several laboratory ro dents. These rodent studies indicate that there is clear evidence that MC is carcinogenic to male and female mice and female rats. Based on epidemiologic studies, OSHA has concluded that there is suggestive evidence of increased cancer risk in MC -related worker populations. The epidemiological evidence is consistent with the finding of excess cancer in the experimental animal studies. NIOSH regards MC as a potential occupational carcinogen and the International Agency for Research Cancer (IARC) classifi es MC as an animal carcinogen. OSHA considers MC as a suspected human carcinogen. III. Medical Signs and Symptoms of Acute Exposure Skin exposure to liquid MC may cause irritation or skin burns. Liquid MC can also be irritating to the eyes. MC is also a bsorbed through the skin and may contribute to the MC exposure by inhalation. At high concentrations in air, MC may cause nausea, vomiting, light - headedness, numbness of the extremities, changes in blood enzyme levels, and breathing problems, leading to bronchitis and pulmonary edema, unconsciousness and even death. At lower concentrations in air, MC may cause irritation to the skin, eye, and respiratory tract and occasionally headache and nausea. Perhaps the greatest problem from exposure to low concent rations of MC is the CNS effects on coordination and alertness that may cause unsafe operations of machinery and equipment, leading to self -injury or accidents. Low levels and short duration exposures do not seem to produce permanent disability, but chron ic exposures to MC have been demonstrated to produce liver toxicity in animals, and therefore, the evidence is suggestive for liver toxicity in humans after chronic exposure. Chronic exposure to MC may also cause cancer. IV. Surveillance and Preventive Co nsiderations As discussed above, MC is classified as a suspect or potential human carcinogen. It is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and a skin, eye and respiratory tract irritant. At extremely high concentrations, MC has caused liver damage in animals. MC principally affects the CNS, where it acts as a narcotic. The observation of the symptoms characteristic of CNS depression, along with a physical examination, provides the best detection of early neurological disorders. Since exposure to MC also increases the carboxyhemoglobin level in the blood, ambient carbon monoxide levels would have an additive effect on that carboxyhemoglobin level. Based on such information, a periodic post - shift carboxyhemoglobin test as an index of the presence of carbon monoxide in the blood is recommended, but not required, for medical surveillance. Based on the animal evidence and three epidemiologic studies previously mentioned, OSHA concludes that MC is a suspect human carcinogen. The medical surveillance prog ram is designed to observe exposed workers on a regular basis. While the medical surveillance program cannot detect MC -induced cancer at a preneoplastic stage, OSHA anticipates that, as in the past, early detection and treatments of cancers leading to enh anced survival rates will continue to evolve. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 243 A. Medical and Occupational History: The medical and occupational work history plays an important role in the initial evaluation of workers exposed to MC. It is therefore extremely important for the examinin g physician or other licensed health care professional to evaluate the MC -exposed worker carefully and completely and to focus the examination on MC's potentially associated health hazards. The medical evaluation must include an annual detailed work and m edical history with special emphasis on cardiac history and neurological symptoms. An important goal of the medical history is to elicit information from the worker regarding potential signs or symptoms associated with increased levels of carboxyhemoglobin due to the presence of carbon monoxide in the blood. Physicians or other licensed health care professionals should ensure that the smoking history of all MC exposed employees is known. Exposure to MC may cause a significant increase in carboxyhemoglobin level in all exposed persons. However, smokers as well as workers with anemia or heart disease and those concurrently exposed to carbon monoxide are at especially high risk of toxic effects because of an already reduced oxygen carrying capacity of the bl ood. A comprehensive or interim medical and work history should also include occurrence of headache, dizziness, fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, pain in the limbs, and irritation of the skin and eyes. In addition, it is important for the physicia n or other licensed health care professional to become familiar with the operating conditions in which exposure to MC is likely to occur. The physician or other licensed health care professional also must become familiar with the signs and symptoms that m ay indicate that a worker is receiving otherwise unrecognized and exceptionally high exposure levels of MC. An example of a medical and work history that would satisfy the requirement for a comprehensive or interim work history is represented by the follow ing: The following is a list of recommended questions and issues for the self - administered questionnaire for methylene chloride exposure.

Physical Examination The complete physical examination, when coupled with the medical and occupational history, assists the physician or other licensed health care professional in detecting pre -existing conditions that might place the employee at increased risk, and establishes a baseline for future health monitoring. These examinations should include: 1. Clinical impressions of the nervous system, cardiovascular function and pulmonary function, with additional tests conducted where indicated or determined by the examining physician or other licensed health care professional to be necessary. 2. An evaluati on of the advisability of the worker using a respirator, because the use of certain respirators places an additional burden on the cardiopulmonary system. It is necessary for the attending physician or other licensed health care professional to evaluate t he cardiopulmonary function of these workers, in order to inform the employer in a written medical opinion of the worker's ability or fitness to work in an area requiring the use of certain types of respiratory protective equipment. The presence of facial hair or scars that might interfere with the worker's ability to wear certain types of respirators should also be noted during the examination and in the written medical opinion. Because of the importance of lung function to workers required to wear certai n types of respirators to protect themselves from MC exposure, these workers must receive an assessment of pulmonary function before they begin to wear a negative pressure respira tor and at least annually thereafter. The recommended pulmonary function tes ts include measurement of the employee's forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1), as well as calculation of the ratios of FEV 1 to FVC, and the ratios of measured FVC and measured FEV 1 to expected respective values correct ed for variation due to age, sex, race, and height. Pulmonary function evaluation must be conducted by a physician or other licensed health care professional experienced in pulmonary function tests.

Studies 1. Pulmonary function testing 2. Electrocardiogram An evaluation of the oxygen carrying capaci ty of the blood of employees (for example by measured red blood cell volume) is considered useful, especially for workers acutely exposed to MC. It is also recommended, but not required, that end of shift carboxyhemoglobin levels be determined periodicall y, and any level above 3% for nonsmokers and above 10% for smokers should prompt an investigation of the worker and his workplace. This test is recommended because MC is metabolized to CO, which combines strongly with hemoglobin, resulting in a reduced ca pacity of the blood to transport oxygen in the body. This is of particular concern for cigarette smokers because they already have a diminished hemoglobin capacity due to the presence of CO in cigarette smoke. C. Additional Examinations and Referrals 1. Examination by a Specialist When a worker examination reveals unexplained symptoms or signs (i.e. in the physical examination or in the laboratory tests), follow -up medical examinations are necessary to assure that MC exposure is not adversely affecting the worker's health. When the examining physician or other licensed health care professional finds it necessary, additional tests should be included to determine the nature of the medical problem and the underlying cause. Where relevant, the worker should b e sent to a specialist for further testing and treatment as deemed necessary. The final rule requires additional investigations to be covered and it also permits physicians or other licensed health care professionals to add appropriate or necessary tests to improve the diagnosis of disease should such tests become available in the future. 2. Emergencies The examination of workers exposed to MC in an emergency should be directed at the organ systems most likely to be affected. If the worker has received a severe acute exposure, hospitalization may be required to assure proper medical intervention. It is not possible to precisely define \"severe,\" but the physician or other licensed health care professional's judgment should not merely rest on hospitalizatio n. If the worker has suffered significant conjunctival, oral, or nasal irritation, respiratory distress, or discomfort, the physician or other licensed health care professional should instigate appropriate follow -up procedures. These include attention to the eyes, lungs and the neurological system. The frequency of follow -up examinations should be determined by the attending physician or other licensed health care professional. This testing permits the early identification essential to proper medical ma nagement of such workers. D. Employer Obligations The employer is required to provide the responsible physician or other licensed health care professional and any specialists involved in a diagnosis with the following information: a copy of the MC standar d including relevant appendices, a description of the affected employee's duties as they relate to their exposure to MC; an estimate of the employee's exposure including duration (e.g., 15hr/wk ., ., full Chapter Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 250 time); a description of any personal protective equipment used by the employee, including respirators; and the results of any previous medical determinations for the affected employee related to MC exposure to the extent that this information is within the employer's control. E. Physicians' or Other Licensed Health Care Professionals' Obligations The standard requires the employer to ensure that the physician or other licensed health care professional provides a written statement to the employee and the employer. This statement shou ld contain the physician's or licensed health care professional's opinion as to whether the employee has any medical condition placing him or her at increased risk of impaired health from exposure to MC or use of respirators, as appropriate. The physician or other licensed health care professional should also state their opinion regarding any restrictions that should be placed on the employee's exposure to MC or upon the use of protective clothing or equipment such as respirators. If the employee wears a respirator as a result of their exposure to MC, the physician or other licensed health care professional's opinion should also contain a statement regarding the suitability of the employee to wear the type of respirator assigned. Furthermore, the employee should be informed by the physician or other licensed health care professional about the cancer risk of MC and about risk factors for heart disease, and the potential for exacerbation of underlying heart disease by exposure to MC through its metabolism to carbon monoxide. Finally, the physician or other licensed health care professional should inform the employer that the employee has been told the results of the medical examination and of any medical conditions which require further explanation or treatme nt. This written opinion must not contain any information on specific findings or diagnosis unrelated to employee's occupational exposures. The purpose in requiring the examining physician or other licensed health care professional to supply the employer with a written opinion is to provide the employer with a medical basis to assist the employer in placing employees initially, in assuring that their health is not being impaired by exposure to MC, and to assess the employee's ability to use any required pr otective equipment. WAC 296 -62-07477 Appendix C. Questions and answers --methylene chloride in furniture stripping. (Adapted from NIOSH Publication No. 93 -133) Introduction This appendix answers commonly asked questions about the hazards from exposure to methylene chloride. It also describes approaches to controlling methylene chloride exposure during the most common furniture stripping processes. Although these approaches were developed and field tested by the National Institute of Occupational Safety a nd Health, each setting requires custom installation because of the different air flow interferences at each site. 1. What is the Stripping Solution Base? Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 251 The most common active ingredient in paint removers is a chemical called methylene chloride. Methy lene chloride is present in the paint remover to penetrate, blister, and finally lift the old finish. Other chemicals in paint removers work to accelerate the stripping process, to retard evaporation, and to act as thickening agents. These other ingredie nts may include: methanol, toluene, acetone, or paraffin.1 2. Methylene Chloride Bad for Me? Exposure to methylene chloride may cause short -term health effects or long -term health effects. Short -Term (Acute) Health Effects Exposure to high levels of pa int removers over short periods of time can cause irritation to the skin, eyes, mucous membranes, and respiratory tracts. Other symptoms of high exposure are dizziness, headache, and lack of coordination. The occurrence of any of these symptoms indicates that you are being exposed to high levels of methylene chloride. At the onset of any of these symptoms, you should leave the work area, get some fresh air, and determine why the levels were high. A portion of inhaled methylene chloride is converted by th e body to carbon monoxide, which can lower the blood's ability to carry oxygen. When the solvent is used properly, however, the levels of carbon monoxide should not be hazardous. Individuals with cardiovascular or pulmonary health problems should check w ith their physician before using the paint stripper. Individuals experiencing severe symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pains should obtain proper medical care immediately.1 Long -Term (Chronic) Health Effects Methylene chloride has been shown t o cause cancer in certain laboratory animal tests. The available human studies do not provide the necessary information to determine whether methylene chloride causes cancer in humans. However, as a result of the animal studies, methylene chloride is con sidered a potential occupational carcinogen. There is also considerable indirect evidence to suggest that workers exposed to methylene chloride may be at an increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease. Therefore, it is prudent to minimize exposur e to solvent vapors.3 3. What does the Methylene Chloride Standard Require? On January 10, 1997, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration published a new regulation for methylene chloride. The standard establishes an eight -hour time -weighted aver age exposure limit of 25 parts per million (ppm), as well as a short -term exposure limit of 125 ppm determined from a 15 minute sampling period. That is a reduction from the current WISHA limit of 100 ppm. The standard also sets a 12.5 ppm action level ( a level that would trigger periodic exposure monitoring and medical surveillance provisions).2 WISHA adopted an identical standard on [date]. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that methylene chloride be regarded as a \"pot ential occupational carcinogen.\" NIOSH further recommends that occupational exposure to methylene chloride be controlled to the lowest feasible limit. This recommendation was based on the observation of cancers and tumors in both rats and mice exposed to methylene chloride in air.5 Chapter 296 -62 WAC Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 252 4. How Can I Be Exposed to Methylene Chloride while Stripping Furniture? Methylene chloride can be inhaled when vapors are in the air. Inhalation of the methylene chloride vapors is generally the most important source of exp osure. Methylene chloride evaporates quicker than most chemicals. The odor threshold of methylene chloride is 300 ppm.6 Therefore, once you smell methylene chloride, you are being over -exposed. Pouring, moving, or stirring the chemical will increase th e rate of evaporation. Methylene chloride can be absorbed through the skin either by directly touching the chemical or through your gloves. Methylene chloride can be swallowed if it gets on your hands, clothes, or beard, or if food or drinks become contam inated. 5. How Can Breathing Exposures be Reduced? Install a Local Exhaust Ventilation System Local exhaust ventilation can be used to control exposures. Local exhaust ventilation systems capture contaminated air from the source before it spreads into the workers' breathing zone.7 If engineering controls are not effective, only a self -contained breathing apparatus equipped with a full face piece and operated in a positive -pressure mode or a supplied -air respirator affords the level of protection. Air -purifying respirators such as gas masks with organic vapor canisters can only be used for escape situations.8 These gas masks are not suitable for normal work situations because methylene chloride is poorly absorbed by the canister filtering material. A loca l exhaust system consists of the following: a hood, a fan, ductwork, and a replacement air system.9,10,11 Two processes are commonly used in furniture stripping: flow -over and dip tanks. For flow -over systems there are two common local exhaust controls for methylene chloride - a slot hood and a down draft hood. A slot hood of different design is most often used for dip tanks. (See Figures 1, 2, and 3.) The hood is made of sheet metal and connected to the tank. All designs require a centrifugal fan to exhaust the fumes, ductwork connecting the hood and the fan, and a replacement air system to bring conditioned air into the building to replace the air exhausted. In constructing or designing a slot or down draft hood, use the following data: Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 253 FIGURE 1 -- SLOT HOOD Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 254 FIGURE 2 -- DOWNDRAFT HOOD Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 255 FIGURE 3 -- SLOT HOOD FOR DIP TANK Safe Work -practices Workers can lower exposures by decreasing their access to the methylene chloride.12 1) Turn on dip tank control system several minutes before e ntering the stripping area. 2) Avoid unnecessary transferring or moving of the stripping solution. 3) Keep face out of the air stream between the solution -covered furniture and the exhaust system. 4) Keep face out of vapor zone above the stripping solution and the dip tank. 5) Retrieve dropped items with a long handled tool. 6) Keep the solution -recycling system off when not in use. Cover reservoir for recycling system. 7) Cover dip tank when not in use. 8) Provide adequate ventilation for rinse area. How Can Skin Exposures Be Reduced? Skin exposures can be reduced by wearing gloves whenever you are in contact with the stripping solution.13 1) Two gloves should be worn. The inner glove should be made from polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol (e.g., Silver Shield\u00ae, or 4H\u00ae). This material, however, does not provide good physical resistance against tears, so an outer glove made from nitrile or neoprene should be worn. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 256 2) Shoulder -length gloves will be more protective. 3) Change gloves before the break -throu gh time occurs. Rotate several pairs of gloves throughout the day. Let the gloves dry in a warm well -ventilated area at least over night before reuse. 4) Keep gloves clean by rinsing often. Keep gloves in good condition. Inspect the gloves before use f or pin -holes, cracks, thin spots, and stiffer than normal or sticky surfaces. 5) Wear a face shield or goggles to protect face and eyes. 6. What Other Problems Can Occur? Stripping Solution Temperature Most manufacturers of stripping solution recommend con trolling the solution to a temperature of 70\u00b0F. This temperature is required for the wax in the solution to form a vapor barrier on top of the solution to keep the solution from evaporating too quickly. If the temperature is too high, the wax will not fo rm the vapor barrier. If it is too cold, the wax will solidify and separate from the solvent causing increased evaporation. Use a belt heater to heat the solution to the correct temperature. Call your solution manufacturer for the correct temperature fo r your solution.14 Make -Up Air Air will enter a building in an amount to equal the amount of air exhausted whether or not provision is made for this replacement. If a local exhaust system is added a make -up or replacement air system must be added to repla ce the air removed. Without a replacement air system, air will enter the building through cracks causing uncontrollable eddy currents. If the building perimeter is tightly sealed, it will prevent the air from entering and severely decrease the amount exh austed from the ventilation system. This will cause the building to be under negative pressure and decrease the performance of the exhaust system.15 Dilution Ventilation With general or dilution ventilation, uncontaminated air is moved through the workroo m by means of fans or open windows, which dilutes the pollutants in the air. Dilution ventilation does not provide effective protection to other workers and does not confine the methylene chloride vapors to one area.16 Phosgene Poisoning from Use of Keros ene Heaters Do not use kerosene heaters or other open flame heaters while stripping furniture. Use of kerosene heaters in connection with methylene chloride can create lethal or dangerous concentrations of phosgene. Methylene chloride vapor is mixed with the air used for the combustion of kerosene in kerosene stoves. The vapor thus passes through the flames, coming into close contact with carbon monoxide at high temperatures. Any chlorine formed by decomposition may, under these conditions, react with c arbon monoxide and form phosgene.17 Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part G General Occupational Health Standards Carcinogens (Specific) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____ Part G, Page 257 REFERENCES 1Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance and Consumer Product Safety Commission [1990].

The inside of worker carrying vehicles must be washed or vacuumed and wiped down at least weekly during the period of thiram use. (c) Personal protective measures. Clothing must be worn by workers to reduce skin contact with thiram to the legs, arms and torso. For those workers who have thiram skin irritations, exposed areas of the body must be protected by a suitable barrier cream. Clothing worn by workers must be washed or changed at least every other day. Only impervious gloves ma y be worn by workers. Workers hands should be clean of thiram before placing them into gloves. Thiram applicators must be provided with and use respiratory protection in accordance with chapter 296-842 WAC, Respirators , disposable coveralls or rubber slickers or other impervious clothing, rubberized boots, head covers and rubberized gloves. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 2 Nursery workers, other than applicators, who are likely to be exposed to thiram must be provided with and use disposable coveralls or rubber slickers or other impervious clothing, impervious footwear and gloves, and head covers in accordance with WAC 296-800-160, unless showers have been provided and are used. Eye protection according to WAC 296-800-160, must be provided and worn by workers who may be exposed to splashes of thiram during spraying, plug bundling, belt line grading and plugging or other operations. Item (viii) of this subdivision need not be complied with where pressurized emergency eye wash fountains are within 10 seconds travel time of the work location. (Approved respirator - see chapter 296-842 WAC, Respirators. ) A dust mask must be worn, when planting large seedlings, to avoid mouth and face contact with the thiram treated plant unless equally effective measures or planting practices have been established. (d) Food handling. Food snacks, beverages, smoking materials, or any other item which is consumed must not be stored or consumed in th e packing area of the nursery. Worker carrying vehicles must have a clean area for carrying lunches. The clean area of the vehicle must be elevated from the floor and not used to carry other than food or other consumable items. The carrying of lunches, foo d or other consumable items in tree planting bags is prohibited. Care must be taken to ensure that worker exposure to thiram spray, including downwind driftings, is minimized or eliminated. When bags that contained thiram or thiram treated seedlings are bu rned, prevent worker exposure to the smoke. (e) Thiram use and handling. Thiram treated seedlings must be allowed to dry or stabilize prior to packing. Seedlings must be kept moist during packing and whenever possible during planting operations. Floors, where thiram is used, must not be dry swept but instead vacuumed, washed or otherwise cleaned at least daily. Silica chips used to cover thiram treated seedling plugs must be removed at the nursery. (f) Training. Each worker engaged in operations where exposure to t hiram may occur must be provided training on the hazards of thiram, as well as the necessary precautions for its safe use and handling. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 3 The training must include instruction in: (A) The nature of the health hazard(s) from exposure to thiram including specifi cally the potential for alcohol intolerance, drug interaction, and skin irritation; (B) The specific nature of operations which could result in exposure to thiram and the necessary protective steps; (C) The purpose for, proper use, and limitations of protective de vices including respirators and clothing; (D) The necessity for and requirements of good personal hygiene; and (E) A review of the thiram rules at the worker's first training and indoctrination, and annually thereafter.

(a) This section applies to all occupational exposure to lead, except as provided in subdivision (1)(b). (b) This section does not apply to the constructio n industry or to agricultural operations covered by chapter 296-307 WAC. (2) Definitions as applicable to this part . (a) Action level . Employee exposure, without regard to the use of respirators, to an airborne concentration of lead of thirty micrograms per cubic meter of air (30 \u00b5g/m3) averaged over an eight -hour period. (b) Director The director of the department of labor and industries. (c) Lead . Metallic lead, all inorganic lead compounds, and organic lead soaps. Excluded from this definition are all other organic lead compounds. (3) General requirements . (a) Employers will assess the hazards of lead in the work place and provide information to the employees about the hazards of th e lead exposures to which they may be exposed. (b) Information provided must include: Exposure monitoring (including employee notification); Written compliance programs; Respiratory protection programs; Personnel protective equipment and housekeeping; Medical surveillance and examinations; Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 4 Training requirements; Recordkeeping requirements. (4) Permissible exposure limit (PEL) . (a) The employer must ensure that no employee is exposed to lead at concentrations greater than fifty micrograms per cubic meter of air (50 \u00b5g /m3) averaged over an eight -hour period. (b) If an employee is exposed to lead for more than eight hours in any work day, the permissible exposure limit, as a time weighted average (TWA) for that day, must be reduced according to the following formula: Maximum permissible limit (in \u00b5g/m3) = 400 \u00f7 hours worked in the day. (c) When respirators are used to supplement engineering and work practice controls to comply with the PEL and all the requirements of subsection (7) have been met, employee exposure, for the purpos e of determining whether the employer has complied with the PEL, may be considered to be at the level provided by the protection factor of the respirator for those periods the respirator is worn. Those periods may be averaged with exposure levels during p eriods when respirators are not worn to determine the employee's daily TWA exposure. (5) Exposure monitoring . (a) General. For the purposes of subsection (5), employee exposure is that exposure which would occur if the employee were not using a respirator. With th e exception of monitoring under subdivision (5)(c), the employer must collect full shift (for at least seven continuous hours) personal samples including at least one sample for each shift for each job classification in each work area. Full shift personal samples must be representative of the monitored employee's regular, daily exposure to lead. (b) Initial determination. Each employer who has a workplace or work operation covered by this standard must determine if any employee may be exposed to lead at or abo ve the action level. (c) Basis of initial determination. The employer must monitor employee exposures and must base initial determinations on the employee exposure monitoring results and any of the following, relevant considerations: (A) Any information, observati ons, or calculations which would indicate employee exposure to lead; (B) Any previous measurements of airborne lead; and (C) Any employee complaints of symptoms which may be attributable to exposure to lead. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 5 Monitoring for the initial determination may be limite d to a representative sample of the exposed employees who the employer reasonably believes are exposed to the greatest airborne concentrations of lead in the workplace. Measurements of airborne lead made in the preceding twelve months may be used to satisf y the requirement to monitor under item (5)(c)(i) if the sampling and analytical methods used meet the accuracy and confidence levels of subdivision (5)(i) of this section. (d) Positive initial determination and initial monitoring. Where a determination conduc ted under subdivision (5)(b) and (5)(c) of this section shows the possibility of any employee exposure at or above the action level, the employer must conduct monitoring which is representative of the exposure for each employee in the workplace who is expo sed to lead. Measurements of airborne lead made in the preceding twelve months may be used to satisfy this requirement if the sampling and analytical methods used meet the accuracy and confidence levels of subdivision (5)(i) of this section. (e) Negative initi al determination. Where a determination, conducted under subdivisions (5)(b) and (5)(c) of this section is made that no employee is exposed to airborne concentrations of lead at or above the action level, the employer must make a written record of such de termination. The record must include at least the information specified in subdivision (5)(c) of this section and must also include the date of determination, location within the worksite, and the name and social security number of each employee monitored . (f) Frequency. If the initial monitoring reveals employee exposure to be below the action level the measurements need not be repeated except as otherwise provided in subdivision (5)(g) of this section. If the initial determination or subsequent monitoring re veals employee exposure to be at or above the action level but below the permissible exposure limit the employer must repeat monitoring in accordance with this subsection at least every six months. The employer must continue monitoring at the required fre quency until at least two consecutive measurements, taken at least seven days apart, are below the action level at which time the employer may discontinue monitoring for that employee except as otherwise provided in subdivision (5)(g) of this section. If the initial monitoring reveals that employee exposure is above the permissible exposure limit the employer must repeat monitoring quarterly. The employer must continue monitoring at the required frequency until at least two consecutive measurements, taken at least seven days apart, are below the PEL but at or above the action level at which time the employer must repeat monitoring for that employee at the frequency specified in item (5)(f)(ii), except as otherwise provided in subdivision (5)(g) of this sect ion. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 6 (g) Additional monitoring. Whenever there has been a production, process, control or personnel change which may result in new or additional exposure to lead, or whenever the employer has any other reason to suspect a change which may result in new or a dditional exposures to lead, additional monitoring in accordance with this subsection shall be conducted. (h) Employee notification. Within five working days after the receipt of monitoring results, the employer must notify each employee in writing of the resu lts which represent that employee's exposure. Whenever the results indicate that the representative employee exposure, without regard to respirators, exceeds the permissible exposure limit, the employer must include in the written notice a statement that t he permissible exposure limit was exceeded and a description of the corrective action taken or to be taken to reduce exposure to or below the permissible exposure limit. (i) Reserved. (j) Accuracy of measurement. The employer must use a method of monitoring and analysis which has an accuracy (to a confidence level of ninety -five percent) of not less than plus or minus twenty percent for airborne concentrations of lead equal to or greater than 30 \u00b5g/m3. (6) Methods of compliance . (a) Engineering and work practice controls. Where any employee is exposed to lead above the permissible exposure limit for more than thirty days per year, the employer must implement engineering and work practice controls (including administrative controls) to reduce and maintain employee exposure to lead in accordance with the implementation schedule in Table I below, except to the extent that the employer can demonstrate that such controls are not feasible. Wherever the engineering and work practice controls which can be instituted are not suffi cient to reduce employee exposure to or below the permissible exposure limit, the employer must nonetheless use them to reduce exposures to the lowest feasible level and must supplement them by the use of respiratory protection which complies with the requ irements of subsection (7) of this section. Where any employee is exposed to lead above the permissible exposure limit, but for thirty days or less per year, the employer must implement engineering controls to reduce exposures to 200 \u00b5g/m3, but thereafter may implement any combination of engineering, work practice (including administrative controls), and respiratory controls to reduce and maintain employee exposure to lead to or below 50 \u00b5g/m3. Table 1 Industry Compliance dates1 (50 g/m3) Lead chemicals, secondary copper smelting Nonferrous foundries Brass and bronze ingot manufacture. July 19, 1996 July 19, 19962 6 years3 Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 7 1 Calculated by counting from the date the stay on implementation of subsection (6)(a) was lifted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for th e District of Columbia, the number of years specified in the 1978 lead standard and subsequent amendments for compliance with the PEL of 50 \u00b5g/m3 for exposure to airborne concentrations of lead levels for the particular industry. 2 Large nonferrous foundri es (20 or more employees) are required to achieve the PEL of 50 \u00b5g/m3 by means of engineering and work practice controls. Small nonferrous foundries (fewer than 20 employees) are required to achieve an 8 -hour TWA of 75 \u00b5g/m3 by such controls. 3 Expressed as the number of years from the date on which the Court lifts the stay on the implementation of subsection (6)(a) for this industry for employers to achieve a lead in air concentration of 75 \u00b5g/m3. Compliance with subsection (6) in this industry is determ ined by a compliance directive that incorporates elements from the settlement agreement between OSHA and representatives of the industry. (b) Respiratory protection. Where engineering and work practice controls do not reduce employee exposure to or below the 50 \u00b5g/m3 permissible exposure limit, the employer must supplement these controls with respirators in accordance with subsection (7). (c) Compliance program. Each employer must establish and implement a written compliance program to reduce exposures to or below the permissible exposure limit, and interim levels if applicable, solely by means of engineering and work practice controls in accordance with the implementation schedule in subdivision (6)(a). Written plans for these compliance programs must include at l east the following: (A) A description of each operation in which lead is emitted; e.g., machinery used, material processed, controls in place, crew size, employee job responsibilities, operating procedures and maintenance practices; (B) A description of the specif ic means that will be employed to achieve compliance, including engineering plans and studies used to determine methods selected for controlling exposure to lead; (C) A report of the technology considered in meeting the permissible exposure limit; (D) Air monitori ng data which documents the source of lead emissions; (E) A detailed schedule for implementation of the program, including documentation such as copies of purchase orders for equipment, construction contracts, etc.; (F) A work practice program which includes items required under subsections (8), (9) and (10) of this regulation; (G) An administrative control schedule required by subdivision (6)(f), if applicable; and (H) Other relevant information. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 8 Written programs must be submitted upon request to the director, and must be available at the worksite for examination and copying by the director, any affected employee or authorized employee representatives. Written programs must be revised and updated at least every six months to reflect the current status of the program. (d) Mechanical ventilation. When ventilation is used to control exposure, measurements which demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in controlling exposure, such as capture velocity, duct velocity, or static pressure must be made at least every three months. Measurements of the system's effectiveness in controlling exposure must be made within five days of any change in production, process, or control which might result in a change in employee exposure to lead. Recirculation of air. If air from exhaust vent ilation is recirculated into the workplace, the employer must ensure that (A) the system has a high efficiency filter with reliable back -up filter; and (B) controls to monitor the concentration of lead in the return air and to bypass the recirculation syst em automatically if it fails are installed, operating, and maintained. (e) Administrative controls. If administrative controls are used as a means of reducing employees TWA exposure to lead, the employer must establish and implement a job rotation schedule wh ich includes: Name or identification number of each affected employee; Duration and exposure levels at each job or work station where each affected employee is located; and Any other information which may be useful in assessing the reliability of administr ative controls to reduce exposure to lead. (7) Respiratory protection . (a) General. For employees who use respirators required by this section, the employer must provide each employee an appropriate respirator that complies with the requirements of this subsectio n. Respirators must be used during: Periods necessary to install or implement engineering or work -practice controls; Work operations for which engineering and work -practice controls are not sufficient to reduce exposures to or below the permissible exposu re limit; Periods when an employee requests a respirator. (b) Respirator program. The employer must develop, implement and maintain a respiratory protection program as required by Chapter 296-842 WAC, Respirators, which covers each employee required by this chapter to use a respirator. If an employee has difficulty breathing during fit testing or respirator use, the employer must provide the employee with a medical ex amination as required by subsection (11)(c)(ii)(C) of this section to determine whether or not the employee can use a respirator while performing the required duty. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 9 (c) Respirator selection. The employer must: Select and provide to employees appropriate res pirators according to this section and WAC 296-842-13005 found in the respirator rule. Provide employees with a powered air -purifying respirator (PAPR) instead of a negative -pressure respirator selected when an employee chooses to use a PAPR and it provides adequate protection to the employee. Provide employees with full -facepiece respirators instead of half -facepiece respirators for protection against lead aerosol s that cause eye or skin irritation at the use concentration. Provide HEPA filters or N -, R-, or P -100 filters for powered air -purifying respirators (PAPRs) and negative -pressure air -purifying respirators. (8) Protective work clothing and equipment .

(12) Medical removal protection . (a) Temporary medical removal and return of an employee. Temporary removal due to elevated blood lead levels. (A) The employer must remove an employee from work having an exposure to lead at or above the action level on each occasion that a periodic and a follow -up blood sampling test conducted pursuant to this section indicate that the employee's blood lead level is at or above 60 \u00b5g/100 g of whole blood; and Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 16 (B) The employer must remove an employee from work having an exposure to lead at or above the action level on each occasion that the average of the last three blood sampling tests conducted pursuant to this section (or the average of all blood sampling tests conducted over the previous six months, whichever is longer) indicates that the employee's blood lead level is at or above 50 \u00b5g/100 g of whole blood; provided, however, that an employee need not be removed if the last blood sampling test indicates a blood lead level at or below 40 \u00b5g/100 g of whole blood. Temporary removal due to a final medical determination. (A) The employer must remove an employee from work having an exposure to lead at or above the action level on each occasion that a final medical determination results in a medical finding, determination, or opinion that the employee has a detected medical condition which places the employee at increased risk of material impairment to health from exposure to lead. (B) For the purposes of this section, the phrase \"final medi cal determination\" shall mean the outcome of the multiple physician review mechanism or alternate medical determination mechanism used pursuant to the medical surveillance provisions of this section. (C) Where a final medical determination results in any recom mended special protective measures for an employee, or limitations on an employee's exposure to lead, the employer must implement and act consistent with the recommendation. Return of the employee to former job status. (A) The employer must return an employee to their former job status: (I) For an employee removed due to a blood lead level at or above 60 \u00b5g/100 g, or due to an average blood lead level at or above 50 \u00b5g/100 g, when two consecutive blood sampling tests indicate that the employee's blood lead level is at or below 40 \u00b5g/100 g of whole blood; (II) For an employee removed due to a final medical determination, when a subsequent final medical determination results in a medical finding, determination, or opinion that the employee no longer has a detected medical condition which places the employee at increased risk of material impairment to health from exposure to lead. (B) For the purposes of this section, the requirement that an employer return an employee to their former job status is not intended to expand upon or restrict any rights an employee has or would have had, absent temporary medical removal, to a specific job classification or position under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. Removal of other employee special protective measure or limitations . The employer must remove any limitations placed on an employee or end any special protective measures provided to an employee pursuant to a final medical determination when a subsequent final medical determination indicates that the limitations or speci al protective measures are no longer necessary. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 17 Employer options pending a final medical determination. Where the multiple physician review mechanism, or alternate medical determination mechanism used pursuant to the medical surveillance provisions of thi s section, has not yet resulted in a final medical determination with respect to an employee, the employer must act as follows: (A) Removal. The employer may remove the employee from exposure to lead, provide special protective measures to the employee, or pl ace limitations upon the employee, consistent with the medical findings, determinations, or recommendations of any of the physicians who have reviewed the employee's health status. (B) Return. The employer may return the employee to their former job status, end any special protective measures provided to the employee, and remove any limitations placed upon the employee, consistent with the medical findings, determinations, or recommendations of any of the physicians who have reviewed the employee's health stat us, with two exceptions. If: (I) The initial removal, special protection, or limitation of the employee resulted from a final medical determination which differed from the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the initial physician; or (II) The employee has been on removal status for the preceding eighteen months due to an elevated blood lead level, then the employer must await a final medical determination. (b) Medical removal protection benefits. Provision of medical removal protection benefits. The employ er must provide to an employee up to eighteen months of medical removal protection benefits on each occasion that an employee is removed from exposure to lead or otherwise limited pursuant to this section. Definition of medical removal protection benefits. For the purposes of this section, the requirement that an employer provide medical removal protection benefits means that the employer must maintain the earnings, seniority and other employment rights and benefits of an employee as though the employee ha d not been removed from normal exposure to lead or otherwise limited. Follow -up medical surveillance during the period of employee removal or limitation. During the period of time that an employee is removed from normal exposure to lead or otherwise limit ed, the employer may condition the provision of medical removal protection benefits upon the employee's participation in follow -up medical surveillance made available pursuant to this section. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 18 Workers' compensation claims. If a removed employee files a claim for workers' compensation payments for a lead -related disability, then the employer must continue to provide medical removal protection benefits pending disposition of the claim. To the extent that an award is made to the employee for earnings lost during the period of removal, the employer's medical removal protection obligation must be reduced by such amount. The employer must not receive credit for workers' compensation payments received by the employee for treatment related expenses. Other credi ts. The employer's obligation to provide medical removal protection benefits to a removed employee shall be reduced to the extent that the employee receives compensation for earnings lost during the period of removal either from a publicly or employer -funded compensation program, or receives income from employment with another employer made possible by virtue of the employee's removal. Employees whose blood lead levels do not adequately decline within eighteen months of removal. The employer must take the following measures with respect to any employee removed from exposure to lead due to an elevated blood lead level whose blood lead level has not declined within the past eighteen months of removal so that the employee has been returned to their former job status: (A) The employer must make available to the employee a medical examination pursuant to this section to obtain a final medical determination with respect to the employee; (B) The employer must ensure that the final medical determination obtained indicates whether or not the employee may be returned to their former job status, and if not, what steps should be taken to protect the employee's health; (C) Where the final medical determination has not yet been obtained, or once obtained indicates that the employee m ay not yet be returned to their former job status, the employer must continue to provide medical removal protection benefits to the employee until either the employee is returned to former job status, or a final medical determination is made that the emplo yee is incapable of ever safely returning to their former job status. (D) Where the employer acts pursuant to a final medical determination which permits the return of the employee to their former job status despite what would otherwise be an unacceptable bloo d lead level, later questions concerning removing the employee again must be decided by a final medical determination. The employer need not automatically remove such an employee pursuant to the blood lead level removal criteria provided by this section. Voluntary removal or restriction of an employee. Where an employer, although not required by this section to do so, removes an employee from exposure to lead or otherwise places limitations on an employee due to the effects of lead exposure on the employe e's medical condition, the employer must provide medical removal protection benefits to the employee equal to that required by item (12)(b)(i) of this section. (13) Employee information and training . Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 19 (a) Training program.

Without interfering with the monitoring, observers must be entitled to: (A) Receive an explanation of the measurement procedures; (B) Observe all steps related to the monitoring of lead performed at the place of exposure; and (C) Record the results obtained or receive copies of the results when returned by the laboratory. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 23 (17) Appendices . The information contained in the appendices to this section is not intend ed by itself, to create any additional obligations not otherwise imposed by this standard nor detract from any existing obligation. (a) Appendix A. Substance Data Sheet for Occupational Exposure to Lead. Substance identification. (A) Substance. Pure lead (Pb) is a heavy metal at room temperature and pressure and is a basic chemical element. It can combine with various other substances to form numerous lead compounds. (B) Compounds covered by the standard. The word \"lead\" when used in this standard means elemental l ead, all inorganic lead compounds (except those which are not biologically available due to either solubility or specific chemical interaction), and a class of organic lead compounds called lead soaps. This standard does not apply to other organic lead compounds. (C) Uses. Exposure to lead occurs in at least 120 different occupations, including primary and secondary lead smelting, lead storage battery manufacturing, lead pigment manufacturing and use, solder manufacturing and use, shipbuilding and ship repair ing, auto manufacturing, and printing. (D) Permissible exposure. The Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) set by the standard is 50 micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air (50 \u00b5g/m3), averaged over an eight -hour work day. (E) Action level. The standard establishes an action level of 30 micrograms per cubic meter of air (30 \u00b5g/m3) time weighted average, based on an eight -hour work day. The action level initiates several requirements of the standard, such as exposure monitoring, medical surveillance, and training and education. Health hazard data. (A) Ways in which lead enters your body. (I) When absorbed into your body in certain doses lead is a toxic substance. The object of the lead standard is to prevent absorption of harmful quantities of lead. The standard is intende d to protect you not only from the immediate toxic effects of lead, but also from the serious toxic effects that may not become apparent until years of exposure have passed. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 24 (II) Lead can be absorbed into your body by inhalation (breathing) and ingestion (eat ing). Lead (except for certain organic lead compounds not covered by the standard, such as tetraethyl lead) is not absorbed through your skin. When lead is scattered in the air as a dust, fume or mist, it can be inhaled and absorbed through your lungs an d upper respiratory tract. Inhalation of airborne lead is generally the most important source of occupational lead absorption. You can also absorb lead through your digestive system if lead gets into your mouth and is swallowed. If you handle food, ciga rettes, chewing tobacco, or make -up which have lead on them or handle them with hands contaminated with lead, this will contribute to ingestion. (III) A significant portion of the lead that you inhale or ingest gets into your blood stream. Once in your blood st ream lead is circulated throughout your body and stored in various organs and body tissues. Some of this lead is quickly filtered out of your body and excreted, but some remains in your blood and other tissue. As exposure to lead continues, the amount st ored in your body will increase if you are absorbing more lead than your body is excreting. Even though you may not be aware of any immediate symptoms of disease, this lead stored in your tissues can be slowly causing irreversible damage, first to individ ual cells, then to your organs and whole body systems. (B) Effects of overexposure to lead. (I) Short -term (acute) overexposure. Lead is a potent, systemic poison that serves no known useful function once absorbed by your body. Taken in large enough doses, lead can kill you in a matter of days. A condition affecting the brain called acute encephalopathy may arise which develops quickly to seizures, coma, and death from cardiorespiratory arrest. A short -term dose of lead can lead to acute encephalopathy. Short -term occupational exposures of this magnitude are highly unusual, but not impossible. Similar forms of encephalopathy may, however arise from extended, chronic exposure to lower doses of lead. There is no sharp dividing line between rapidly developing ac ute effects of lead, and chronic effects which take longer to acquire. Lead adversely affects numerous body systems, and causes forms of health impairment and disease which arise after periods of exposure as short as days or as long as several years. (II) Long -term (chronic) overexposure. a) Chronic overexposure to lead may result in severe damage to your blood -forming, nervous, urinary and reproductive systems. Some common symptoms of chronic overexposure include loss of appetite, metallic taste in the mouth, anxiety, constipation, nausea, pallor, excessive tiredness, weakness, insomnia, headache, nervous irritability, muscle and joint pain or soreness, fine tremors, numbness, dizziness, hyperactivity and colic. In lead colic there may be severe abdominal pai n. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 25 b) Damage to the central nervous system in general and the brain (encephalopathy) in particular is one of the most severe forms of lead poisoning. The most severe, often fatal, form of encephalopathy may be preceded by vomiting, a feeling of dullness p rogressing to drowsiness and stupor, poor memory, restlessness, irritability, tremor, and convulsions. It may arise suddenly with the onset of seizures, followed by coma, and death. There is a tendency for muscular weakness to develop at the same time. This weakness may progress to paralysis often observed as a characteristic \"wrist drop\" or \"foot drop\" and is a manifestation of a disease to the nervous system called peripheral neuropathy. c) Chronic overexposure to lead also results in kidney disease with few, if any, symptoms appearing until extensive and most likely permanent kidney damage has occurred. Routine laboratory tests reveal the presence of this kidney disease only after about two -thirds of kidney function is lost. When overt symptoms of ur inary dysfunction arise, it is often too late to correct or prevent worsening conditions, and progression of kidney dialysis or death is possible. d) Chronic overexposure to lead impairs the reproductive systems of both men and women. Overexposure to lead may result in decreased sex drive, impotence and sterility in men. Lead can alter the structure of sperm cells raising the risk of birth defects. There is evidence of miscarriage and stillbirth in women whose husbands were exposed to lead or who were exposed to lead themselves. Lead exposure also may result in decreased fertility, and abnormal menstrual cycles in women. The course of pregnancy may be adversely affected by exposure to lead since lead crosses the placental barrier and poses risks to deve loping fetuses. Children born of parents either one of whom were exposed to excess lead levels are more likely to have birth defects, mental retardation, behavioral disorders or die during the first year of childhood. e) Overexposure to lead also disrupt s the blood -forming system resulting in decreased hemoglobin (the substance in the blood that carries oxygen to the cells) and ultimately anemia. Anemiais characterized by weakness, pallor and fatigability as a result of decreased oxygen carrying capacity in the blood. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 26 (III) Health protection goals of the standard. a) Prevention of adverse health effects for most workers from exposure to lead throughout a working lifetime requires that worker blood lead (PbB) levels be maintained at or below forty micrograms p er one hundred grams of whole blood (40 \u00b5g/100g). The blood lead levels of workers (both male and female workers) who intend to have children should be maintained below 30 \u00b5g/100g to minimize adverse reproductive health effects to the parents and to the d eveloping fetus. b) The measurement of your blood lead level is the most useful indicator of the amount of lead absorbed by your body. Blood lead levels (PbB) are most often reported in units of milligrams (mg) or micrograms (\u00b5g) of lead (1 mg = 1000 \u00b5g) per 100 grams (100g), 100 milliters (100 ml) or deciliter (dl) of blood. These three units are essentially the same. Sometimes PbB's are expressed in the form of mg% or \u00b5g%. This is a shorthand notation for 100g, 100ml, or dl. c) PbB measurements show t he amount of lead circulating in your blood stream, but do not give any information about the amount of lead stored in your various tissues. PbB measurements merely show current absorption of lead, not the effect that lead is having on your body or the ef fects that past lead exposure may have already caused. Past research into lead-related diseases, however, has focused heavily on associations between PbBs and various diseases. As a result, your PbB is an important indicator of the likelihood that you will gradually acquire a lead -related health impairment or disease. d) Once your blood lead level climbs above 40 \u00b5g/100g, your risk of disease increases. There is a wide variability of individual response to lead, thus it is difficult to say that a particu lar PbB in a given person will cause a particular effect. Studies have associated fatal encephalopathy with PbBs as low as 150 \u00b5g/100g. Other studies have shown other forms of disease in some workers with PbBs well below 80 \u00b5g/100g. Your PbB is a crucia l indicator of the risks to your health, but one other factor is extremely important. This factor is the length of time you have had elevated PbBs. The longer you have an elevated PbB, the greater the risk that large quantities of lead are being graduall y stored in your organs and tissues (body burden). The greater your overall body burden, the greater the chances of substantial permanent damage. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 27 e) The best way to prevent all forms of lead -related impairments and diseases --both short -term and long -term--is to maintain your PbB below 40 \u00b5g/100g. The provisions of the standard are designed with this end in mind. Your employer has prime responsibility to ensure that the provisions of the standard are complied with both by the company and by individual wor kers. You as a worker, however, also have a responsibility to assist your employer in complying with the standard. You can play a key role in protecting your own health by learning about the lead hazards and their control, learning what the standard requi res, following the standard where it governs your own action, and seeing that your employer complies with the provisions governing his actions. (IV) Reporting signs and symptoms of health problems. You should immediately notify your employer if you develop sig ns or symptoms associated with lead poisoning or if you desire medical advice concerning the effects of current or past exposure to lead on your ability to have a healthy child. You should also notify your employer if you have difficulty breathing during a respirator fit test or while wearing a respirator. In each of these cases your employer must make available to you appropriate medical examinations or consultations. These must be provided at no cost to you and at a reasonable time and place. (b) Appendix B. Employee Standard Summary . This appendix summarizes key provisions of the standard that you as a worker should become familiar with. The appendix discusses the entire standard. Permissible exposure limit (PEL). The standard sets a permissible exposu re limit (PEL) of fifty micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air (50 \u00b5g/m3), averaged over and eight -hour workday. This is the highest level of lead in air to which you may be permissibly exposed over an eight -hour workday. Since it is an eight - hour ave rage it permits short exposures above the PEL so long as for each eight - hour workday your average exposure does not exceed the PEL. Exposure monitoring. (A) If lead is present in the work place where you work in any quantity, your employer is required to make an initial determination of whether the action level is exceeded for any employee. The initial determination must include instrument monitoring of the air for the presence of lead and must cover the exposure of a representative number of employees who are reasonably believed to have the highest exposure levels. If your employer has conducted appropriate air sampling for lead in the past year he may use these results. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 28 If there have been any employee complaints of symptoms which may be attributable to exp osure to lead or if there is any other information or observations which would indicate employee exposure to lead, this must also be considered as part of the initial determination. If this initial determination shows that a reasonable possibility exists that any employee may be exposed, without regard to respirators, over the action level (30 \u00b5g/m3) your employer must set up an air monitoring program to determine the exposure level of every employee exposed to lead at your work place. (B) In carrying out this air monitoring program, your employer is not required to monitor the exposure of every employee, but they must monitor a representative number of employees and job types. Enough sampling must be done to enable each employee's exposure level to be reasonably represented by at least one full shift (at least seven hours) air sample. In addition, these air samples must be taken under conditions which represent each employee's regular, daily exposure to lead. (C) If you are exposed to lead and air sampling is performed, your employer is required to quickly notify you in writing of air monitoring results which represent your exposure. If the results indicate your exposure exceeds the PEL (without regard to your use of respirators), then your employer must also notify you of this in writing, and provide you with a description of the corrective action that will be taken to reduce your exposure. (D) Your exposure must be rechecked by monitoring every six months if your exposure is over the action level but below the P EL. Air monitoring must be repeated every three months if you are exposed over the PEL. Your employer may discontinue monitoring for you if two consecutive measurements, taken at least two weeks apart, are below the action level. However, whenever there is a production, process, control, or personnel change at your work place which may result in new or additional exposure to lead, or whenever there is any other reason to suspect a change which may result in new or additional exposure to lead, your employ er must perform additional monitoring. Methods of compliance. Your employer is required to ensure that no employee is exposed to lead in excess of the PEL. The standard establishes a priority of methods to be used to meet the PEL. Respiratory protection. (A) Your employer is required to provide and ensure your use of respirators when your exposure to lead is not controlled below the PEL by other means. The employer must pay the cost of the respirator. Whenever you request one, your employer is also required to provide you a respirator even if your air exposure level does not exceed the PEL. You might desire a respirator when, for example, you have received medical advice that your lead absorption should be decreased. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 29 Or, you may intend to have children in the near future, and want to reduce the level of lead in your body to minimize adverse reproductive effects. While respirators are the least satisfactory means of controlling your exposure, they are capable of providing significant protection if properly chosen, fitted, worn, cleaned, maintained, and replaced when they stop providing adequate protection. (B) Your employer is required to select respirators from the seven types listed in Table II of the respiratory protection section of this standard (see subse ction (7)(c) of this section). Any respirator chosen must be certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) under the provisions of 42 CFR part 84. This respirator selection table will enable your employer to choose a type of respirator which will give you a proper amount of protection based on your airborne lead exposure. Your employer may select a type of respirator that provides greater protection than that required by the standard; that is, one recommended for a higher concentration of lead than is present in your work place. For example, a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) is much more protective than a typical negative -pressure respirator, and may also be more comfortable to wear. A PAPR has a filter, cartridge or canister to clean the air, and a power source which continuously blows filtered air into your breathing zone. Your employer might make a PAPR available to you to ease the burden of having to wear a respirator for long periods of time. The standard pr ovides that you can obtain a PAPR upon request. (C) Your employer must also start a respiratory protection program. This program must include written procedures for the proper selection, use, cleaning, storage, and maintenance of respirators. (D) Your employer mu st ensure that your respirator facepiece fits properly. Proper fit of a respirator facepiece is critical to your protection against air borne lead. Obtaining a proper fit on each employee may require your employer to make available several different types of respirator masks. To ensure that your respirator fits properly and that facepiece leakage is minimal, your employer must give you either a qualitative or quantitative fit test as required in chapter 296-842 WAC. (E) You must also receive from your employer proper training in the use of respirators. Your employer is required to teach you how to wear a respirator, to know why it is needed, and to understand its lim itations. (F) The standard provides that if your respirator uses filter elements, you must be given an opportunity to change the filter elements whenever an increase in breathing resistance is detected. You also must be permitted to periodically leave your wo rk area to wash your face and respirator facepiece whenever necessary to prevent skin irritation. If you ever have difficulty breathing during a fit test or while using a respirator, your employer must make a medical examination available to you to determ ine whether you can safely wear a respirator. The result of this examination may be to give you a positive pressure respirator (which reduces breathing resistance) or to provide alternative means of protection. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 30 Protective work clothing and equipment. I f you are exposed to lead above the PEL, or if you are exposed to lead compounds such as lead arsenate or lead azide which can cause skin and eye irritation, your employer must provide you with protective work clothing and equipment appropriate for the haz ard. If work clothing is provided, it must be provided in a clean and dry condition at least weekly, and daily if your airborne exposure to lead is greater than 200 \u00b5g/m3. Appropriate protective work clothing and equipment can include coveralls or simila r full -body work clothing, gloves, hats, shoes or disposable shoe coverlets, and face shields or vented goggles. Your employer is required to provide all such equipment at no cost to you. They are is responsible for providing repairs and replacement as n ecessary and also is responsible for the cleaning, laundering or disposal of protective clothing and equipment. Contaminated work clothing or equipment must be removed in change rooms and not worn home or you will extend your exposure and expose your fami ly since lead from your clothing can accumulate in your house, car, etc. Contaminated clothing which is to be cleaned, laundered or disposed of must be placed in closed containers in the change room. At no time may lead be removed from protective clothin g or equipment by any means which disperses lead into the work room air. Housekeeping. Your employer must establish a housekeeping program sufficient to maintain all surfaces as free as practicable of accumulations of lead dust. Vacuuming is the preferre d method of meeting this requirement, and the use of compressed air to clean floors and other surfaces is absolutely prohibited. Dry or wet sweeping, shoveling, or brushing may not be used except where vacuuming or other equally effective methods have bee n tried and do not work. Vacuums must be used and emptied in a manner which minimizes the reentry of lead into the work place. Hygiene facilities and practices. (A) The standard requires that change rooms, showers and filtered air lunchrooms be constructed an d made available to workers exposed to lead above the PEL. When the PEL is exceeded, the employer must ensure that food and beverage is not present or consumed, tobacco products are not present or used, and cosmetics are not applied, except in these facilities. Change rooms, showers and lunchrooms, must be used by workers exposed in excess of the PEL. After showering no clothing or equipment worn during the shift may be worn home and this includes shoes and underwear. Your own clothing worn during the s hift should be carried home and cleaned carefully so that it does not contaminate your home. Lunchrooms may not be entered with protective clothing or equipment unless surface dust has been removed by vacuuming, downdraft booth or other cleaning methods. Finally, workers exposed above the PEL must wash both their hands and faces prior to eating, drinking, smoking or applying cosmetics. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 31 (B) All of the facilities and hygiene practices just discussed are essential to minimize additional sources of lead absorpt ion from inhalation or ingestion of lead that may accumulate on you, your clothes or your possessions. Strict compliance with these provisions can virtually eliminate several sources of lead exposure which significantly contribute to excessive lead absorp tion. Medical surveillance. (A) The medical surveillance program is part of the standard's comprehensive approach to the prevention of lead -related disease. Its purpose is to supplement the main thrust of the standard which is aimed at minimizing airborne concentrations of lead and sources of ingestion. Only medical surveillance can determine if the other provisions of the standard have effectively protected you as an individual. Compliance with the standard's provision will protect most workers from the adv erse effects of lead exposure, but may not be satisfactory to protect individual workers (I) who have high body burdens of lead acquired over past years, (II) who have additional uncontrolled sources of nonoccupational lead exposure, (III) who exhibit unus ual variations in lead absorption rates, or (IV) who have specific nonwork related medical conditions which could be aggravated by lead exposure (e.g., renal disease, anemia). In addition, control systems may fail, or hygiene and respirator programs may b e inadequate. Periodic medical surveillance of individual workers will help detect those failures. Medical surveillance will also be important to protect your reproductive ability - regardless of whether you are a man or a woman. (B) All medical surveillance required by the standard must be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed physician. The employer must provide required medical surveillance without cost to employees and at a reasonable time and place. The standard's medical surveillance pro gram has two parts - periodic biological monitoring, and medical examinations. (C) Your employer's obligation to offer medical surveillance is triggered by the results of the air monitoring program. Medical surveillance must be made available to all employees who are exposed in excess of the action level for more than 30 days a year. The initial phase of the medical surveillance program, which included blood lead level tests and medical examinations, must be completed for all covered employees no later than 180 days from the effective date of this standard. Priority within this first round of medical surveillance must be given to employees whom the employer believes to be at greatest risk from continued exposure (for example, those with the longest prior expo sure to lead, or those with the highest current exposure). Thereafter, the employer must periodically make medical surveillance - both biological monitoring and medical examinations - available to all covered employees. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 32 (D) Biological monitoring under the s tandard consists of blood lead level (PbB) and zinc protoporphyrin tests at least every six months after the initial PbB test. A zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) test is a very useful blood test which measures an effect of lead on your body. If a worker's PbB exceeds 40 \u00b5g/100g, the monitoring frequency must be increased from every six months to at least every two months and not reduced until two consecutive PbBs indicate a blood lead level below 40 \u00b5g/100g. Each time your PbB is determined to be over 40\u00b5g/100g , your employer must notify you of this in writing within five working days of the receipt of the test results. The employer must also inform you that the standard requires temporary medical removal with economic protection when your PbB exceeds certain c riteria (see Discussion of Medical Removal Protection - subsection (12)). During the first year of the standard, this removal criterion is 80 \u00b5g/100g. Anytime your PbB exceeds 80 \u00b5g/100g your employer must make available to you a prompt follow -up PbB tes t to ascertain your PbB. If the two tests both exceed 80 \u00b5g/100g and you are temporarily removed, then your employer must make successive PbB tests available to you on a monthly basis during the period of your removal. (E) Medical examinations beyond the init ial one must be made available on an annual basis if your blood lead levels exceeds 40 \u00b5g/100g at any time during the preceding year. The initial examination will provide information to establish a baseline to which subsequent data can be compared. An in itial medical examination must also be made available (prior to assignment) for each employee being assigned for the first time to an area where the airborne concentration of lead equals or exceeds the action level. In addition, a medical examination or c onsultation must be made available as soon as possible if you notify your employer that you are experiencing signs or symptoms commonly associated with lead poisoning or that you have difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator or during a respirator f it test. You must also be provided a medical examination or consultation if you notify your employer that you desire medical advice concerning the effects of current or past exposure to lead on your ability to procreate a healthy child. (F) Finally, appropria te follow -up medical examinations or consultations may also be provided for employees who have been temporarily removed from exposure under the medical removal protection provisions of the standard (see item (ix) below). (G) The standard specifies the minimum content of preassignment and annual medical examinations. The content of other types of medical examinations and consultations is left up to the sound discretion of the examining physician. Preassignment and annual medical examinations must include (I) a detailed work history and medical history, (II) a thorough physical examination, and (III) a series of laboratory tests designed to check your blood chemistry and your kidney function. In addition, at any time upon your request, a laboratory evaluation o f male fertility will be made (microscopic examination of a sperm sample), or a pregnancy test will be given. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 33 (H) The standard does not require that you participate in any of the medical procedures, tests, etc., which your employer is required to make availabl e to you. Medical surveillance can, however, play a very important role in protecting your health. You are strongly encouraged, therefore, to participate in a meaningful fashion. Generally, your employer will choose the physician who conducts medical su rveillance under the lead standard - unless you and your employer can agree on the choice of a physician or physicians. Some companies and unions have agreed in advance, for example, to use certain independent medical laboratories or panels of physicians. Any of these arrangements are acceptable so long as required medical surveillance is made available to workers. (I) The standard requires your employer to provide certain information to a physician to aid in their examination of you. This information includ es (I) the standard and its appendices, (II) a description of your duties as they relate to lead exposure, (III) your exposure level, (IV) a description of personal protective equipment you wear, (V) prior blood level results, and (VI) prior written medica l opinions concerning you that the employer has. After a medical examination or consultation the physician must prepare a written report which must contain (I) the physician's opinion as to whether you have any medical conditions which places you at incre ased risk of material impairment to health from exposure to lead, (II) any recommended special protective measures to be provided to you, (III) any blood lead level determinations, and (IV) any recommended limitation on your use of respirators. This last element must include a determination of whether you can wear a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) if you are found unable to wear a negative pressure respirator. (J) The medical surveillance program of the lead standard may at some point in time serve to notify certain workers that they have acquired a disease or other adverse medical condition as a result of occupational lead exposure. If this is true these workers might have legal rights to compensation from public agencies, their employers, firms that supply hazardous products to their employers, or other persons. Some states have laws, including worker compensation laws, that disallow a worker to learn of a job -related health impairment to sue, unless the worker sues within a short period of time afte r learning of the impairment. (This period of time may be a matter of months or years.) An attorney can be consulted about these possibilities. It should be stressed that WISHA is in no way trying to either encourage or discourage claims or lawsuits. H owever, since results of the standard's medical surveillance program can significantly affect the legal remedies of a worker who has acquired a job -related disease or impairment, it is proper for WISHA to make you aware of this. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 34 (K) The medical surveillance section of the standard also contains provisions dealing with chelation. Chelation is the use of certain drugs (administered in pill form or injected into the body) to reduce the amount of lead absorbed in body tissues. Experience accumulated by the medi cal and scientific communities has largely confirmed the effectiveness of this type of therapy for the treatment of very severe lead poisoning. On the other hand it has also been established that there can be a long list of extremely harmful side effects associated with the use of chelating agents. The medical community has balanced the advantages and disadvantages resulting from the use of chelating agents in various circumstances and has established when the use of these agents is acceptable. The stand ard includes these accepted limitations due to a history of abuse of chelation therapy by some lead companies. The most widely used chelating agents are calcium disodium EDTA, The standard prohibits \"prophylactic chelation\" of any employee by any person the employer retains, supervises or controls. \"Prophylactic chelation\" is the routine use of chelating or similarly acting drugs to prevent elevated bloo d levels in workers who are occupationally exposed to lead, or the use of these drugs to routinely lower blood lead levels to predesignated concentrations believed to be safe. It should be emphasized that where an employer takes a worker who has no sympto ms of lead poisoning and has chelation carried out by a physician (either inside or outside of a hospital) solely to reduce the worker's blood lead level, that will generally be considered prophylactic chelation. The use of a hospital and a physician does not mean that prophylactic chelation is not being performed. Routine chelation to prevent increased or reduce current blood lead levels is unacceptable whatever the setting. (M) The standard allows the use of \"therapeutic\" or \"diagnostic\" chelation if admini stered under the supervision of a licensed physician in a clinical setting with thorough and appropriate medical monitoring. Therapeutic chelation responds to severe lead poisoning where there are marked symptoms. Diagnostic chelation, involves giving a patient a dose of the drug then collecting all urine excreted for some period of time as an aid to the diagnosis of lead poisoning. (N) In cases where the examining physician determines that chelation is appropriate, you must be notified in writing of this fac t before such treatment. This will inform you of a potentially harmful treatment, and allow you to obtain a second opinion. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 35 Medical removal protection. (A) Excessive lead absorption subjects you to increased risk of disease. Medical removal protection (MRP ) is a means of protecting you when for whatever reasons, other methods, such as engineering controls, work practices, and respirators, have failed to provide the protection you need. MRP involves the temporary removal of a worker from their regular job t o a place of significantly lower exposure without any loss of earnings, seniority, or other employment rights of benefits. The purpose of this program is to cease further lead absorption and allow your body to naturally excrete lead which has previously b een absorbed. Temporary medical removal can result from an elevated blood lead level, or a medical opinion. Up to eighteen months of protection is provided as a result of either form of removal. The vast majority of removed workers, however, will return to their former jobs long before this eighteen month period expires. The standard contains special provisions to deal with the extraordinary but possible case where a long -term worker's blood lead level does not adequately decline during eighteen months of removal. (B) During the first year of the standard, if your blood lead level is 80 \u00b5g/100g or above you must be removed from any exposure where your air lead level without a respirator would be 100 \u00b5g/m3 or above. If you are removed from your normal job yo u may not be returned until your blood lead level declines to at least 60 \u00b5g/100g. These criteria for removal and return will change according to the following schedule: Effective Date Removal Blood Level (\u00b5g/100g) Air Lead (\u00b5g/m3) Return Blood Lead (\u00b5g/m3) 09/06/81 At or above 70 50 or above At or below 50 09/06/82 At or above 60 30 or above At or below 40 09/06/84 At or above 50 averaged over six months 30 or above At or below 40 (C) You may also be removed from exposure even if your blood lead levels are below these criteria if a final medical determination indicates that you temporarily need reduced lead exposure for medical reasons. If the physician who is implementing your employers medical program makes a final written opinion recommending your remo val or other special protective measures, your employer must implement the physician's recommendation. If you are removed in this manner, you may only be returned when the physician indicates it is safe for you to do so. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 36 (D) The standard does not give speci fic instructions dealing with what an employer must do with a removed worker. Your job assignment upon removal is a matter for you, your employer and your union (if any) to work out consistent with existing procedures for job assignments. Each removal mu st be accomplished in a manner consistent with existing collective bargaining relationships. Your employer is given broad discretion to implement temporary removals so long as no attempt is made to override existing agreements. Similarly, a removed worke r is provided no right to veto an employer's choice which satisfies the standard. (E) In most cases, employers will likely transfer removed employees to other jobs with sufficiently low lead exposure. Alternatively, a worker's hours may be reduced so that the time weighted average exposure is reduced, or he or she may be temporarily laid off if no other alternative is feasible. (F) In all of these situations, MRP benefits must be provided during the period of removal - i.e., you continue to receive the same earnin gs, seniority, and other rights and benefits you would have had if you had not been removed. Earnings include more than just your base wage; it includes overtime, shift differentials, incentives, and other compensation you would have earned if you had not been removed. During the period of removal you must also be provided with appropriate follow -up medical surveillance. If you were removed because your blood lead level was too high, you must be provided with a monthly blood test. If a medical opinion c aused your removal, you must be provided medical tests or examinations that the physician believes to be appropriate. If you do not participate in this follow -up medical surveillance, you may lose your eligibility for MRP benefits. (G) When you are medically eligible to return to your former job, your employer must return you to your \"former job status.\" This means that you are entitled to the position, wages, benefits, etc., you would have had if you had not been removed. If you would still be in your old j ob if no removal had occurred, that is where you go back. If not, you are returned consistent with whatever job assignment discretion your employer would have had if no removal had occurred. MRP only seeks to maintain your rights, not expand them or dimi nish them. (H) If you are removed under MRP and you are also eligible for worker compensation or other compensation for lost wages, your employer's MRP benefits obligation is reduced by the amount that you actually receive from these other sources. This is al so true if you obtain other employment during the time you are laid off with MRP benefits. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 37 (I) The standard also covers situations where an employer voluntarily removes a worker from exposure to lead due to the effects of lead on the employee's medical condi tion, even though the standard does not require removal. In these situations MRP benefits must still be provided as though the standard required removal. Finally, it is important to note that in all cases where removal is required, respirators cannot be used as a substitute. Respirators may be used before removal becomes necessary, but not as an alternative to a transfer to a low exposure job, or to a lay -off with MRP benefits. Employee information and training. (A) Your employer is required to provide an in formation and training program for all employees exposed to lead above the action level or who may suffer skin or eye irritation from lead. This program must inform these employees of the specific hazards associated with their work environment, protective measures which can be taken, the danger of lead to their bodies (including their reproductive systems), and their rights under the standard. In addition, your employer must make readily available to all employees, included those exposed below the action level, a copy of the standard and its appendices and must distribute to all employees any materials provided to the employer under the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act (WISHA). (B) Your employer is required to complete this training for all employee s by March 4, 1981. After this date, all new employees must be trained prior to initial assignment to areas where there is possibility of exposure over the action level. This training program must also be provided at least annually thereafter. Signs. Th e standard requires that the following warning sign be posted in work areas where the exposure to lead exceeds the PEL: DANGER LEAD MAY DAMAGE FERTILITY OR THE UNBORN CHILD CAUSES DAMAGE TO THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DO NOT EAT, DRINK OR SMOKE IN THIS AREA Recordkeeping. (A) Your employer is required to keep all records of exposure monitoring for airborne lead. These records must include the name and job classification of employees measured, details of the sampling and analytic techniques, the results of this sampling and the type of respiratory protection being worn by the person sampled. Your employer is also required to keep all records of biological monitoring and medical examination results. These must include the names of the employees, the physician's written opinion and a copy of the results of the examination. All of the above kinds of records must be kept for 40 years, or for at least 20 years after your termination of employment, whichever is longer. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 38 (B) Recordkeeping is also required if you are temp orarily removed from your job under the MRP program. This record must include your name and social security number, the date of your removal and return, how the removal was or is being accomplished, and whether or not the reason for the removal was an ele vated blood lead level. Your employer is required to keep each medical removal record only for as long as the duration of an employee's employment. (C) The standard requires that if you request to see or copy environmental monitoring, blood lead level monitor ing, or medical removal records, they must be made available to you or to a representative that you authorize. Your union also has access to these records. Medical records other than PbBs must also be provided to you upon request, to your physician or to any other person whom you may specifically designate. Your union does not have access to your personal medical records unless you authorize their access. Observations of monitoring. When air monitoring for lead is performed at your work place as require d by this standard, your employer must allow you or someone you designate to act as an observer of the monitoring. Observers are entitled to an explanation of the measurement procedure, and to record the results obtained. Since results will not normally be available at the time of the monitoring, observers are entitled to record or receive the results of the monitoring when returned by the laboratory. Your employer is required to provide the observer with any personal protective devices required to be wo rn by employees working in the areas that is being monitored. The employer must require the observer to wear all such equipment and to comply with all other applicable safety and health procedures. Effective date. The standard's effective date is Septemb er 6, 1980, and the employer's obligation under the standard begin to come into effect as of that date. The standard was originally adopted as WAC 296 -62-07349 and later recodified to C. Medical Surveillance Guidelines. Introdu ction. (A) The primary purpose of the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act of 1973 is to ensure , so far as possible, safe and healthful working conditions for every working man and woman. The occupational health standard for inorganic lead* was promulg ated to protect workers exposed to inorganic lead including metallic lead, all inorganic lead compounds and organic lead soaps. *The term inorganic lead used throughout the medical surveillance appendices is meant to be synonymous with the definition of le ad set forth in the standard. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 39 (B) Under this final standard in effect as of September 6, 1980, occupational exposure to inorganic lead is to be limited to 50 \u00b5g/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter) based on an 8 -hour time -weighted average (TWA). This level of ex posure eventually must be achieved through a combination of engineering, work practice and other administrative controls. Periods of time ranging from one to 10 years are provided for different industries to implement these controls which are based on ind ividual industry considerations. Until these controls are in place, respirators must be used to meet the 50 \u00b5g/m3 exposure limit. (C) The standard also provides for a program of biological monitoring and medical surveillance for all employees exposed to level s of inorganic lead above the action level of 30 \u00b5g/m3 for more than thirty days per year. (D) The purpose of this document is to outline the medical surveillance provisions of the standard for inorganic lead, and to provide further information to the physicia n regarding the examination and evaluation of workers exposed to inorganic lead. (E) Item (ii) provides a detailed description of the monitoring procedure including the required frequency of blood testing for exposed workers, provisions for medical removal pro tection (MRP), the recommended right of the employee to a second medical opinion, and notification and recordkeeping requirements of the employer. A discussion of the requirements for respirator use and respirator monitoring and WISHA's position on prophyl actic chelation therapy are also included in this section. (F) Item (iii) discusses the toxic effects and clinical manifestations of lead poisoning and effects of lead intoxication on enzymatic pathways in heme synthesis. The adverse effects on both male and female reproductive capacity and on the fetus are also discussed. (G) Item (iv) outlines the recommended medical evaluation of the worker exposed to inorganic lead including details of the medical history, physical examination, and recommended laboratory tests , which are based on the toxic effects of lead as discussed in item (ii). (H) Item (v) provides detailed information concerning the laboratory tests available for the monitoring of exposed workers. Included also is a discussion of the relative value of each t est and the limitations and precautions which are necessary in the interpretation of the laboratory results. (I) Airborne levels to be achieved without reliance or respirator protection through a combination of engineering and work practice or other administra tive controls are illustrated in the following table: Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 40 Industry Permissible Lead Level/Compliance Date 200\u00b5g/m3 100\u00b5g/m3 50\u00b5g/m3 Primary Lead Production. 1973 06/29/84 06/29/91 Secondary Lead Production. 1973 06/29/84 06/29/91 Lead Acid Battery Manufacturing. 1973 06/29/83 06/29/91 Automobile Mfg.,/ Solder, Grinding. 1973 N/A 03/08/97 Electronics, Gray Iron Foundries, Ink Mfg., Paints and Coatings Mfg., Can Mfg., Wallpaper Mfg., and Printing. 1973 N/A 06/29/91 Lead chemical Mfg ., Nonferrous Foundries, Leaded Steel Mfg., Battery Breaking in the Collection and Processing of Scrap (when not a part of secondary lead smelter), Secondary Copper Smelter, Brass and Bronze Ingot Production. 1973 N/A N/A1* All Other Industries. 1973 N/A 09/08/92 * Feasibility of achieving the PEL by engineering and work practice controls for these industries has yet to be resolved in court, therefore no date has been scheduled. (ii) Medical surveillance and monitoring requirement s for workers exposed to inorganic lead. (A) Under the occupational health standard for inorganic lead, a program of biological monitoring and medical surveillance is to be made available to all employees exposed to lead above the action level of 30 \u00b5g/m3 TWA for more than thirty days each year. This program consists of periodic blood sampling and medical evaluation to be performed on a schedule which is defined by previous laboratory results, worker complaints or concerns, and the clinical assessment of the e xamining physician. (B) Under this program, the blood lead level of all employees who are exposed to lead above the action level of 30 \u00b5g/m3 is to be determined at least every six months. The frequency is increased to every two months for employees whose last blood lead level was between 40\u00b5g/100g whole blood and the level requiring employee medical removal to be discussed below. For employees who are removed from exposure to lead due to an elevated blood lead, a new blood lead level must be measured monthly. Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) measurement is required on each occasion that a blood lead level measurement is made. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 41 (C) An annual medical examination and consultation performed under the guidelines discussed in item (iv) is to be made available to each employee for whom a blood test conducted at any time during the preceding twelve months indicated a blood lead level at or above 40\u00b5g/100g. Also, an examination is to be given to all employees prior to their assignment to an area in which airborne lead concentrati ons reach or exceed the action level. In addition, a medical examination must be provided as soon as possible after notification by an employee that the employee has developed signs or symptoms commonly associated with lead intoxication, that the employee desires medical advice regarding lead exposure and the ability to procreate a healthy child, or that the employee has demonstrated difficulty in breathing during a respirator fitting test or during respirator use. An examination is also to be made availa ble to each employee removed from exposure to lead due to a risk of sustaining material impairment to health, or otherwise limited or specially protected pursuant to medical recommendations. (D) Results of biological monitoring or the recommendations of an exa mining physician may necessitate removal of an employee from further lead exposure pursuant to the standard's medical removal program (MRP). The object of the MRP program is to provide temporary medical removals to workers either with substantially elevat ed blood lead levels or otherwise at risk of sustaining material health impairment from continued substantial exposure to lead. The following guidelines which are summarized in Table 10 were created under the standard for the temporary removal of an expos ed employee and their subsequent return to work in an exposure area.

Medical monitoring during the medical removal period can be more stringent than noted in the table a bove if the physician so specifies. Return to work or removal of limitations and special protections is permitted when the physician indicates that the worker is no longer at risk of material impairment. (E) Under the standard's ultimate worker removal crite ria, a worker is to be removed from any work having any eight -hour TWA exposure to lead of 30 \u00b5g/m3or more whenever either of the following circumstances apply. (I) a blood lead level of 60 \u00b5g/100g or greater is obtained and confirmed by a second follow -up blood lead level performed within two weeks after the employer receives the results of the first blood sample test, or (II) the average of the previous three blood lead determinations or the average of all blood lead determinations conducted during the p revious six months, whichever encompasses the longest time period, equals or exceeds 50 \u00b5g/100g, unless the last blood sample indicates a blood lead level at or below 40 \u00b5g/100g, in which case the employee need not be removed. Medical removal is to contin ue until two consecutive blood lead levels are 40 \u00b5g/100g or less. (F) During the first two years that the ultimate removal criteria are being phased in, the return criteria have been set to ensure that a worker's blood lead level has substantially declined du ring the period of removal. From March 1, 1979, to March 1, 1980, the blood lead level requiring employee medial removal is 80 \u00b5g/100g. Workers found to have a confirmed blood lead at this level or greater need only be removed from work having a daily ei ght hour TWA exposure to lead at or above 100 \u00b5g/m3. Workers so removed are to be returned to work when their blood lead levels are at or below 60 \u00b5g/100g of whole blood. From March 1, 1980, to March 1, 1981, the blood lead level requiring medical remova l is 70 \u00b5g/100g. During this period workers need only be removed from jobs having a daily eight hour TWA exposure to lead at or above 50 \u00b5g/m3 and are to be returned to work when a level of 50 \u00b5g/100g is achieved. Beginning March 1, 1981, return depends on the worker's blood lead level declining to 40 \u00b5g/100g of whole blood. (G) As part of the standard, the employer is required to notify in writing each employee whose whole blood lead level exceeds 40 g/100g. In addition, each such employee is to be informe d that the standard requires medical removal with MRP benefits, discussed below, when an employee's blood lead level exceeds the above defined limits. (H) In addition to the above blood lead level criteria, temporary worker removal may also take place as a res ult of medical deter minations and recommendations. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 45 Written medical opinions must be prepared after each examination pursuant to the standard. If the examining physician includes medical finding, determination or opinion that the employee has a medical condition which places the employee at increased risk of material health impairment from exposure to lead, then the employee must be removed from exposure to lead at or above the action level. Alternatively, if the examining physician recommends special pr otective measures for an employee (e.g., use of a powered air purifying respirator) or recommends limitations on an employee's exposure to lead, then the employer must implement these recommendations. Recommendations may be more stringent than the specifi c provisions of the standard. The examining physician, therefore, is given broad flexibility to tailor special protective procedures to the needs of individual employees. This flexibility extends to the evaluation and management of pregnant workers and m ale and female workers who are planning to conceive children. Based on the history, physical examination, and laboratory studies, the physician might recommend special protective measures or medical removal for an employee who is pregnant or who is planni ng to conceive a child when, in the physician's judgment, continued exposure to lead at the current job would pose a significant risk. The return of the employee to their former job status, or the removal of special protections or limitations, depends upon the examining physician determining that the employee is no longer at increased risk of material impairment or that the special measures are no longer needed. (I) During the period of any form of special protection or removal, the employer must maintain the worker's earnings, seniority, and other employment rights and benefits (as though the worker has not been removed) for a period of up to eighteen months. This economic protection will maximize meaningful worker participation in the medical surveillance pr ogram, and is appropriate as part of the employer's overall obligation to provide a safe and healthful work place. The provisions of MRP benefits during the employee's removal period may, however, be conditioned upon participation in medical surveillance. (J) On rare occasions, an employee's blood lead level may not acceptably decline within eighteen months of removal. This situation will arise only in unusual circumstances, thus the standard relies on an individual medical examination to determine how to pro tect such an employee. This medical determination is to be based on both laboratory values, including lead levels, zinc protoporphyrin levels, blood counts, and other tests felt to be warranted, as well as the physician's judgment that any symptoms or findings on physical examination are a result of lead toxicity. The medical determination may be that the employee is incapable of ever safely returning to their former job status. The medical determination may provide additional removal time past eighteen months for some employees or specify special protective measures to be implemented. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 46 (K) The lead standard provides for a multiple physician review in cases where the employee wishes a second opinion concerning potential lead poisoning or toxicity. If an em ployee wishes a second opinion, they can make an appointment with a physician of their choice. This second physician will review the findings, recommendations or determinations of the first physician and conduct any examinations, consultations or tests deemed necessary in an attempt to make a final medical determination. If the first and second physicians do not agree in their assessment they must try to resolve their differences. If they cannot reach an agreement then they must designate a third physici an to resolve the dispute. (L) The employer must provide examining and consulting physicians with the following specific information: A copy of the lead regulations and all appendices, a description of the employee's duties as related to exposure, the exposur e level to lead and any other toxic substances (if applicable), a description of personal protective equipment used, blood lead levels, and all prior written medical opinions regarding the employee in the employer's possession or control. The employer mus t also obtain from the physician and provide the employee with a written medical opinion containing blood lead levels, the physician's opinion as to whether the employee is at risk of material impairment to health, any recommended protective measures for t he employee if further exposure is permitted, as well as any recommended limitations upon an employee's use of respirators. (M) Employers must instruct each physician not to reveal to the employer in writing or in any other way their findings, laboratory resul ts, or diagnoses which are felt to be unrelated to occupational lead exposure. They must also instruct each physician to advise the employee of any occupationally or nonoccupationally related medical condition requiring further treatment or evaluation. (N) The standard provides for the use of respirators when engineering and other primary controls have not been fully implemented. However, the use of respirator protection must not be used in lieu of temporary medical removal due to elevated blood lead levels o r findings that an employee is at risk of material health impairment. This is based on the numerous inadequacies of respirators including skin rash where the facepiece makes contact with the skin, unacceptable stress to breathing in some workers with unde rlying cardiopulmonary impairment, difficulty in providing adequate fit, the tendency for respirators to create additional hazards by interfering with vision, hearing, and mobility, and the difficulties of ensuring the maximum effectiveness of a complicate d work practice program involving respirators. Respirators do, however, serve a useful function where engineering and work practice are inadequate by providing interim or short -term protection, provided they are properly selected for the environment in wh ich the employee will be working, properly fitted to the employee, maintained and cleaned periodically, and worn by the employee when required. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 47 (O) In its final standard on occupational exposure to inorganic lead, WISHA has prohibited prophylactic chelation. Diagnostic and therapeutic chelation are permitted only under the supervision of a licensed physician with appropriate medical monitoring in an acceptable clinical setting. The decision to initiate chelation therapy must be made on an individual basis and take into account the severity of symptoms felt to be a result of lead toxicity along with blood lead levels, ZPP levels and other laboratory tests as appropriate. EDTA and penicillamine, which are the primary chelating agents used in the therapy of oc cupational lead poisoning, have significant potential side effects and their use must be justified on the basis of expected benefits to the worker. (P) Unless frank and severe symptoms are present, therapeutic chelation is not recommended given the opportunity to remove a worker from exposure and allow the body to naturally excrete accumulated lead. As a diagnostic aid, the chelation mobilization test using CA -EDTA has limited applicability. According to some investigators, the tests can differentiate between lead-induced and other nephropathies. The test may also provide an estimation of the mobile fraction of the total body lead burden. (Q) Employers are required to ensure that accurate records are maintained on exposure monitoring, medical surveillance, and me dical removal for each employee. Exposure monitoring and medical surveillance records must be kept for forty years or the duration of employment plus twenty years, whichever is longer, while medical removal records must be maintained for the duration of e mployment. All records required under the standard must be made available upon request to representatives of the director of the department of labor and industries. Employers must also make environmental and biological monitoring and medical removal reco rds available to affected employees and to former employees or their authorized employee representatives. Employees or their specifically designated representatives have access to their entire medical surveillance records. (R) In addition, the standard requir es that the employer inform all workers exposed to lead at or above the action level of the provisions of the standard and all its appendices, the purpose and description of medical surveillance and provisions for medical removal protection if temporary removal is required. An understanding of the potential health effects of lead exposure by all exposed employees along with full understanding of their rights under the lead standard is essential for an effective monitoring program. (iii) Adverse health effects of inorganic lead. (A) Although the toxicity of lead has been known for 2,000 years, the knowledge of the complex relationship between lead exposure and human response is still being refined. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 48 Significant research into the toxic properties of lead continues thr oughout the world, and it should be anticipated that our understanding of thresholds of effects and margins of safety will be improved in future years. The provisions of the lead standard are founded on two prime medical judgments; first, the prevention o f adverse health effects from exposure to lead throughout a working lifetime requires that worker blood lead levels be maintained at or below 40 \u00b5g/100g, and second, the blood lead levels of workers, male or female, who intend to parent in the near future should be maintained below 30 \u00b5g/100g to minimize adverse reproduction health effects to the parent and developing fetus. The adverse effects of lead on reproduction are being actively researched and WISHA encourages the physician to remain abreast of rec ent developments in the area to best advise pregnant workers or workers planning to conceive children. (B) The spectrum of health effects caused by lead exposure can be sub - divided into five developmental states; normal, physiological changes of uncertain sign ificance, pathophysiological changes, overt symptoms (morbidity), and mortality. Within this process there are no sharp distinctions, but rather a continuum of effects. Boundaries between categories overlap due to the wide variation of individual respons es and exposures in the working population. WISHA's development of the lead standard focused on pathophysiological changes as well as later stages of disease. (I) Heme synthesis inhibition. a) The earliest demonstrated effect of lead involves its ability to inhibit at least two enzymes of the heme synthesis pathway at very low blood levels. Inhibition of delta aminolevulinic acid dehydrase (ALA -D) which catalyzes the conversion of delta - aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to protoporphyrin is observed at a blood lead l evel below 20\u00b5g/100g whole blood. At a blood lead level of 40 \u00b5g/100g, more than twenty percent of the population would have seventy percent inhibition of ALA -D. There is an exponential increase in ALA excretion at blood lead levels greater than 40 \u00b5g/10 0g. b) Another enzyme, ferrochelatase, is also inhibited at low blood lead levels. Inhibition of ferrochelatase leads to increased free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) in the blood which can then bind to zinc to yield zinc protoporphyrin. At a blood lea d level of 50\u00b5g/100g or greater, nearly 100 percent of the population will have an increase FEP. There is also an exponential relationship between blood lead levels greater than 40 \u00b5g/100g and the associated ZPP level, which has led to the development of the ZPP screening test for lead exposure. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 49 c) While the significance of these effects is subject to debate, it is WISHA's position that these enzyme disturbances are early stages of a disease process which may eventually result in the clinical symptoms of lead poisoning. Whether or not the effects do progress to the later stages of clinical disease, disruption of these enzyme processes over a working lifetime is considered to be a material impairment of health. d) One of the eventual results of lead -induc ed inhibition of enzymes in the heme synthesis pathway is anemia which can be asymptomatic if mild but associated with a wide array of symptoms including dizziness, fatigue, and tachycardia when more severe. Studies have indicated that lead levels as low as 50 \u00b5g/100g can be associated with a definite decreased hemoglobin, although most cases of lead -induced anemia, as well as shortened red -cell survival times, occur at lead levels exceeding 80 \u00b5g/100g. Inhibited hemoglobin synthesis is more common in chr onic cases whereas shortened erythrocyte life span is more common in acute cases. e) In lead -induced anemias, there is usually a reticulocytosis along with the presence of basophilic stippling, and ringed sideroblasts, although none of the above are pathog nomonic for lead -induced anemia. (II) Neurological effects. a) Inorganic lead had been found to have toxic effects on both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The earliest stage of lead-induced central nervous system effects first manifest themselves i n the form of behavioral disturbances and central nervous system symptoms including irritability, restlessness, insomnia and other sleep disturbances, fatigue, vertigo, headache, poor memory, tremor, depression, and apathy. With more severe exposure, symp toms can progress to drowsiness, stupor, hallucinations, delirium, convulsions and coma. b) The most severe and acute form of lead poisoning which usually follows ingestion or inhalation of large amounts of lead is acute encephalopathy which may arise prec ipitously with the onset of intractable seizures, coma, cardiorespiratory arrest, and death within 48 hours. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 50 c) While there is disagreement about what exposure levels are needed to produce the earliest symptoms, most experts agree that symptoms definitel y can occur at blood lead levels of 60 \u00b5g/100g whole blood and therefore recommend a 40 \u00b5g/100g maximum. The central nervous system effects frequently are not reversible following discontinued exposure or chelation therapy and when improvement does occur, it is almost always only partial. d) The peripheral neuropathy resulting from lead exposure characteristically involves only motor function with minimal sensory damage and has a marked predilection for the extensor muscles of the most active extremity. The peripheral neuropathy can occur with varying degrees of severity. The earliest and mildest form which can be detected in workers with blood lead levels as low as 50 \u00b5g/100g is manifested by slowing or motor nerve conduction velocity often without clinical symptoms. With progression of the neuropathy there is development of painless extensor muscle weakness usually involving the extensor muscles of the fingers and hand in the most active upper extremity, followed in severe cases by wrist drop, much less commonly, foot drop. e) In addition to slowing of nerve conduction, electromyographical studies in patients with blood lead levels greater than 50 \u00b5g/100g have demonstrated a decrease in the number of acting motor unit potentials, an increase in the durat ion of motor unit potentials, and spontaneous pathological activity including fibrillations and fasciculation. Whether these effects occur at levels of 40 \u00b5g/100g is undetermined. f) While the peripheral neuropathies can occasionally be reversed with ther apy, again such recovery is not ensured particularly in the more severe neuropathies and often improvement is only partial. The lack of reversibility is felt to be due in part to segmental demyelination. (III) Gastrointestinal. Lead may also effect the gastroi ntestinal system producing abdominal colic or diffuse abdominal pain, constipation, obstipation, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. Lead colic rarely develops at blood lead levels below 80 \u00b5g/100g. (IV) Renal. a) Renal toxicity represents one of the most serious health effects of lead poisoning. In the early stages of disease nuclear inclusion bodies can frequently be identified in proximal renal tubular cells. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 51 Renal functions remain normal and the changes in this stage are probably reversible. With m ore advanced disease there is progressive interstitial fibrosis and impaired renal function. Eventually extensive interstitial sclerotic glomeruli and dilated and all represent end stage kidney disease. Az otemia can be progressive, eventually resulting in frank uremia necessitating dialysis. There is occasionally associated hypertension and hyperuricemia with or without gout. b) Early kidney disease is difficult to detect. The urinalysis is normal in earl y lead nephropathy and the blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine increase only when two -thirds of kidney function is lost. Measurement of creatinine clearance can often detect earlier disease as can other methods of measurement of glomerular filtration rate. An abnormal Ca -EDTA mobilization test has been used to differentiate between lead - induced and other nephropathies, but this procedure is not widely accepted. A form of Fanconi syndrome with aminoaciduria, glycosuria, and hyperphosphaturia indicati ng severe injury to the proximal renal tubules is occasionally seen in children. (V) Reproductive effects. a) Exposure to lead can have serious effects on reproductive function in both males and females. In male workers exposed to lead there can be a decrease in sexual drive, impotence, decreased ability to produce healthy sperm, and sterility. Malformed sperm (teratospermia), decreased number of sperm (hypospermia), and sperm with decreased motility (asthenospermia) can occur. Teratospermia has been noted a t mean blood lead levels of 53 \u00b5g/100g and hypospermia and asthenospermia at 41 \u00b5g/100g. Furthermore, there appears to be a dose -response relationship for teratospermia in lead exposed workers. b) Women exposed to lead may experience menstrual disturbance s including dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia and amenorrhea. Following exposure to lead, women have a higher frequency of sterility, premature births, spontaneous miscarriages, and stillbirths. c) Germ cells can be affected by lead and cause genetic damage in the egg or sperm cells before conception and result in failure to implant, miscarriage, stillbirth, or birth defects. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 52 d) Infants of mothers with lead poisoning have a higher mortality during the first year and suffer from lowered birth weights, slower grow th, and nervous system disorders. e) Lead can pass through the placental barrier and lead levels in the mother's blood are comparable to concentrations of lead in the umbilical cord at birth. Transplacental passage becomes detectable at 12 -14 weeks of ges tation and increases until birth. f) There is little direct data on damage to the fetus from exposure to lead but it is generally assumed that the fetus and newborn would be at least as susceptible to neurological damage as young children. Blood lead leve ls of 50 -60 \u00b5g/100g in children can cause significant neurobehavioral impairments, and there is evidence of hyperactivity at blood levels as low as 25 \u00b5g/100g. Given the overall body of literature concerning the adverse health effects of lead in children, WISHA feels that the blood lead level in children should be maintained below 30 \u00b5g/100g with a population mean of 15 \u00b5g/100g. Blood lead levels in the fetus and newborn likewise should not exceed 30 \u00b5g/100g. g) Because of lead's ability to pass through t he placental barrier and also because of the demonstrated adverse effects of lead on reproductive function in both males and females as well as the risk of genetic damage of lead on both the ovum and sperm, WISHA recommends a 30 \u00b5g/100g maximum permissible blood lead level in both males and females who wish to bear children. (VI) Other toxic effects. a) Debate and research continue on the effects of lead on the human body. Hypertension has frequently been noted in occupationally exposed individuals although it is difficult to assess whether this is due to lead's adverse effects on the kidneys or if some other mechanism is involved. b) Vascular and electrocardiographic changes have been detected but have not been well characterized. Lead is thought to impair thyroid function and interfere with the pituitary -adrenal axis, but again these effects have not been well defined. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 53 (iv) Medical evaluation. (A) The most important principle in evaluating a worker for any occupational disease including lead poisoning is a high index of suspicion on the part of the examining physician. As discussed in Section (ii), lead can affect numerous organ systems and produce a wide array of signs and symptoms, most of which are nonspecific and subtle in nature at least in the early stages of d isease. Unless serious concern for lead toxicity is present, many of the early clues to diagnosis may easily be overlooked. (B) The crucial initial step in the medical evaluation is recognizing that a worker's employment can result in exposure to lead. The w orker will frequently be able to define exposures to lead and lead -containing materials but often will not volunteer this information unless specifically asked. In other situations the worker may not know of any exposures to lead but the suspicion might b e raised on the part of the physician because of the industry or occupation of the worker. Potential occupational exposure to lead and its compounds occur in at least 120 occupations, including lead smelting, the manufacture of lead storage batteries, the manufacture of lead pigments and products containing pigments, solder manufacture, shipbuilding and ship repair, auto manufacturing, construction, and painting. (C) Once the possibility for lead exposure is raised, the focus can then be directed toward elicit ing information from the medical history, physical exam, and finally from laboratory data to evaluate the worker for potential lead toxicity. (D) A complete and detailed work history is important in the initial evaluation. A listing of all previous employment with information on work processes, exposure to fumes or dust, known exposures to lead or other toxic substances, respiratory protection used, and previous medical surveillance should all be included in the worker's record. Where exposure to lead is suspected, information concerning on -the-job personal hygiene, smoking or eating habits in work areas, laundry procedures, and use of any protective clothing or respiratory protection equipment should be noted. A complete work history is essential in the medi cal evaluation of a worker with suspected lead toxicity, especially when long -term effects such as neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity are considered. (E) The medical history is also of fundamental importance and should include a listing of all past and current m edical conditions, current medications including proprietary drug intake, previous surgeries and hospitalizations, allergies, smoking history, alcohol consumption, and also nonoccupational lead exposures such as hobbies (hunting, riflery). Also known chil dhood exposures should be elicited. Any previous history of hematological, neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, psychological, gynecological, genetic, or reproductive problems should be specifically noted. (F) A careful and complete review of systems must b e performed to assess both recognized complaints and subtle or slowly acquired symptoms which the worker might not appreciate as being significant. The review of symptoms should include the following: Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 54 General Weight Loss, Fatigue, Decreased Appetite. Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat (HEENT) Headaches, visual disturbance or decreased visual acuity, hearing deficits or tinnitus, pigmentation of the oral mucosa, or metallic taste in mouth. Cardio -pulmonary Shortness of breath, cough, chest pains, palpitations , or orthopnea. Gastrointestinal nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea. Neurologic Irritability, insomnia, weakness (fatigue), dizziness, loss of memory, confusion, hallucinations, incoordination, ataxia, decreased streng th in hands or feet, disturbance in gait, difficulty in climbing stairs, or seizures. Hematologic pallor, easy fatigability, abnormal blood loss, melena. Reproductive (male or female and spouse where relevant) history of infertility, impotence, loss of l ibido, abnormal menstrual periods, history of miscarriages, stillbirths, or children with birth defects. Musculo -skeletal Muscle and joint pains. (G) The physical examination should emphasize the neurological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular systems. The worker's weight and blood pressure should be recorded and the oral mucosa checked for pigmentation characteristic of a possible Burtonian or lead line on the gingiva. It should be noted, however, that the lead line may not be present even in severe le ad poisoning if good oral hygiene is practiced. (H) The presence of pallor on skin examination may indicate an anemia, which if severe might also be associated with a tachycardia. If an anemia is suspected, an active search for blood loss should be undertaken including potential blood loss through the gastrointestinal tract. (I) A complete neurological examination should include an adequate mental status evaluation including a search for behavioral and psychological disturbances, memory testing, evaluation for irr itability, insomnia, hallucinations, and mental clouding. Gait and coordination should be examined along with close observation for tremor. A detailed evaluation of peripheral nerve function including careful sensory and motor function testing is warrant ed. Strength testing particularly of extensor muscle groups of all extremities is of fundamental importance. (J) Cranial nerve evaluation should also be included in the routine examination. (K) The abdominal examination should include auscultation for bowel sound s and abnormal bruits and palpation for organomegaly, masses, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 55 (L) Cardiovascular examination should evaluate possible early signs of congestive heart failure. Pulmonary status should be addressed particularly if respirator protection is contemplated. (M) As part of the medical evaluation, the lead standard requires the following laboratory studies. (I) Blood lead level. (II) Hemoglobin and hematocrit determinations, red cell indices, and examination of the peripheral blood smear to evalu ate red blood cell morphology. (III) Blood urea nitrogen. (IV) Serum creatinine. (V) Routine urinalysis with microscopic examination. (VI) A zinc protoporphyrin level. (N) In addition to the above, the physician is authorized to order any further laboratory or other tests which they deem necessary in accordance with sound medical practice. The evaluation must also include pregnancy testing or laboratory evaluation of male fertility if requested by the employee. (O) Additional tests which are probably not warranted on a routine basis but may be appropriate when blood lead and ZPP levels are equivocal include delta aminolevulinic acid and coproporphyrin concentrations in the urine, and dark -field illumination for detection of basophilic stippling in red blood cells. (P) If an anemia is dete cted further studies including a careful examination of the peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, stool for occult blood, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, bilirubin, and, if appropriate vitamin B12 and folate may be of value in attempting to identi fy the cause of the anemia. (Q) If a peripheral neuropathy is suspected, nerve conduction studies are warranted both for diagnosis and as a basis to monitor any therapy. (R) If renal disease is questioned, a 24 -hour urine collection for creatinine clearance, prote in, and electrolytes may be indicated. Elevated uric acid levels may result from lead -induced renal disease and a serum uric acid level might be performed. (S) An electrocardiogram and chest x -ray may be obtained as deemed appropriate. (T) Sophisticated and highl y specialized testing should not be done routinely and where indicated should be under the direction of a specialist. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 56 (v) Laboratory evaluation. (A) The blood level at present remains the single most important test to monitor lead exposure and is the test used i n the medical surveillance program under the lead standard to guide employee medical removal. The ZPP has several advantages over the blood lead level. Because of its relatively recent development and the lack of extensive data concerning its interpretat ion, the ZPP currently remains an ancillary test. (B) This section will discuss the blood lead level and ZPP in detail and will outline their relative advantages and disadvantages. Other blood tests currently available to evaluate lead exposure will also be r eviewed. (C) The blood lead level is a good index of current or recent lead absorption when there is no anemia present and when the worker has not taken any chelating agents. However, blood lead levels along with urinary lead levels do not necessarily indicat e the total body burden of lead and are not adequate measures of past exposure. One reason for this is that lead has a high affinity for bone and up to 90 percent of the body's total lead is deposited there. A very important component of the total lead b ody burden is lead in soft tissue (liver, kidneys, and brain). This fraction of the lead body burden, the biologically active lead, is not entirely reflected by blood lead levels since it is a function of the dynamics of lead absorption, distribution, dep osition in bone and excretion. Following discontinuation of exposure to lead, the excess body burden is only slowly mobilized from bone and other relatively stable stores and excreted. Consequently, a high blood lead level may only represent recent heavy exposure to lead without a significant total body excess and likewise a low blood lead level does not exclude an elevated total body burden of lead. (D) Also due to its correlation with recent exposures, the blood lead level may vary considerably over short t ime intervals. (E) To minimize laboratory error and erroneous results due to contamination, blood specimens must be carefully collected after thorough cleaning of the skin with appropriate methods using lead -free containers and analyzed by a reliable laborator y. Under the standard, samples must be analyzed in laboratories which are approved by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) or which have received satisfactory grades in proficiency testing by the CDC in the previous year. Analysis is to be made using ato mic absorption spectrophotometry anodic stripping; voltammetry or any method which meets the accuracy requirements set forth by the standard. (F) The determination of lead in urine is generally considered a less reliable monitoring technique than analysis of w hole blood primarily due to individual variability in urinary excretion capacity as well as the technical difficulty of obtaining accurate 24 hour urine collections. In addition, workers with renal insufficiency, whether due to lead or some other cause, may have decreased lead clearance and consequently urine lead levels may underestimate the true lead burden. Therefore, urine lead levels should not be used as a routine test. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 57 (G) The zinc protoporphyrin test, unlike the blood lead determination, measures an a dverse metabolic effect of lead and as such is a better indicator of lead toxicity than the level of blood lead itself. The level of ZPP reflects lead absorption over the preceding three to four months, and therefore is a better indicator of lead body bur den. The ZPP requires more time than the blood lead to read significantly elevated levels; the return to normal after discontinuing lead exposure is also slower. Furthermore, the ZPP test is simpler, faster, and less expensive to perform and no contamina tion is possible. Many investigators believe it is the most reliable means of monitoring chronic lead absorption. (H) Zinc protoporphyrin results from the inhibition of the enzyme ferrochelatase which catalyzes the insertion of an iron molecule into the proto porphyrin molecule, which then becomes heme. If iron is not inserted into the molecule then zinc, having a greater affinity for protoporphyrin, takes place in the iron, forming ZPP. (I) An elevation in the level of circulating ZPP may occur at blood lead leve ls as low as 20 -30 \u00b5g/100g in some workers. Once the blood lead level has reached 40 \u00b5g/100g there is more marked rise in the ZPP value from its normal range of less than 100 \u00b5g/100ml. Increases in blood lead levels beyond 40 \u00b5g/100g are associated with exponential increases in ZPP. (J) Whereas blood lead levels fluctuate over short time spans, ZPP levels remain relatively stable. ZPP is measured directly in red blood cells and is present for the cell's entire 120 day lifespan. Therefore, the ZPP level in blood reflects the average ZPP production over the previous three to four months and consequently the average lead exposure during that time interval. (K) It is recommended that a hematocrit be determined whenever a confirmed ZPP of 50 \u00b5g/100ml whole blood is o btained to rule out a significant underlying anemia. If the ZPP is in excess of 100\u00b5g/100ml and not associated with abnormal elevations in blood lead levels, the laboratory should be checked to be sure the blood leads were determined using atomic absorpti on spectrophotometry, anodic stripping voltammetry or any method which meets the accuracy requirements set forth by the standard, by a CDC approved laboratory which is experienced in lead level determinations. Repeat periodic blood lead studies should be obtained in all individuals with elevated ZPP levels to be certain that an associated elevated blood lead level has not been missed due to transient fluctuations in blood leads. (L) ZPP has characteristic fluorescence spectrum with a peak at 594nm which is det ectable with a hematofluorimeter. The hematofluorimeter is accurate and portable and can provide on -site, instantaneous results for workers who can be frequently tested via a finger prick. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 58 (M) However, careful attention must be given to calibration and qual ity control procedures. Limited data on blood lead - ZPP correlations and the ZPP levels which are associated with the adverse health effects discussed in item (ii) are the major limitations of the test. Also it is difficult to correlate ZPP levels with environmental exposure and there is some variation of response with age and sex. Nevertheless, the ZPP promises to be an important diagnostic test for the early detection of lead toxicity and its value will increase as more data is collected regarding its relationship to other manifestations of lead poisoning. (N) Levels of delta -aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the urine are also used as a measure of lead exposure. Increasing concentrations of ALA are believed to result from the inhibition of the enzyme delta -aminolevulinic acid dehydrase (ALA -D). Although the test is relatively easy to perform, inexpensive, and rapid, the disadvantages include variability in results, the necessity to collect a complete 24 hour urine sample which has a specific gravity greater t han 1.010, and also the fact that ALA decomposes in the presence of light. (O) The pattern of porphyrin excretion in the urine can also be helpful in identifying lead intoxication. With lead poisoning, the urine concentrations of coproporphyrins I and II, por phobilinogen and uroporphyrin I rise. The most important increase, however, is that of coproporphyrin III; levels may exceed 5,000 \u00b5g/1 in the urine in lead poisoned individuals, but its correlation with blood lead levels and ZPP are not as good as those of ALA. Increases in urinary porphyrins are not diagnostic of lead toxicity and may be seen in porphyria, some liver diseases, and in patients with high reticulocyte counts. (vi) Summary. (A) The WISHA standard for inorganic lead places significant emphasis on the medical surveillance of all workers exposed to levels of inorganic lead above the action level of 30 \u00b5g/m3 TWA. The physician has a fundamental role in this surveillance program, and in the operation of the medical removal protection program. (B) Even with a dequate worker education on the adverse health effects of lead and appropriate training in work practices, personal hygiene and other control measures, the physician has a primary responsibility for evaluating potential lead toxicity in the worker. It is only through a careful and detailed medical and work history, a complete physical examination and appropriate laboratory testing that an accurate assessment can be made. Many of the adverse health effects of lead toxicity are either irreversible or only p artially reversible and therefore early detection of disease is very important. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 59 (C) This document outlines the medical monitoring program as defined by the occupational safety and health standard for inorganic lead. It reviews the adverse health effects of lead poisoning and describes the important elements of the history and physical examinations as they relate to these adverse effects. (D) It is hoped that this review and discussion will give the physician a better understanding of the WISHA standard with the ultimate goal of protecting the health and well -being of the worker exposed to lead under their care. (d) Appendix D. Recommendations to employers concerning high -risk tasks (nonmandatory). The department advises employers that the following tasks have a high risk for lead overexposure (this list is not complete; other tasks also can result in lead over - exposure): Any open flame operation involving lead -containing solder in a manner producing molten solder, including the manufacture or repair of motor vehicle radiators; Sanding, cutting or grinding of lead -containing solder; Breaking, recycling or manufacture of lead -containing batteries; Casting objects using lead, brass, or lead -containing alloys; Where lead -containing coatings or paints are present: Abrasive blasting Welding Cutting Torch burning Manual demolition of structures Manual scraping Manual sanding Heat gun applications Power tool cleaning Rivet busting Clean -up activities where dry expendable abrasives are used Abrasive blasting enclosure movement and removal; Spray -painting with lead -containing paint; Using lead -containing mortar; Lead burning; Operation or cleaning of shooting facilities where lead bullets are used; Formulation or processing of lead -containing pigments or paints; Cutting, burning, or melting of lead -containing materials. The department recommends that annual blood lead testing be offered to all employees potentially overexposed to lead, including those performing the tasks listed above, regardless of air lead levels. Research has shown that air lead levels often do not accurately predict workers' lead overexposure. The blood lead testing will provide the most information if performed during a period of peak lead exposure. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 60 Employers should be aware that the United States Public H ealth Service has set a goal of eliminating occupational exposures which result in whole blood lead levels of 25 \u00b5g/dl or greater. This goal should guide whether employees' blood lead levels indicate lead overexposure. If blood lead levels are elevated in an employee performing a task associated with lead overexposure, employers should assess the maintenance and effectiveness of exposure controls, hygiene facilities, respiratory protection program, the employee's work practices and personal hygiene, and th e employee's respirator use, if any. If a deficiency exists in any of these areas, the employer should correct the problem. WAC 296 -62-07531 Appendix D sampling and analytical methods for benzene monitoring and measurement procedures . Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure to benzene are best taken so that the representative average eight -hour exposure may be determined from a single eight -hour sample or two four -hour samples. Short -time interval samples (or grab samples) may also be used to determine average exposure level if a minimum of five measurements are taken in a random manner over the eight -hour work shift. Random sampling means that any portion of the work shift has the same chance of being sampled as any other. T he arithmetic average of all such random samples taken on one work shift is an estimate of an employee's average level of exposure for that work shift. Air samples should be taken in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent that inhaled by the employee). Sampling and analysis must be performed with procedures meeting the requirements of the standard. There are a number of methods available for monitoring employee exposures to benzene. The sampling and analysis may be performed by collection of the benzene vapor on charcoal adsorption tubes, with subsequent chemical analysis by gas chromatography. Sampling and analysis may also be performed by portable direct reading instruments, real -time continuous monitoring systems, passive dosimeters or other suitable methods. The employer has the obligation of selecting a monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of the standard under his unique field conditions. The standard requires that the method of monitor ing must have an accuracy, to a ninety -five percent confidence level, of not less than plus or minus twenty -five percent for concentrations of benzene greater than or equal to 0.5 ppm. The WISHA laboratory uses NIOSH Method 1500 for evaluation of benzene a ir concentrations. (1) WISHA method HYDCB for air samples Benzene. Procedure: on disulfide, analysis by GC. Detection limit: 0.04 ppm. Recommended air volume and sampling rate: 10L at 0.05 to 0.2 L/min. (a) Principle of the method. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 61 A known volume of air is drawn through a charcoal tube to trap the organic vapors present. The charcoal in the tube is transferred to a small, stoppered vial, and the analyte is desorbed with carbon disulfide. An a liquot of the desorbed sample is injected into a gas chromatograph. The area of the resulting peak is determined and compared with areas obtained from standards. (b) Advantages and disadvantages of the method. The sampling device is small, portable, and involv es no liquids. Interferences are minimal, and most of those which do occur can be eliminated by altering chromatographic conditions. The samples are analyzed by means of a quick, instrumental method. The amount of sample which can be taken is limited by the number of milligrams that the tube will hold before overloading. When the sample value obtained for the backup section of the charcoal tube exceeds twenty -five percent of that found on the front section, the possibility of sample loss exists. (c) Apparatu s. A calibrated personal sampling pump whose flow can be determined within \u00b15 percent at the recommended flow rate. Charcoal tubes: Glass with both ends flame sealed, 7 cm long with a 6 -mm O.D. and a 4 -mm I.D., containing two sections of 20/40 mesh activa ted charcoal separated by a 2 -mm portion of urethane foam. The activated charcoal is prepared from coconut shells and is obtained commercially. The adsorbing section contains 100 mg of charcoal, the back -up section 50 mg. A 3 -mm portion of urethane foam is placed between the outlet end of the tube and the back -up section. A plug of silanized glass wool is placed in front of the adsorbing section. The pressure drop across the tube must be less than one inch of mercury at a flow rate of one liter per min ute. Gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. Column (10 -ft 1/8 -in stainless steel) packed with 80/100 Supelcoport coated with twenty percent SP 2100, 0.1 percent CW 1500. (v) An electronic integrator or some other suitable method for m easuring peak area. Two-milliliter sample vials with syringes: 10 -microliter 10 -uL syringe, and other convenient sizes for making standards, 1 -uL syringe for sample injections. Pipets: 1.0 mL delivery pipets. Volumetric flas ks: Convenient sizes for making standard solutions. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 62 (d) Reagents. Chromatographic quality carbon disulfide (CS2). Most commercially available carbon disulfide contains a trace of benzene which must be removed. It can be removed with the following procedur e: Heat under reflux for two to three hours, 500 mL of carbon disulfide, 10 mL concentrated sulfuric acid, and five drops of concentrated nitric acid. The benzene is converted to nitrobenzene. The carbon disulfide layer is removed, dried with anhydrous s odium sulfate, and distilled. The recovered carbon disulfide should be benzene free. (It has recently been determined that benzene can also be removed by passing the carbon disulfide through 13x molecular sieve.) Benzene, reagent grade. (internal standard). Desorbing reagent. The desorbing reagent is prepared by adding 0.05 mL of p - Cymene per milliliter of carbon disulfide. (The internal standard offers a convenient means correcting analytical response for slight inconsistencies in the size of sample injections. If the external standard technique is preferred, the internal standard can be eliminated.) Purified GC grade helium, hydrogen, and air. (e) Procedure. Cleaning of equipment. All glassware used for the laboratory analysis sh ould be properly cleaned and free of organics which could interfere in the analysis. Calibration of personal pumps. Each pump must be calibrated with a representative charcoal tube in the line. Collection and shipping of samples. (A) Immediately before sampli ng, break the ends of the tube to provide an opening at least one -half the internal diameter of the tube (2 mm). (B) The smaller section of the charcoal is used as the backup and should be placed nearest the sampling pump. (C) The charcoal tube should be placed in a vertical position during sampling to minimize channeling through the charcoal. (D) Air being sampled should not be passed through any hose or tubing before entering the charcoal tube. (E) A sample size of ten liters is recommended. Sample at a flow rate of approximately 0.05 to 0.2 liters per minute. The flow rate should be known with an accuracy of at least \u00b15 percent. (F) The charcoal tubes should be capped with the supplied plastic caps immediately after sampling. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 63 (G) Submit at least one blank tube (a charcoal tu be subjected to the same handling procedures, without having any air drawn through it) with each set of samples. Take necessary shipping and packing precautions to minimize breakage of samples. Analysis of samples. (A) Preparation of samples. In preparation for analysis, each charcoal tube is scored with a file in front of the first section of charcoal and broken open. The glass wool is removed and discarded. The charcoal in the first (larger) section is transferred to a 2 -ml vial. The separating section o f foam is removed and discarded; the second section is transferred to another capped vial. These two sections are analyzed separately. (B) Desorption of samples. Prior to analysis, 1.0 mL of desorbing solution is pipetted into each sample container. The des orbing solution consists of 0.05 \u00b5L internal standard per mL of carbon disulfide. The sample vials are capped as soon as the solvent is added. Desorption should be done for thirty minutes with occasional shaking. (C) GC conditions. Typical operating conditi ons for the gas chromatograph are: (I) 30 mL/min (60 psig) helium carrier gas flow. (II) 30 mL/min (40 psig) hydrogen gas flow to detector. (III) 240 mL/min (40 psig) air flow to detector. (IV) 150C injector temperature. (V) 250C detector temperature. (VI) 100C column temperature. (D) Injection size. 1 \u00b5L. (E) Measurement of area. The peak areas are measured by an electronic integrator or some other suitable form of area measurement. (F) An internal standard procedure is used. The integrator is calibrated to report results in ppm for a ten l iter air sample after correction for desorption efficiency. Determ ination of desorption eff iciency. (A) Importance of determination. The desorption efficiency of a particular compound can vary from one laboratory to another and from one lot of chemical to ano ther. Thus, it is necessary to determine, at least once, the percentage of the specific compound that is removed in the desorption process, provided the same batch of charcoal is used. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 64 (B) Procedure for determining desorption efficiency. The reference port ion of the charcoal tube is removed. To the remaining portion, amounts representing 0.5X, 1X, and 2X and (X represents target concentration) based on a 10 L air sample are injected into several tubes at each level. Dilutions of benzene with carbon disulf ide are made to allow injection of measurable quantities. These tubes are then allowed to equilibrate at least overnight. Following equilibration they are analyzed following the same procedure as the samples. Desorption efficiency is determined by dividing the amount of benzene found by amount spiked on the tube. (f) Calibration and standards. A series of standards varying in concentration over the range of interest is prepared and analyzed under the same GC conditions that will be used on the samples. A calibration curve is prepared by plotting concentration (mg/mL) versus peak area. (g) Calculations. Benzene air concentration can be calculated from the following equation: mg/m3 = (A)(B)/(C)(D) Where: A = \u00b5g/mL benzene, obtained from the calibration curve B = desorption volume (1 mL) C = Liters of air sampled D = desorption efficiency The concentration in mg/m3 can be converted to ppm (at 25 C and 760 mm) with the following equation: ppm = (mg/m3)(24.46)/(78.11) Where: 24.46 = molar volume of an ideal gas 25 C and 760 mm 78.11 = molecular weight of benzene (h) Backup data. Detection limit -air samples. The detection limit for the analytical procedure is 1.28 mg with a coefficient of 0.04 ppm for a 10 L air sample. This amount provided a chromatographic peak that could be identifiable in the presence of possible interferences. The detection limit data were obtained by making 1 \u00b5L injections of a 1.283 \u00b5g/mL standard.

(b) Advantages and disadvantages of the method. The analytical procedure is quick, sensitive, and reproducible. Reanalysis of samples is possible. Interferences can be circumvent ed by proper selection of HPLC parameters or GC parameters. Samples must be free of any particulates that may clog the capillary tubing in the liquid chromatograph. This may require distilling the sample or clarifying with a clarification kit. (c) Apparatus. Liquid chromatograph equipped with a UV detector or capillary gas chromatograph with FID detector. HPLC column that will separate benzene from other components in the bulk sample being analyzed. The column used for validation studies was a Waters uBondapa ck C18, 30 cm x 3.9 mm.

Note : The requirements in this chapter apply only to agriculture. The general industry requirements relating to formaldehyde have been moved to chapter 296-856 WAC, Formaldehyde. (1) Scope and application . This standard applies to all occupational exposures to formaldehyde, i.e., from formaldehyde gas, its solutions, and materials that release formaldehyde. (2) Definitions . For purposes of this standard, the following definitions shall apply: (a) Action level . A concentration of 0.5 part formaldehyde per million parts of air (0.5 ppm) calculated as an 8 -hour time -weighted a verage (TWA) concentration. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 70 (b) Approved . Approved by the director of the department of labor and industries or their authorized representative: Provided, however, That should a provision of this chapter state that approval by an agency or organization oth er than the department of labor and industries is required, such as Underwriters' Laboratories or the Mine Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the provision of WAC 296-800-370 shall apply. (c) Authorized person . Any person required by work duties to be present in regulated work areas, or authorized to do so by the employer, by this section of the standard, or by the WISHA Act. (d) Director . The director of the department of labor and industries, or their designated representative. (e) Emergency . Any occurrence, such as but not limited to equipment failure, rupture of containers, or failure of control equipment that results in an uncontrolled release of a significant amount of formaldehyde. (f) Employee exposure . The exposure to airborne formaldehyde which would occur without corrections for protection provided by any respirator that is in use. (g) Formaldehyde . The chemica l substance, HCHO, Chemical Abstracts Service Registry No. 50 -00-0. (3) Permissible exposure limit (PEL ). (a) TWA: The employer must ensure that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of formaldehyde which exceeds 0.75 part formaldehyde per million parts of air as an 8 -hour TWA. (b) Short term exposure limit (STEL): The employer shall must ensure that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of formaldehyde which exceeds two parts formaldehyde per million parts of air (2 ppm) as a fifteen -minu te STEL. (4) Exposure monitoring . (a) General. Each employer who has a workplace covered by this standard must monitor employees to determine their exposure to formaldehyde. Exception. Where the employer do cuments, using objective data, hat the presence of formal dehyde or formaldehyde -releasing products in the workplace cannot result in airborne concentrations of formaldehyde that would cause any employee to be exposed at or above the action level or the STEL under foreseeable conditions of use, the employer will not be required to measure employee exposure to formaldehyde. When an employee's exposure is determined from representative sampling, the measurements used must be representative of the employee's full shift or short - term exposure to formaldehyde, as appro priate. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 71 (iv) Representative samples for each job classification in each work area must be taken for each shift unless the employer can document with objective data that exposure levels for a given job classification are equivalent for different workshift s. (b) Initial monitoring. The employer must identify all employees who may be exposed at or above the action level or at or above the STEL and accurately determine the exposure of each employee so identified. Unless the employer chooses to measure the exposu re of each employee potentially exposed to formaldehyde, the employer must develop a representative sampling strategy and measure sufficient exposures within each job classification for each workshift to correctly characterize and not underestimate the exp osure of any employee within each exposure group. The initial monitoring process must be repeated each time there is a change in production, equipment, process, personnel, or control measures which may result in new or additional exposure to formaldehyde. If the employer receives reports or signs or symptoms of respiratory or dermal conditions associated with formaldehyde exposure, the employer must promptly monitor the affected employee's exposure. (c) Periodic monitoring. The employer must periodically measur e and accurately determine exposure to formaldehyde for employees shown by the initial monitoring to be exposed at or above the action level or at or above the STEL. If the last monitoring results reveal employee exposure at or above the action level, the employer must repeat monitoring of the employees at least every six months. If the last monitoring results reveal employee exposure at or above the STEL, the employer must repeat monitoring of the employees at least once a year under worst conditions. (d) Term ination of monitoring. The employer may discontinue periodic monitoring for employees if results from two consecutive sampling periods taken at least seven days apart show that employee exposure is below the action level and the STEL. The results must be statistically representative and consistent with the employer's knowledge of the job and work operation. (e) Accuracy of monitoring. Monitoring must be accurate, at the ninety -five percent confidence level, to within plus or minus twenty -five percent for air borne concentrations of formaldehyde at the TWA and the STEL and to within plus or minus thirty -five percent for airborne concentrations of formaldehyde at the action level. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 72 (f) Employee notification of monitoring results. Within fifteen days of receiving t he results of exposure monitoring conducted under this standard, the employer must notify the affected employees of these results. Notification must be in writing, either by distributing copies of the results to the employees or by posting the results. I f the employee exposure is over either PEL, the employer must develop and implement a written plan to reduce employee exposure to or below both PELs, and give written notice to employees. The written notice must contain a description of the corrective action being taken by the employer to decrease exposure. (g) Observation of monitoring. The employer must provide affected employees or their designated representatives an opportunity to observe any monitoring of employee exposure to formaldehyde required by this standard. When observation of the monitoring of employee exposure to formaldehyde requires entry into an area where the use of protective clothing or equipment is required, the employer must provide the clothing and equipment to the observer, require the observer to use such clothing and equipment, and ensure that the observer complies with all other applicable safety and health procedures. (5) Regulated areas . (a) The employer must establish regulated areas where the concentration of airborne formaldehyde exceeds either the TWA or the STEL and post all entrances and accessways with signs bearing the following information: DANGER FORMALDEHYDE IRRITANT AND POTENTIAL CANCER HAZARD AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY (b) The employer must limit access to regulated areas to authoriz ed persons who have been trained to recognize the hazards of formaldehyde. (c) An employer at a multi -employer worksite who establishes a regulated area must communicate the access restrictions and locations of these areas to other employers with work operatio ns at that worksite. (6) Methods of compliance . (a) Engineering controls and work practices. The employer must institute engineering and work practice controls to reduce and maintain employee exposures to formaldehyde at or below the TWA and the STEL. (b) Exception. Whenever the employer has established that feasible engineering and work practice controls cannot reduce employee exposure to or below either of the PELs, the employer must apply these controls to reduce employee exposures to the extent feasible and must supplement them with respirators which satisfy this standard. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 73 (7) Respiratory protection . (a) General. For employees who use respirators required by this section, the employer must provide respirators that comply with the requirements of this subsection. Respi rators must be used during: Periods necessary to install or implement feasible engineering and work - practice controls; Work operations, such as maintenance and repair activities or vessel cleaning, for which the employer establishes that engineering and wo rk-practice controls are not feasible; Work operations for which feasible engineering and work -practice controls are not yet sufficient to reduce exposure to or below the PELs; Emergencies. (b) Respirator program. The employer must implement a respiratory prot ection program as required by chapter 296-842 WAC, and 296-842-14005. If -cartridge respirators are used, the employer must: (A) Replace the cartridge after three hours of use or at the e nd of the workshift, whichever occurs first, unless the cartridge contains a NIOSH - certified end -of-service -life indicator (ESLI) to shown when breakthrough occurs. (B) Unless the canister contains a NIOSH -certified ESLI to show when breakthrough occurs, repla ce canisters used in atmospheres up to 7.5 ppm (10 x PEL) every four hours and industrial -sized canisters used in atmospheres up to 75 ppm (100 x PEL) every two hours, or at the end of the workshift, whichever occurs first. (c) Respirator selection. (i) The employer must select appropriate respirators from Table 1 of this section.

(ii) The employer must provid e a powered air -purifying respirator adequate to protect against formaldehyde exposure to any employee who has difficulty using a negative -pressure respirator. (8) Protective equipment and clothing . Employers must comply with the provisions of WAC 296-800-160. When protective equipment or clothing is provided under these provisions, the employer must provide these protective devices at no cost to the employee and ass ure that the employee wears them. (a) Selection. The employer must select protective clothing and equipment based upon the form of formaldehyde to be encountered, the conditions of use, and the hazard to be prevented. All contact of the eyes and skin with liq uids containing one percent or more formaldehyde must be prevented by the use of chemical protective clothing made of material impervious to formaldehyde and the use of other personal protective equipment, such as goggles and face shields, as appropriate t o the operation. Contact with irritating or sensitizing materials must be prevented to the extent necessary to eliminate the hazard. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 75 Where a face shield is worn, chemical safety goggles are also required if there is a danger of formaldehyde reaching the area of the eye. Full body protection must be worn for entry into areas where concentrations exceed 100 ppm and for emergency reentry into areas of unknown concentration. (b) Maintenance of protective equipment and clothing. The employer must ensure that prote ctive equipment and clothing that has become contaminated with formaldehyde is cleaned or laundered before its reuse. When ventilating formaldehyde -contaminated clothing and equipment, the employer must establish a storage area so that employee exposure is minimized. Containers for contaminated clothing and equipment and storage areas must have labels and signs containing the following information: DANGER FORMALDEHYDE -CONTAMINATED (CLOTHING) EQUIPMENT AVOID INHALATION AND SKIN CONTACT The employer must ens ure that only persons trained to recognize the hazards of formaldehyde remove the contaminated material from the storage area for purposes of cleaning, laundering, or disposal. The employer must ensure that no employee takes home equipment or clothing that is contaminated with formaldehyde. The employer must repair or replace all required protective clothing and equipment for each affected employee as necessary to ensure its effectiveness. The employer must inform any person who launders, cleans, or repairs such clothing or equipment of formaldehyde's potentially harmful effects and of procedures to safely handle the clothing and equipment. (9) Hygiene protection . (a) The employer must provide change rooms, as described in WAC 296-800-230 for employees who are required to change from work clothing into protective clothing to prevent skin contact with formaldehyde. (b) If employees' skin may become splashed with solutions contain ing one percent or greater formaldehyde, for example because of equipment failure or improper work practices, the employer must provide conveniently located quick drench showers and ensure that affected employees use these facilities immediately.

(d) Formaldehyde -contaminated waste and debris resulting from leaks or spills must be placed for disposal in sealed containers bearing a label warning of formald ehyde's presence and of the hazards associated with formaldehyde. (11) Emergencies . For each workplace where there is the possibility of an emergency involving formaldehyde, the employer must ensure appropriate procedures are adopted to minimize injury and los s of life. Appropriate procedures must be implemented in the event of an emergency. (12) Medical surveillance . (a) Employees covered. The employer must institute medical surveillance programs for all employees exposed to formaldehyde at concentrations at or exceed ing the action level or exceeding the STEL. The employer must make medical surveillance available for employees who develop signs and symptoms of overexposure to formaldehyde and for all employees exposed to formaldehyde in emergencies. When determining w hether an employee may be experiencing signs and symptoms of possible overexposure to formaldehyde, the employer may rely on the evidence that signs and symptoms associated with formaldehyde exposure will occur only in exceptional circumstances when airbor ne exposure is less than 0.1 ppm and when formaldehyde is present in materials in concentrations less than 0.1 percent. (b) Examination by a physician. All medical procedures, including administration of medical disease questionnaires, must be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed physician and shall be provided without cost to the employee, without loss of pay, and at a reasonable time and place. (c) Medical disease questionnaire. The employer must make the following medical surveillance available to employees prior to assignment to a job where formaldehyde exposure is at or above the action level or above the STEL and annually thereafter. The employer must also make the following medical surveillance available promptly upon determining that an emp loyee is experiencing signs and symptoms indicative of possible overexposure to formaldehyde. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 77 Administration of a medical disease questionnaire, such as in Appendix D, which is designed to elicit information on work history, smoking history, any evidence of eye, nose, or throat irritation; chronic airway problems or hyperreactive airway disease; allergic skin conditions or dermatitis; and upper or lower respiratory problems. A determination by the physician, based on evaluation of the medical disease questionnaire, of whether a medical examination is necessary for employees not required to wear respirators to reduce exposure to formaldehyde. (d) Medical examinations. Medical examinations must be given to any employee who the physician feels, based on informat ion in the medical disease questionnaire, may be at increased risk from exposure to formaldehyde and at the time of initial assignment and at least annually thereafter to all employees required to wear a respirator to reduce exposure to formaldehyde. The medical examination must include: A physical examination with emphasis on evidence of irritation or sensitization of the skin and respiratory system, shortness of breath, or irritation of the eyes. Laboratory examinations for respirator wearers consisting of baseline and annual pulmonary function tests. As a minimum, these tests must consist of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and forced expiratory flow (FEF). Any other test which the examining physician deems nec essary to complete the written opinion. Counseling of employees having medical conditions that would be directly or indirectly aggravated by exposure to formaldehyde on the increased risk of impairment of their health. (e) Examinations for employees exposed in an emergency. The employer must make medical examinations available as soon as possible to all employees who have been exposed to formaldehyde in an emergency. The examination must include a medical and work history with emphasis on any evidence of upper or lower respiratory problems, allergic conditions, skin reaction or hypersensitivity, and any evidence of eye, nose, or throat irritation. Other examinations must consist of those elements considered appropriate by the examining physician. (f) Information pr ovided to the physician. The employer must provide the following information to the examining physician: A copy of this standard and Appendices A, C, D, and E; A description of the affected employee's job duties as they relate to the employee's exposure t o formaldehyde; The representative exposure level for the employee's job assignment; Information concerning any personal protective equipment and respiratory protection used or to be used by the employee; and Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 78 Information from previous medical examination s of the affected employee within the control of the employer. In the event of a nonroutine examination because of an emergency, the employer must provide to the physician as soon as possible: A description of how the emergency occurred and the exposure t he victim may have received. (g) Physician's written opinion. For each examination required under this standard, the employer must obtain a written opinion from the examining physician. This written opinion must contain the results of the medical examination except that it must not reveal specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to occupational exposure to formaldehyde. The written opinion must include: (A) The physician's opinion as to whether the employee has any medical condition that would place the employee at an increased risk of material impairment of health exposure to formaldehyde. (B) Any recommended limitations on the employee's exposure or changes in the use of personal protective equipment, including respirators; (C) A statement that the employee has been inf ormed by the physician of any medical conditions which would be aggravated by exposure to formaldehyde, whether these conditions may have resulted from past formaldehyde exposure or from exposure in an emergency, and whether there is a need for further exa mination or treatment. The employer must provide for retention of the results of the medical examination and tests conducted by the physician. The employer must provide a copy of the physician's written opinion to the affected employee within fifteen days of its receipt. (h) Medical removal. The provisions of this subdivision apply when an employee reports significant irritation of the mucosa of the eyes or of the upper airways, respiratory sensitization, dermal irritation, or dermal sensitization attributed to workplace formaldehyde exposure. Medical removal provisions do not apply in case of dermal irritation or dermal sensitization when the product suspected of causing the dermal condition contains less than 0.05% formaldehyde. An employee's report of signs or symptoms of possible overexposure to formaldehyde must be evaluated by a physician selected by the employer pursuant to (c) of this subsection. If the physician determines that a medical examination is not necessary under (c)(ii) of this subsection, th ere must be a two -week evaluation and remediation period to permit the employer to ascertain whether the signs or symptoms subside untreated or with the use of creams, gloves, first aid treatment, or personal protective equipment. Industrial hygiene meas ures that limit the employee's exposure to formaldehyde may also be implemented during this period. The employee must be referred immediately to a physician prior to expiration of the two -week period if the signs or symptoms worsen. Earnings, seniority, and benefits may not be altered during the two -week period by virtue of the report. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 79 If the signs or symptoms have not subsided or been remedied by the end of the two-week period, or earlier if signs or symptoms warrant, the employee must be examined by a physician selected by the employer. The physician must presume, absent contrary evidence, that observed dermal irritation or dermal sensitization are not attributable to formaldehyde when products to which the affected employee is exposed contain less th an 0.1% formaldehyde. Medical examinations must be conducted in compliance with the requirements of (e)(i) and (ii) of this subsection. Additional guidelines for conducting medical exams are contained in WAC 296 -62-07546, Appendix C. If the physician find s that significant irritation of the mucosa of the eyes or the upper airways, respiratory sensitization, dermal irritation, or dermal sensitization result from workplace formaldehyde exposure and recommends restrictions or removal. The employer must promp tly comply with the restrictions or recommendations of removal. In the event of a recommendation of removal, the employer must remove the affected employee from the current formaldehyde exposure and if possible, transfer the employee to work having no or significantly less exposure to formaldehyde. When an employee is removed pursuant to item (v) of this subdivision, the employer must transfer the employee to comparable work for which the employee is qualified or can be trained in a short period (up to six months), where the formaldehyde exposures are as low as possible, but not higher than the action level. The employer must maintain the employee's current earnings, seniority, and other benefits. If there is no such work available, the employer must main tain the employee's current earnings, seniority, and other benefits until such work becomes available, until the employee is determined to be unable to return to workplace formaldehyde exposure, until the employee is determined to be able to return to the original job status, or for six months, whichever comes first. The employer must arrange for a follow -up medical examination to take place within six months after the employee is removed pursuant to this subsection. This examination must determine if the employee can return to the original job status, or if the removal is to be permanent. The physician must make a decision within six months of the date the employee was removed as to whether the employee can be returned to the original job status, or if th e removal is to be permanent. An employer's obligation to provide earnings, seniority, and other benefits to a removed employee may be reduced to the extent that the employee receives compensation for earnings lost during the period of removal either from a publicly or employer -funded compensation program or from employment with another employer made possible by virtue of the employee's removal. In making determinations of the formaldehyde content of materials under this subsection the employer may rely on objective data. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 80 (i) Multiple physician review. After the employer selects the initial physician who conducts any medical examination or consultation to determine whether medical removal or restriction is appropriate, the employee may designate a second physi cian to review any findings, determinations, or recommendations of the initial physician and to conduct such examinations, consultations, and laboratory tests as the second physician deems necessary and appropriate to evaluate the effects of formaldehyde e xposure and to facilitate this review. The employer must promptly notify an employee of the right to seek a second medical opinion after each occasion that an initial physician conducts a medical examination or consultation for the purpose of medical remov al or restriction. The employer may condition its participation in, and payment for, the multiple physician review mechanism upon the employee doing the following within fifteen days after receipt of the notification of the right to seek a second medical opinion, or receipt of the initial physician's written opinion, whichever is later: (A) The employee informs the employer of the intention to seek a second medical opinion; and (B) The employee initiates steps to make an appointment with a second physician. If the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the second physician differ from those of the initial physician, then the employer and the employee must ensure that efforts are made for the two physicians to resolve the disagreement. If the two physicians are unable to quickly resolve their disagreement, then the employer and the employee through their respective physicians must designate a third physician who must be a specialist in the field at issue: (A) To review the findings, determinations, or recommenda tions of the prior physicians; and (B) To conduct such examinations, consultations, laboratory tests, and discussions with prior physicians as the third physician deems necessary to resolve the disagreement of the prior physicians. In the alternative, the empl oyer and the employee or authorized employee representative may jointly designate such third physician. The employer must act consistent with the findings, determinations, and recommendations of the third physician, unless the employer and the employee reach an agreement which is otherwise consistent with the recommendations of at least one of the three physicians.

WAC 296 -62-07542 Appendix A --Substance technical guideline formalin. (1) The following substance technical guideline for formalin provides information on uninhibited formalin solution (thirty -seven percent formaldehyde, no methanol stabilizer). It is designed to inform employees at the production level of their rights and duties under the formaldehyde standard whether thei r job title defines them as workers or supervisors. Much of the information provided is general; however, some information is specific for formalin. When employee exposure to formaldehyde is from resins capable of releasing formaldehyde, the resin itself and other impurities or decomposition products may also be toxic, and employers should include this information as well when informing employees of the hazards associated with the materials they handle. The precise hazards associated with exposure to for maldehyde depend both on the form (solid, liquid, or gas) of the material and the concentration of formaldehyde present. For example, thirty -seven to fifty percent solutions of formaldehyde present a much greater hazard to the skin and eyes from spills or splashes than solutions containing less than one percent formaldehyde. Individual substance technical guidelines used by the employer for training employees should be modified to properly give information on the material actually being used. (a) Substance id entification. Chemical name: Formaldehyde. 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 85 Molecular weight: 30.03. Chemical Formaldehyde. Percent: 63.0 water. Note : Inhibited solutions contain methanol. Other contaminants: Formic acid (alcohol free). Exposure limits: data. Colorless liquid, pungent odor.

Solid streams may not be effective. Cool fire-exposed containers with water from side until well after fire is out. (II) Use of water spray to fl ush spills can also dilute the spill to produce nonflammable mixtures. Water runoff, however, should be contained for treatment. National Fire Protection Association Section 325M Designation: (A) Health: 2 -Materials hazardous to health, but areas may be ente red with full-faced mask self -contained breathing apparatus which provides eye protection. (B) Flammability: 2 -Materials which must be moderately heated before ignition will occur. Water spray may be used to extinguish the fire because the material can be co oled below its flash point. (C) Reactivity: D -Materials which (in themselves) are normally stable even under fire exposure conditions and which are not reactive with water. Normal firefighting procedures may be used. (e) Reactivity. (i) Stability: Formaldehyde solutions may self -polymerize to form paraformaldehyde which precipitates. (ii) Incompatibility (materials to strong reacts with hydroch loric acid to form the potent carcinogen, bis -chloromethyl ether. Formaldehyde reacts with nitrogen dioxide, nitromethane, perchloric acid and aniline, or peroxyformic acid to yield explosive compounds. A violent reaction occurs when formaldehyde is mixe d with strong oxidizers. (C) Hazardous combustion or decomposition products: Oxygen from the air can oxidize formaldehyde to formic acid, especially when heated. Formic acid is corrosive. (f) Health hazard data. (i) Acute effects of exposure. (A) Ingestion (swallowi ng): Liquids containing ten to forty percent formaldehyde cause severe irritation and inflammation of the mouth, throat, and stomach. Severe stomach pains will follow ingestion with possible loss of consciousness and death. Ingestion of dilute formaldeh yde solutions (0.03 -0.04%) may cause discomfort in the stomach and pharynx. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 87 (B) Inhalation (breathing): (I) Formaldehyde is highly irritating to the upper respiratory tract and eyes. Concentrations of 0.5 to 2.0 ppm may irritate the eyes, nose, and throat of so me individuals. (II) Concentrations of 3 to 5 ppm also cause tearing of the eyes and are intolerable to some persons. (III) Concentrations of 10 to 20 ppm cause difficulty in breathing, burning of the nose and throat, coughing, and heavy tearing of the eyes, and 25 t o 30 ppm causes severe respiratory tract injury leading to pulmonary edema and pneumonitis. A concentration of 100 ppm is immediately dangerous to life and health. Deaths from accidental exposure to high concentrations of formaldehyde have been reported. (C) Skin (dermal): Formalin is a severe skin irritant and a sensitizer. Contact with formalin causes white discoloration, smarting, drying, cracking, and scaling. Prolonged and repeated contact can cause numbness and a hardening or tanning of the skin. Pr eviously exposed persons may react to future exposure with an allergic eczematous dermatitis or hives. (D) Eye contact: Formaldehyde solutions splashed in the eye can cause injuries ranging from transient discomfort to severe, permanent corneal clouding and l oss of vision. The severity of the effect depends on the concentration of formaldehyde in the solution and whether or not the eyes are flushed with water immediately after the accident. Note : The perception of formaldehyde by odor and eye irritation becom es less sensitive with time as one adapts to formaldehyde. This can lead to overexposure if a worker is relying on formaldehyde's warning properties to alert him or her to the potential for exposure. (E) Acute animal toxicity: (I) Oral, rats: LD50 = 800 mg/kg. LC50 590 mg/kg. (g) Chronic effects of exposure. (i) Carcinogenicity: Formaldehyde has the potential to cause cancer in humans. Repeated and prolonged exposure increases the risk. Various animal experiments have conclusively shown formaldehyde to be a carcinogen in rats. In humans, formaldehyde exposure has been associated with cancers of the lung, nasopharynx and oropharynx, and na sal passages. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 88 (ii) Mutagenicity: Formaldehyde is genotoxic in several in vitro test systems showing properties of both an initiator and a promoter. (iii) Toxicity: Prolonged or repeated exposure to formaldehyde may result in respiratory impairment. Rats ex posed to formaldehyde at 2 ppm developed benign nasal tumors and changes of the cell structure in the nose as well as inflamed mucous membranes of the nose. Structural changes in the epithelial cells in the human nose have also been observed. Some person s have developed asthma or bronchitis following exposure to formaldehyde, most often as the result of an accidental spill involving a single exposure to a high concentration of formaldehyde. (h) Emergency and first -aid procedures. Ingestion (swallowing): If t he victim is conscious, dilute, inactivate, or absorb the ingested formaldehyde by giving milk, activated charcoal, or water. Any organic material will inactivate formaldehyde. Keep affected person warm and at rest. Get medical attention immediately. I f vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips. Inhalation (breathing): Remove the victim from the exposure area to fresh air immediately. Where the formaldehyde concentration may be very high, each rescuer must put on a self -contained breathing apparatus before attempting to remove the victim, and medical personnel should be informed of the formaldehyde exposure immediately. If breathing has stopped, give artificial respiration. Keep the affected person warm and at rest. Qualified first -aid or medical p ersonnel should administer oxygen, if available, and maintain the patient's airways and blood pressure until the victim can be transported to a medical facility. If exposure results in a highly irritated upper respiratory tract and coughing continues for more than ten minutes, the worker should be hospitalized for observation and treatment. Skin contact: Remove contaminated clothing (including shoes) immediately. Wash the affected area of your body with soap or mild detergent and large amounts of water u ntil no evidence of the chemical remains (at least fifteen to twenty minutes). If there are chemical burns, get first aid to cover the area with sterile, dry dressing, and bandages. Get medical attention if you experience appreciable eye or respiratory i rritation. Eye contact: Wash the eyes immediately with large amounts of water occasionally lifting lower and upper lids, until no evidence of chemical remains (at least fifteen to twenty minutes). In case of burns, apply sterile bandages loosely without medication. Get medical attention immediately. If you have experienced appreciable eye irritation from a splash or excessive exposure, you should be referred promptly to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. (b) Emergency procedures. (i) Emergencies: Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 89 (A) If you w ork in an area where a large amount of formaldehyde could be released in an accident or from equipment failure, your employer must develop procedures to be followed in event of an emergency. You should be trained in your specific duties in the event of an emergency, and it is important that you clearly understand these duties. Emergency equipment must be accessible and you should be trained to use any equipment that you might need. Formaldehyde contaminated equipment must be cleaned before reuse. (B) If a sp ill of appreciable quantity occurs, leave the area quickly unless you have specific emergency duties. Do not touch spilled material. Designated persons may stop the leak and shut off ignition sources if these procedures can be done without risk. Designa ted persons should isolate the hazard area and deny entry except for necessary people protected by suitable protective clothing and respirators adequate for the exposure. Use water spray to reduce vapors. Do not smoke, and prohibit all flames or flares i n the hazard area. (ii) Special firefighting procedures: (A) Learn procedures and responsibilities in the event of a fire in your workplace. (B) Become familiar with the appropriate equipment and supplies and their location. (C) In firefighting, withdraw immediately in cas e of rising sound from venting safety device or any discoloration of storage tank due to fire. (c) Spill, leak, and disposal procedures. Occupational spill: For small containers, place the leaking container in a well - ventilated area. Take up small spills wit h absorbent material and place the waste into properly labeled containers for later disposal. For larger spills, dike the spill to minimize contamination and facilitate salvage or disposal. You may be able to neutralize the spill with sodium hydroxide or sodium sulfite. Your employer must comply with EPA rules regarding the clean -up of toxic waste and notify state and local authorities, if required. If the spill is greater than 1,000 lb/day, it is reportable under EPA's superfund legislation. Waste disp osal: Your employer must dispose of waste containing formaldehyde in accordance with applicable local, state, and federal law and in a manner that minimizes exposure of employees at the site and of the clean -up crew. (d) Monitoring and measurement procedures. Monitoring requirements: If your exposure to formaldehyde exceeds the 0.5 ppm action level or the 2 ppm STEL, your employer must monitor your exposure. Your employer need not measure every exposure if a \"high exposure\" employee can be identified. This person usually spends the greatest Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 90 amount of time nearest the process equipment. If you are a \"representative employee,\" you will be asked to wear a sampling device to collect formaldehyde. This device may be a passive badge, a sorbent tube attached t o a pump, or an impinger containing liquid. You should perform your work as usual, but inform the person who is conducting the monitoring of any difficulties you are having wearing the device. (ii) Evaluation of 8 -hour exposure: Measurements taken for th e purpose of determining time -weighted average (TWA) exposures are best taken with samples covering the full shift. Samples collected must be taken from the employee's breathing zone air. Short -term exposure evaluation: If there are tasks that involve br ief but intense exposure to formaldehyde, employee exposure must be measured to assure compliance with the STEL. Sample collections are for brief periods, only fifteen minutes, but several samples may be needed to identify the peak exposure. Monitoring te chniques: WISHA's only requirement for selecting a method for sampling and analysis is that the methods used accurately evaluate the concentration of formaldehyde in employees' breathing zones. Sampling and analysis may be performed by collection of form aldehyde on liquid or solid sorbents with subsequent chemical analysis. Sampling and analysis may also be performed by passive diffusion monitors and short -term exposure may be measured by instruments such as real -time continuous monitoring systems and portable direct reading instruments. Notification of results: Your employer must inform you of the results of exposure monitoring representative of your job. You may be informed in writing, but posting the results where you have ready access to them consti tutes compliance with the standard. (e) Protective equipment and clothing. (Material impervious to formaldehyde is needed if the employee handles formaldehyde solutions of one percent or more. Other employees may also require protective clothing or equipment to prevent dermatitis.) Respiratory protection. Use NIOSH -approved full facepiece negative pressure respirators equipped with approved cartridges or canisters within the use limitations of these devices. (Present restrictions on cartridges and canisters do not permit them to be used for a full workshift.) In all other situations, use positive pressure respirators such as the positive -pressure air purifying respirator or the self -contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). Protective gloves: (A) Wear protective (im pervious) gloves provided by your employer, at no cost, to prevent contact with formalin. (B) Your employer should select these gloves based on the results of permeation testing and in accordance with the ACGIH guidelines for selection of chemical protective c lothing. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 91 Eye protection: (A) If you might be splashed in the eyes with formalin, it is essential that you wear goggles or some other type of complete protection for the eye. (B) You may also need a face shield if your face is likely to be splashed with formalin, but you must not substitute face shields for eye protection. (This section pertains to formaldehyde solutions of one percent or more.) Other protective equipment: (A) You must wear protective (impervious) clothing and equipment provided by your employer at n o cost to prevent repeated or prolonged contact with formaldehyde liquids. (B) If you are required to change into whole -body chemical protective clothing, your employer must provide a change room for your privacy and for storage of your normal clothing. (C) If you are splashed with formaldehyde, use the emergency showers and eyewash fountains provided by your employer immediately to prevent serious injury. Report the incident to your supervisor and obtain necessary medical support. (2) Entry into an IDLH atmosphere . Enter areas where the formaldehyde concentration might be 100 ppm or more only with complete body protection including a self -contained breathing apparatus with a full facepiece operated in a positive pressure mode or a supplied -air respirator with full fa cepiece and operated in a positive pressure mode. This equipment is essential to protect your life and health under such extreme conditions. (a) Engineering controls. Ventilation is the most widely applied engineering control method for reducing the concentra tion of airborne substances in the breathing zones of workers. There are two distinct types of ventilation. (ii) Local exhaust: Local exhaust ventilation is designed to capture airborne contaminants as near to the point of generation as possible. To pro tect you, the direction of contaminant flow must always be toward the local exhaust system inlet and away from you. (iii) General (mechanical): (A) General dilution ventilation involves continuous introduction of fresh air into the workroom to mix with the con taminated air and lower your breathing zone concentration of formaldehyde. Effectiveness depends on the number of air changes per hour. (B) Where devices emitting formaldehyde are spread out over a large area, general dilution ventilation may be the only prac tical method of control. (iv) Work practices: Work practices and administrative procedures are an important part of a control system. If you are asked to perform a task in a certain manner to limit your exposure to formaldehyde, it is extremely important that you follow these procedures. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 92 (b) Medical surveillance. Medical surveillance helps to protect employees' health. You are encouraged strongly to participate in the medical surveillance program. Your employer must make a medical surveillance program avai lable at no expense to you and at a reasonable time and place if you are exposed to formaldehyde at concentrations above 0.5 ppm as an 8 -hour average or 2 ppm over any fifteen -minute period. (A) You will be offered medical surveillance at the time of your init ial assignment and once a year afterward as long as your exposure is at least 0.5 ppm (action level) or 2 ppm (STEL). (B) Even if your exposure is below these levels, you should inform your employer if you have signs and symptoms that you suspect, through your training, are related to your formaldehyde exposure because you may need medical surveillance to determine if your health is being impaired by your exposure. The surveillance plan includes: (A) A medical disease questionnaire. (B) A physical examination if the ph ysician determines this is necessary. If you are required to wear a respirator, your employer must offer you a physical examination and a pulmonary function test every year. The physician must collect all information needed to determine if you are at incre ased risk from your exposure to formaldehyde. At the physician's discretion, the medical examination may include other tests, such as a chest x - ray, to make this determination. After a medical examination the physician will provide your employer with a written opinion which includes any special protective measures recommended and any restrictions on your exposure. The physician must inform you of any medical conditions you have which would be aggravated by exposure to formaldehyde. All records from your medical examinations, including disease surveys, must be retained at your employer's expense. (c) Emergencies. If you are exposed to formaldehyde in an emergency and develop signs or symptoms associated with acute toxicity from formaldehyde exposure, your empl oyer must provide you with a medical examination as soon as possible. This medical examination will include all steps necessary to stabilize your health. You may be kept in the hospital for observation if your symptoms are severe to ensure that any delayed effects are recognized and treated. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 93 WAC 296 -62-07544 Appendix B --Sampling strategy and analytical methods for formaldehyde. (1) To protect the health of employees, exposure measurements must be unbiased and representative of employee exposure. The proper measurement of employee exposure requires more than a token commitment on the part of the employer. WISHA's mandatory requirements establish a baseline; under the best of circumstances all questions regarding employee exposure will be answered. Many empl oyers, however, will wish to conduct more extensive monitoring before undertaking expensive commitments, such as engineering controls to ensure that the modifications are truly necessary. The following sampling strategy, which was developed at NIOSH by Ne lson A. Leidel, Kenneth A. Busch, and Jeremiah R. Lynch and described in NIOSH publication No. 77 -173 (Occupational Exposure Sampling Strategy Manual) will assist the employer in developing a strategy for determining the exposure of their employees. (2) There is no one correct way to determine employee exposure. Obviously, measuring the exposure of every employee exposed to formaldehyde will provide the most information on any given day. Where few employees are exposed, this may be a practical solution. For most employers, however, use of the following strategy will give just as much information at less cost. (3) Exposure data collected on a single day will not automatically guarantee the employer that their workplace is always in compliance with the formaldehyde standard. This does not imply, however, that it is impossible for an employer to be sure that their worksite is in compliance with the standard. Indeed, a properly designed sampling strategy showing that all employees are exposed below the PELs, at leas t with a ninety -five percent certainty, is compelling evidence that the exposure limits are being achieved provided that measurements are conducted using valid sampling strategy and approved analytical methods. (4) There are two PELs, the TWA concentration and the STEL . (a) Most employers will find that one of these two limits is more critical in the control of their operations, and WISHA expects that the employer will concentrate monitoring efforts on the critical component. (b) If the more difficult exposure is contr olled, this information, along with calculations to support the assumptions, should be adequate to show that the other exposure limit is also being achieved. (5) Sampling strategy . (a) Determination of the need for exposure measurements. (b) The employer must determin e whether employees may be exposed to concentrations in excess of the action level. This determination becomes the first step in an employee exposure monitoring program that minimizes employer sampling burdens while providing adequate employee protection. (c) If employees may be exposed above the action level, the employer must measure exposure. Otherwise, an objective determination that employee exposure is low provides adequate evidence that exposure potential has been examined. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 94 (d) The employer should examin e all available relevant information, e.g., insurance company and trade association data and information from suppliers or exposure data collected from similar operations. (e) The employer may also use previously -conducted sampling including area monitoring. The employer must make a determination relevant to each operation although this need not be on a separate piece of paper. (f) If the employer can demonstrate conclusively that no employee is exposed above the action level or the STEL through the use of objecti ve data, the employer need proceed no further on employee exposure monitoring until such time that conditions have changed and the determination is no longer valid. (g) If the employer cannot determine that employee exposure is less than the action level and t he STEL, employee exposure monitoring will have to be conducted. (6) Workplace material survey . (a) The primary purpose of a survey of raw material is to determine if formaldehyde is being used in the work environment and if so, the conditions under which formalde hyde is being used. (b) The first step is to tabulate all situations where formaldehyde is used in a manner such that it may be released into the workplace atmosphere or contaminate the skin. This information should be available through analysis of company re cords and information on the SDS available through provisions of this standard and the hazard communication standard. (c) If there is an indication from materials handling records and accompanying SDS that formaldehyde is being used in the following types of p rocesses or work operations, there may be a potential for releasing formaldehyde into the workplace atmosphere: Any operation that involves grinding, sanding, sawing, cutting, crushing, screening, sieving, or any other manipulation of material that generat es formaldehyde -bearing dust. Any processes where there have been employee complaints or symptoms indicative of exposure to formaldehyde. Any liquid or spray process involving formaldehyde. Any process that uses formaldehyde in preserved tissue. Any proces s that involves the heating of a formaldehyde -bearing resin. Processes and work operations that use formaldehyde in these manners will probably require further investigation at the worksite to determine the extent of employee monitoring that should be cond ucted. (7) Workplace observations . (a) To this point, the only intention has been to provide an indication as to the existence of potentially exposed employees. With this information, a visit to the workplace is needed to observe work operations, to identify pote ntial health hazards, and to determine whether any employees may be exposed to hazardous concentrations of formaldehyde. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 95 (b) In many circumstances, sources of formaldehyde can be identified through the sense of smell. However, this method of detection should be used with caution because of olfactory fatigue. (c) Employee location in relation to source of formaldehyde is important in determining if an employee may be significantly exposed to formaldehyde. In most instances, the closer a worker is to the source, th e higher the probability that a significant exposure will occur. (d) Other characteristics should be considered. Certain high temperature operations give rise to higher evaporation rates. Locations of open doors and windows provide natural ventilation that t end to dilute formaldehyde emissions. General room ventilation also provides a measure of control. (8) Calculation of potential exposure concentrations . (a) By knowing the ventilation rate in a workplace and the quantity of formaldehyde generated, the employer ma y be able to determine by calculation if the PELs might be exceeded. (b) To account for poor mixing of formaldehyde into the entire room, locations of fans and proximity of employees to the work operation, the employer must include a safety factor. (c) If an emplo yee is relatively close to a source, particularly if they are located downwind, a safety factor of one hundred may be necessary. (d) For other situations, a factor of ten may be acceptable. If the employer can demonstrate through such calculations that employ ee exposure does not exceed the action level or the STEL, the employer may use this information as objective data to demonstrate compliance with the standard. (9) Sampling strategy . (a) Once the employer determines that there is a possibility of substantial employ ee exposure to formaldehyde, the employer is obligated to measure employee exposure. (b) The next step is selection of a maximum risk employee. When there are different processes where employees may be exposed to formaldehyde, a maximum risk employee should b e selected for each work operation. (c) Selection of the maximum risk employee requires professional judgment. The best procedure for selecting the maximum risk employee is to observe employees and select the person closest to the source of formaldehyde. Emp loyee mobility may affect this selection; e.g., if the closest employee is mobile in their tasks, they may not be the maximum risk employee. Air movement patterns and differences in work habits will also affect selection of the maximum risk employee. (d) When many employees perform essentially the same task, a maximum risk employee cannot be selected. In this circumstance, it is necessary to resort to random sampling of the group of workers. The objective is to select a subgroup of adequate size so that there is a high probability that the random sample will contain at least one worker with high exposure of one exists. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 96 The number of persons in the group influences the number that need to be sampled to ensure that at least one individual from the highest ten percent exposure group is contained in the sample. For example, to have ninety percent confidence in the results, if the group size is ten, nine should be sampled; for fifty, only eighteen need to be sampled. (e) If measurement shows exposure to formaldehyde at or above the action level or the STEL, the employer needs to identify all other employees who may be exposed at or above the action level or STEL and measure or otherwise accurately characterize the exposure of these employees. (f) Whether representative m onitoring or random sampling are conducted, the purpose remains the same to determine if the exposure of any employee is above the action level. If the exposure of the most exposed employee is less than the action level and the STEL, regardless of how the employee is identified, then it is reasonable to assume that measurements of exposure of the other employees in that operation would be below the action level and the STEL. (10) Exposure measurements . (a) There is no \"best\" measurement strategy for all situations. Some elements to consider in developing a strategy are: Availability and cost of sampling equipment; Availability and cost of analytic facilities; Availability and cost of personnel to take samples; Location of employees and work operations; Intraday and interday variations in the process; Precision and accuracy of sampling and analytic methods; and Number of samples needed. (b) Samples taken for determining compliance with the STEL differ from those that measure the TWA concentration in important ways. STEL samples are best taken in a nonrandom fashion using all available knowledge relating to the area, the individual, and the process to obtain samples during periods of maximum expected concentrations. At least three measurements on a shift are generally ne eded to spot gross errors or mistakes; however, only the highest value represents the STEL. (c) If an operation remains constant throughout the workshift, a much greater number of samples would need to be taken over the thirty -two discrete nonoverlapping perio ds in an 8 -hour workshift to verify compliance with a STEL. If employee exposure is truly uniform throughout the workshift, however, an employer in compliance with the 1 ppm TWA would be in compliance with the 2 ppm STEL, and this determination can probab ly be made using objective data. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 97 (11) Need to repeat the monitoring strategy . (a) Interday and intraday fluctuations in employee exposure are mostly influenced by the physical processes that generate formaldehyde and the work habits of the employee. Hence, in -plant process variations influence the employer's determination of whether or not additional controls need to be imposed. Measurements that employee exposure is low on a day that is not representative of worst conditions may not provide sufficient informati on to determine whether or not additional engineering controls should be installed to achieve the PELs. (b) The person responsible for conducting sampling must be aware of systematic changes which will negate the validity of the sampling results. Systematic c hanges in formaldehyde exposure concentration for an employee can occur due to: The employee changing patterns of movement in the workplace; Closing of plant doors and windows; Changes in ventilation from season to season; Decreases in ventilation efficien cy or abrupt failure of engineering control equipment; and Changes in the production process or work habits of the employee. (c) Any of these changes, if they may result in additional exposure that reaches the next level of action (i.e., 0.5 or 1.0 ppm as an 8 -hour average or 2 ppm over fifteen minutes) require the employer to perform additional monitoring to reassess employee exposure. (d) A number of methods are suitable for measuring employee exposure to formaldehyde or for characterizing emissions within the wo rksite. The preamble to this standard describes some methods that have been widely used or subjected to validation testing. A detailed analytical procedure derived from the WISHA Method A.C.R.O. for acrolein and formaldehyde is presented below for inform ational purposes. (e) Inclusion of WISHA's method in this appendix in no way implies that it is the only acceptable way to measure employee exposure to formaldehyde. Other methods that are free from significant interferences and that can determine formaldehyd e at the permissible exposure limits within .\u00b125 percent of the \"true\" value at the ninety -five percent confidence level are also acceptable. Where applicable, the method should also be capable of measuring formaldehyde at the action level to \u00b135 percent of the \"true\" value with a ninety -five percent confidence level. WISHA encourages employers to choose methods that will be best for their individual needs. The employer must exercise caution, however, in choosing an appropriate method since some techniqu es suffer from interferences that are likely to be present in workplaces of certain industry sectors where formaldehyde is used. (12) WISHA's analytical laboratory method . A.C.R.O. (also use methods F.O.R.M. and F.O.R.M. 2 when applicable). (a) Matrix: Air. (b) concentration: 1 ppm (1.2 mg/m3). Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 98 (c) Procedures: Air samples are collected by drawing known volumes of air through sampling tubes containing XAD -2 adsorbent which have been coated with 2 - (hydroxymethyl) piperidine. The samples are desorbed with tolu ene and then analyzed by gas chromatography using a nitrogen selective detector. (d) Recommended sampling rate and air volumes: 0.1 L/min and 24 L. (e) Reliable quantitation limit: 16 ppb (20 \u00b5g/m3). (f) Standard error of estimate at the target concentration: 7.3%. (g) Status of the method: A sampling and analytical method that has been subjected to the established evaluation procedures of the organic methods evaluation branch. (h) Date: March, 1985. (13) General discussion . (a) Background: The current WISHA method for collecting acrolein vapor recommends the use of activated 13X molecular sieves. The samples must be stored in an ice bath during and after sampling and also they must be analyzed within forty -eight hours of collection. The current WISHA method for collecting forma ldehyde vapor recommends the use of bubblers containing ten percent methanol in water as the trapping solution. (b) This work was undertaken to resolve the sample stability problems associated with acrolein and also to eliminate the need to use bubblers to sam ple formaldehyde. A goal of this work was to develop and/or to evaluate a common sampling and analytical procedure for acrolein and formaldehyde. (c) NIOSH has developed independent methodologies for acrolein and formaldehyde which recommend the use of reagen t-coated adsorbent tubes to collect the aldehydes as stable derivatives. The formaldehyde sampling tubes contain Chromosorb 102 adsorbent coated with N -benzylethanolamine (BEA) which reacts with formaldehyde vapor to form a stable oxazolidine compound. T he acrolein sampling tubes contain XAD -2 adsorbent coated with 2 -(hydroxymethyl) piperidine (2 -HMP) which reacts with acrolein vapor to form a different, stable oxazolidine derivative. Acrolein does not appear to react with BEA to give a suitable reaction product. Therefore, the formaldehyde procedure cannot provide a common method for both aldehydes. However, formaldehyde does react with 2 -HMP to form a very suitable reaction product. It is the quantitative reaction of acrolein and formaldehyde with 2 -HMP that provides the basis for this evaluation. (d) This sampling and analytical procedure is very similar to the method recommended by NIOSH for acrolein. Some changes in the NIOSH methodology were necessary to permit the simultaneous determination of both aldehydes and also to accommodate WISHA laboratory equipment and analytical techniques. (14) Limit -defining parameters : The analyte air concentrations reported in this method are based on the recommended air volume for each analyte collected separately and a desorption volume of 1 mL. The amounts are presented as acrolein and/or formaldehyde, even though the derivatives are the actual species analyzed. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 99 (15) Detection limits of the analytical procedure : The detection limit of the analytical procedure was 386 pg p er injection for formaldehyde. This was the amount of analyte which gave a peak whose height was about five times the height of the peak given by the residual formaldehyde derivative in a typical blank front section of the recommended sampling tube. (16) Detec tion limits of the overall procedure : The detection limits of the overall procedure were 482 ng per sample (16 ppb or 20 \u00b5g/m3 for formaldehyde). This was the amount of analyte spiked on the sampling device which allowed recoveries approximately equal to the detection limit of the analytical procedure. (17) Reliable quantitation limits : (a) The reliable quantitation limit was 482 ng per sample (16 ppb or 20 \u00b5g/m3) for formaldehyde. These were the smallest amounts of analyte which could be quantitated within the l imits of a recovery of at least seventy -five percent and a precision (\u00b11.96 SD) of \u00b125% or better. (b) The reliable quantitation limit and detection limits reported in the method are based upon optimization of the instrument for the smallest possible amount of analyte. When the target concentration of an analyte is exceptionally higher than these limits, they may not be attainable at the routine operating parameters. (18) Sensitivity : The sensitivity of the analytical procedure over concentration ranges representi ng 0.4 to 2 times the target concentration, based on the recommended air volumes, was seven thousand five hundred eighty -nine area units per g/mL for formaldehyde. This value was determined from the slope of the calibration curve. The sensitivity may va ry with the particular instrument used in the analysis. (19) Recovery : The recovery of formaldehyde from samples used in an eighteen -day storage test remained above ninety -two percent when the samples were stored at ambient temperature. These values were dete rmined from regression lines which were calculated from the storage data. The recovery of the analyte from the collection device must be at least seventy -five percent following storage. (20) Precision (analytical method only) : The pooled coefficient of variat ion obtained from replicate determinations of analytical standards over the range of 0.4 to 2 times the target concentration was 0.0052 for formaldehyde ((d)(C)(iii) of this subsection). (21) Precision (overall procedure) : The precision at the ninety -five perc ent confidence level for the ambient temperature storage tests was \u00b114.3% for formaldehyde. These values each include an additional \u00b15% for sampling error. The overall procedure must provide results at the target concentrations that are \u00b125% at the ninet y-five percent confidence level. (22) Reproducibility : Samples collected from controlled test atmospheres and a draft copy of this procedure were given to a chemist unassociated with this evaluation. The formaldehyde samples were analyzed following fifteen da ys storage. The average recovery was 96.3% and the standard deviation was 1.7%. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 100 (23) Advantages : (a) The sampling and analytical procedures permit the simultaneous determination of acrolein and formaldehyde. (b) Samples are stable following storage at ambient temper ature for at least eighteen days. (24) Disadvantages : None. (25) Sampling procedure . (a) Apparatus: Samples are collected by use of a personal sampling pump that can be calibrated to within \u00b15% of the recommended 0.1 L/min sampling rate with the sampling tube in line. Samples are collected with laboratory prepared sampling tubes. The sampling tube is constructed of silane treated glass and is about 8 -cm long. The ID is 4 mm and the OD is 6 mm. One end of the tube is tapered so that a glass wool end plug will hold the contents of the tube in place during sampling. The other end of the sampling tube is open to its full 4 -mm ID to facilitate packing of the tube. Both ends of the tube are fire -polished for safety. The tube is packed with a 75 -mg backup section, located nearest the tapered end and a 150 -mg sampling section of pretreated XAD -2 adsorbent which has been coated with 2 - HMP. The two sections of coated adsorbent are separated and retained with small plugs of silanized glass wool. Following packing, the sampli ng tubes are sealed with two 7/32 inch OD plastic and caps. Instructions for the pretreatment and the coating of XAD -2 adsorbent are presented in (d) of this subsection. (b) Sampling tubes, similar to those recommended in this method, are marketed by Supelco, Inc. These tubes were not available when this work was initiated; therefore, they were not evaluated. (26) Reagents : None required. (27) Technique : (a) Properly label the sampling tube before sampling and then remove the plastic end caps. (b) Attach the sampling tube to the pump using a section of flexible plastic tubing such that the large, front section of the sampling tube is exposed directly to the atmosphere. Do not place any tubing ahead of the sampling tube. The sampling tube should be attached in the worker's br eathing zone in a vertical manner such that it does not impede work performance. (c) After sampling for the appropriate time, remove the sampling tube from the pump and then seal the tube with plastic end caps. (d) Include at least one blank for each sampling set. The blank should be handled in the same manner as the samples with the exception that air is not drawn through it. (e) List any potential interferences on the sample data sheet. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 101 (28) Breakthrough : (a) Breakthrough was defined as the relative amount of analyte found on a backup sample in relation to the total amount of analyte collected on the sampling train. (b) For formaldehyde collected from test atmospheres containing six times the PEL, the average five percent breakthrough air volume was 41 L. The sampling rate was 0.1 L/min and the average mass of formaldehyde collected was 250 g. (29) Desorption efficiency : No desorption efficiency corrections are necessary to compute air sample results because analytical standards are prepared using coated adsorbent. Desorption eff iciencies were determined, however, to investigate the recoveries of the analytes from the sampling device. The average recovery over the range of 0.4 to 2 times the target concentration, based on the recommended air volumes, was 96.2% for formaldehyde. Desorption efficiencies were essentially constant over the ranges studied. (30) Recommended air volume and sampling rate : (a) The recommended air volume for formaldehyde is 24 L. (b) The recommended sampling rate is 0.1 L/min. (31) Interferences : (a) Any collected substance tha t is capable of reacting with 2 -HMP and thereby depleting the derivatizing agent is a potential interference. Chemicals which contain a carbonyl group, such as acetone, may be capable of reacting with 2 -HMP. (b) There are no other known interferences to the s ampling method. (32) Safety precautions : (a) Attach the sampling equipment to the worker in such a manner that it will not interfere with work performance or safety. (b) Follow all safety practices that apply to the work area being sampled. (33) Analytical procedure . (a) Appara tus: A gas chromatograph (GC), equipped with a nitrogen selective detector. A Hewlett -Packard model 5840A GC fitted with a nitrogen phosphorus flame ionization detector (NPD) was used for this evaluation. Injections were performed using a Hewlett -Packard model 7671A automatic sampler. A GC column capable of resolving the analytes from any interference. A 6 ft x 1/4 in OD (2mm ID) glass GC column 80/100 mesh Chromosorb W -AW was used for the evaluation. Injection s were performed on -column. Vials, glass 2 -mL with Teflon -lined caps. pipets, and syringes for preparing dilutions, and performing injections. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 102 (b) Reagents: Toluene and dimethylformamide. Burdick and Jackson solvents wer e used in this evaluation. Helium, hydrogen, and air, GC grade. Formaldehyde, thirty -seven percent by weight, in water. Aldrich Chemical, ACS Reagent Grade formaldehyde was used in this evaluation. Amberlite XAD -2 adsorbent coated with 2 -(hydroxymethyl) p iperidine (2 - HMP), 10% by weight ((d) of this subsection). Desorbing solution with internal standard. This solution was prepared by adding 20 \u00b5L of dimethylformamide to 100 mL of toluene. (c) Standard preparation: Formaldehyde: Prepare stock standards by dil uting known volumes of thirty - seven percent formaldehyde solution with methanol. A procedure to determine the formaldehyde content of these standards is presented in (d) of this subsection. A standard containing 7.7 mg/mL formaldehyde was prepared by diluting 1 mL of the thirty -seven percent reagent to 50 mL with methanol. It is recommended that analytical standards be prepared about sixteen hours before the air samples are to be analyzed in order to ensure the complete reaction of the analytes with 2 -HMP . However, rate studies have shown the reaction to be greater than ninety -five percent complete after four hours. Therefore, one or two standards can be analyzed after this reduced time if sample results are outside the concentration range of the prepare d standards. Place 150 -mg portions of coated XAD -2 adsorbent, from the same lot number as used to collect the air samples, into each of several glass 2 -mL vials. Seal each vial with a Teflon -lined cap. Prepare fresh analytical standards each day by inject ing appropriate amounts of the diluted analyte directly onto 150 -mg portions of coated adsorbent. It is permissible to inject both acrolein and formaldehyde on the same adsorbent portion. Allow the standards to stand at room temperature. A standard, approximately the target levels, was prepared by injecting 11 \u00b5L of the acrolein and 12 \u00b5L of the formaldehyde stock standards onto a single coated XAD -2 adsorbent portion. Prepare a sufficient number of standards to generate the calibration curves. Analytic al standard concentrations should bracket sample concentrations. Thus, if samples are not in the concentration range of the prepared standards, additional standards must be prepared to determine detector response. Desorb the standards in the same manner a s the samples following the sixteen - hour reaction time. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 103 (d) Sample preparation: Transfer the 150 -mg section of the sampling tube to a 2 -mL vial. Place the 75 - mg section in a separate vial. If the glass wool plugs contain a significant number of adsorbent b eads, place them with the appropriate sampling tube section. Discard the glass wool plugs if they do not contain a significant number of adsorbent beads. Add 1 mL of desorbing solution to each vial. Seal the vials with Teflon -lined caps and then allow the m to desorb for one hour. Shake the vials by hand with vigorous force several times during the desorption time. Save the used sampling tubes to be cleaned and recycled. (e) Analysis: (f) GC conditions. (34) Column temperature : (a) Bi-level temperature program. First level : 100C to 140C at 4 C/min following completion of the first level. Second level: 140 C to 180C at 20C/min following completion of the first level. (b) Isothermal period: Hold column at 180 C until the recorder pen returns to baseline (usually about twent y-five minutes after injection). (c) Injector temperature: 180 C. (d) Helium flow rate: 30 mL/min (detector response will be reduced if nitrogen is substituted for helium carrier gas). (e) Injection volume: 51 0.8 \u00b5L. (f) GC column: Six -ft x 1/4 -in rate: mL/min. Air flow rate: 50 mL/min. (h) Detector temperature: 275 5151C. Use a suitable method, such as electronic integration, to measure detector response. Use an internal standard method to prepare the calibration curve with several standard solutions of different concentrations. Prepare the calibration curve daily. Program the integrator to report results in g/mL. Bracket sample concen trations with standards. Interferences (analytical). Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 104 (A) Any compound with the same general retention time as the analytes and which also gives a detector response is a potential interference. Possible interferences should be reported to the laboratory with submitted samples by the industrial hygienist. (B) GC parameters (temperature, column, etc.), may be changed to circumvent interferences. (C) A useful means of structure designation is GC/MS. It is recommended this procedure be used to confirm samples whenever p ossible. (D) The coated adsorbent usually contains a very small amount of residual formaldehyde derivative. (i) Calculations: Results are obtained by use of calibration curves. Calibration curves are prepared by plotting detector response against concentration fo r each standard. The best line through the data points is determined by curve fitting. The concentration, in g/mL, for a particular sample is determined by comparing its detector response to the calibration curve. If either of the analytes is found on t he backup section, it is added to the amount found on the front section. Blank corrections should be performed before adding the results together. The acrolein and/or formaldehyde air concentration can be expressed using the following equation: Mg/m3=(A)( B)/C. where A = \u00b5g/mL from 3.7.2, B = desorption volume, and C = L of air sampled. No desorption efficiency corrections are required. The following equation can be used to convert results in mg/m51351 to ppm. ppm = (mg/m3)(24.45)/MW where mg/m3 = result fr om 3.7.3, 24.45 = molar volume of an ideal gas at 760 mm Hg and 25 5151C, MW = molecular weight (Formaldehyde = 30.0). (j) Backup data. Backup data on detection limits, reliable quantitation limits, sensitivity and precision of the analytical method, breakthr ough, desorption efficiency, storage, reproducibility, and generation of test atmospheres are available in OSHA Method 52, developed by the Organics Methods Evaluation Branch, OSHA Analytical Laboratory, Salt Lake City, Utah. (k) Procedure to coat XAD -2 adsorb ent with 2 -HMP: Apparatus: Soxhlet extraction apparatus, rotary evaporation apparatus, vacuum coarse disc, etc. Reagents: Methan ol, isooctane, and toluene. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 105 (B) (Hydroxymethyl) piperidine. (C) Amberlite XAD -2 nonionic polymeric adsorbent, twenty to sixty mesh, Aldrich Chemical XAD -2 was used in this evaluation. (l) Procedure: Weigh 125 g of crude XAD -2 adsorbent into a 1 -L Erlenmeyer fla sk. Add about 200 mL of water to the flask and then swirl the mixture to wash the adsorbent. Discard any adsorbent that floats to the top of the water and then filter the mixture using a fritted Buchner funnel. Air dry the adsorbent for two minutes. Transfer the adsorbent back to the Erlenmeyer flask and then add about 200 mL of methanol to the flask. Swirl and then filter the mixture as before. Transfer the washed adsorbent back to the Erlenmeyer flask and then add about 200 mL of methanol to the fla sk. Swirl and then filter the mixture as before. Transfer the washed adsorbent to a 1 -L round -bottomed evaporative flask, add 13 g of 2 -HMP and then 200 mL of methanol, swirl the mixture and then allow it to stand for one hour. Remove the methanol at ab out 40oC and reduced pressure using a rotary evaporation apparatus. Transfer the coated adsorbent to a suitable container and store it in a vacuum desiccator at room temperature overnight. Transfer the coated adsorbent to a Soxhlet extractor and then ext ract the material with toluene for about twenty -four hours. Discard the contaminated toluene, add methanol in its place and then continue the Soxhlet extraction for an additional four hours. Transfer the adsorbent to a weighted 1 -L round -bottom evaporati ve flask and remove the methanol using the rotary evaporation apparatus. Determine the weight of the adsorbent and then add an amount of 2 -HMP, which is ten percent by weight of the adsorbent. Add 200 mL of methanol and then swirl the mixture. Allow the mixture to stand for one hour. Remove the methanol by rotary evaporation. Transfer the coated adsorbent to a suitable container and store it in a vacuum dessicator until all traces of solvents are gone. Typically, this will take two to three days. The coated adsorbent should be protected from contamination. XAD -2 adsorbent treated in this manner will probably not contain residual acrolein derivative. However, this adsorbent will often contain residual formaldehyde derivative levels of about 0.1 g per 150 mg of adsorbent. If the blank values for a batch of coated adsorbent are too high, then the batch should be returned to the Soxhlet extractor, extracted with toluene again and then recoated. This process can be repeated until the desired blank level s are attained. The coated adsorbent is now ready to be packed into sampling tubes. The sampling tubes should be stored in a sealed container to prevent contamination. Sampling tubes should be stored in the dark at room temperature. The sampling tubes should be segregated by coated adsorbent lot number. A sufficient amount of each lot number of coated adsorbent should be retained to prepare analytical standards for use with air samples from that lot number. (m) A procedure to determine formaldehyde by acid titration: (i) Standardize the 0.1 N HC1 solution using sodium carbonate and methyl orange indicator. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 106 (ii) Place 50 mL of 0.1 M sodium sulfite and three drops of thymophthalein indicator into a 250 -mL Erlenmeyer flask. Titrate the contents of the flask to a colorless endpoint with 0.1 N HC1 (usually one or two drops is sufficient). Transfer 10 mL of the formaldehyde/methanol solution ((b)(iii)(A) of this subsection) into the same flask and titrate the mixture with 0.1 N HC1, again, to a colorless endpo int. The formaldehyde concentration of the standard may be calculated by the following equation: acid titer x acid normality x 30.0 Formaldehyde, mg/mL = _____________________________________________ mL of Sample This method is based on the quantitative l iberation of sodium hydroxide when formaldehyde reacts with sodium sulfite to form the formaldehyde -bisulfite addition product. The volume of sample may be varied depending on the formaldehyde content but the solution to be titrated must contain excess so dium sulfite. Formaldehyde solutions containing substantial amounts of acid or base must be neutralized before analysis. WAC 296 -62-07546 Appendix C medical surveillance --Formaldehyde. (1) Health hazards . The occupational health hazards of formaldehyde are primarily due to its toxic effects after inhalation, after direct contact with the skin or eyes by formaldehyde in liquid or vapor form, and after ingestion. (2) Toxicology . (a) Acute effects of exposure. Inhalation (breathing): Formaldehyde is highly irritating to the upper airways. The concentration of formaldehyde that is immediately dangerous to life and health is 100 ppm. Concentrations above 50 ppm can cause severe pulmonary reactions within minutes. These include pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and bronchial irritation which can result in death. Concentrations above 5 ppm readily cause lower airway irritation characterized by cough, chest tightness, and wheezing. There is some controversy regarding whether formaldehyde gas is a pulmonary sensitizer which ca n cause occupational asthma in a previously normal individual. Formaldehyde can produce symptoms of bronchial asthma in humans. The mechanism may be either sensitization of the individual by exposure to formaldehyde or direct irritation by formaldehyde i n persons with preexisting asthma. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 107 Upper airway irritation is the most common respiratory effect reported by workers and can occur over a wide range of concentrations, most frequently above 1 ppm. However, airway irritation has occurred in some workers with exposures to formaldehyde as low as 0.1 ppm. Symptoms of upper airway irritation include dry or sore throat, itching and burning sensations of the nose, and nasal congestion. Tolerance to this level of exposure may develop within one to two hours. This tolerance can permit workers remaining in an environment of gradually increasing formaldehyde concentrations to be unaware of their increasingly hazardous exposure. Eye contact: Concentrations of formaldehyde between 0.05 ppm and 0.5 ppm produce a se nsation of irritation in the eyes with burning, itching, redness, and tearing. Increased rate of blinking and eye closure generally protects the eye from damage at these low levels, but these protective mechanisms may interfere with some workers' work abi lities. Tolerance can occur in workers continuously exposed to concentrations of formaldehyde in this range. Accidental splash injuries of human eyes to aqueous solutions of formaldehyde (formalin) have resulted in a wide range of ocular injuries includi ng corneal opacities and blindness. The severity of the reactions have been directly dependent on the concentration of formaldehyde in solution and the amount of time lapsed before emergency and medical intervention. Skin contact: Exposure to formaldehyd e solutions can cause irritation of the skin and allergic contact dermatitis. These skin diseases and disorders can occur at levels well below those encountered by many formaldehyde workers. Symptoms include erythema, edema, and vesiculation or hives. E xposure to liquid formalin or formaldehyde vapor can provoke skin reactions in sensitized individuals even when airborne concentrations of formaldehyde are well below 1 ppm. Ingestion: Ingestion of as little as 30 ml of a thirty -seven percent solution of formaldehyde (formalin) can result in death. Gastrointestinal toxicity after ingestion is most severe in the stomach and results in symptoms which can include nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain. Diverse damage to other organ systems including th e liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, brain, and central nervous systems can occur from the acute response to ingestion of formaldehyde. (b) Chronic effects of exposure. Long -term exposure to formaldehyde has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cancer of the nose and accessory sinuses, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal cancer, and lung cancer in humans. Animal experiments provide conclusive evidence of a causal relationship between nasal cancer in rats and formaldehyde exposure. Concordant evid ence of carcinogenicity includes DNA binding, genotoxicity in short -term tests, and cytotoxic changes in the cells of the target organ suggesting both preneoplastic changes and a dose -rate effect. Formaldehyde is a complete carcinogen and appears to exert an effect on at least two stages of the carcinogenic process. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 108 (3) Surveillance considerations . (a) History. Medical and occupational history: Along with its acute irritative effects, formaldehyde can cause allergic sensitization and cancer. One of the goals o f the work history should be to elicit information on any prior or additional exposure to formaldehyde in either the occupational or the nonoccupational setting. Respiratory history: As noted above, formaldehyde has recognized properties as an airway irri tant and has been reported by some authors as a cause of occupational asthma. In addition, formaldehyde has been associated with cancer of the entire respiratory system of humans. For these reasons, it is appropriate to include a comprehensive review of the respiratory system in the medical history. Components of this history might include questions regarding dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, chronic airway complaints, hyperreactive airway disease, rhinitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, asthma, emphysema, respiratory allergic reaction, or other preexisting pulmonary disease. In addition, generalized airway hypersensitivity can result from exposures to a single sensitizing agent. The examiner should, therefore, elicit any prior history of exposure t o pulmonary irritants, and any short -term or long -term effects of that exposure. Smoking is known to decrease mucociliary clearance of materials deposited during respiration in the nose and upper airways. This may increase a worker's exposure to inhaled m aterials such as formaldehyde vapor. In addition, smoking is a potential confounding factor in the investigation of any chronic respiratory disease, including cancer. For these reasons, a complete smoking history should be obtained. Skin disorders: Beca use of the dermal irritant and sensitizing effects of formaldehyde, a history of skin disorders should be obtained. Such a history might include the existence of skin irritation, previously documented skin sensitivity, and other dermatologic disorders. P revious exposure to formaldehyde and other dermal sensitizers should be recorded. History of atopic or allergic diseases: Since formaldehyde can cause allergic sensitization of the skin and airways, it might be useful to identify individuals with prior al lergen sensitization. A history of atopic disease and allergies to formaldehyde or any other substances should also be obtained. It is not definitely known at this time whether atopic diseases and allergies to formaldehyde or any other substances should also be obtained. Also it is not definitely known at this time whether atopic individuals have a greater propensity to develop formaldehyde sensitivity than the general population, but identification of these individuals may be useful for ongoing surveill ance. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 109 Use of disease questionnaires: Comparison of the results from previous years with present results provides the best method for detecting a general deterioration in health when toxic signs and symptoms are measured subjectively. In this way recall bias does not affect the results of the analysis. Consequently, WISHA has determined that the findings of the medical and work histories should be kept in a standardized form for comparison of the year-to-year results. (b) Physical examination. Mucosa of eye s and airways: Because of the irritant effects of formaldehyde, the examining physician should be alert to evidence of this irritation. A speculum examination of the nasal mucosa may be helpful in assessing possible irritation and cytotoxic changes, as m ay be indirect inspection of the posterior pharynx by mirror. Pulmonary system: A conventional respiratory examination, including inspection of the thorax and auscultation and percussion of the lung fields should be performed as part of the periodic medic al examination. Although routine pulmonary function testing is only required by the standard once every year for persons who are exposed over the TWA concentration limit, these tests have an obvious value in investigating possible respiratory dysfunction and should be used wherever deemed appropriate by the physician. In cases of alleged formaldehyde -induced airway disease, other possible causes of pulmonary dysfunction (including exposures to other substances) should be ruled out. A chest radiograph may be useful in these circumstances. In cases of suspected airway hypersensitivity or allergy, it may be appropriate to use bronchial challenge testing with formaldehyde or methacholine to determine the nature of the disorder. Such testing should be perfor med by or under the supervision of a physician experienced in the procedures involved. Skin: The physician should be alert to evidence of dermal irritation of sensitization, including reddening and inflammation, urticaria, blistering, scaling, formation o f skin fissures, or other symptoms. Since the integrity of the skin barrier is compromised by other dermal diseases, the presence of such disease should be noted. Skin sensitivity testing carries with it some risk of inducing sensitivity, and therefore, skin testing for formaldehyde sensitivity should not be used as a routine screening test. Sensitivity testing may be indicated in the investigation of a suspected existing sensitivity. Guidelines for such testing have been prepared by the North American Contact Dermatitis Group. (4) Additional examinations or tests . The physician may deem it necessary to perform other medical examinations or tests as indicated. The standard provides a mechanism whereby these additional investigations are covered under the s tandard for occupational exposure to formaldehyde. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 110 (5) Emergencies . The examination of workers exposed in an emergency should be directed at the organ systems most likely to be affected. Much of the content of the examination will be similar to the periodi c examination unless the patient has received a severe acute exposure requiring immediate attention to prevent serious consequences. If a severe overexposure requiring medical intervention or hospitalization has occurred, the physician must be alert to th e possibility of delayed symptoms. Follow -up nonroutine examinations may be necessary to ensure the patient's well -being. (6) Employer obligations . The employer is required to provide the physician with the following information: A copy of this standard and appendices A, C, D, and E; a description of the affected employee's duties as they relate to their exposure concentration; an estimate of the employee's exposure including duration (e.g., fifteen hr./wk., three eight - hour shifts, full -time); a description of any personal protective equipment, including respirators, used by the employee; and the results of any previous medical determinations for the affected employee related to formaldehyde exposure to the extent that this information is within the employer 's control. (7) Physician's obligations . The standard requires the employer to obtain a written statement from the physician. This statement must contain the physician's opinion as to whether the employee has any medical condition which would place them at increased risk of impaired health from exposure to formaldehyde or use of respirators, as appropriate. The physician must also state his opinion regarding any restrictions that should be placed on the employee's exposure to formaldehyde or upon the use of protective clothing or equipment such as respirators. If the employee wears a respirator as a result of their exposure to formaldehyde, the physician's opinion must also contain a statement regarding the suitability of the employee to wear the type of res pirator assigned. Finally, the physician must inform the employer that the employee has been told the results of the medical examination and of any medical conditions which require further explanation or treatment. This written opinion is not to contain any information on specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to occupational exposure to formaldehyde. The purpose in requiring the examining physician to supply the employer with a written opinion is to provide the employer with a medical basis to assist t he employer in placing employees initially, in ensuring that their health is not being impaired by formaldehyde, and to assess the employee's ability to use any required protective equipment.

The employer may remove the employee from exposure to MDA, provide special protective measures to the employee, or place limitations upon the employee, consistent with the medical findings, determ inations, or recommendations of any of the physicians who have reviewed the employee's health status. (b) Return. The employer may return the employee to their former job status, and end any special protective measures provided to the employee, consistent wit h the medical findings, determinations, or recommendations of any of the physicians who have reviewed the employee's health status, with two exceptions. If the initial removal, special protection, or limitation of the employee resulted from a final medical determination which differed from the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the initial physician; or If the employee has been on removal status for the preceding six months as a result of exposure to MDA, then the employer must await a final me dical determination. WAC 296 -62-07629 Medical removal protection benefits. (1) Provisions of medical removal protection benefits . The employer must provide to an employee up to six months of medical removal protection benefits on each occasion that an employ ee is removed from exposure to MDA or otherwise limited pursuant to this section. (2) Definition of medical removal protection benefits . For the purposes of this section, the requirement that an employer provide medical removal protection benefits means that the employer must maintain the earnings, seniority, and other employment rights and benefits of an employee as though the employee had not been removed from normal exposure to MDA or otherwise limited. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 130 (3) Follow -up medical surveillance during the period of employee removal or limitations . During the period of time that an employee is removed from normal exposure to MDA or otherwise limited, the employer may condition the provision of medical removal protection benefits upon the employee's participation in f ollow -up medical surveillance made available pursuant to WAC 296 -62-076. (4) Workers' compensation claims . If a removed employee files a claim for workers' compensation payments for an MDA -related disability, then the employer must continue to provide medical removal protection benefits pending disposition of the claim. To the extent that an award is made to the employee for earnings lost during the period of removal, the employer's medical removal protection obligation must be reduced by such amount. The em ployer must receive no credit for workers' compensation payments received by the employee for treatment -related expenses. (5) Other credits . The employer's obligation to provide medical removal protection benefits to a removed employee must be reduced to the extent that the employee receives compensation for earnings lost during the period of removal either from a publicly or employer -funded compensation program, or receives income from non -MDA -related employment with any employer made possible by virtue of th e employee's removal. (6) Employees who do not recover within the 6 months of removal . The employer must take the following measures with respect to any employee removed from exposure to MDA: (a) The employer must make available to the employee a medical examinat ion pursuant to this section to obtain a final medical determination with respect to the employee; (b) The employer must ensure that the final medical determination obtained indicates whether or not the employee may be returned to their former job status, and, if not, what steps should be taken to protect the employee's health; (c) Where the final medical determination has not yet been obtained, or, once obtained indicates that the employee may not yet be returned to their former job status, the employer must conti nue to provide medical removal protection benefits to the employee until either the employee is returned to former job status, or a final medical determination is made that the employee is incapable of ever safely returning to their former job status; and (d) Where the employer acts pursuant to a final medical determination which permits the return of the employee to their former job status, despite what would otherwise be an abnormal liver function test, later questions concerning removing the employee again must be decided by a final medical determination. The employer need not automatically remove such an employee pursuant to the MDA removal criteria provided by WAC 296 -62-076. (7) Voluntary removal or restriction of an employee . Where an employer, although not required by WAC 296 -62-076 to do so, removes an employee from exposure to MDA or otherwise places limitations on an employee due to the effects of MDA exposure on the employee's medical condition, the employer must provide medical removal protection benef its to the employee equal to that required by this section.

The information contained in Appendices A, B, C, and D of WAC 296 -62-076 is not intended by itself, to create any additional obligations not otherwise imposed by this standard nor detract from any ex isting obligation. WAC 296 -62-07654 Substance: Methylenedianiline (MDA). (b) Permissible exposure: Airborne: Ten parts per billion parts of air (10 pp b), time -weighted average (TWA) for an 8 -hour workday and an action level of five parts per billion parts of air (5 ppb). Dermal: Eye contact and skin contact with MDA are not permitted. (c) Appearance and odor: White to tan solid; amine odor. (2) Health hazard data . (a) Ways in which MDA affects your health. MDA can affect your health if you inhale it, or if it comes in contact with your skin or eyes. MDA is also harmful if you happen to swallow it. Do not get MDA in eyes, on skin, or on clothing. (b) Effects of over exposure. Short -term (acute) overexposure: Overexposure to MDA may produce fever, chills, loss of appetite, vomiting, jaundice. Contact may irritate skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Sensitization may occur. Long -term (chronic) exposure. Repeated or pr olonged exposure to MDA, even at relatively low concentrations, may cause cancer. In addition, damage to the liver, kidneys, blood, and spleen may occur with long -term exposure. Reporting signs and symptoms: You should inform your employer if you develop any signs or symptoms which you suspect are caused by exposure to MDA including yellow staining of the skin. (3) Protective clothing and equipment . (a) Respirators. Respirators are required for those operations in which engineering controls or work practice cont rols are not adequate or feasible to reduce exposure to the permissible limit. If respirators are worn, they must have the joint Mine Safety and Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) seal of approval, and cartridges or canisters must be replaced as necessary to maintain the effectiveness of the respirator. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 135 If you experience difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, you may request a positive pressure respirator from your employer. You must be thor oughly trained to use the assigned respirator, and the training will be provided by your employer. MDA does not have a detectable odor except at levels well above the permissible exposure limits. Do not depend on odor to warn you when a respirator canist er is exhausted. If you can smell MDA while wearing a respirator, proceed immediately to fresh air. If you experience difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, tell your employer. (b) Protective clothing. You may be required to wear coveralls, aprons , gloves, face shields, or other appropriate protective clothing to prevent skin contact with MDA. Where protective clothing is required, your employer is required to provide clean garments to you, as necessary, to assure that the clothing protects you ad equately. Replace or repair impervious clothing that has developed leaks. MDA should never be allowed to remain on the skin. Clothing and shoes which are not impervious to MDA should not be allowed to become contaminated with MDA, and if they do, the clothing and shoes should be promptly removed and decontaminated. The clothing should be laundered to remove MDA or discarded. Once MDA penetrates shoes or other leather articles, they should not be worn again. (c) Eye protection. You must wear splashproof sa fety goggles in areas where liquid MDA may contact your eyes. Contact lenses should not be worn in areas where eye contact with MDA can occur. In addition, you must wear a face shield if your face could be splashed with MDA liquid. (4) Emergency and first ai d procedures . (a) Eye and face exposure. If MDA is splashed into the eyes, wash the eyes for at least 15 minutes. See a doctor as soon as possible. (b) Skin exposure. If MDA is spilled on your clothing or skin, remove the contaminated clothing and wash the expo sed skin with large amounts of soap and water immediately. Wash contaminated clothing before you wear it again. (c) Breathing. If you or any other person breathes in large amounts of MDA, get the exposed person to fresh air at once. Apply artificial respira tion if breathing has stopped. Call for medical assistance or a doctor as soon as possible. Never enter any vessel or confined space where the MDA concentration might be high without proper safety equipment and at least one other person present who will stay outside. A life line should be used. (d) Swallowing. If MDA has been swallowed and the patient is conscious, do not induce vomiting. Call for medical assistance or a doctor immediately. (5) Medical requirements . If you are exposed to MDA at a concentratio n at or above the action level for more than 30 days per year, or exposed to liquid mixtures more than 15 days per year, your employer is required to provide a medical examination, including a medical history and laboratory tests, within 60 days of the eff ective date of this standard and annually thereafter. These tests shall be provided without cost to you. In addition, if you are accidentally exposed to MDA (either by ingestion, inhalation, or skin/eye contact) under conditions known or suspected to con stitute toxic exposure to MDA, your employer is required to make special examinations and tests available to you. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 136 (6) Observation of monitoring . Your employer is required to perform measurements that are representative of your exposure to MDA and you or you r designated representative are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are entitled to observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure and to record the results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking place in an area where resp irators or personal protective clothing and equipment are required to be worn, you and your representative must also be provided with, and must wear, the protective clothing and equipment. (7) Access to records . You or your representative are entitled to see the records of measurements of your exposure to MDA upon written request to your employer.

(a) High exposure to MDA can occur when transferring the substance from one container to another. Such operations should be well ventilated a nd good work practices must be established to avoid spills. (b) Pure MDA is a solid with a low vapor pressure. Grinding or heating operations increase the potential for exposure. (c) Store away from oxidizing materials. (d) Employers shall advise employees of all are as and operations where exposure to MDA could occur. (7) Housekeeping and hygiene facilities . (a) The workplace should be kept clean, orderly, and in a sanitary condition. The employer should institute a leak and spill detection program for operations involving MDA in order to detect sources of fugitive MDA emissions. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 138 (b) Adequate washing facilities with hot and cold water are to be provided and maintained in a sanitary condition. Suitable cleansing agents should also be provided to assure the effective removal of MDA from the skin. (8) Common operations . Common operations in which exposure to MDA is likely to occur include the following: Manufacture of MDA; manufacture of methylene diisocyanate; curing agent for epoxy resin structures; wire fi MDA. (1) Route of entry : Inhalation; skin absorption; ingestion. MDA can be inhaled, absorbed through the skin, or ingested. (2) Toxicology : MDA is a suspect carci nogen in humans. There are several reports of liver disease in humans and animals resulting from acute exposure to MDA. A well -documented case of an acute cardiomyopathy secondary to exposure to MDA is on record. Numerous human cases of hepatitis second ary to MDA are known. Upon direct contact MDA may also cause damage to the eyes. Dermatitis and skin sensitization have been observed. Almost all forms of acute environmental hepatic injury in humans involve the hepatic parenchyma ular jaundice. This The clinical picture consists of cholestatic jaundice, preceded or accompanied by abdominal pain, fever, and chills. Onset in about 60 percent of all observed cases is abrupt with severe abdom inal pain. In about 30 percent of observed cases, the illness presented and evolved more slowly and less dramatically, with only slight abdominal pain. In about 10 percent of the cases only jaundice was evident. The cholestatic nature of the jaundice is evident in the prominence of itching, the histologic predominance of bile stasis, and portal inflammatory infiltration, accompanied by only slight parenchymal injury in most cases, and by the moderately elevated transaminase values. Acute, high doses, ho wever, have been known to cause hepatocellular damage resulting in elevated SGPT, SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. Absorption through the skin is rapid. MDA is metabolized and excreted over a 48 -hour period. Direct contact may be irritating to the skin, causing dermatitis. Also MDA which is deposited on the skin is not thoroughly removed through washing. MDA may cause bladder cancer in humans. Animal data supporting this assumption is not available nor is conclusive human data. However, human data collected on workers at a helicopter manufacturing facility where MDA is used suggests a higher incidence of bladder cancer among exposed workers. (3) Signs and symptoms : Skin may become yellow from contact with MDA. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 139 Repeated or prolonged contact with MDA may result in recurring dermatitis (red -itchy, cracked skin) and eye irritation. Inhalation, ingestion, or absorption through the skin at high concentrations may result in hepatitis, causing symptoms such as fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, dark urine, anorexia, rash, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice. Corneal burns may occur when MDA is splashed in the eyes. (4) Treatment of acute toxic effects/emergency situation : If MDA gets into the eyes, immediately wash eyes with large amounts of water. If MDA is splashed on the skin, immediately wash contaminated skin with mild soap or detergent. Employee should be removed from exposure and given proper medical treatment. Medical tests required under the emergency section of the medical surveillance s ubsection (13)(d) must be conducted. If the chemical is swallowed do not induce vomiting but remove by gastric lavage. WAC 296 -62-07660 Appendix methods for MDA monitoring and measurement procedures. Measureme nts taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure to MDA are best taken so that the representative average 8 -hour exposure may be determined from a single 8 -hour sample or two 4 -hour samples. Short -time interval samples (or grab samples) may also be used to determine average exposure level if a minimum of five measurements are taken in a random manner over the 8 -hour work shift. Random sampling means that any portion of the work shift has the same chance of being sampled as any other. The arithme tic average of all such random samples taken on one work shift is an estimate of an employee's average level of exposure for that work shift. Air samples should be taken in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent that inhaled b y the employee). There are a number of methods available for monitoring employee exposures to MDA. The method WISHA currently uses is included below. The employer, however, has the obligation of selecting any monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of the standard under their unique field conditions. The standard requires that the method of monitoring must have an accuracy, to a 95 percent confidence level, of not less than plus or minus 25 percent for the select PEL. WISHA m ethodology . Sampling procedure . Apparatus : Samples are collected by use of a personal sampling pump that can be calibrated within +5 percent of the recommended flow rate with the sampling filter in line. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 140 Samples are collected on 37 mm Gelman type A/E gla ss fiber filters treated with sulfuric acid. The filters are prepared by soaking each filter with 0.5 mL of 0.26N H 2SO4. (0.26 N H2SO4 can be prepared by diluting 1.5 mL of 36N H 2SO4 to 200 mL with deionized water.) The filters are dried in an oven at 100 degrees C. for one hour and then assembled into three -piece 37 mm polystyrene cassettes without backup pads. The front filter is separated from the back filter by a polystyrene spacer. The cassettes are sealed with shrink bands and the ends are plugged with plastic plugs. After sampling, the filters are carefully removed from the cassettes and individually transferred to small vials containing approximately 2 mL deionized water. The vials must be tightly sealed. The water can be added before or after t he filters are transferred. The vials must be sealable and capable of holding at least 7 mL of liquid. Small glass scintillation vials with caps containing Teflon liners are recommended. Reagents: Deionized water is needed for addition to the vials. Samp ling technique: Immediately before sampling, remove the plastic plugs from the filter cassettes. Attach the cassette to the sampling pump with flexible tubing and place the cassette in the employee's breathing zone. After sampling, seal the cassettes with plastic plugs until the filters are transferred to the vials containing deionized water. At some convenient time within 10 hours of sampling, transfer the sample filters to vials. Seal the small vials lengthwise. Submit at least one blank filter with each sample set. Blanks should be handled in the same manner as samples, but no air is drawn through them. Record sample volumes (in L of air) for each sample, along with any potential interferences. Retention efficiency: A retention efficiency study was perfo rmed by drawing 100 L of air (80 percent relative humidity) at 1 L/min through sample filters that had been spiked with 0.814 microgram MDA. Instead of using backup pads, blank acid -treated filters were used as backups in each cassette. Upon analysis, th e top filters were found to have an average of 91.8 percent of the spiked amount. There was no MDA found on the bottom filters, so the amount lost was probably due to the slight instability of the MDA salt. Extraction efficiency: The average extraction ef ficiency for six filters spiked at the target concentration is 99.6 percent. The stability of extracted and derivatized samples was verified by reanalyzing the above six samples the next day using fresh standards. The average extraction efficiency for the reanalyzed samples is 98.7 percent. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 141 Recommended air volume and sampling rate: The recommended air volume is 100 L. The recommended sampling rate is 1 L/min. Interferences (sampling): MDI appears to be a positive interference. It was found that when MDI was spiked onto an acid -treated filter, the MDI converted to MDA after air was drawn through it. Suspected interferences should be reported to the laboratory with submitted samples. Safety precautions (sampling): Attach the sampling equipment to the emplo yees so that it will not interfere with work performance or safety. Follow all safety procedures that apply to the work area being sampled. Analytical procedure: Apparatus: The following are required for analysis. A GC equipped with an electron capture de tector. For this evaluation a Hewlett Packard 5880 Gas Chromatograph equipped with a Nickel 63 High Temperature Electron Capture Detector and a Linearizer was used. A GC column capable of separating the MDA derivative from the solvent and interferences. A 6 ft X 2 mm ID glass column packed with 3 percent OV -101 coated on 100/120 Gas Chrom Q meter DB -1 or DB -5 capillary column is recommended for this evaluation. A electronic integrator or some other suitable means of measuring peak areas or heights . Small resealable vials with Teflon -lined caps capable of holding 4 mL. A dispenser or pipet for toluene capable of delivering 2.0 mL. Pipets (or repipets with plastic or Teflon tips) capable of delivering 1 mL for the sodium hydroxide and buffer solution s. A repipet capable of delivering 25 micro -L HFAA. Syringes for preparation of standards and injection of standards and samples into a GC. Volumetric flasks and pipets to dilute the pure MDA in preparation of standards. Disposable pipets to transfer the t oluene layers after the samples are extracted. Reagents: 0.5 NaOH prepared from reagent grade NaOH. Toluene, pesticide grade. Burdick and Jackson distilled glass toluene was used. Heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride (HFAA). HFAA from Pierce Chemical Com pany was used. pH 7.0 phosphate buffer, prepared from 136 g potassium dihydrogen phosphate and 1L deionized water. The pH is adjusted to 7.0 with saturated sodium hydroxide solution. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 142 4,4'-Methylenedianiline (MDA), reagent grade. Standard preparation: Concentrated stock standards are prepared by diluting pure MDA with toluene. Analytical standards are prepared by injecting \u00b5L amounts of diluted stock standards into vials that contain 2.0 mL toluene. 25 \u00b5L HFAA are added to each vial and the vials are cap ped and shaken for 10 seconds. After 10 min, 1 mL of buffer is added to each vial. The vials are recapped and shaken for 10 seconds. After allowing the layers to separate, aliquots of the toluene (upper) layers are removed with a syringe and analyzed by GC . Analytical standard concentrations should bracket sample concentrations. Thus, if samples fall out of the range of prepared standards, additional standards must be prepared to ascertain detector response. Sample preparation: The sample filters are recei ved in vials containing deionized water. 1 mL of 0.5N NaOH and 2.0 mL toluene are added to each vial. The vials are recapped and shaken for 10 min. After allowing the layers to separate, approximately 1 mL aliquots of the toluene (upper) layers are transfe rred to separate vials with clean disposable pipets. The toluene layers are treated and analyzed. Analysis: GC conditions Zone temperatures: Column --220 degrees C. Injector --235 degrees C. Detector --335 degrees C.

Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I General Occupational Health Standards Airborne Contaminants (Specific) _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I, Page 143 A calibration curve is constructed by plotting response (peak areas or heights) of standard injections versus g of MDA per sample. Sample c oncentrations must be bracketed by standards. Interferences (analytical): Any compound that gives an electron capture detector response and has the same general retention time as the HFAA derivative of MDA is a potential interference. Suspected interferen ces reported to the laboratory with submitted samples by the industrial hygienist must be considered before samples are derivatized. GC parameters may be changed to possibly circumvent interferences. Retention time on a single column is not considered proo f of chemical identity. Analyte identity should be confirmed by GC/MS if possible. Calculations: The analyte concentration for samples is obtained from the calibration curve in terms of g MDA per sample. The extraction efficiency is 100 percent. If any MDA is found on the blank, that amount is subtracted from the sample amounts. The air concentrations are calculated using the following formulae: Microgram/m3 = (microgram MDA per sample) = (microgram/m3) (24.46)/(198.3) = (microgram/m3)(0.1233) where 24.46 is the molar volume at 25 degrees C. and 760 mm Hg.

Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part Antho phyllite, worksites. (1) On multi -employer worksites, an employer performing work requiring the establishment of a regulated area must inform other employers on the site of the nature of the employer's work with asbestos and/o r PACM, of the existence of and requirements pertaining to regulated areas, and the measures taken to ensure that employees of such other employers are not exposed to asbestos. (2) Asbestos hazards at a multi -employer worksite must be abated by the employer wh o created or controls the source of asbestos contamination. For example, if there is a significant breach of an enclosure containing Class I work, the employer responsible for erecting the enclosure must repair the breach immediately. (3) In addition, all emp loyers of employees exposed to asbestos hazards must comply with applicable protective provisions to protect their employees. For example, if employees working immediately adjacent to a Class I asbestos job are exposed to asbestos due to the inadequate co ntainment of such jobs, their employer must either remove the employees from the area until the enclosure breach is repaired; or perform an initial exposure assessment pursuant to WAC 296 -62-07709. (4) All employers of employees working adjacent to regulated a reas established by another employer on a multi -employer worksite, must take steps on a daily basis to ascertain the integrity of the enclosure and/or the effectiveness of the control method relied on by the primary asbestos contractor to ensure that asbes tos fibers do not migrate to such adjacent areas. (5) All general contractors on a construction project which includes work covered by this standard must be deemed to exercise general supervisory authority over the work covered by this standard, even though th e general contractor is not qualified to serve as the asbestos \"competent person\" as defined by WAC 296 -62-07703. As supervisor of the entire project, the general contractor must ascertain whether the asbestos contractor is in compliance with this standar d, and must require such contractor to come into compliance with this standard when necessary. WAC 296 -62-07709 Exposure assessment and monitoring. (1) General monitoring criteria . (a) Each employer who has a workplace or work operation where exposure monitoring is required under this part must perform monitoring to determine accurately the airborne concentrations of asbestos to which employees may be exposed. (b) Determinations of employee exposure must be made from breathing zone air samples that are representative of the eight -hour TWA and thirty minute short -term exposures of each employee. (c) Representative eight -hour TWA employee exposures must be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing full -shift exposure for each shift for each employee in each job classification in each work area. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 6 (d) Representative thirty minute short -term employee exposures must be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing thirty minute exposures associated with operations that are most likely to produce expos ures above the excursion limit for each shift for each job classification in each work area. (2) Exposure monitoring requirements for all occupational exposures to asbestos in all industries covered by the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act except con struction work, as defined in WAC 296-155-012, and except ship repairing, shipbuilding and shipbreaking employments and related employments as defined in WAC 296-304-01001. (a) Initial monitoring. Each employer who has a workplace or work operation covered by this standard, except as provided for in (a)(ii) and (iii) of this s ubsection, must perform initial monitoring of employees who are, or may reasonably be expected to be exposed to airborne concentrations at or above the TWA permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit. The initial monitoring must be at the initiation of each asbestos job to accurately determine the airborne concentration of asbestos to which employees may be exposed. Where the employer or their representative has monitored after March 31, 1992, for the TWA permissible exposure limit and/or excursion l imit, and the monitoring satisfies all other requirements of this section, and the monitoring data was obtained during work operations conducted under workplace conditions closely resembling the processes, type of material including percentage of asbestos, control methods, work practices, and environmental conditions used and prevailing in the employer's current operations, the employer may rely on such earlier monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of (a)(i) of this subsection. Where the employer h as relied upon objective data that demonstrates that asbestos is not capable of being released in airborne concentrations at or above the TWA permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit under those work conditions of processing, use, or handling expe cted to have the greatest potential for releasing asbestos, then no initial monitoring is required. (b) Monitoring frequency (periodic monitoring) and patterns. After the initial determinations required by subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section, samples must be of such frequency and pattern as to represent with reasonable accuracy the levels of exposure of the employees. Sampling must not be at intervals greater than six months for employees whose exposures may reasonably be foreseen to exceed the TWA permissib le exposure limit and/or excursion limit. (c) Daily monitoring within regulated areas: The employer must conduct daily monitoring that is representative of the exposure of each employee who is assigned to work within a regulated area. Exception: When all em ployees within a regulated area are equipped with full facepiece supplied -air respirators operated in the pressure - demand mode equipped with either an auxiliary positive pressure self -contained breathing apparatus or a HEPA filter, the employer may dispens e with the daily monitoring required by this subsection. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 7 (d) Changes in monitoring frequency. If either the initial or the periodic monitoring required by subsection (2)(a) and (b) of this section statistically indicates that employee exposures are below th e TWA permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit, the employer may discontinue the monitoring for those employees whose exposures are represented by such monitoring. (e) Additional monitoring. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2)(a)(ii) and (c) of this section, the employer must institute the exposure monitoring required under subsection (2)(a)(i) and (ii) of this section whenever there has been a change in the production, process, control equipment, personnel, or work practices that may result in new or additional exposures above the TWA permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit, or when the employer has any reason to suspect that a change may result in new or additional exposures above the TWA permissible exposure limit and/or excur sion limit. (3) Exposure assessment monitoring requirements for all construction work as defined in WAC 296-155-012 and for all ship repairing, shipbuilding and shipb reaking employments and related employments as defined in WAC 296-304-01001. (a) Initial exposure assessment. Each employer who has a workplace or work operation cove red by this standard must ensure that a \"competent person\" conducts an exposure assessment immediately before or at the initiation of the operation to ascertain expected exposures during that operation or workplace. The assessment must be completed in tim e to comply with the requirements which are triggered by exposure data or lack of a \"negative exposure assessment,\" and to provide information necessary to ensure that all control systems planned are appropriate for that operation and will work properly. Basis of initial exposure assessment: Unless a negative exposure assessment has been made according to (b) of this subsection, the initial exposure assessment must, if feasible, be based on monitoring conducted according to (b) of this subsection. The ass essment must take into consideration both the monitoring results and all observations, information or calculations which indicate employee exposure to asbestos, including any previous monitoring conducted in the workplace, or of the operations of the emplo yer which indicate the levels of airborne asbestos likely to be encountered on the job. For Class I asbestos work, until the employer conducts exposure monitoring and documents that employees on that job will not be exposed in excess of the PELs, or other wise makes a negative exposure assessment according to (b) of this subsection, the employer must presume that employees are exposed in excess of the TWA and excursion limit. (b) Negative exposure assessment: For any one specific asbestos job which will be performed by employees who have been trained in compliance with the standard, the employer may demonstrate that employee exposures will be below the PELs by data which conform to the following criteria: Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 8 Objective data demonstrating that the products or mate rial containing asbestos minerals or the activity involving such product or material cannot release airborne fibers in concentrations exceeding the TWA and excursion limit under those work conditions having the greatest potential for releasing asbestos; or Where the employer has monitored prior asbestos jobs for the PEL and the excursion limit within 12 months of the current or projected job, the monitoring and analysis were performed in compliance with the asbestos standard in effect; and the data was obta ined during work operations conducted under workplace conditions \"closely resembling\" the processes, type of material including percentage of asbestos, control methods, work practices, and environmental conditions used and prevailing in the employer's curr ent operations, the operations were conducted by employees whose training and experience are no more extensive than that of employees performing the current job, and these data show that under the conditions prevailing and which will prevail in the current workplace there is a high degree of certainty that employee exposures will not exceed the TWA or excursion limit; or The results of initial exposure monitoring of the current job made from breathing zone samples that are representative of the 8 -hour TWA a nd 30 - minute short -term exposures of each employee covering operations which are most likely during the performance of the entire asbestos job to result in exposures over the PELs. (c) Periodic monitoring. Class I and Class II operations. The employer must co nduct daily monitoring that is representative of the exposure of each employee who is assigned to work within a regulated area who is performing Class I or II work, unless the employer according to (b) of this subsection, has made a negative exposure asses sment for the entire operation. All operations under the standard other than Class I and II operations. The employer must conduct periodic monitoring of all work where exposures are expected to exceed a PEL, at intervals sufficient to document the validit y of the exposure prediction. Exception. When all employees required to be monitored daily are equipped with supplied -air respirators operated in the pressure demand mode, the employer may dispense with the daily monitoring required by subsection (2)(c) of this section. However, employees performing Class I work using a control method which is not listed in WAC 296 -62-07712 or using a modification of a listed control method, must continue to be monitored daily even if they are equipped with supplied -air respirators. (d) Termination of monitoring. If the periodic monitoring required by (c) of this subsection reveals that employee exposures, as indicated by statistically reliable measurements, are below the permissible exposure limit and excursion limit the employer may discontinue monitoring for those employees whose exposures are represented by such monitoring. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 9 (e) Monitoring outside negative -pressure enclosures: The employer must conduct representative area monitoring of the airborne fiber levels at least ever y other day at the HEPA machine exhaust and entrance to the decontamination area. (f) Additional monitoring. Notwithstanding the provisions of (b), (c), and (d) of this subsection, the employer must institute the exposure monitoring required under (c) of this subsection whenever there has been a change in process, control equipment, personnel or work practices that may result in new or additional exposures above the permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit or when the employer has any reason to suspec t that a change may result in new or additional exposures above the permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit. Such additional monitoring is required regardless of whether a \"negative exposure assessment\" was previously produced for a specific job . (g) Preabatement monitoring. Prior to the start of asbestos work, representative area monitoring must be conducted for comparison to clearance monitoring as required by subsection (3)(h) of this section. Preabatement air monitoring is not required for outdoor work. (h) Clearance monitoring. Representative area air monitoring must be taken at the completion of the asbestos work. Air sample results must be obtained before removal or reoccupancy of the regulated area. Clearance air monitoring is not required fo r outdoor asbestos work. The employer must demonstrate by monitoring that the airborne concentration is below: The permissible exposure limit; or At or below the airborne fiber level existing prior to the start of the asbestos work, whichever level is low er. (4) Method of monitoring . (a) All samples taken to satisfy the employee exposure monitoring requirements of this section must be personal samples collected following the procedures specified in WAC 296 -62-07735, Appendix A. (b) Monitoring must be performed by pers ons having a thorough understanding of monitoring principles and procedures and who can demonstrate proficiency in sampling techniques. (c) All samples taken to satisfy the monitoring requirements of this section must be evaluated using the WISHA reference met hod specified in WAC 296 -62-07735, Appendix A, or an equivalent counting method recognized by the department. (d) If an equivalent method to the WISHA reference method is used, the employer must ensure that the method meets the following criteria: Replicate ex posure data used to establish equivalency are collected in side -by- side field and laboratory comparisons; and Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 10 The comparison indicates that ninety percent of the samples collected in the range 0.5 to 2.0 times the permissible limit have an accuracy range of plus or minus twenty -five percent of the WISHA reference method results at a ninety - five percent confidence level as demonstrated by a statistically valid protocol; and The equivalent method is documented and the results of the comparison testing are m aintained. (e) To satisfy the monitoring requirements of this section, employers must use the results of monitoring analysis performed by laboratories which have instituted quality assurance programs that include the elements as prescribed in WAC 296 -62-07735, Appendix A. (5) Employee notification of monitoring results . (a) The employer must, as soon as possible but no later than within five days for construction and shipyard industries and fifteen working days for other industries, after the receipt of the results of any monitoring performed under the standard, notify the affected employees of these results in writing either individually or by posting of results in an appropriate location that is accessible to affected employees. (b) The written notification required by (a ) of this subsection must contain the corrective action being taken by the employer to reduce employee exposure to or below the TWA and/or excursion exposure limits, wherever monitoring results indicated that the TWA and/or excursion exposure limits had be en exceeded. (6) Observation of monitoring . (a) The employer must provide affected employees or their designated representatives an opportunity to observe any monitoring of employee exposure to asbestos conducted in accordance with this section. (b) When observation o f the monitoring of employee exposure to asbestos requires entry into an area where the use of protective clothing or equipment is required, the observer must be provided with and be required to use such clothing and equipment and must comply with all othe r applicable safety and health procedures. WAC 296 -62-07711 Regulated areas . (1) General .

The results of such monitoring must be made known to the employer no later than 24 hours from the end of the work shift represented by such monitoring. Exception: For work completed outdoors where employees are not working in areas adjacent to the regulated areas, (a) of this subsection is satisfied when the specific control methods in subsection (7) of this section are used; (c) For all Class I jobs, HVAC systems must be isolated in the regulated area by sealing with a double layer of 6 mil plastic or the equivalent; (d) For all Class I jobs, impermeable dropcloths must be placed on surfaces beneath all removal activity; (e) For all Class I jobs, all objects within the regulated area must be covered with imper meable dropcloths or plastic sheeting which is secured by duct tape or an equivalent; (f) For all Class I jobs where the employer cannot produce a negative exposure assessment, or where exposure monitoring shows that a PEL is exceeded, the employer must ventil ate the regulated area to move contaminated air away from the breathing zone of employees toward a HEPA filtration or collection device. (7) Specific control methods for Class I work . In addition, Class I asbestos work must be performed using one or more of t he following control methods according to the limitations stated below: (a) Negative pressure enclosure (NPE) systems: NPE systems may be used where the configuration of the work area does not make the erection of the enclosure infeasible, with the following specifications and work practices: Specifications: (A) The negative pressure enclosure (NPE) may be of any configuration; (B) At least 4 air changes per hour must be maintained in the NPE; Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 14 (C) A minimum of -0.02 column inches of water pressure differential, relative to outside pressure, must be maintained within the NPE as evidenced by manometric measurements; (D) The NPE must be kept under negative pressure throughout the period of its use; and (E) Air movement must be directed away from employees performing asbestos work w ithin the enclosure, and toward a HEPA filtration or collection device.

(G) Where system uses attached waste bag, such bag must be connected to collection bag using hose or other material which must withstand pres sure of ACM waste and water without losing its integrity. (H) Sliding valve or other device must separate waste bag from hose to ensure no exposure when waste bag is disconnected. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 15 (I) At least two persons must perform Class I glove bag removal operations. (c) Negati ve pressure glove bag systems. Negative pressure glove bag systems may be used to remove ACM or PACM from piping. Specifications: In addition to specifications for glove bag systems above, negative pressure glove bag systems must attach HEPA vacuum syste ms or other devices to bag during removal. Work practices: (A) The employer must comply with the work practices for glove bag systems in this section. (B) The HEPA vacuum cleaner or other device used during removal must run continually during the operation until i t is completed at which time the bag must be collapsed prior to removal of the bag from the pipe. (C) Where a separate waste bag is used along with a collection bag and discarded after one use, the collection bag may be reused if rinsed clean with amended wate r before reuse. (d) Negative pressure glove box systems: Negative pressure glove boxes may be used to remove ACM or PACM from pipe runs with the following specifications and work practices: Specifications: (A) Glove boxes must be constructed with rigid sides and made from metal or other material which can withstand the weight of the ACM and PACM and water used during removal. (B) A negative pressure generator must be used to create negative pressure in the system. (C) An air filtration unit must be attached to the box. (D) The box must be fitted with gloved apertures.

(C) Loose or damaged ACM adjacent to the box must be wrapped and sealed in two layers of 6 mil plastic prior to the job, or otherwise made intact prior to the job. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 16 (D) A HEPA filtration system must be used to maintain pressure barrier in box. (e) Water spray process system. A water spray process system may be used for removal of ACM and PACM from cold line piping if, employees carrying out such process have completed a 40 -hour separate training course in its use, in addition to training required for employees performing Class I work. The system must meet the following specifications and must be performed by employees using the following work practices: Specifications: (A) Piping must be surrounded on 3 sides by rigid framing. (B) A 360 degree water spray, delivered through nozzles supplied by a high pressure separate water line, must be formed ar ound the piping. (C) The spray must collide to form a fine aerosol which provides a liquid barrier between workers and the ACM and PACM. Work practices: (A) The system must be run for at least 10 minutes before removal begins. (B) All removal must take place within th e water barrier. (C) The system must be operated by at least three persons, one of whom must not perform removal, but must check equipment, and ensure proper operation of the system. (D) After removal, the ACM and PACM must be bagged while still inside the water barrier. (f) A small walk -in enclosure which accommodates no more than two persons (mini - enclosure) may be used if the disturbance or removal can be completely contained by the enclosure with the following specifications and work practices: Specifications: (A) The fabricated or job -made enclosure must be constructed of 6 mil plastic or equivalent. (B) The enclosure must be placed under negative pressure by means of a HEPA filtered vacuum or similar ventilation unit. (C) Change room. A small change room made of 6 -mil-thick polyethylene plastic should be contiguous to the mini -enclosure, and is necessary to allow the worker to vacuum off their protective coveralls and remove them before leaving the work area. While inside the enclosure, the worker should wear Tyvek disposabl e coveralls or equivalent and must use the appropriate HEPA -filtered dual cartridge respiratory protection. The advantages of mini -enclosures are that they limit the spread of asbestos contamination, reduce the potential exposure of bystanders and other workers who may be working in adjacent areas, and are quick and easy to install. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 17 The disadvantage of mini -enclosures is that they may be too small to contain the equipment necessary to create a negative -pressure within the enclosure; however, the double l ayer of plastic sheeting will serve to restrict the release of asbestos fibers to the area outside the enclosure. Work practices: (A) Before use, the mini -enclosure must be inspected for leaks and smoke - tested to detect breaches, and any breaches sealed. (B) Befo re reuse, the interior must be completely washed with amended water and HEPA -vacuumed. (C) During use, air movement must be directed away from the employee's breathing zone within the mini -enclosure. (8) Alternative control methods for Class I work . Class I work may be performed using a control method which is not referenced in subsection (2)(a) through (3)(e) of this section, or which modifies a control method referenced in subsection (2)(a) through (3)(e) of this section, if the following provisions are complied with: (a) The control method must enclose, contain or isolate the processes or source of airborne asbestos dust, before it enters the breathing zone of employees. (b) A certified industrial hygienist or licensed professional engineer who is also qualified as a pr oject designer as defined in WAC 296 -62-07703, must evaluate the work area, the projected work practices and the engineering controls and must certify in writing that the planned control method is adequate to reduce direct and indirect employee exposure to below the PELs under worst -case conditions of use, and that the planned control method will prevent asbestos contamination outside the regulated area, as measured by clearance sampling which meets the requirements of EPA's Asbestos in Schools rule issued under AHERA, or perimeter monitoring which meets the criteria in subsection (6)(b)(ii) of this section. Where the TSI or surfacing material to be removed is 25 linear or 10 square feet or less, the evaluation required in subsection (8)(b) of this section may be performed by a competent person. (c) Before work which involves the removal of more than 25 linear or 10 square feet of thermal system insulation or surfacing material is begun using an alternative method which has been the subject of subsection (2)(a) through (3)(e) of this section required evaluation and certification, the employer must include a copy of such evaluation and certification with notifications required by WAC 296-65-020, Notification requirements. The submission must not constitute approval by WISHA. (d) The evaluation of employee exposure required in WAC 296 -62-07712(8) must include and be based on sampling and analytical data representing employee ex posure during the use of such method under the worst -case conditions and by employees whose training and experiences are equivalent to employees who are to perform the current job. (9) Work practices and engineering controls for Class II work . (a) All Class II wor k must be supervised by a competent person as defined in WAC 296 - 62-07703. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 18 (b) For all indoor Class II jobs, where the employer has not produced a negative exposure assessment according to WAC 296 -62-07709(3), or where during the job, changed conditions indi cate there may be exposure above the PEL or where the employer does not remove the ACM in a substantially intact state, the employer must use one of the following methods to ensure that airborne asbestos does not migrate from the regulated area: Critical b arriers must be placed over all openings to the regulated area; or The employer must use another barrier or isolation method which prevents the migration of airborne asbestos from the regulated area, as verified by perimeter area monitoring or clearance mo nitoring which meets the criteria set out in subsection (6)(b)(ii) of this section. (c) Impermeable dropcloths must be placed on surfaces beneath all removal activity. (d) All Class II asbestos work must be performed using the work practices and requirements set o ut above in subsection (2) of this section. (10) Additional controls for Class II work . Class II asbestos work must also be performed by complying with the work practices and controls designated for each type of asbestos work to be performed, set out in this p aragraph. Where more than one control method may be used for a type of asbestos work, the employer may choose one or a combination of designated control methods. Class II work also may be performed using a method allowed for Class I work, except that glo ve bags and glove boxes are allowed if they fully enclose the Class II material to be removed. (a) For removing vinyl and asphalt flooring materials which contain ACM or for which in buildings constructed no later than 1980, the employer has not verified the a bsence of ACM according to WAC 296 -62-07712 (10)(a)(ix). The employer must ensure that employees comply with the following work practices and that employees are trained in these practices according to WAC 296 -62-07722. Flooring or its backing must not be sanded. Vacuums equipped with HEPA filter, disposable dust bag, and metal floor tool (no brush) must be used to clean floors. Resilient sheeting must be removed by cutting with wetting of the snip point and wetting during delamination. Rip -up of resilient sheet floor material is prohibited. All scraping of residual adhesive and/or backing must be performed using wet methods. Dry sweeping is prohibited. Mechanical chipping is prohibited unless performed in a negative pressure enclosure which meets the requi rements of subsection (7)(a) of this section. Tiles must be removed intact, unless the employer demonstrates that intact removal is not possible. When tiles are heated and can be removed intact, wetting may be omitted. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ flooring material includi ng associated mastic and backing must be assumed to be asbestos -containing unless an industrial hygienist determines that it is asbestos -free using recognized analytical techniques. (b) For removing roofing material which contains ACM the employer must ensure that the following work practices are followed: Roofing material must be removed in an intact state to the extent feasible. Wet methods must be used to remove roofing materials that are not intact, or that will be rendered not intact during removal, unless such wet methods are not feasible or will create safety hazards. Cutting machines must be continuously misted during use, unless a competent person determines that misting substantially decreases worker safety. When removing built -up roofs with asbestos -containing roofing felts and an aggregate surface using a power roof cutter, all dust resulting from the cutting operation must be collected by a HEPA dust collector, or must be HEPA vacuumed by vacuuming along the cut line. When removing built -up roofs with asbestos -containing roofing felts and a smooth surface using a power roof cutter, the dust resulting from the cutting operation must be collected either by a HEPA dust collector or HEPA vacuuming along the cut line, or by gently sweeping and then carefu lly and completely wiping up the still wet dust and debris left along the cut line. The dust and debris must be immediately bagged or placed in covered containers. Asbestos -containing material that has been removed from a roof must not be dropped or throw n to the ground. Unless the material is carried or passed to the ground by hand, it must be lowered to the ground via covered, dust -tight chute, crane or hoist: (A) Any ACM that is not intact must be lowered to the ground as soon as is practicable, but in any event no later than the end of the work shift. While the material remains on the roof it must either be kept wet, placed in an impermeable waste bag, or wrapped in plastic sheeting. (B) Intact ACM must be lowered to the ground as soon as is practicable, but in any event no later than the end of the work shift. Upon being lowered, unwrapped material must be transferred to a closed receptacle in such manner so as to preclude the dispersion of dust. Roof level heating and ventilation air intake sources shall be isolated or the ventilation system must be shut down. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, removal or repair of sections of intact roofing less than 25 square feet in area does not require use of wet methods or HEPA vacuuming as long as man ual methods which do not render the material nonintact are used to remove the material and no visible dust is created by the removal method used. In determining whether a job involves less than 25 square feet, the employer must include all removal and rep air work performed on the same roof on the same day. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 20 (c) When removing cementitious asbestos -containing siding and shingles or transite panels containing ACM on building exteriors (other than roofs, where subsection (10)(b) of this section applies) the emplo yer must ensure that the following work practices are followed: Cutting, abrading or breaking siding, shingles, or transite panels, must be prohibited unless the employer can demonstrate that methods less likely to result in asbestos fiber release cannot b e used. Each panel or shingle must be sprayed with amended water prior to removal. Unwrapped or unbagged panels or shingles must be immediately lowered to the ground via covered dust -tight chute, crane or hoist, or placed in an impervious waste bag or wrap ped in plastic sheeting and lowered to the ground no later than the end of the work shift. Nails must be cut with flat, sharp instruments. (d) When removing gaskets containing ACM, the employer must ensure that the following work practices are followed: If a g asket is visibly deteriorated and unlikely to be removed intact, removal must be undertaken within a glove bag as described in subsection (7)(b) of this section. (Reserved.) The gasket must be immediately placed in a disposal container. Any scraping to rem ove residue must be performed wet. (e) When performing any other Class II removal of asbestos -containing material for which specific controls have not been listed in subsection (10) of this section, the employer must ensure that the following work practices ar e complied with. The material must be thoroughly wetted with amended water prior to and during its removal. The material must be removed in an intact state unless the employer demonstrates that intact removal is not possible. Cutting, abrading or breaking the material must be prohibited unless the employer can demonstrate that methods less likely to result in asbestos fiber release are not feasible. Asbestos -containing material removed, must be immediately bagged or wrapped, or kept wet until transferred t o a closed receptacle, no later than the end of the work shift. (f) Alternative work practices and controls. Instead of the work practices and controls listed in subsection (10) of this section, the employer may use different or modified engineering and work practice controls if the following provisions are complied with. The employer must demonstrate by data representing employee exposure during the use of such method under conditions which closely resemble the conditions under which the method is to be used, that employee exposure will not exceed the PELs under any anticipated circumstances. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 21 A competent person must evaluate the work area, the projected work practices and the engineering controls, and must certify in writing, that the different or modified con trols are adequate to reduce direct and indirect employee exposure to below the PELs under all expected conditions of use and that the method meets the requirements of this standard. The evaluation must include and be based on data representing employee e xposure during the use of such method under conditions which closely resemble the conditions under which the method is to be used for the current job, and by employees whose training and experience are equivalent to employees who are to perform the current job. (11) Work practices and engineering controls for Class III asbestos work . Class III asbestos work must be conducted using engineering and work practice controls which minimize the exposure to employees performing the asbestos work and to bystander employ ees. (a) The work must be performed using wet methods. (b) To the extent feasible, the work must be performed using local exhaust ventilation. Where the disturbance involves drilling, cutting, abrading, sanding, chipping, braking, or sawing of thermal system insul ation or surfacing material, the employer must use impermeable dropcloths, and must isolate the operation using mini - enclosures or glove bag systems according to subsection (7) of this section or another isolation method. (c) Where the employer does not produc e a \"negative exposure assessment\" for a job, or where monitoring results show the PEL has been exceeded, the employer must contain the area using impermeable dropcloths and plastic barriers or their equivalent, or must isolate the operation using a contro l system listed in and in compliance with subsection (7) of this section. (d) Employees performing Class III jobs, which involve the disturbance of thermal system insulation or surfacing material, or where the employer does not produce a \"negative exposure ass essment\" or where monitoring results show a PEL has been exceeded, must wear respirators which are selected, used and fitted according to provisions of WAC 296 -62-07715. (12) Class IV asbestos work . Class IV asbestos jobs must be conducted by employees trained according to the asbestos awareness training program set out in WAC 296 -62-07722. In addition, all Class IV jobs must be conducted in conformity with the requirements set out in this section, mandating wet methods, HEPA vacuums, and prompt cleanup of deb ris containing ACM and PACM. (a) Employees cleaning up debris and waste in a regulated area where respirators are required must wear respirators which are selected, used and fitted according to provisions of WAC 296 -62-07715. (b) Employers of employees who clean u p waste and debris in, and employers in control of, areas where friable thermal system insulation or surfacing material is accessible, must assume that such waste and debris contain asbestos. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 22 (13) Alternative methods of compliance for installation, removal, repair, and maintenance of certain roofing and pipeline coating materials. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an employer who complies with all provisions of subsection (10)(a) and (b) of this section when installing, removing, repairing , or maintaining intact pipeline asphaltic wrap, or roof flashings which contain asbestos fibers encapsulated or coated by bituminous or resinous compounds will be deemed to be in compliance with this section. If an employer does not comply with all provi sions of this subsection (13), or if during the course of the job the material does not remain intact, the provisions of subsection (10) of this section apply instead of this subsection (13). (a) Before work begins and as needed during the job, a competent per son who is capable of identifying asbestos hazards in the workplace and selecting the appropriate control strategy for asbestos exposure, and who has the authority to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate such hazards, must conduct an inspection of the worksite and determine that the roofing material is intact and will likely remain intact. (b) All employees performing work covered by this subsection (13) must be trained in a training program that meets the requirements of WAC 296 -62-07722. (c) The material must not be sanded, abraded, or ground. When manual methods are used, materials must stay intact. (d) Material that has been removed from a roof must not be dropped or thrown to the ground. Unless the material is carried or passed to the ground by hand, it m ust be lowered to the ground via covered, dust -tight chute, crane or hoist. All such material must be removed from the roof as soon as is practicable, but in any event no later than the end of the work shift. (e) Where roofing products which have been labeled as containing asbestos pursuant to WAC 296 -62-07721, installed on nonresidential roofs during operations covered by this subsection (13), the employer must notify the building owner of the presence and location of such materials no later than the end of t he job. (f) All removal or disturbance of pipeline asphaltic wrap must be performed using wet methods. WAC 296 -62-07713 Methods of compliance for asbestos activities in general industry. (1) Engineering controls and work practices. (a) The employer must institute eng ineering controls and work practices to reduce and maintain employee exposure to or below the permissible exposure limits prescribed in WAC 296 -62-07705, except to the extent that such controls are not feasible. Engineering controls and work practices inc lude but are not limited to the following: Local exhaust ventilation equipped with HEPA filter dust collection systems; Vacuum cleaners equipped with HEPA filters; Enclosure or isolation of processes producing asbestos dust; Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 23 Use of wet methods, wetting a gents, or removal encapsulants to control employee exposures during asbestos handling, mixing, removal, cutting, application, and cleanup; Prompt disposal of wastes contaminated with asbestos in leak -tight containers; or Use of work practices or other engi neering controls that the director can show to be feasible. (b) Wherever the feasible engineering controls and work practices that can be instituted are not sufficient to reduce employee exposure to or below the permissible exposure limits prescribed in WAC 29 6-62-07705, the employer must use them to reduce employee exposure to the lowest levels achievable by these controls and must supplement them by the use of respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of WAC 296 -62-07715. (c) For the following op erations, wherever feasible engineering controls and work practices that can be instituted are not sufficient to reduce the employee exposure to or below the permissible exposure limits prescribed in WAC 296 -62-07705, the employer must use them to reduce e mployee exposure to or below 0.5 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (as an eight -hour time -weighted average) or 2.5 fibers per cubic centimeter of air for 30 minutes (short -term exposure), and must supplement them by the use of any combination of respirator y protection that complies with the requirements of WAC 296 -62-07715, work practices and feasible engineering controls that will reduce employee exposure to or below the permissible exposure limits prescribed in WAC 296 -62-07705: Coupling cutoff in primar y asbestos cement pipe manufacturing; sanding in primary and secondary asbestos cement sheet manufacturing; grinding in primary and secondary friction product manufacturing; carding and spinning in dry textile processes; and grinding and sanding in primary plastics manufacturing. (d) Local exhaust ventilation. Local exhaust HEPA ventilation and dust collection systems must be designed, constructed, installed, and maintained in accordance with good practices such as those found in the American National Standard Fundamentals Governing the Design and Operation of Local Exhaust Systems, ANSI Z9.2 -1979. (e) Particular tools. All hand -operated and power -operated tools which would produce or release fibers of asbestos so as to expose employees to levels in excess of the exposure limits prescribed in WAC 296 -62-07705, such as, but not limited to, saws, scorers, abrasive wheels, and drills, must be provided with local exhaust ventilation systems which comply with (d) of this subsection. High -speed abrasive disc saws that a re not equipped with appropriate engineering controls must not be used for work related to asbestos. (f) Wet methods. Asbestos must be handled, mixed, applied, removed, cut, scored, or otherwise worked in a wet saturated state to prevent the emission of airbo rne fibers unless the usefulness of the product would be diminished thereby. (g) Particular products and operations. When asbestos cement, mortar, coating, grout, plaster, or similar material containing asbestos is removed from bags, cartons, or other contain ers in which they are shipped, it must be either wetted, enclosed, or ventilated so as to prevent effectively the release of airborne fibers of asbestos. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 24 (h) Compressed air. Compressed air must not be used to remove asbestos or materials containing asbestos u nless the compressed air is used in conjunction with an enclosed ventilation system designed to effectively capture the dust cloud created by the compressed air. (2) Compliance program . (a) Where either the time weighted average and/or excursion limit is exceeded, the employer must establish and implement a written program to reduce employee exposure to or below the permissible exposure limits by means of engineering and work practice controls as required by subsection (1) of this section, and by the use of respira tory protection where required or permitted under this section. (b) Such programs must be reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect significant changes in the status of the employer's compliance program. (c) Written programs must be submitted upon request for e xamination and copying to the director, affected employees and designated employee representatives. (d) The employer must not use employee rotation as a means of compliance with the permissible exposure limits specified in WAC 296 -62-07705. (3) Specific compliance methods for brake and clutch repair : (a) Engineering controls and work practices for brake and clutch repair and service. During automotive brake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair and assembly operations, the employer must institute engineering cont rols and work practices to reduce employee exposure to materials containing asbestos using a negative pressure enclosure/HEPA vacuum system method or low pressure/wet cleaning method which meets the detailed requirements in WAC 296 -62-07745, Appendix F. T he employer may also comply using an equivalent method which follows written procedures which the employer demonstrates can achieve results equivalent to Method (1) Negative pressure enclosure/HEPA vacuum system method in WAC 296 -62-07745, Appendix F. For facilities in which no more than 5 pair of brakes or 5 clutches are inspected, disassembled, repaired, or assembled per week, (4) Wet method in WAC 296 -62- 07745, Appendix F may be used instead of Method (1). (b) The employer may also comply by using an equiva lent method which follows written procedures, which the employer demonstrates can achieve equivalent exposure reductions as do the two \"preferred methods.\" Such demonstration must include monitoring data conducted under workplace conditions closely resemb ling the process, type of asbestos containing materials, control method, work practices and environmental conditions which the equivalent method will be used, or objective data, which document that under all reasonably foreseeable conditions of brake and clutch repair applications, the method results in exposure which are equivalent to the methods in WAC 296 -62-07745, Appendix F.

WAC 296 -62-07721 Communication of hazards. (1) Communication of hazards to employees . (a) Introduction. This secti on applies to the communication of information concerning asbestos hazards in general industry to facilitate compliance with this standard. Asbestos exposure in general industry occurs in a wide variety of industrial and commercial settings. Employees wh o manufacture asbestos -containing products may be exposed to asbestos fibers. Employees who repair and replace automotive brakes and clutches may be exposed to asbestos fibers. In addition, employees engaged in housekeeping activities in industrial facil ities with asbestos product manufacturing operations, and in public and commercial buildings with installed asbestos -containing materials may be exposed to asbestos fibers. It should be noted that employees who perform housekeeping activities during and a fter construction activities are covered by asbestos construction work requirements in WAC 296 -62-077. Housekeeping employees, regardless of industry designation, should know whether building components they maintain may expose them to asbestos. The same hazard communication provisions will protect employees who perform housekeeping operations in all three asbestos standards; general industry, construction, and shipyard employment. Building owners are often the only and/or best source of information conc erning the presence of previously installed asbestos -containing building materials. Therefore they, along with employers of potentially exposed employees, are assigned specific information conveying and retention duties under this section. Chemical manufa cturers, importers, distributors and employers must comply with all requirements of the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS), WAC 296-901-140 for asbestos. In clas sifying the hazards of asbestos at least the following hazards are to be addressed: Cancer and lung effects. Employers must include asbestos in the hazard communication program established to comply with the HCS, WAC 296-901-140. Employers must ensure that each employee has access to labels on containers of asbestos and to safety data sheets, and is trained in accordance with the requirements of HCS and WAC 296 -62-07722. (b) Installed asbestos -containing material. Employers and building owners are required to treat installed TSI and sprayed -on and troweled -on surfacing materials as ACM for the purposes of this standard. These materials are designated \"presumed ACM o r PACM,\" and are defined in WAC 296 -62-07703. Asphalt and vinyl flooring installed no later than 1980 also must be treated as asbestos -containing. The employer or building owner may demonstrate that PACM and flooring materials do not contain asbestos by WAC -62-07712 (10)(a)(ix). Chapter 296 -62 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 33 (c) Duties of employers and building and facility owners. Building and facility owners must determine the presence, location, and quantity of ACM and/or PACM at the worksite. Employers and building and facility own ers must exercise due diligence in complying with these requirements to inform employers and employees about the presence and location of ACM and PACM. Before authorizing or allowing any construction, renovation, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or demolit ion project, an owner or owner's agent must perform, or cause to be performed, a good faith inspection to determine whether materials to be worked on or removed contain asbestos. The inspection must be documented by a written report maintained on file and made available upon request to the director. (A) The good faith inspection must be conducted by an accredited inspector. (B) Such good faith inspection is not required if the owner or owner's agent is reasonably certain that asbestos will not be disturbed by the project or the owner or owner's agent assumes that the suspect material contains asbestos and handles the material in accordance with WAC 296 -62-07701 through 296 -62-07753. The owner or owner's agent must provide, to all contractors submitting a bid to undertake any construction, renovation, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or demolition project, the written statement either of the reasonable certainty of nondisturbance of asbestos or of assumption of the presence of asbestos. Contractors must be provided with the written report before they apply or bid to work. Any owner or owner's agent who fails to comply with (c)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection must be subject to a mandatory fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars for each violation. Each day the violation continues must be considered a separate violation. In addition, any construction, renovation, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or demolition which was started without meeting the requirements of this section must be halted immediately and ca nnot be resumed before meeting such requirements. Building and facility owners must inform employers of employees, and employers must inform employees who will perform housekeeping activities in areas which contain ACM and/or PACM of the presence and locat ion of ACM and/or PACM in such areas which may be contacted during such activities. Upon written or oral request, building or facility owners must make a copy of the written report required in this section available to the department of labor and industrie s and the collective bargaining representatives or employee representatives of any employee who may be exposed to any asbestos or asbestos -containing materials. A copy of the written report must be posted conspicuously at the location where employees repo rt to work. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 34 Building and facility owners must maintain records of all information required to be provided according to this section and/or otherwise known to the building owner concerning the presence, location and quantity of ACM and PACM in the buildin g/facility. Such records must be kept for the duration of ownership and must be transferred to successive owners. (2) Communication of hazards to employees . Requirements for construction and shipyard employment activities. (a) Introduction. This section applies to the communication of information concerning asbestos hazards in construction and shipyard employment activities. Most asbestos - related construction and shipyard activities involve previously installed building materials. Building/vessel owners often are the only and/or best sources of information concerning them. Therefore, they, along with employers of potentially exposed employees, are assigned specific information conveying and retention duties under this section. Installed Asbestos Containing Bu ilding/Vessel Material: Employers and building/vessel owners must identify TSI and sprayed or troweled on surfacing materials as asbestos -containing unless the employer, by complying with WAC 296 -62-07721(3) determines it is not asbestos containing. Asph alt or vinyl flooring/decking material installed in buildings or vessels no later than 1980 must also be considered as asbestos containing unless the employer/owner, according to WAC 296 -62-07712 (10)(a)(ix) determines it is not asbestos containing. If th e employer or building/vessel owner has actual knowledge or should have known, through the exercise of due diligence, that materials other than TSI and sprayed -on or troweled -on surfacing materials are asbestos containing, they must be treated as such. When communicating information to employees according to this standard, owners and employers must identify \"PACM\" as ACM. Additional requirements relating to communication of asbestos work on multi -employer worksites are set out in WAC 296-62-07706. (b) Duties of building/vessel and facility owners. Before work subject to this section is begun, building/vessel and facility owners must identify the presence, location and quantity of ACM, and/or PACM at the work site. All thermal system insulation and sprayed on or troweled on surfacing materials in buildings/vessels or substrates constructed no later than 1980 must be identified as PACM. In addition, resilient flooring/decking material installed no later than 1980 must also be identified as asbestos containing. Before authorizing or allowing any construction, renovation, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or demolition project, a building/vessel and facility owner or owner's agent must perform, or cause to be performed, a good faith inspection to determine whether materials to be worked on or removed contain asbestos. The inspection must be documented by a written report maintained on file and made available upon request to the director. (A) The good faith inspection must be conducted by an accredited inspector. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 35 (B) Such good faith inspection is not required if the building/vessel and facility owner or owner's agent assumes that the suspect material contains asbestos and handles the material in accordance with WAC 296 -62-07701 through 296 -62-07753 or if the owner or the o wner's agent is reasonably certain that asbestos will not be disturbed by the project. The building/vessel and facility owner or owner's agent must provide, to all contractors submitting a bid to undertake any construction, renovation, remodeling, maintena nce, repair, or demolition project, the written statement either of the reasonable certainty of nondisturbance of asbestos or of assumption of the presence of asbestos. Contractors must be provided the written report before they apply or bid on work. Any building/vessel and facility owner or owners agent who fails to comply with WAC 296 -62-07721 (2)(b)(ii) and (iii) must be subject to a mandatory fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars for each violation. Each day the violation continues must be c onsidered a separate violation. In addition, any construction, renovation, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or demolition which was started without meeting the requirements of this section must be halted immediately and cannot be resumed before meeting su ch requirements. Upon written or oral request, building/vessel and facility owner or owner's agent must make a copy of the written report required in this section available to the department of labor and industries and the collective bargaining representat ives or employee representatives of any employee who may be exposed to any asbestos or asbestos -containing materials. A copy of the written report must be posted conspicuously at the location where employees report to work. Building/vessel and facility ow ner or owner's agent must notify in writing the following persons of the presence, location and quantity of ACM or PACM, at work sites in their buildings/facilities/vessels. (A) Prospective employers applying or bidding for work whose employees reasonably can be expected to work in or adjacent to areas containing such material; (B) Employees of the owner who will work in or adjacent to areas containing such material; (C) On multi -employer worksites, all employers of employees who will be performing work within or adjac ent to areas containing such materials; (D) Tenants who will occupy areas containing such materials. (c) Duties of employers whose employees perform work subject to this standard in or adjacent to areas containing ACM and PACM. Building/vessel and facility owner or owner's agents whose employees perform such work must comply with these provisions to the extent applicable. Before work subject to this standard is begun, building/vessel and facility owner or owner's agents must determine the presence, location, and q uantity of ACM and/or PACM at the work Chapter 296 -62 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 36 Before work under this standard is performed employers of employees who will perform such work must inform the following persons of the location and quantity of ACM and/or PACM present at the work site and the precautions to be taken to insure that airborne asbestos is confined to the area. (A) Owners of the building/vessel or facility; (B) Employees who will perform such work and employers of employees who work and/or will be worki ng in adjacent areas; Upon written or oral request, a copy of the written report required in this section must be made available to the department of labor and industries and the collective bargaining representatives or employee representatives of any empl oyee who may be exposed to any asbestos or asbestos -containing materials. A copy of the written report must be posted conspicuously at the location where employees report to work. Within 10 days of the completion of such work, the employer whose employees have performed work subject to this standard, must inform the building/vessel or facility owner and employers of employees who will be working in the area of the current location and quantity of PACM and/or ACM remaining in the former regulated area and f inal monitoring results, if any. (d) In addition to the above requirements, all employers who discover ACM and/or PACM on a work site must convey information concerning the presence, location and quantity of such newly discovered ACM and/or PACM to the owner a nd to other employers of employees working at the work site, within 24 hours of the discovery. (e) No contractor may commence any construction, renovation, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or demolition project without receiving a copy of the written response or statement required by WAC 296 -62-07721 (2)(b). Any contractor who begins any project without the copy of the written report or statement will be subject to a mandatory fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars per day. Each day the violation con tinues will be considered a separate violation. (3) Criteria to rebut the designation of installed material as PACM . (a) At any time, an employer and/or building/vessel owner may demonstrate, for purposes of this standard, that PACM does not contain asbestos. Bui lding/vessel owners and/or employers are not required to communicate information about the presence of building material for which such a demonstration according to the requirements of (b) of this subsection has been made. However, in all such cases, the information, data and analysis supporting the determination that PACM does not contain asbestos, must be retained according to WAC 296 -62-07727. (b) An employer or owner may demonstrate that PACM does not contain asbestos by the following: Having a completed i nspection conducted according to the requirements of AHERA (40 CFR Part 763, Subpart E) which demonstrates that the material is not ACM; Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 37 Performing tests of the material containing PACM which demonstrate that no asbestos is present in the material.

Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part -1 General Antho phyllite, -62-07733 Appendices. (1) Appendices A, D, E, and F to this part are incorporated as part of this section and the contents of these appendices are mandatory. (2) Appendices B, G, H, I, J and K to this part are informational a nd are not intended to create any additional obligations not otherwise imposed or to detract from any existing obligations. WAC 296 -62-07735 Appendix A --WISHA reference method --Mandatory. This mandatory appendix specifies the procedure for analyzing air s amples for asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite and specifies quality control procedures that must be implemented by laboratories performing the analysis. The sampling and analytical methods described below represent the elements of the avai lable monitoring methods (such as Appendix B to this section, the most current version of the WISHA method ID -60, or the most current version of the NIOSH 7400 method) which WISHA considers to be essential to achieve adequate employee exposure monitoring w hile allowing employers to use methods that are already established within their organizations. All employers who are required to conduct air monitoring under WAC 296 -62-07709 are required to utilize analytical laboratories that use this procedure, or an equivalent method, for collecting and analyzing samples. (1) Sampling and analytical procedure . (a) The sampling medium for air samples must be mixed cellulose ester filter membranes. These must be designated by the manufacturer as suitable for asbestos, tremolit e, anthophyllite, and actinolite counting. See below for rejection of blanks. (b) The preferred collection device is the 25 -mm diameter cassette with an open -faced 50-mm electrically conductive extension cowl. The 37 -mm cassette may be used if necessary but only if written justification for the need to use the 37 -mm filter cassette accompanies the sample results in the employee's exposure monitoring record. Do not reuse or reload cassettes for asbestos sample collection. (c) An air flow rate between 0.5 liter/mi n and 4.0 liters/min must be selected for the 25 - mm cassette. If the 37 -mm cassette is used, an air flow rate between 1 liter/min and 4.0 liters/min must be selected. (d) Where possible, a sufficient air volume for each air sample must be collected to yield between one hundred and one thousand three hundred fibers per square millimeter on the membrane filter. If a filter darkens in appearance or if loose dust is seen on the filter, a second sample must be started. (e) Ship the samples in a rigid container with su fficient packing material to prevent dislodging the collected fibers. Packing material that has a high electrostatic charge on its surface (e.g., expanded polystyrene) cannot be used because such material can cause loss of fibers to the sides of the casse tte. (f) Calibrate each personal sampling pump before and after use with a representative filter cassette installed between the pump and the calibration devices. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 51 (g) Personal samples must be taken in the \"breathing zone\" of the employee (i.e., attached to or nea r the collar or lapel near the worker's face). (h) Fiber counts must be made by positive phase contrast using a microscope with an 8 to 10 X eyepiece and a 40 to 45 X objective for a total magnification of approximately 400 X and a numerical aperture of 0.65 t o 0.75. The microscope must also be fitted with a green or blue filter. (i) The microscope must be fitted with a Walton -Beckett eyepiece graticule calibrated for a field diameter of one hundred micrometers (+/ -2 micrometers). (j) The phase -shift detection limit o f the microscope must be about 3 degrees measured using the HSE phase shift test slide as outlined below. Place the test slide on the microscope stage and center it under the phase objective. Bring the blocks of grooved lines into focus. Note : The slide co nsists of seven sets of grooved lines (ca. 20 grooves to each block) in descending order of visibility from sets one to seven, seven being the least visible. The requirements for asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite counting are that the mic roscope optics must resolve the grooved lines in set three completely, although they may appear somewhat faint, and that the grooved lines in sets six and seven must be invisible. Sets four and five must be at least partially visible but may vary slightly in visibility between microscopes. A microscope that fails to meet these requirements has either too low or too high a resolution to be used for asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite counting. If the image deteriorates, clean and adjust the microscope optics. If the problem persists, consult the microscope manufacturer. (k) Each set of samples taken will include ten percent blanks or a minimum of two blanks. These blanks must come from the same lot as the filters used for sample collection. T he field blank results must be averaged and subtracted from the analytical results before reporting. Any samples represented by a blank having a fiber count in excess of the detection limit of the method being used must be rejected. (l) The samples must be mo unted by the acetone/triacetin method or a method with an equivalent index of refraction and similar clarity. (m) Observe the following counting rules. Count only fibers equal to or longer than five micrometers. Measure the length of curved fibers along the c urve. Count all particles as asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite that have a length -to-width ratio (aspect ratio) of three to one or greater. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 52 Fibers lying entirely within the boundary of the Walton -Beckett graticule field must receive a co unt of one. Fibers crossing the boundary once, having one end within the circle, must receive the count of one -half. Do not count any fiber that crosses the graticule boundary more than once. Reject and do not count any other fibers even though they may be visible outside the graticule area. Count bundles of fibers as one fiber unless individual fibers can be identified by observing both ends of an individual fiber. Count enough graticule fields to yield 100 fibers. Count a minimum of 20 fields; stop co unting at 100 fields regardless of fiber count. (n) Blind recounts must be conducted at the rate of ten percent. (2) Quality control procedures . (a) Intralaboratory program. Each laboratory and/or each company with more than one microscopist counting slides must esta blish a statistically designed quality assurance program involving blind recounts and comparisons between microscopists to monitor the variability of counting by each microscopist and between microscopists. In a company with more than one laboratory, the program must include all laboratories and must also evaluate the laboratory -to-laboratory variability. (b) Interlaboratory program. Each laboratory analyzing asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite samples for compliance determination must implement an interlaboratory quality assurance program that as a minimum includes participation of at least two other independent laboratories. Each laboratory must participate in round robin testing at least once every six months with at least all the other labor atories in its interlaboratory quality assurance group. Each laboratory must submit slides typical of its own work load for use in this program. The round robin must be designed and results analyzed using appropriate statistical methodology.

Introduction. This method describes the collection of airborne asbestos fibers using calibrated sampling pumps with mixed -cellulose ester (MCE) filters and analysis by phase contrast microscopy (PCM). Some terms used are unique t o this method and are defined below: Asbestos : A term for naturally occurring fibrous minerals. Asbestos includes chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite (cummingtonite -grunerite asbestos), tremolite asbestos, actinolite asbestos, anthophyllite asbestos, and an y of these minerals that have been chemically treated and/or altered. The precise chemical formulation of each species will vary with the location from which it was mined. Nominal compositions are listed: Chrysotile Mg3Si2O5(OH) 4 2 Asbestos Fiber : A fiber of asbestos which meets the criteria specified below for a fiber. Aspect Ratio : The ratio of the length of a fiber to it is diameter (e.g. 3:1, 5:1 aspect ratios). Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 54 Cleavage Fragments : Mineral particles formed by comminution of minerals, especially those characterized by parallel sides and a moderate aspect ratio (usually less than 20:1). Detection Limit: The number of fibers necessary to be 95% certain that the result is greater than zero. Differential Counting : The term applied to the practice of excluding certain kinds of fibers from the fiber count because they do not appear to be asbestos. Fiber : A par ticle that is 5 \u00b5m or longer, with a length -to-width ratio of 3 to 1 or longer. Field : The area within the graticule circle that is superimposed on the microscope image. Set: The samples which are taken, submitted to the laboratory, analyzed, and for whi ch, interim or final result reports are generated. Tremolite, Anthophyllite, and Actinolite : The non -asbestos form of these minerals which meet the definition of a fiber. It includes any of these minerals that have been chemically treated and/or altered. Walton -Beckett Graticule : An eyepiece graticule specifically designed for asbestos fiber counting. It consists of a circle with a projected diameter of 100 \u00b12 \u00b5m (area of about 0.00785 mm2) with a crosshair having tic -marks at 3 -\u00b5m intervals in one dire ction and 5 -\u00b5m in the orthogonal direction. There are marks around the periphery of the circle to demonstrate the proper sizes and shapes of fibers. The disk is placed in one of the microscope eyepieces so that the design is superimposed on the field of view. 1. History. (a) Early surveys to determine asbestos exposures were conducted using impinger counts of total dust with the counts expressed as million particles per cubic foot. The British Asbestos Research Council recommended filter membrane counting in 1969. In July 1969, the Bureau of Occupational Safety and Health published a filter membrane method for counting asbestos fibers in the United States. This method was refined by NIOSH and published as P & CAM 239. On May 29, 1971, OSHA specified filter membrane sampling with phase contrast counting for evaluation of asbestos exposures at work sites in the United States. The use of this technique was again required by OSHA in 1986. Phase contrast microscopy has continued to be the method of choice for the measurement of occupational exposure to asbestos. (b) Principle. Air is drawn through a MCE filter to capture airborne asbestos fibers. A wedge shaped portion of the filter is removed, placed on a glass microscope slide and made transparent. A measured area (field) is viewed by PCM. All the fibers meeting a defined criteria for asbestos are counted and considered a measure of the airborne asbestos concentration. (c) Advantages and Disadvantages There are four main advantages of PCM over other methods: (A) The t echnique is specific for fibers. Phase contrast is a fiber counting technique which excludes non -fibrous particles from the analysis. (B) The technique is inexpensive and does not require specialized knowledge to carry out the analysis for total fiber counts. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 55 (C) The analysis is quick and can be performed on -site for rapid determination of air concentrations of asbestos fibers. (D) The technique has continuity with historical epidemiological studies so that estimates of expected disease can be inferred from long -term determinations of asbestos exposures. The main disadvantage of PCM is that it does not positively identify asbestos fibers. Other fibers which are not asbestos may be included in the count unless differential counting is performed. This requires a grea t deal of experience to adequately differentiate asbestos from non -asbestos fibers. Positive identification of asbestos must be performed by polarized light or electron microscopy techniques. A further disadvantage of PCM is that the smallest visible fibe rs are about 0.2 \u00b5m in diameter while the finest asbestos fibers may be as small as 0.02 \u00b5m in diameter. For some exposures, substantially more fibers may be present than are actually counted. (d) Workplace Exposure. Asbestos is used by the construction indu stry in such products as shingles, floor tiles, asbestos cement, roofing felts, insulation and acoustical products. Non -construction uses include brakes, clutch facings, paper, paints, plastics, and fabrics. One of the most significant exposures in the w orkplace is the removal and encapsulation of asbestos in schools, public buildings, and homes. Many workers have the potential to be exposed to asbestos during these operations. About 95% of the asbestos in commercial use in the United States is chrysoti le. Crocidolite and amosite make up most of the remainder. Anthophyllite and tremolite or actinolite are likely to be encountered as contaminants in various industrial products. (e) Physical Properties. Asbestos fiber possesses a high tensile strength along its axis, is chemically inert, non -combustible, and heat resistant. It has a high electrical resistance and good sound absorbing properties. It can be weaved into cables, fabrics or other textiles, and also matted into asbestos papers, felts, or mats. 2. Range and Detection Limit . (a) The ideal counting range on the filter is 100 to 1,300 fibers/mm2. With a Walton - Beckett graticule this range is equivalent to 0.8 to 10 fibers/field. Using NIOSH counting statistics, a count of 0.8 fibers/field would give an approximate coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.13. (b) The detection limit for this method is 4.0 fibers per 100 fields or 5.5 fibers/mm2. This was determined using an equation to estimate the maximum CV possible at a specific concentration (95% confidence) and a Lower Control Limit of zero. The CV value was then used to determine a corresponding concentration from historical CV vs fiber relationships. As an example: Lower Control Limit (95% Confidence) = AC -1.645(CV)(AC) Where: AC = Estimate of the airborn e fiber concentration (fibers/cc) Setting the Lower Control Limit = 0 and solving for CV: Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part 0 = AC-1.645(CV)(AC) CV = 0.61 This value was compared with CV vs. count curves. The count at which CV = 0.61 for Leidel -Busch counting statistics 8(i) or for an O SHA Salt Lake Technical Center (OSHA - SLTC) CV curve (see Appendix A for further information) was 4.4 fibers or 3.9 fibers per 100 fields, respectively. Although a lower detection limit of 4 fibers per 100 fields is supported by the OSHA -SLTC data, both da ta sets support the 4.5 fibers per 100 fields value. 3. Method Performance --Precision and Accuracy . Precision is dependent upon the total number of fibers counted and the uniformity of the fiber distribution on the filter. A general rule is to count at l east 20 and not more than 100 fields. The count is discontinued when 100 fibers are counted, provided that 20 fields have already been counted. Counting more than 100 fibers results in only a small gain in precision. As the total count drops below 10 fi bers, an accelerated loss of precision is noted. At this time, there is no known method to determine the absolute accuracy of the asbestos analysis. Results of samples prepared through the Proficiency Analytical Testing (PAT) Program and analyzed by the OSHA -SLTC showed no significant bias when compared to PAT reference values. The PAT samples were analyzed from 1987 to 1989 (N = 36) and the concentration range was from 120 to 1,300 fibers/mm2. 4. Interferences . Fibrous substances, if present, may inter fere with asbestos analysis. Some common fibers are: Fiber glass Perlite veins. Anhydrite plant fibers gypsum Some synthetic fibers. Membrane structures Sponge spicules and diatoms. Microorganisms Wollastonite. The use of electron microscopy or optic al tests such as polarized light, and dispersion staining may be used to differentiate these materials from asbestos when necessary. 5. Sampling . (a) Equipment. Sample assembly. Conductive filter holder consisting of a 25 -mm diameter, 3 - piece cassette having a 50-mm long electrically conductive extension cowl. Backup pad, 25 -mm, cellulose. Membrane filter, mixed -cellulose ester (MCE), 25-mm, plain, white, 0.8 size. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 57 Notes : (A) DO NOT RE -USE CASSETTES. (B) Fully conductive cassettes are requi red to reduce fiber loss to the sides of the cassette due to electrostatic attraction. (C) Purchase filters which have been selected by the manufacturer for asbestos counting or analyze representative filters for fiber background before use. Discard the f ilter lot if more than 5 fibers/100 fields are found. (D) To decrease the possibility of contamination, the sampling system (filter -backup pad -cassette) for asbestos is usually preassembled by the manufacturer. Gel bands for sealing cassettes. Sampling pu mp. Each pump must be a battery operated, self -contained unit small enough to be placed on the monitored employee and not interfere with the work being performed. The pump must be capable of sampling at 2.5 liters per minute (L/min) for the required samp ling time. Flexible tubing, 6 -mm bore. Pump calibration. Stopwatch and bubble tube/burette or electronic meter. (b) Sampling Procedure. Seal the point where the base and cowl of each cassette meet with a gel band or tape. Charge the pumps completely before be ginning. Connect each pump to a calibration cassette with an appropriate length of 6 -mm bore plastic tubing. Do not use luer connectors --the type of cassette specified above has built -in adapters. Select an appropriate flow rate for the situation being mo nitored. The sampling flow rate must be between 0.5 and 4.0 L/min for personal sampling and is commonly set between 1 and 2 L/min. Always choose a flow rate that will not produce overloaded filters. Calibrate each sampling pump before and after sampling with a calibration cassette in -line (Note: This calibration cassette should be from the same lot of cassettes used for sampling). Use a primary standard (e.g. bubble burette) to calibrate each pump. If possible, calibrate at the sampling site. Note : If sampling site calibration is not possible, environmental influences may affect the flow rate. The extent is dependent on the type of pump used. Consult with the pump manufacturer to determine dependence on environmental influences. If the pump is affect ed by temperature and pressure changes, use the formula in subsection (10) of this section to calculate the actual flow rate. Connect each pump to the base of each sampling cassette with flexible tubing. Remove the end cap of each cassette and take each a ir sample open face. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 58 Ensure that each sample cassette is held open side down in the employee's breathing zone during sampling. The distance from the nose/mouth of the employee to the cassette should be about 10 cm. Secure the cassette on the collar or l apel of the employee using spring clips or other similar devices. A suggested minimum air volume when sampling to determine TWA compliance is 25 L. For Excursion Limit (30 min sampling time) evaluations, a minimum air volume of 48 L is recommended. The mo st significant problem when sampling for asbestos is overloading the filter with non -asbestos dust. Suggested maximum air sample volumes for specific environments are: Environment Air Vol. (L) Asbestos removal operations (visible dust) 100 Asbestos remo val operations (little dust) 240 Office environments 400 to 2,400 Caution : Do not overload the filter with dust. High levels of non -fibrous dust particles may obscure fibers on the filter and lower the count or make counting impossible. If more than a bout 25 to 30% of the field area is obscured with dust, the result may be biased low. Smaller air volumes may be necessary when there is excessive non -asbestos dust in the air. While sampling, observe the filter with a small flashlight. If there is a visible layer of dust on the filter, stop sampling, remove and seal the cassette, and replace with a new sampling assembly. The total dust loading should not exceed 1 mg. Blank samples are used to determine if any contamination has occurred during sample h andling. Prepare two blanks for the first 1 to 20 samples. For sets containing greater than 20 samples, prepare blanks as 10% of the samples. Handle blank samples in the same manner as air samples with one exception: Do not draw any air through the bla nk samples. Open the blank cassette in the place where the sample cassettes are mounted on the employee. Hold it open for about 30 seconds. Close and seal the cassette appropriately. Store blanks for shipment with the sample cassettes. Immediately afte r sampling, close and seal each cassette with the base and plastic plugs. Do not touch or puncture the filter membrane as this will invalidate the analysis. Attach a seal (OSHA -21 or equivalent) around each cassette in such a way as to secure the end cap plug and base plug. Tape the ends of the seal together since the seal is not long enough to be wrapped end -to-end. Also wrap tape around the cassette at each joint to keep the seal secure. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 59 (c) Sample Shipment. Send the samples to the laboratory with paperw ork requesting asbestos analysis. List any known fibrous interferences present during sampling on the paperwork. Also, note the workplace operation(s) sampled. Secure and handle the samples in such that they will not rattle during shipment nor be exposed to static electricity. Do not ship samples in expanded polystyrene peanuts, vermiculite, paper shreds, or excelsior. Tape sample cassettes to sheet bubbles and place in a container that will cushion the samples without rattling. To avoid the possibility of sample contamination, always ship bulk samples in separate mailing containers. 6. Analysis. (a) Safety Precautions. Acetone is extremely flammable and precautions must be taken not to ignite it. Avoid using large containers or quantities of acetone. Tran sfer the solvent in a ventilated laboratory hood. Do not use acetone near any open flame. For generation of acetone vapor, use a spark free heat source. Any asbestos spills should be cleaned up immediately to prevent dispersal of fibers. Prudence should be exercised to avoid contamination of laboratory facilities or exposure of personnel to asbestos. Asbestos spills should be cleaned up with wet methods and/or a High Efficiency Particulate -Air (HEPA) filtered vacuum. Caution : Do not use a vacuum without a HEPA filter --It will disperse fine asbestos fibers in the air. (b) Equipment. Phase contrast microscope with binocular or trinocular head. Widefield must be a focusing eyepiece. Use a 40X phase objective with a numerical aperture of 0.65 to 0.75). Kohler illumination (if possible) with green or blue filter. Walton -Beckett Graticule, type G -22 with 100 \u00b12 \u00b5m projected diameter. Mechanical stage. A rotating mechanical stage is convenie nt for use with polarized light. Phase telescope. Stage micrometer with 0.01 -mm subdivisions. Phase -shift test slide, mark II (Available from PTR optics Ltd., and also McCrone). Precleaned glass slides, 25 mm X 75 mm. One end can be frosted for convenienc e in writing sample numbers, etc., or paste -on labels can be used. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ #1 -1/2. Scalpel (#10, curved blade). Fine tipped forceps. Aluminum block for clearing filter. Automatic adjustable pipette, 100 - to 500 -\u00b5L. Micropipette, (glycerol triacetate). Lacquer or nail polish. (d) Standard Preparation. A way to prepare standard asbestos samples of known concentration has not been developed. It is possible to prepare replicate samples of nearly equal concentr ation. This has been performed through the PAT program. These asbestos samples are distributed by the AIHA to participating laboratories. Since only about one -fourth of a 25 -mm sample membrane is required for an asbestos count, any PAT sample can serve as a \"standard\" for replicate counting. (e) Sample Mounting. Note : See Safety Precautions in (6)(a) before proceeding. The objective is to produce samples with a smooth (non -grainy) background in a medium with a refractive index of approximately 1.46. The te chnique below collapses the filter for easier focusing and produces permanent mounts which are useful for quality control and interlaboratory comparison. An aluminum block or similar device is required for sample preparation. Heat the aluminum block to a bout 70C. The hot block should not be used on any surface that can be damaged by either the heat or from exposure to acetone. Ensure that the glass slides and cover glasses are free of dust and fibers. Remove the top plug to prevent a vacuum when the cas sette is opened. Clean the outside of the cassette if necessary. Cut the seal and/or tape on the cassette with a razor blade. Very carefully separate the base from the extension cowl, leaving the filter and backup pad in the base. With a rocking motion cut a triangular wedge from the filter using the scalpel. This wedge should be one -sixth to one -fourth of the filter. Grasp the filter wedge with the forceps on the perimeter of the filter which was clamped between the cassette pieces. DO NOT TOUCH the filter with your finger. Place the filter on the glass slide sample side up. Static electricity will usually keep the filter on the slide until it is cleared. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 61 Place the tip of the micropipette containing about 200 \u00b5L acetone into the aluminum block. I nsert the glass slide into the receiving slot in the aluminum block. Inject the acetone into the block with slow, steady pressure on the plunger while holding the pipette firmly in place. Wait 3 to 5 seconds for the filter to clear, then remove the pipet te and slide from the aluminum block. Immediately (less than 30 seconds) place 2.5 to 3.5 \u00b5L of triacetin on the filter (Note: Waiting longer than 30 seconds will result in increased index of refraction and decreased contrast between the fibers and the pr eparation. This may also lead to separation of the cover slip from the slide). Lower a cover slip gently onto the filter at a slight angle to reduce the possibility of forming air bubbles. If more than 30 seconds have elapsed between acetone exposure and triacetin application, glue the edges of the cover slip to the slide with lacquer or nail polish. If clearing is slow, warm the slide for 15 min on a hot plate having a surface temperature of about 50 C to hasten clearing. The top of the hot block can be used if the slide is not heated too long. Counting may proceed immediately after clearing and mounting are completed. (f) Sample Analysis. Completely align the microscope according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, align the microscope using the fol lowing general alignment routine at the beginning of every counting session and more often if necessary. Alignment. (A) Clean all optical surfaces. Even a small amount of dirt can significantly degrade the image. (B) Rough focus the objective on a sample. (C) Close d own the field iris so that it is visible in the field of view. Focus the image of the iris with the condenser focus. Center the image of the iris in the field of view. (D) Install the phase telescope and focus on the phase rings. Critically center the rings . Misalignment of the rings results in astigmatism which will degrade the image. (E) Place the phase -shift test slide on the microscope stage and focus on the lines. The analyst must see line set 3 and should see at least parts of 4 and 5 but, not see line s et 6 or 6. A microscope/microscopist combination which does not pass this test may not be used. Counting Fibers. (A) Place the prepared sample slide on the mechanical stage of the microscope. Position the center of the wedge under the objective lens and focus upon the sample. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 62 (B) Start counting from one end of the wedge and progress along a radial line to the other end (count in either direction from perimeter to wedge tip). Select fields randomly, without looking into the eyepieces, by slightly advancing the slide in one direction with the mechanical stage control. (C) Continually scan over a range of focal planes (generally the upper 10 to 15 \u00b5m of the filter surface) with the fine focus control du ring each fieldcount. Spend at least 5 to 15 seconds per field. (D) Most samples will contain asbestos fibers with fiber diameters less than 1\u00b5. Look carefully for faint fiber images. The small diameter fibers will be very hard to see. However, they are an important contribution to the total count. (E) Count only fibers equa l to or longer than 5\u00b5. Measure the length of curved fibers along the curve. (F) Count fibers which have a length to width ratio of 3:1 or greater. (G) Count all the fibers in at least 20 fields. Continue counting until either 100 fibers are counted or 100 field s have been viewed; whichever occurs first. Count all the fibers in the final field. (H) Fibers lying entirely within the boundary of the Walton -Beckett graticule field receive a count of 1. Fibers crossing the boundary once, having one end within the circle receive a count of 1/2. Do not count any fiber that crosses the graticule boundary more than once. Reject and do not count any other fibers even though they may be visible outside the graticule area. If a fiber touches the circle, it is considered to c ross the line. (I) Count bundles of fibers as one fiber unless individual fibers can be clearly identified and each individual fiber is clearly not connected to another counted fiber. (J) Record the number of fibers in each field in a consistent way such that filter non -uniformity can be assessed. (K) Regularly check phase ring alignment. (L) When an agglomerate (mass of material) covers more than 25% of the field of view, reject the field and select another. Do not include it in the number of fields counted. (M) Perform a \"b lind recount\" of 1 in every 10 filter wedges (slides). Re -label the slides using a person other than the original counter. (g) Fiber Identification. As previously mentioned in (1)(c), PCM does not provide positive confirmation of asbestos fibers. Alternate differential counting techniques should be used if discrimination is desirable. Differential counting may include primary discrimination based on morphology, polarized light analysis of fibers, or modification of PCM data by Scanning Electron or Transmiss ion Electron Microscopy. A great deal of experience is required to routinely and correctly perform differential counting. It is discouraged unless it is legally necessary. Then, only if a fiber is obviously not asbestos should it be excluded from the co unt. Further discussion of this technique can be found in reference 8(j). If there is a question whether a fiber is asbestos or not, follow the rule: \" WHEN IN DOUBT, COUNT .\" Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 63 (h) Analytical Recommendations --Quality Control System. All individuals performing a sbestos analysis must have taken the NIOSH course for sampling and evaluating airborne asbestos or an equivalent course. Each laboratory engaged in asbestos counting must set up a slide trading arrangement with at least two other laboratories in order to c ompare performance and eliminate inbreeding of error. The slide exchange occurs at least semiannually. The round robin results must be posted where all analysts can view individual analyst's results. Each laboratory engaged in asbestos counting must part icipate in the Proficiency Analytical Testing Program, the Asbestos Analyst Registry or equivalent. Each analyst must select and count prepared slides from a \"slide bank\". These are quality assurance counts. The slide bank must be prepared using uniforml y distributed samples taken from the workload. Fiber densities should cover the entire range routinely analyzed by the laboratory. These slides are counted blind by all counters to establish an original standard deviation. This historical distribution i s compared with the quality assurance counts. A counter must have 95% of all quality control samples counted within three standard deviations of the historical mean. This count is then integrated into a new historical mean and standard deviation for the slide. The analyses done by the counters to establish the slide bank may be used for an interim quality control program if the data are treated in a proper statistical fashion. 7. Calculations . (a) Calculate the estimated airborne asbestos fiber concentration on the filter sample using the following formula: Where: AC = Airborne fiber concentration FB = Total number of fibers greater than 5 \u00b5m counted FL = Total number of fields counted on the filter BFB = Total number of fibers greater than 5\u00b5m counted in t he blank BFL = Total number of fields counted on the blank ECA = Effective collecting area of filter (385 mm2 nominal for a 25 -mm filter.) FR = Pump flow rate (L/min) MFA = Microscope count field area (mm2). This is 0.00785 mm2 for a Walton - XECAFL -62 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 64 Beckett Gra ticule. T = Sample collection time (min) 1,000 = Conversion of L to cc Note : The collection area of a filter is seldom equal to 385 mm2. It is appropriate for laboratories to routinely monitor the exact diameter using an inside micrometer. The collection area is calculated according to the formula: Area = (d/2) 2 (b) Short -cut Calculation Since a given analyst always has the same interpupillary distance, the number of fields per filter for a particular analyst will remain constan t for a given size filter. The field size for that analyst is constant (i.e. the analyst is using an assigned microscope and is not changing the reticle). For example, if the exposed area of the filter is always 385 mm2 and the size of the field is alway s 0.00785 mm2, the number of fields per filter will always be 49,000. In addition it is necessary to convert liters of air to cc. These three constants can then be combined such that ECA/(1,000 X MFA) = 49. The previous equation simplifies to: (c) Recount Calculations. As mentioned in step 13 of 6 (f)(ii), a \"blind recount\" of 10% of the slides is performed. In all cases, differences will be observed between the first and second counts of the same filter wedge. Most of these differences will be due to chance alone, that is, due to the random variability (precision) of the count method. Statistical recount criteria enables one to decide whether observed differences can be explained due to chance alone or are probably due to systematic differences between analysts, microscopes, or other biasing factors. The following recount criterion is for a pair of counts that estimate AC in fibers/cc. The criterion is given at the type -I error level. That is, there is 5% maximum risk that we will reject a pair of co unts for the reason that one might be biased, when the large observed difference is really due to chance. Reject a pair of counts if: Where: AC1 = lower estimated airborne fiber concentration AC2 = higher estimated airborne fiber concentration X49FL FR X =FB BFLBFB Chapter 296 -62 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 65 ACavg = average of the two concentration estimates CVFB = CV for the average of the two concentration estimates If a pair of counts are rejected by this criterion then, recount the rest of the filters in the submitted set. Apply the test and reject any other pai rs failing the test. Rejection shall include a memo to the industrial hygienist stating that the sample failed a statistical test for homogeneity and the true air concentration may be significantly different than the reported value. (d) Reporting Results. Re port results to the industrial hygienist as fibers/cc. Use two significant figures. If multiple analyses are performed on a sample, an average of the results is to be reported unless any of the results can be rejected for cause. 8. References .

Quality Control . The OSHA asbestos regulations require each laboratory to establish a quality control program. The following is presented as an example of how the OSHA - SLTC constructed its internal CV curve as part of meeting this requirement. Data for the CV curve shown below is from 395 samples collected during OSHA compliance inspections and analyzed from October 1980 through April 1986. Each sample was counted by 2 to 5 different counters independently of one ano ther. The standard deviation and the CV statistic was calculated for each sample. This data was then plotted on a graph of CV vs. fibers/mm2. A least squares regression was performed using CV = Application of least squares gave: A = 0.182205 B = -0.973343 C = 0.327499 Using these values, the equation 10 (x))2 - 0.973343(log 10. Sampling Pump Flow Rate C orrections . This correction is used if a difference greater than 5% in ambient temperature and/or pressure is noted between calibration and sampling sites and the pump does not compensate for the differences. Where: Qact = actual flow rate Qcal = calibr ated flow rate (if a rotameter was used, the rotameter value) Pcal = uncorrected air pressure at calibration Pact = uncorrected air pressure at sampling site Tact = temperature at sampling site (K) Tcal = temperature at calibration (K) 11. Walton -Beckett G raticule . When ordering the Graticule for asbestos counting, specify the exact disc diameter needed to fit the ocular of the microscope and the diameter (mm) of the circular counting area. Instructions for measuring the dimensions necessary are listed: (a) Insert any available graticule into the focusing eyepiece and focus so that the graticule lines are sharp and clear. (b) Align the microscope. (c) Place a stage micrometer on the microscope object stage and focus the microscope on the graduated lines. Tact TcalPcal PactXQactQcal= XChapter 296 -62 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 67 (d) Measure the magnified grid length, PL (\u00b5m), using the stage micrometer. (e) Remove the graticule from the microscope and measure its actual grid length, AL (mm). This can be accomplished by using a mechanical stage fitted with verniers, or a jeweler's loupe with a direct reading scale. (f) Let D = 100 \u00b5m. Calculate the circle diameter, d c (mm), for the Walton -Beckett graticule and specify the diameter when making a purchase: Example: If PL = 108 \u00b5m, AL = 2.93 mm and D = 100 \u00b5m, then, dc = (2.93 x 100)/108 = 2.71 mm (g) Each e yepiece -objective -reticle combination on the microscope must be calibrated. Should any of the three be changed (by zoom adjustment, disassembly, replacement, etc.), the combination must be recalibrated. Calibration may change if interpupillary distance i s changed. Measure the field diameter, D (acceptable range: 100 \u00b12 \u00b5m) with a stage micrometer upon receipt of the graticule from the manufacturer. Determine the field area (mm2). Field Area = (D/2)2 If D = 100 \u00b5m = 0.1 mm, then Field Area = +(0.1 mm/2)2 = 0.00785 mm2 The Ltd., Morley Road, Tonbridge TN9 IRN, Kent, England (Telephone 011 -44-732-359061).

As a minimum, the content within the bold lines of this form (items one through four) must be included. This form is not to be submitted to NIOSH. (2) Roentgenograms must be interpreted and classified only by a B -reader, a boar d eligible/certified radiologist, or an experienced physician with known expertise in pneumoconioses. (3) All interpreters, whenever interpreting chest roentgenograms made under this section, must have immediately available for reference a complete set of the ILO-U/C International Classification of Radiographs for Pneumoconioses, 1980. WAC 296 -62-07745 Appendix F --Work practices and engineering controls for automotive brake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair and assembly -- Mandatory. This mandatory appe ndix specifies engineering controls and work practices that must be implemented by the employer during automotive brake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair, and assembly operations. Proper use of these engineering controls and work practices will r educe employees' asbestos exposure below the permissible exposure level during clutch and brake inspection, disassembly, repair, and assembly operations. The employer must institute engineering controls and work practices using either the method set forth in (1) or (2) of this appendix, or any other method which the employer can demonstrate to be equivalent in terms of reducing employee exposure to asbestos as defined and which meets the requirements described in (3) of this appendix, for those facilities in which no more than 5 pairs of brakes or 5 clutches are inspected, disassembled, reassembled and/or repaired per week, the method set forth in (4) of this appendix may be used: (1) Negative pressure enclosure/HEPA vacuum system method . (a) The brake and clutch i nspection, disassembly, repair, and assembly operations must be enclosed to cover and contain the clutch or brake assembly and to prevent the release of asbestos fibers into the worker's breathing zone. (b) The enclosure must be sealed tightly and thoroughly i nspected for leaks before work begins on brake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair and assembly. (c) The enclosure must be such that the worker can clearly see the operation and must provide impermeable sleeves through which the worker can handle the br ake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair and assembly. The integrity of the sleeves and ports must be examined before work begins. (d) A HEPA -filtered vacuum must be employed to maintain the enclosure under negative pressure throughout the operation. C ompressed -air may be used to remove asbestos fibers or particles from the enclosure. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 82 (e) The HEPA vacuum must be used first to loosen the asbestos containing residue from the brake and clutch parts and then to evacuate the loosened asbestos containing materi al from the enclosure and capture the material in the vacuum filter. (f) The vacuum's filter, when full, must be first wetted with a fine mist of water, then removed and placed immediately in an impermeable container, labeled according to WAC 296 -62-07721 (6) and disposed of according to WAC 296 -62-07723. (g) Any spills or releases of asbestos containing waste material from inside of the enclosure or vacuum hose or vacuum filter must be immediately cleaned up and disposed of according to WAC 296 -62-07723. (2) Low press ure/wet cleaning method . (a) A catch basin must be placed under the brake assembly, positioned to avoid splashes and spills. (b) The reservoir must contain water containing an organic solvent or wetting agent. The flow of liquid must be controlled such that the b rake assembly is gently flooded to prevent the asbestos -containing brake dust from becoming airborne. (c) The aqueous solution must be allowed to flow between the brake drum and brake support before the drum is removed. (d) After removing the brake drum, the wheel hub and back of the brake assembly must be thoroughly wetted to suppress dust. (e) The brake support plate, brake shoes and brake components used to attach the brake shoes must be thoroughly washed before removing the old shoes. (f) In systems using filters, the filters, when full, must be first wetted with a fine mist of water, then removed and placed immediately in an impermeable container, labeled according to WAC 296 -62-07721 (6) and disposed of according to WAC -62- 07723. (g) Any spills of asbestos -containing aqueous solution or any asbestos -containing waste material must be cleaned up immediately and disposed of according to WAC 296 -62- 07723. (h) The use of dry brushing during low pressure/wet cleaning operations is prohibited. (3) Equivalent methods . An equivalent m ethod is one which has sufficient written detail so that it can be reproduced and has been demonstrated that the exposures resulting from the equivalent method are equal to or less than the exposure which would result from the use of the method described i n subsection (1) of this appendix. For purposes of making this comparison, the employer must assume that exposures resulting from the use of the method described in subsection (1) of this appendix must not exceed 0.016 f/cc, as measured by the WISHA refer ence method and as averaged over at least 18 personal samples. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 83 (4) Wet method . (a) A spray bottle, hose nozzle, or other implement capable of delivering a fine mist of water or amended water or other delivery system capable of delivering water at low pressure, must be used to first thoroughly wet the brake and clutch parts. Brake and clutch components must then be wiped clean with a cloth. (b) The cloth must be placed in an impermeable container, labeled according to WAC 296-62-07721 (6) and then disposed of accordi ng to WAC 296 -62-07723, or the cloth must be laundered in a way to prevent the release of asbestos fibers in excess of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air. (c) Any spills of solvent or any asbestos containing waste material must be cleaned up immediately acc ording to WAC 296 -62-07723. (d) The use of dry brushing during the wet method operations is prohibited . WAC 296 -62-07747 Appendix G --Substance technical information Nonmandatory. (1) Substance identification . (a) Substance: \"Asbestos\" is the name of a class of magnesium -silicate minerals that occur in fibrous form. Minerals that are included in this group are chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, tremolite asbestos, anthophyllite asbestos, and actinolite asbestos. (b) Asbestos is used in the manufacture of hea t-resistant clothing, automotive brake and clutch linings, and a variety of building materials including floor tiles, roofing felts, ceiling tiles, asbestos -cement pipe and sheet, and fire -resistant drywall. Asbestos is also present in pipe and boiler ins ulation materials, and in sprayed -on materials located on beams, in crawlspaces, and between walls. (c) The potential for a product containing asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite to release breathable fibers depends on its degree of friability. Friable means that the material can be crumbled with hand pressure and is therefore likely to emit fibers. The fibrous or fluffy sprayed -on materials used for fireproofing, insulation, or sound proofing are considered to be friable, and they readily rele ase airborne fibers if disturbed. Materials such as vinyl -asbestos floor tile or roofing felts are considered nonfriable and generally do not emit airborne fibers unless subjected to sanding or sawing operations. Asbestos -cement pipe or sheet can emit ai rborne fibers if the materials are cut or sawed, or if they are broken during demolition operations. (d) Permissible exposure: Exposure to airborne asbestos fibers may not exceed 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (0.1 f/cc) averaged over the eight -hour wo rkday (time weighted average), or 1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (1 f/cc) during any thirty minute period, (excursion limit). Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 84 (2) Health hazard data . (a) Asbestos can cause disabling respiratory disease and various types of cancers if the fibers are inhaled . Inhaling or ingesting fibers from contaminated clothing or skin can also result in these diseases. The symptoms of these diseases generally do not appear for twenty or more years after initial exposure. (b) Exposure to asbestos has been shown to cause lung cancer, mesothelioma, and cancer of the stomach and colon. Mesothelioma is a rear cancer of the thin membrane lining of the chest and abdomen. Symptoms of mesothelioma include shortness of breath, pain in the walls of the chest, and/or abdominal pain. (3) Respirators and protective clothing. (a) Respirators: You are required to wear a respirator when performing tasks that result in asbestos exposure that exceeds 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (0.1 f/cc) as an eight -hour time weighted average and/or 1.0 f iber per cubic centimeter (1 f/cc) during any thirty minute period (excursion limit). These conditions can occur while your employer is in the process of installing engineering controls to reduce asbestos exposure, or where engineering controls are not fe asible to reduce asbestos exposure. Air-purifying respirators equipped with a high -efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter can be used where airborne asbestos fiber concentrations do not exceed 1 f/cc; otherwise, air -supplied, positive -pressure, full fac epiece respirators must be used. Disposable respirators or dust masks are not permitted to be used for asbestos work. For effective protection, respirators must fit your face and head snugly. Your employer is required to conduct fit tests when you are f irst assigned a respirator and every six months thereafter. Respirators should not be loosened or removed in work situations where their use is required. (b) Protective clothing: You are required to wear protective clothing in work areas where asbestos fiber concentrations exceed the permissible exposure limits to prevent contamination of the skin. Where protective clothing is required, your employer must provide you with clean garments. Unless you are working on a large asbestos removal or demolition proje ct, your employer must also provide a change room and separate lockers for your street clothes and contaminated work clothes. If you are working on a large asbestos removal or demolition project, and where it is feasible to do so, your employer must provi de a clean room, shower, and decontamination room contiguous to the work area. When leaving the work area, you must remove contaminated clothing before proceeding to the shower. If the shower is not adjacent to the work area, you must vacuum your clothin g before proceeding to the change room and shower. To prevent inhaling fibers in contaminated change rooms and showers, leave your respirator on until you leave the shower and enter the clean change room. (4) Disposal procedures and cleanup . (a) Wastes that are g enerated by processes where asbestos is present include: Empty asbestos shipping containers. Process wastes such as cuttings, trimmings, or reject material. Housekeeping waste from sweeping or HEPA vacuuming. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 85 Asbestos fireproofing or insulating material that is removed from buildings. Building products that contain asbestos removed during building renovation or demolition. Contaminated disposable protective clothing. (b) Empty shipping bags can be flattened under exhaust hoods and packed into airtight contain ers for disposal. Empty shipping drums are difficult to clean and should be sealed. (c) Vacuum bags or disposable paper filters should not be cleaned, but should be sprayed with a fine water mist and placed into a labeled waste container. (d) Process waste and ho usekeeping waste should be wetted with water or a mixture of water and surfactant prior to packaging in disposable containers. (e) Material containing asbestos that is removed from buildings must be disposed of in leaktight 6 -mil thick plastic bags, plastic -lined cardboard containers, or plastic -lined metal containers. These wastes, which are removed while wet, should be sealed in containers before they dry out to minimize the release of asbestos fibers during handling. (5) Access to information . (a) Each year, your e mployer is required to inform you of the information contained in this standard and appendices for asbestos. In addition, your employer must instruct you in the proper work practices for handling materials containing asbestos and the correct use of protec tive equipment. (b) Your employer is required to determine whether you are being exposed to asbestos. You or your representative has the right to observe employee measurements and to record the results obtained. Your employer is required to inform you of you r exposure, and, if you are exposed above the permissible limits, he or she is required to inform you of the actions that are being taken to reduce your exposure to within the permissible limits. (c) Your employer is required to keep records of your exposures and medical examinations. These exposure records must be kept for at least thirty years. Medical records must be kept for the period of your employment plus thirty years. (d) Your employer is required to release your exposure and medical records to your phys ician or designated representative upon your written request. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, H --Medical surveillance guidelines for asbestos -- Nonmandatory. (1) Route of entry inhalation, ingestion . (2) Toxicology . Clinical evidence of the adverse effects associated with exposure to asbestos is present in the form of several well -conducted epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed workers, family contacts of workers, and persons living near asbestos mines. These studies have shown a definite association betwe en exposure to asbestos and an increased incidence of lung cancer, pleural and peretoneal mesothelioma, gastrointestinal cancer, and asbestosis. The latter is a disabling fibrotic lung disease that is caused only by exposure to asbestos. Exposure to asbe stos has also been associated with an increased incidence of esophageal, kidney, laryngeal, pharyngeal, and buccal cavity cancers. As with other known chronic occupational diseases, disease associated with asbestos generally appears about twenty years fol lowing the first occurrence of exposure: There are no known acute effects associated with exposure to asbestos. Epidemiological studies indicate that the risk of lung cancer among exposed workers who smoke cigarettes is greatly increased over the risk of lung cancer among nonexposed smokers or exposed nonsmokers. These studies suggest that cessation of smoking will reduce the risk of lung cancer for a person exposed to asbestos but will not reduce it to the same level of risk as that existing for an expos ed worker who has never smoked. (3) Signs and symptoms of exposure -related disease . The signs and symptoms of lung cancer or gastrointestinal cancer induced by exposure to asbestos are not unique, except that a chest x -ray of an exposed patient with lung cance r may show pleural plaques, pleural calcification, or pleural fibrosis. Symptoms characteristic of mesothelioma include shortness of breath, pain in the walls of the chest, or abdominal pain. Mesothelioma has a much longer latency period compared with lu ng cancer (forty years versus fifteen to twenty years), and mesothelioma is therefore more likely to be found among workers who were first exposed to asbestos at an early age. Mesothelioma is always fatal. Asbestosis is pulmonary fibrosis caused by the ac cumulation of asbestos fibers in the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and vague feelings of sickness. When the fibrosis worsens, shortness of breath occurs even at rest. The diagnosis of asbestosis is based on a history of exposure to asbestos, the presence of characteristic radiologic changes, endinspiratory crackles (rales), and other clinical features of fibrosing lung disease. Pleural plaques and thickening are observed on x -rays taken during the early stages of the di sease. Asbestosis is often a progressive disease even in the absence of continued exposure, although this appears to be a highly individualized characteristic. In severe cases, death may be caused by respiratory or cardiac failure. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 87 (4) Surveillance and pre ventive considerations . As noted above, exposure to asbestos has been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer, mesothelioma, gastrointestinal cancer, and asbestosis among occupationally exposed workers. Adequate screening tests to determine an employee 's potential for developing serious chronic diseases, such as cancer, from exposure to asbestos do not presently exist. However, some tests, particularly chest x -rays and pulmonary function tests, may indicate that an employee has been overexposed to asbe stos increasing their risk of developing exposure -related chronic diseases. It is important for the physician to become familiar with the operating conditions in which occupational exposure to asbestos is likely to occur. This is particularly important i n evaluating medical and work histories and in conducting physical examinations. When an active employee has been identified as having been overexposed to asbestos measures taken by the employer to eliminate or mitigate further exposure should also lower the risk of serious long -term consequences. The employer is required to institute a medical surveillance program for all employees who are or will be exposed to asbestos at or above the permissible exposure limits (0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air) fo r 30 or more days per year and for all employees who are assigned to wear a negative pressure respirator. All examinations and procedures must be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed physician, at a reasonable time and place, and at no cost to the employee. Although broad latitude is given to the physician in prescribing specific tests to be included in the medical surveillance program, WISHA requires inclusion of the following elements in the routine examination: (a) Medical and work histories with special emphasis directed to symptoms of the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, and digestive tract. (b) Completion of the respiratory disease questionnaire contained in WAC 296 -62- 07741, Appendix D. (c) A physical examination including a chest roentg enogram and pulmonary function test that includes measurement of the employee's forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1). (d) Any laboratory or other test that the examining physician deems by sound medical practice to be n ecessary. The employer is required to make the prescribed tests available at least annually to those employees covered; more often than specified if recommended by the examining physician; and upon termination of employment. The employer is required to pro vide the physician with the following information: A copy of this standard and appendices; a description of the employee's duties as they relate to asbestos exposure; the employee's representative level of exposure to asbestos; a description of any person al protective and respiratory equipment used; and information from previous medical examinations of the affected employee that is not otherwise available to the physician. Making this information available to the physician will aid in the evaluation of th e employee's health in relation to assigned duties and fitness to wear personal protective equipment, if required. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 88 The employer is required to obtain a written opinion from the examining physician containing the results of the medical examination; the ph ysician's opinion as to whether the employee has any detected medical conditions that would place the employee at an increased risk of exposure -related disease; any recommended limitations on the employee or on the use of personal protective equipment; and a statement that the employee has been informed by the physician of the results of the medical examination and of any medical conditions related to asbestos exposure that require further explanation or treatment. This written opinion must not reveal spec ific findings or diagnoses unrelated to exposure to asbestos and a copy of the opinion must be provided to the affected employee. WAC 296 -62-07751 Appendix I --Work practices and engineering controls for Class I asbestos operations --Nonmandatory. This is a nonmandatory appendix to the asbestos standards for construction and for shipyards. It describes criteria and procedures for erecting and using negative pressure enclosures for Class I Asbestos Work, when NPEs are used as an allowable control method to c omply with WAC 296 - 62-07712 (7)(a). Many small and variable details are involved in the erection of a negative pressure enclosure. OSHA and most participants in the rulemaking agreed that only the major, more performance oriented criteria should be made mandatory. These criteria are set out in WAC 296 -62-07712. In addition, this appendix includes these mandatory specifications and procedures in its guidelines in order to make this appendix coherent and helpful. The mandatory nature of the criteria which appear in the regulatory text is not changed because they are included in this \"nonmandatory\" appendix. Similarly, the additional criteria and procedures included as guidelines in the appendix, do not become mandatory because mandatory criteria are also included in these comprehensive guidelines. In addition, none of the criteria, both mandatory and recommended, are meant to specify or imply the need for use of patented or licensed methods or equipment. Recommended specifications included in this attachm ent should not discourage the use of creative alternatives which can be shown to reliably achieve the objectives of negative -pressure enclosures. Requirements included in this appendix, cover general provisions to be followed in all asbestos jobs, provisio ns which must be followed for all Class I asbestos jobs, and provisions governing the construction and testing of negative pressure enclosures. The first category includes the requirement for use of wet methods, HEPA vacuums, and immediate bagging of wast e; Class I work must conform to the following provisions: - oversight by competent person - use of critical barriers over all openings to work area - isolation of HVAC systems - use of impermeable dropcloths and coverage of all objects within regulated are as Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 89 In addition, more specific requirements for NPEs include: - maintenance of -0.02 inches water gauge within enclosure - manometric measurements - air movement away from employees performing removal work - smoke testing or equivalent for detection of le aks and air direction - deactivation of electrical circuits, if not provided with ground -fault circuit interrupters. Planning the Project The standard requires that an exposure assessment be conducted before the asbestos job is begun WAC 296 -62-07709(3). Information needed for that assessment, includes data relating to prior similar jobs, as applied to the specific variables of the current job. The information needed to conduct the assessment will be useful in planning the project, and in complying with a ny reporting requirements under this standard, when significant changes are being made to a control system listed in the standard, (see WAC 296 -62-07719), as well as those of USEPA (40 CFR Part 61, subpart M). Thus, although the standard does not explicit ly require the preparation of a written asbestos removal plan, the usual constituents of such a plan, i.e., a description of the enclosure, the equipment, and the procedures to be used throughout the project, must be determined before the enclosure can be erected. The following information should be included in the planning of the system: A physical description of the work area ; A description of the approximate amount of material to be removed; A schedule for turning off and sealing existing ventilation sy stems; Personnel hygiene procedures; A description of personal protective equipment and clothing to be worn by employees; A description of the local exhaust ventilation systems to be used and how they are to be tested; A description of work practices to be observed by employees; An air monitoring plan; A description of the method to be used to transport waste material; and The location of the dump site. Materials and Equipment Necessary for Asbestos Removal Although individual asbestos removal projects vary in terms of the equipment required to accomplish the removal of the materials, some equipment and materials are common to most asbestos removal operations. Plastic sheeting used to protect horizontal surfaces, seal HVAC openings or to seal vertical openin gs and ceilings should have a minimum thickness of 6 mils. Tape or other adhesive used to attach plastic sheeting should be of sufficient adhesive strength to support the weight of the material plus all stresses encountered during the entire duration of t he project without becoming detached from the surface. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 90 Other equipment and materials which should be available at the beginning of each project are: - HEPA Filtered Vacuum is essential for cleaning the work area after the asbestos has been removed. It s hould have a long hose capable of reaching out -of-the-way places, such as areas above ceiling tiles, behind pipes, etc. - Portable air ventilation systems installed to provide the negative air pressure and air removal from the enclosure must be equipped wi th a HEPA filter. The number and capacity of units required to ventilate an enclosure depend on the size of the area to be ventilated. The filters for these systems should be designed in such a manner that they can be replaced when the air flow volume is reduced by the build -up of dust in the filtration material. Pressure monitoring devices with alarms and strip chart recorders attached to each system to indicate the pressure differential and the loss due to dust buildup on the filter are recommended. - Water sprayers should be used to keep the asbestos material as saturated as possible during removal; the sprayers will provide a fine mist that minimizes the impact of the spray on the material. - Water used to saturate the asbestos containing material can be amended by adding at least 15 milliliters (0.5 ounce) of wetting agent in 1 liter (1 pint) of water. An example of a wetting agent is a 50/50 mixture of polyoxyethylene ether and polyoxyethylene polyglycol ester. - Backup power supplies are recommende d, especially for ventilation systems. - Shower and bath water should be with mixed hot and cold water faucets. Water that has been used to clean personnel or equipment should either be filtered or be collected and discarded as asbestos waste. Soap and s hampoo should be provided to aid in removing dust from the workers' skin and hair. - See WAC 296 -62-07715 and 296 -62-07717 for appropriate respiratory protection and protective clothing. - See WAC 296 -62-07721 for required signs and labels. Preparing the W ork Area Disabling HVAC Systems: The power to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems that service the restricted area must be deactivated and locked off. All ducts, grills, access ports, windows and vents must be sealed off with two layer s of plastic to prevent entrainment of contaminated air. Operating HVAC Systems in the Restricted Area: If components of a HVAC system located in the restricted area are connected to a system that will service another zone during the project, the portion of the duct in the restricted area must be sealed and pressurized. Necessary precautions include caulking the duct joints, covering all cracks and openings with two layers of sheeting, and pressurizing the duct throughout the duration of the project by re stricting the return air flow. The power to the fan supplying the positive pressure should be locked \"on\" to prevent pressure loss. Sealing Elevators: If an elevator shaft is located in the restricted area, it should be either shut down or isolated by se aling with two layers of plastic sheeting. The sheeting should provide enough slack to accommodate the pressure changes in the shaft without breaking the air -tight seal. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 91 Removing Mobile Objects: All movable objects should be cleaned and removed from th e work area before an enclosure is constructed unless moving the objects creates a hazard. Mobile objects will be assumed to be contaminated and should be either cleaned with amended water and a HEPA vacuum and then removed from the area or wrapped and th en disposed of as hazardous waste. Cleaning and Sealing Surfaces: After cleaning with water and a HEPA vacuum, surfaces of stationary objects should be covered with two layers of plastic sheeting. The sheeting should be secured with duct tape or an equiv alent method to provide a tight seal around the object. Bagging Waste: In addition to the requirement for immediate bagging of waste for disposal, it is further recommended that the waste material be double -bagged and sealed in plastic bags designed for a sbestos disposal. The bags should be stored in a waste storage area that can be controlled by the workers conducting the removal. Filters removed from air handling units and rubbish removed from the area are to be bagged and handled as hazardous waste. Constructing the Enclosure The enclosure should be constructed to provide an air -tight seal around ducts and openings into existing ventilation systems and around penetrations for electrical conduits, telephone wires, water lines, drain pipes, etc. Enclosu res should be both airtight and watertight except for those openings designed to provide entry and/or air flow control. Size: An enclosure should be the minimum volume to encompass all of the working surfaces yet allow unencumbered movement by the worker( s), provide unrestricted air flow past the worker(s), and ensure walking surfaces can be kept free of tripping hazards. Shape: The enclosure may be any shape that optimizes the flow of ventilation air past the worker(s). Structural Integrity: The walls, ceilings and floors must be supported in such a manner that portions of the enclosure will not fall down during normal use. Openings: It is not necessary that the structure be airtight; openings may be designed to direct air flow. Such openings should be located at a distance from active removal operations. They should be designed to draw air into the enclosure under all anticipated circumstances. In the event that negative pressure is lost, they should be fitted with either HEPA filters to trap dust or automatic trap doors that prevent dust from escaping the enclosure. Openings for exits should be controlled by an airlock or a vestibule. Barrier Supports: Frames should be constructed to support all unsupported spans of sheeting. Sheeting: Walls, barr iers, ceilings, and floors should be lined with two layers of plastic sheeting having a thickness of at least 6 mil. Seams: Seams in the sheeting material should be minimized to reduce the possibilities of accidental rips and tears in the adhesive or conn ections. All seams in the sheeting should overlap, be staggered and not be located at corners or wall -to-floor joints. Areas Within an Enclosure: Each enclosure consists of a work area, a decontamination area, and waste storage area. The work area where the asbestos removal operations occur should be separated from both the waste storage area and the contamination control area by physical curtains, doors, and/or airflow patterns that force any airborne contamination back into the work area. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and See WAC 296 -62-07719 for requirements for hygiene facilities. During egress from the work area, each worker should step into the equipment room, clean tools and equipment, and remove gross contamination from clothing by wet cleaning and HEPA vacuuming. Before enteri ng the shower area, foot coverings, head coverings, hand coverings, and coveralls are removed and placed in impervious bags for disposal or cleaning. Airline connections from airline respirators with HEPA disconnects and power cables from powered air - purifying respirators (PAPRs) will be disconnected just prior to entering the shower room. Establishing Negative Pressure Within the Enclosure Negative Pressure: Air is to be drawn into the enclosure under all anticipated conditions and exhausted through a HE PA filter for 24 hours a day during the entire duration of the project. Air Flow Tests: Air flow patterns will be checked before removal operations begin, at least once per operating shift and any time there is a question regarding the integrity of the en closure. The primary test for air flow is to trace air currents with smoke tubes or other visual methods. Flow checks are made at each opening and at each doorway to demonstrate that air is being drawn into the enclosure and at each worker's position to show that air is being drawn away from the breathing zone. Monitoring Pressure Within the Enclosure: After the initial air flow patterns have been checked, the static pressure must be monitored within the enclosure. Monitoring may be made using manometer s, pressure gauges, or combinations of these devices. It is recommended that they be attached to alarms and strip chart recorders at points identified by the design engineer. Corrective Actions: If the manometers or pressure gauges demonstrate a reductio n in pressure differential below the required level, work should cease and the reason for the change investigated and appropriate changes made. The air flow patterns should be retested before work begins again. Pressure Differential: The design parameter s for static pressure differentials between the inside and outside of enclosures typically range from 0.02 to 0.10 inches of water gauge, depending on conditions. All zones inside the enclosure must have less pressure than the ambient pressure outside of the enclosure ( -0.02 inches water gauge differential). Design specifications for the differential vary according to the size, configuration, and shape of the enclosure as well as ambient and mechanical air pressure conditions around the enclosure. Air Flo w Patterns: The flow of air past each worker shall be enhanced by positioning the intakes and exhaust ports to remove contaminated air from the worker's breathing zone, by positioning HEPA vacuum cleaners to draw air from the worker's breathing zone, by f orcing relatively uncontaminated air past the worker toward an exhaust port, or by using a combination of methods to reduce the worker's exposure. Air Handling Unit Exhaust: The exhaust plume from air handling units should be located away from adjacent pe rsonnel and intakes for HVAC systems. Air Flow Volume: The air flow volume (cubic meters per minute) exhausted (removed) from the workplace must exceed the amount of makeup air supplied to the enclosure. The rate of air exhausted from the enclosure shoul d be designed to maintain a negative pressure in the enclosure and air movement past each worker. The volume of air flow removed from the enclosure should replace the volume of the container at every 5 to 15 minutes. Air flow volume will need to be relatively high for large enclosures, enclosures with awkward shapes, enclosures with multiple openings, and operations employing several workers in the enclosure. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 93 Air Flow Velocity: At each opening, the air flow velocity must visibly \"drag\" air into the enclosure. The velocity of air flow within the enclosure must be adequate to remove airborne contamination from each worker's breathing zone without disturbing the asbestos -containing material on surfaces. Airlocks: Airlocks are mechanisms on doors and curt ains that control the air flow patterns in the doorways. If air flow occurs, the patterns through doorways must be such that the air flows toward the inside of the enclosure. Sometimes vestibules, double doors, or double curtains are used to prevent air movement through the doorways. To use a vestibule, a worker enters a chamber by opening the door or curtain and then closing the entry before opening the exit door or curtain. Airlocks should be located between the equipment room and shower room, between the shower room and the clean room, and between the waste storage area and the outside of the enclosure. The air flow between adjacent rooms must be checked using smoke tubes or other visual tests to ensure the flow patterns draw air toward the work area without producing eddies. Monitoring for Airborne Concentrations In addition to the breathing zone samples taken as outlined in WAC 296 -62-07709, samples of air should be taken to demonstrate the integrity of the enclosure, the cleanliness of the clean room and shower area, and the effectiveness of the HEPA filter. If the clean room is shown to be contaminated, the room must be relocated to an uncontaminated area. Samples taken near the exhaust of portable ventilation systems must be done with care. Genera l Work Practices Preventing dust dispersion is the primary means of controlling the spread of asbestos within the enclosure. Whenever practical, the point of removal should be isolated, enclosed, covered, or shielded from the workers in the area. Waste a sbestos containing materials must be bagged during or immediately after removal; the material must remain saturated until the waste container is sealed. Waste material with sharp points or corners must be placed in hard air -tight containers rather than bag s. Whenever possible, large components should be sealed in plastic sheeting and removed intact. Bags or containers of waste will be moved to the waste holding area, washed, and wrapped in a bag with the appropriate labels. Cleaning the Work Area Surfaces w ithin the work area should be kept free of visible dust and debris to the extent feasible. Whenever visible dust appears on surfaces, the surfaces within the enclosure must be cleaned by wiping with a wet sponge, brush, or cloth and then vacuumed with a H EPA vacuum. All surfaces within the enclosure should be cleaned before the exhaust ventilation system is deactivated and the enclosure is disassembled. An approved encapsulant may be sprayed onto areas after the visible dust has been removed. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, Method number: ID -191 Matrix: Bulk Collection Procedure Collect approximately 1 to 2 grams of each type of material and place into separate 20 mL scintillation vials. Analytical Pr ocedure A portion of each separate phase is analyzed by gross examination, phase -polar examination, and central stop dispersion microscopy. Commercial manufacturers and products mentioned in this method are for descriptive use only and do not constitute en dorsements by USDOL -WISHA. Similar products from other sources may be substituted. (1) Introduction This method describes the collection and analysis of asbestos bulk materials by light microscopy techniques including phase - polar illumination and central -stop dispersion microscopy. Some terms unique to asbestos analysis are defined below: Amphibole: A family of minerals whose crystals are formed by long, thin units which have two thin ribbons of double chain silicate with a brucite ribbon in between. The s hape of each unit is similar to an \"I beam.\" Minerals important in asbestos analysis include cummingtonite -grunerite, crocidolite, tremolite -actinolite and anthophyllite. Asbestos: A term occurring Asbestos chryso tile, cummingtonite -grunerite asbestos (amosite), anthophyllite asbestos, tremolite asbestos, crocidolite, actinolite asbestos and any of these minerals which have been chemically treated or altered. The precise chemical formulation of each species varies with the location from which it was mined. Nominal compositions are listed: Chrysotile Mg3Si2O5(OH) 4 Crocidolite Asbestos Fiber: A fiber of asbestos meeting the criteria for a fiber. (See section (3)(e)) Aspect Ratio: The ratio of the length of a fiber to its diameter usually defined as \"length: width\", e.g. 3:1. Brucite: A sheet mineral with the mg(OH) 2. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Central Stop Dispersion Staining (microscope): This is a dark field microscope technique that images particles using only light refracted by the particle, excluding ligh t that travels through the particle unrefracted. This is usually accomplished with a McCrone objective or other arrangement which places a circular stop with apparent aperture equal to the objective aperture in the back focal plane of the microscope. Cleavage Fragments: Mineral particles formed by the comminution of minerals, especially those characterized by relatively parallel sides and moderate aspect ratio. Differential Counting: The term applied to the practice of excluding certain kinds of fibers f rom a phase contrast asbestos count because they are not asbestos. Fiber: A particle longer than or equal to 5 microns with a length to width ratio greater than or equal to 3:1. This may include cleavage fragments. (See section (3)(e) of this appendix). Phase Contrast: Contrast obtained in the microscope by causing light scattered by small particles to destructively interfere with unscattered light, thereby enhancing the visibility of very small particles and particles with very low intrinsic contrast. Phase Contrast Microscope: A microscope configured with a phase mask pair to create phase contrast. The technique which uses this is called Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM). Phase -Polar Analysis: This is the use of polarized light in a phase contrast mic roscope. It is used to see the same size fibers that are visible in air filter analysis. Although fibers finer than 1 micron are visible, analysis of these is inferred from analysis of larger bundles that are usually present. Phase -Polar Microscope: The phase -polar microscope is a phase contrast microscope which has an analyzer, a polarizer, a first order red plate and a rotating phase condenser all in place so that the polarized light image is enhanced by phase contrast. Sealing Encapsulant: This is a product which can be applied, preferably by spraying, onto an asbestos surface which will seal the surface so that fibers cannot be released. Serpentine: A mineral family consisting of minerals with the general composition Mg3(Si2O5(OH) 4 having the magnes ium in brucite layer over a silicate layer. Minerals important in asbestos analysis included in this family are chrysotile, lizardite, antigorite. (a) History Light microscopy has been used for well over 100 years for the determination of mineral species. Th is analysis is carried out using specialized polarizing microscopes as well as bright field microscopes. The identification of minerals is an on -going process with many new minerals described each year. The first recorded use of asbestos was in Finland a bout 2500 B.C. where the material was used in the mud wattle for the wooden huts the people lived in as well as strengthening for pottery. Adverse health aspects of the mineral were noted nearly 2000 years ago when Pliny the Younger wrote about the poor h ealth of slaves in the asbestos mines. Although known to be injurious for centuries, the first modern references to its toxicity were by the British Labor Inspectorate when it banned asbestos dust from the workplace in 1898. Asbestosis cases were describ ed in the literature after the turn of the century. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 96 Cancer was first suspected in the mid 1930's and a causal link to mesothelioma was made in 1965. Because of the public concern for worker and public safety with the use of this material, several differ ent types of analysis were applied to the determination of asbestos content. Light microscopy requires a great deal of experience and craft. Attempts were made to apply less subjective methods to the analysis. X -ray diffraction was partially successful in determining the mineral types but was unable to separate out the fibrous portions from the nonfibrous portions. Also, the minimum detection limit for asbestos analysis by X -ray diffraction (XRD) is about 1%. Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) was no more successful. These provide useful corroborating information when the presence of asbestos has been shown by microscopy; however, neither can determine the difference between fibrous and nonfibrous minerals when both habits are present. The same is tr ue of Infrared Absorption (IR). When electron microscopy was applied to asbestos analysis, hundreds of fibers were discovered present too small to be visible in any light microscope. There are two different types of electron microscopes used for asbestos analysis: Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Scanning Electron Microscopy is useful in identifying minerals. The SEM can provide two of the three pieces of information required to identify fibers by electron m icroscopy: Morphology and chemistry. The third is structure as determined by Selected Area Electron Diffraction -SAED which is performed in the TEM. Although the resolution of the SEM is sufficient for very fine fibers to be seen, accuracy of chemical an alysis that can be performed on the fibers varies with fiber diameter in fibers of less than 0.2 micron diameter. The TEM is a powerful tool to identify fibers too small to be resolved by light microscopy and should be used in conjunction with this method when necessary. The TEM can provide all three pieces of information required for fiber identification. Most fibers thicker than 1 micron can adequately be defined in the light microscope. The light microscope remains as the best instrument for the determination of mineral type. This is because the minerals under investigation were first described analytically with the light microscope. It is inexpensive and gives positive identification for most samples analyzed. Further, when optical techniques are inadequate, there is ample indication that alternative techniques should be used for complete identification of the sample. (b) Principle Minerals consist of atoms that may be arranged in random order or in a regular arrangement. Amorphous materials have atom s in random order while crystalline materials have long range order. Many materials are transparent to light, at least for small particles or for thin sections. The properties of these materials can be investigated by the effect that the material has on light passing through it. The six asbestos minerals are all crystalline with particular properties that have been identified and cataloged. These six minerals are anisotropic. They have a regular array of atoms, but the arrangement is not the same in al l directions. Each major direction of the crystal presents a different regularity. Light photons traveling in each of these main directions will encounter different electrical neighborhoods, affecting the path and time of travel. The techniques outlined in this method use the fact that light traveling through fibers or crystals in different directions will behave differently, Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 97 but predictably. The behavior of the light as it travels through a crystal can be measured and compared with known or determin ed values to identify the mineral species. Usually, Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM) is performed with strain -free objectives on a bright -field microscope platform. This would limit the resolution of the microscope to about 0.4 micron. Because WISHA req uires the counting and identification of fibers visible in phase contrast, the phase contrast platform is used to visualize the fibers with the polarizing elements added into the light path. Polarized light methods cannot identify fibers finer than about 1 micron in diameter even though they are visible. The finest fibers are usually identified by inference from the presence of larger, identifiable fiber bundles. When fibers are present, but not identifiable by light microscopy, use either SEM or TEM to determine the fiber identity. (c) Advantages and Disadvantages The advantages of light microscopy are: Basic identification of the materials was first performed by light microscopy and gross analysis. This provides a large base of published information agains t which to check analysis and analytical technique. The analysis is specific to fibers. The minerals present can exist in asbestiform, fibrous, prismatic, or massive varieties all at the same time. Therefore, bulk methods of analysis such as X -ray diffra ction, IR analysis, DTA, etc. are inappropriate where the material is not known to be fibrous. The analysis is quick, requires little preparation time, and can be performed on - site if a suitably equipped microscope is available. The disadvantages are: Even using phase -polar illumination, not all the fibers present may be seen. This is a problem for very low asbestos concentrations where agglomerations or large bundles of fibers may not be present to allow identification by inference. The method requires a great degree of sophistication on the part of the microscopist. An analyst is only as useful as his mental catalog of images. Therefore, a microscopist's accuracy is enhanced by experience. The mineralogical training of the analyst is very important. I t is the basis on which subjective decisions are made. The method uses only a tiny amount of material for analysis. This may lead to sampling bias and false results (high or low). This is especially true if the sample is severely inhomogeneous. Fibers ma y be bound in a matrix and not distinguishable as fibers so identification cannot be made. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 98 (d) Method Performance This method can be used for determination of asbestos content from 0 to 100% asbestos. The detection limit has not been adequately determined, although for selected samples, the limit is very low, depending on the number of particles examined. For mostly homogeneous, finely divided samples, with no difficult fibrous interferences, the detection limit is below 1%. For inhomogeneous samples (most samples), the detection limit remains undefined. NIST has conducted proficiency testing of laboratories on a national scale. Although each round is reported statistically with an average, control limits, etc., the results indicate a difficulty in establ ishing precision especially in the low concentration range. It is suspected that there is significant bias in the low range especially near 1%. EPA tried to remedy this by requiring a mandatory point counting scheme for samples less than 10%. The point counting procedure is tedious, and may introduce significant biases of its own. It has not been incorporated into this method. The precision and accuracy of the quantitation tests performed in this method are unknown. Concentrations are easier to determi ne in commercial products where asbestos was deliberately added because the amount is usually more than a few percent. An analyst's results can be \"calibrated\" against the known amounts added by the manufacturer. For geological samples, the degree of homogeneity affects the precision. The performance of the method is analyst dependent. The analyst must choose carefully and not necessarily randomly the portions for analysis to assure that detection of asbestos occurs when it is present. For this reason, the analyst must have adequate training in sample preparation, and experience in the location and identification of asbestos in samples. This is usually accomplished through substantial on -the-job training as well as formal education in mineralogy and microscopy. (e) Interferences Any material which is long, thin, and small enough to be viewed under the microscope can be considered an interference for asbestos. There are literally hundreds of interferences in workplaces. The techniques described in this meth od are normally sufficient to eliminate the interferences. An analyst's success in eliminating the interferences depends on proper training. Asbestos minerals belong to two mineral families: The serpentines and the amphiboles. In the serpentine family, the only common fibrous mineral is chrysotile. Occasionally, the mineral antigorite occurs in a fibril habit with morphology similar to the amphiboles. The amphibole minerals consist of a score of different minerals of which only five are regulated by fe deral standard: Amosite, crocidolite, anthophyllite asbestos, tremolite asbestos and actinolite asbestos. These are the only amphibole minerals that have been commercially exploited for their fibrous properties; however, the rest can and do occur occasio nally in asbestiform habit. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 99 In addition to the related mineral interferences, other minerals common in building material may present a problem for some microscopists: Gypsum, anhydrite, brucite, quartz fibers, talc fibers or ribbons, wollastonite, perli te, attapulgite, etc. Other fibrous materials commonly present in workplaces are: Fiberglass, mineral wool, ceramic wool, refractory ceramic fibers, kevlar, nomex, synthetic fibers, graphite or carbon fibers, cellulose (paper or wood) fibers, metal fiber s, etc. Matrix embedding material can sometimes be a negative interference. The analyst may not be able to easily extract the fibers from the matrix in order to use the method. Where possible, remove the matrix before the analysis, taking careful note of the loss of weight. Some common matrix materials are: Vinyl, rubber, tar, paint, plant fiber, cement, and epoxy. A further negative interference is that the asbestos fibers themselves may be either too small to be seen in Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM ) or of a very low fibrous quality, having the appearance of plant fibers. The analyst's ability to deal with these materials increases with experience. (f) Uses and Occupational Exposure Asbestos is ubiquitous in the environment. More than 40% of the land a rea of the United States is composed of minerals which may contain asbestos. Fortunately, the actual formation of great amounts of asbestos is relatively rare. Nonetheless, there are locations in which environmental exposure can be severe such as in the Serpentine Hills of California. There are thousands of uses for asbestos in industry and the home. Asbestos abatement workers are the most current segment of the population to have occupational exposure to great amounts of asbestos. If the material is un disturbed, there is no exposure. Exposure occurs when the asbestos -containing material is abraded or otherwise disturbed during maintenance operations or some other activity. Approximately 95% of the asbestos in place in the United States is chrysotile. Amosite and crocidolite make up nearly all the difference. Tremolite and anthophyllite make up a very small percentage. Tremolite is found in extremely small amounts in certain chrysotile deposits. Actinolite exposure is probably greatest from environme ntal sources, but has been identified in vermiculite containing, sprayed -on insulating materials which may have been certified as asbestos -free. (g) Physical and Chemical Properties The nominal chemical compositions for the asbestos minerals were given in subsection (1). Compared to cleavage fragments of the same minerals, asbestiform fibers possess a high tensile strength along the fiber axis. They are chemically inert, noncombustible, and heat resistant. Except for chrysotile, they are insoluble in Hydrochl oric acid (HCl). Chrysotile is slightly soluble in HCl. Asbestos has high electrical resistance and good sound absorbing characteristics. It can be woven into cables, fabrics or other textiles, or matted into papers, felts, and mats. (h) Toxicology (This Se ction is for Information Only and Should Not Be Taken as WISHA Policy). Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 100 Possible physiologic results of respiratory exposure to asbestos are mesothelioma of the pleura or peritoneum, interstitial fibrosis, asbestosis, pneumoconiosis, or respiratory cance r. The possible consequences of asbestos exposure are detailed in the NIOSH Criteria Document or in the WISHA Asbestos Standards, WAC 296 -62- 077. (2) Sampling Procedure (a) Equipment for Sampling Tube or cork borer sampling device Knife 20 mL scintillation vial o r similar vial Sealing encapsulant (b) Safety Precautions Asbestos is a known carcinogen. Take care when sampling. While in an asbestos - containing atmosphere, a properly selected and fit -tested respirator should be worn. Take samples in a manner to cause th e least amount of dust. Follow these general guidelines: Do not make unnecessary dust. Take only a small amount (1 to 2 g). Tightly close the sample container. Use encapsulant to seal the spot where the sample was taken, if necessary. (c) Sampling procedure Samples of any suspect material should be taken from an inconspicuous place. Where the material is to remain, seal the sampling wound with an encapsulant to eliminate the potential for exposure from the sample site. Microscopy requires only a few milligra ms of material. The amount that will fill a 20 mL scintillation vial is more than adequate. Be sure to collect samples from all layers and phases of material. If possible, make separate samples of each different phase of the material. This will aid in determining the actual hazard. do not use envelopes, plastic or paper bags of any kind to collect samples. The use of plastic bags presents a contamination hazard to laboratory personnel and to other samples. When these containers are opened, a bellows effect blows fibers out of the container onto everything, including the person opening the container. If a cork -borer type sampler is available, push the tube through the material all the way, so that all layers of material are sampled. Some samplers are intended to be disposable. These should be capped and sent to the laboratory. If a nondisposable cork borer is used, empty the contents into a scintillation vial and send to the laboratory. Vigorously and completely clean the cork borer between samples. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 101 (d) Shipment Samples packed in glass vials must not touch or they might break in shipment. Seal the samples with a sample seal over the end to guard against tampering and to identify the sample. Package the bulk samples in separate packages from the air sam ples. They may cross -contaminate each other and will invalidate the results of the air samples. Include identifying paperwork with the samples, but not in contact with the suspected asbestos. To maintain sample accountability, ship the samples by certifie d mail, overnight express, or hand carry them to the laboratory. (3) Analysis The analysis of asbestos samples can be divided into two major parts: Sample preparation and microscopy. Because of the different asbestos uses that may be encountered by the analy st, each sample may need different preparation steps. The choices are outlined below. There are several different tests that are performed to identify the asbestos species and determine the percentage. They will be explained below. (a) Safety Do not create unnecessary dust. Handle the samples in HEPA -filter equipped hoods. If samples are received in bags, envelopes or other inappropriate container, open them only in a hood having a face velocity at or greater than 100 fpm. Transfer a small amount to a sci ntillation vial and only handle the smaller amount. Open samples in a hood, never in the open lab area. Index of refraction oils can be toxic. Take care not to get this material on the skin. Wash immediately with soap and water if this happens. Samples t hat have been heated in the muffle furnace or the drying oven may be hot. Handle them with tongs until they are cool enough to handle. Some of the solvents used, such as THF (tetrahydrofuran), are toxic and should only be handled in an appropriate fume ho od and according to instructions given in the Safety Data Sheet (SDS).

The end result is a sample which has been reduced to a powder that is sufficiently fine to fit under th e cover slip. Analyze different phases of samples separately, e.g., tile and the tile mastic should be analyzed separately as the mastic may contain asbestos while the tile may not. Wet Samples Samples with a high water content will not give the proper di spersion colors and must be dried prior to sample mounting. Remove the lid of the scintillation vial, place the bottle in the drying oven and heat at 100 degrees C to dryness (usually about 2 h). Samples which are not submitted to the lab in glass must be removed and placed in glass vials or aluminum weighing pans before placing them in the drying oven. Samples With Organic Interference -Muffle Furnace These may include samples with tar as a matrix, vinyl asbestos tile, or any other organic that can be red uced by heating. Remove the sample from the vial and weigh in a balance to determine the weight of the submitted portion. Place the sample in a muffle furnace at 500 degrees C for 1 to 2 h or until all obvious organic material has been removed. Retrieve , cool and weigh again to determine the weight loss on ignition. This is necessary to determine the asbestos content of the submitted sample, because the analyst will be looking at a reduced sample. Notes : Heating above 600 degrees C will cause the sample to undergo a structural change which, given sufficient time, will convert the chrysotile to forsterite. Heating even at lower temperatures for 1 to 2 h may have a measurable effect on the optical properties of the minerals. If the analyst is unsure of w hat to expect, a sample of standard asbestos should be heated to the same temperature for the same length of time so that it can be examined for the proper interpretation. Samples With Organic Interference -THF Vinyl asbestos tile is the most common materi al treated with this solvent, although, substances containing tar will sometimes yield to this treatment. Select a portion of the material and then grind it up if possible. Weigh the sample and place it in a test tube. Add sufficient THF to dissolve the organic matrix. This is usually about 4 to 5 mL. Remember, THF is highly flammable. Filter the remaining material through a tared silver membrane, dry and weigh to determine how much is left after the solvent extraction. Further process the sample to remove carbonate or mount directly. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 105 Samples With Carbonate Interference Carbonate material is often found on fibers and sometimes must be removed in order to perform dispersion microscopy. Weigh out a portion of the material and place it in a test tube. Add a sufficient amount of 0.1 M HCl or decalcifying solution in the tube to react all the carbonate as evidenced by gas formation; i.e., when the gas bubbles stop, add a little more solution. If no more gas forms, the reaction is complete. Filter the material out through a tared silver membrane, dry and weigh to determine the weight lost. (d) Sample Preparation Samples must be prepared so that accurate determination can be made of the asbestos type and amount present. The following steps are carried out i n the low -flow hood (a low-flow hood has less than 50 fpm flow): If the sample has large lumps, is hard, or cannot be made to lie under a cover slip, the grain size must be reduced. Place a small amount between two slides and grind the material between th em or grind a small amount in a clean mortar and pestle. The choice of whether to use an alumina, ruby, or diamond mortar depends on the hardness of the material. Impact damage can alter the asbestos mineral if too much mechanical shock occurs. (Freezer mills can completely destroy the observable crystallinity of asbestos and should not be used). For some samples, a portion of material can be shaved off with a scalpel, ground off with a hand grinder or hacksaw blade. The preparation tools should either be disposable or cleaned thoroughly. Use vigorous scrubbing to loosen the fibers during the washing. Rinse the implements with copious amounts of water and air -dry in a dust -free environment. If the sample is powder or has been reduced as in (i) above, i t is ready to mount. Place a glass slide on a piece of optical tissue and write the identification on the painted or frosted end. Place two drops of index of refraction medium n = 1.550 on the slide. (The medium n = 1.550 is chosen because it is the mat ching index for chrysotile.) Dip the end of a clean paper -clip or dissecting needle into the droplet of refraction medium on the slide to moisten it. Then dip the probe into the powder sample. Transfer what sticks on the probe to the slide. The materia l on the end of the probe should have a diameter of about 3 mm for a good mount. If the material is very fine, less sample may be appropriate. For nonpowder samples such as fiber mats, forceps should be used to transfer a small amount of material to the slide. Stir the material in the medium on the slide, spreading it out and making the preparation as uniform as possible. Place a cover -slip on the preparation by gently lowering onto the slide and allowing it to fall \"trapdoor fashion\" on the preparation to push out any bubbles. Press gently on the cover slip to even out the distribution of particulate on the slide. If there is insufficient mounting oil on the slide, one or two drops may be placed near the edge of the coverslip on the slide. Capillary action will draw the necessary amount of liquid into the preparation. Remove excess oil with the point of a laboratory wiper. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 106 Treat at least two different areas of each phase in this fashion. Choose representative areas of the sample. It may be useful to select particular areas or fibers for analysis. This is useful to identify asbestos in severely inhomogeneous samples. When it is determined that amphiboles may be present, repeat the above process using the appropriate high -dispersion oils until an i dentification is made or all six asbestos minerals have been ruled out. Note that percent determination must be done in the index medium 1.550 because amphiboles tend to disappear in their matching mediums. (e) Analytical procedure Note : This method presumes some knowledge of mineralogy and optical petrography. The analysis consists of three parts: The determination of whether there is asbestos present, what type is present and the determination of how much is present. The general flow of the analysis is: Gross examination. Examination under polarized light on the stereo microscope. Examination by phase -polar illumination on the compound phase microscope. Determination of species by dispersion stain. Examination by Becke line analysis may also be used; howe ver, this is usually more cumbersome for asbestos determination. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 107 Figure 1. Particle definitions showing mineral growth habits. From the U.S. Bureau of Mines Difficult samples may need to be analyzed by SEM or TEM, or the results from those techniques combined with light microscopy for a definitive identification. Identification of a particle as asbestos requires that it be asbestiform. Description of particles should follow the suggestion of Campbell. (Figure 2) For the purpose of regulation, the mi neral must be one of the six minerals covered and must be in the asbestos growth habit. Large specimen samples of asbestos generally have the gross appearance of wood. Fibers are easily parted from it. Asbestos fibers are very long compared with their w idths. The fibers have a very high tensile strength as demonstrated by bending without breaking. Asbestos fibers exist in bundles that are easily parted, show longitudinal fine structure and may be tufted at the ends showing \"bundle of sticks morphology. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 108 In the microscope some of these properties may not be observable. Amphiboles do not always show striations along their length even when they are asbestos. Neither will they always show tufting. They generally do not show a curved nature except for ve ry long fibers. Asbestos and asbestiform minerals are usually characterized in groups by extremely high aspect ratios (greater than 100:1). While aspect ratio analysis is useful for characterizing populations of fibers, it cannot be used to identify indi vidual fibers of intermediate to short aspect ratio. Observation of many fibers is often necessary to determine whether a sample consists of \"cleavage fragments\" or of asbestos fibers. Most cleavage fragments of the asbestos minerals are easily distinguis hable from true asbestos fibers. This is because true cleavage fragments usually have larger diameters than 1 micron. Internal structure of particles larger than this usually shows them to have no internal fibrillar structure. In addition, cleavage fragments of the monoclinic amphiboles show inclined extinction under crossed polars with no compensator. Asbestos fibers usually show extinction at zero degrees or ambiguous extinction if any at all. Morphologically, the larger cleavage fragments are obviou s by their blunt or stepped ends showing prismatic habit. Also, they tend to be acicular rather than filiform. Where the particles are less than 1 micron in diameter and have an aspect ratio greater than or equal to 3:1, it is recommended that the sample be analyzed by SEM or TEM if there is any question whether the fibers are cleavage fragments or asbestiform particles. Care must be taken when analyzing by electron microscopy because the interferences are different from those in light microscopy and may s tructurally be very similar to asbestos. The classic interference is between anthophyllite and biopyribole or intermediate fiber. Use the same morphological clues for electron microscopy as are used for light microscopy, e.g. fibril splitting, internal l ongitudinal striation, fraying, curvature, etc. Gross examination: Examine the sample, preferably in the glass vial. Determine the presence of any obvious fibrous component. Estimate a percentage based on previous experience and current observation. Det ermine whether any pre -preparation is necessary. Determine the number of phases present. This step may be carried out or augmented by observation at 6x to 40x under a stereo microscope. After performing any necessary pre -preparation, prepare slides of ea ch phase as described above. Two preparations of the same phase in the same index medium can be made side -by-side on the same glass for convenience. Examine with the polarizing stereo microscope. Estimate the percentage of asbestos based on the amount o f birefringent fiber present. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 109 Examine the slides on the phase -polar microscopes at magnifications of 160x and 400x. Note the morphology of the fibers. Long, thin, very straight fibers with little curvature are indicative of fibers from the amphibole fa mily. Curved, wavy fibers are usually indicative of chrysotile. Estimate the percentage of asbestos on the phase -polar microscope under conditions of crossed polars and a gypsum plate. Fibers smaller than 1.0 microns in thickness must be identified by inference to the presence of larger, identifiable fibers and morphology. If no larger fibers are visible, electron microscopy should be performed. At this point, only a tentative identification can be made. Full identification must be made with dispersio n microscopy. Details of the tests are included in the appendices. Once fibers have been determined to be present, they must be identified. Adjust the microscope for dispersion mode and observe the fibers. The microscope has a rotating stage, one polari zing element, and a system for generating dark -field dispersion microscopy (see subsection (4)(f) of this appendix). Align a fiber with its length parallel to the polarizer and note the color of the Becke lines. Rotate the stage to bring the fiber length perpendicular to the polarizer and note the color. Repeat this process for every fiber or fiber bundle examined. The colors must be consistent with the colors generated by standard asbestos reference materials for a positive identification. In n = 1.55 0, amphiboles will generally show a yellow to straw -yellow color indicating that the fiber indices of refraction are higher than the liquid. If long, thin fibers are noted and the colors are yellow, prepare further slides as above in the suggested matchin g liquids listed below: Type of asbestos Index of refraction Chrysotile n = 1.550. Amosite n = 1.670 or 1.680. Crocidolite n and 1.620. Actinolite n = 1.620. Where more than one liquid is suggested, the first is preferred; however, in some cases this liquid will not give good dispersion color. Take care to avoid interferences in the other liquid; e.g., wollastonite in n = 1.620 will give the same colors as tremolite. In n = 1.605 wolla stonite will appear yellow in all directions. Wollastonite may be determined under crossed polars as it will change from blue to yellow as it is rotated along its fiber axis by tapping on the cover slip. Asbestos minerals will not change in this way. Determination of the angle of extinction may, when present, aid in the determination of anthophyllite from tremolite. True asbestos fibers usually have 0 degree extinction or ambiguous extinction, while cleavage fragments have more definite extinction. Conti nue analysis until both preparations have been examined and all present species of asbestos are identified. If there are no fibers present, or there is less than 0.1% present, end the analysis with the minimum number of slides (2). Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 110 Some fibers have a co ating on them which makes dispersion microscopy very difficult or impossible. Becke line analysis or electron microscopy may be performed in those cases. Determine the percentage by light microscopy. TEM analysis tends to overestimate the actual percent age present. Percentage determination is an estimate of occluded area, tempered by gross observation. Gross observation information is used to make sure that the high magnification microscopy does not greatly over - or under -estimate the amount of fiber pr esent. This part of the analysis requires a great deal of experience. Satisfactory models for asbestos content analysis have not yet been developed, although some models based on metallurgical grain -size determination have found some utility. Estimation is more easily handled in situations where the grain sizes visible at about 160x are about the same and the sample is relatively homogeneous. View all of the area under the cover slip to make the percentage determination. View the fields while moving the stage, paying attention to the clumps of material. These are not usually the best areas to perform dispersion microscopy because of the interference from other materials. But, they are the areas most likely to represent the accurate percentage in the sa mple. Small amounts of asbestos require slower scanning and more frequent analysis of individual fields. Report the area occluded by asbestos as the concentration. This estimate does not generally take into consideration the difference in density of the different species present in the sample. For most samples this is adequate. Simulation studies with similar materials must be carried out to apply microvisual estimation for that purpose and is beyond the scope of this procedure. Where successive concent rations have been made by chemical or physical means, the amount reported is the percentage of the material in the \"as submitted\" or original state. The percentage determined by microscopy is multiplied by the fractions remaining after pre -preparation ste ps to give the percentage in the original sample. For example: Step 1. 60% remains after heating at 550 degrees C for 1 h. Step 2. 30% of the residue of step 1 remains after dissolution of carbonate in 0.1 m HCl. Step 3. Microvisual estimation determines that 5% of the sample is chrysotile asbestos. The reported result is: R = (Microvisual result in percent)x(Fraction remaining after step 2)x(Fraction remaining of original sample after step 1) R = (5)x(.30)x(.60) = 0.9% Report the percent and type of asbe stos present. For samples where asbestos was identified, but is less than 1.0%, report \"Asbestos present, less than 1.0%.\" There must have been at least two observed fibers or fiber bundles in the two preparations to be reported as present. For samples where asbestos was not seen, report as \"None Detected.\" Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 111 (4) Auxiliary Information Because of the subjective nature of asbestos analysis, certain concepts and procedures need to be discussed in more depth. This information will help the analyst understand wh y some of the procedures are carried out the way they are. (a) Light Light is electromagnetic energy. It travels from its source in packets called quanta. It is instructive to consider light as a plane wave. The light has a direction of travel. Perpendicul ar to this and mutually perpendicular to each other, are two vector components. One is the magnetic vector and the other is the electric vector. We shall only be concerned with the electric vector. In this description, the interaction of the vector and the mineral will describe all the observable phenomena. From a light source such a microscope illuminator, light travels in all different direction from the filament. In any given direction away from the filament, the electric vector is perpendicular to the direction of travel of a light ray. While perpendicular, its orientation is random about the travel axis. If the electric vectors from all the light rays were lined up by passing the light through a filter that would only let light rays with electric vectors oriented in one direction pass, the light would then be polarized. Polarized light interacts with matter in the direction of the electric vector. This is the polarization direction. Using this property it is possible to use polarized light to probe different materials and identify them by how they interact with light. The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant at about 2.99\u00fe108 m/s. When light travels in different materials such as air, water, minerals or oil, it does not travel at this speed. It travels slower. This slowing is a function of both the material through which the light is traveling and the wavelength or frequency of the light. In general, the more dense the material, the slower the light travels. Also, generally, the higher th e frequency, the slower the light will travel. The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to that in a material is called the index of refraction (n). It is usually measured at 589 nm (the sodium D line). If white light (light containing all the visibl e wavelengths) travels through a material, rays of longer wavelengths will travel faster than those of shorter wavelengths, this separation is called dispersion. Dispersion is used as an identifier of materials as described in Section (4)(f). (b) Material Pro perties Materials are either amorphous or crystalline. The difference between these two descriptions depends on the positions of the atoms in them. The atoms in amorphous materials are randomly arranged with no long range order. An example of an amorpho us material is glass. The atoms in crystalline materials, on the other hand, are in regular arrays and have long range order. Most of the atoms can be found in highly predictable locations. Examples of crystalline material are salt, gold, and the asbest os minerals. It is beyond the scope of this method to describe the different types of crystalline materials that can be found, or the full description of the classes into which they can fall. However, some general crystallography is provided below to give a foundation to the procedures described. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 112 With the exception of anthophyllite, all the asbestos minerals belong to the monoclinic crystal type. The unit cell is the basic repeating unit of the crystal and for monoclinic crystals can be described as hav ing three unequal sides, two 90 degrees angles and one angle not equal to 90 degrees. The orthorhombic group, of which anthophyllite is a member has three unequal sides and three 90 degrees angles. The unequal sides are a consequence of the complexity of fitting the different atoms into the unit cell. Although the atoms are in a regular array, that array is not symmetrical in all directions. There is long range order in the three major directions of the crystal. However, the order is different in each of the three directions. This has the effect that the index of refraction is different in each of the three directions. Using polarized light, we can investigate the index of refraction in each of the directions and identify the mineral or material under investigation. The indices alpha, beta, and gamma are used to identify the lowest, middle, and highest index of refraction respectively. The x direction, associated with alpha is called the fast axis. Conversely, the z direction is associated with gamm a and is the slow direction. Crocidolite has alpha along the fiber length making it \"length -fast.\" The remainder of the asbestos minerals have the gamma axis along the fiber length. They are called \"length -slow.\" This orientation to fiber length is use d to aid in the identification of asbestos. (c) Polarized Light Technique Polarized light microscopy as described in this section uses the phase -polar microscope described in Section (3)(b). A phase contrast microscope is fitted with two polarizing elements, one below and one above the sample. The polarizers have their polarization directions at right angles to each other. Depending on the tests performed, there may be a compensator between these two polarizing elements. Light emerging from a polarizing ele ment has its electric vector pointing in the polarization direction of the element. The light will not be subsequently transmitted through a second element set at a right angle to the first element. Unless the light is altered as it passes from one eleme nt to the other, there is no transmission of light. (d) Angle of Extinction Crystals which have different crystal regularity in two or three main directions are said to be anisotropic. They have a different index of refraction in each of the main directions. When such a crystal is inserted between the crossed polars, the field of view is no longer dark but shows the crystal in color. The color depends on the properties of the crystal. The light acts as if it travels through the crystal along the optical axe s. If a crystal optical axis were lined up along one of the polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the analyzer) the light would appear to travel only in that direction, and it would blink out or go dark. The difference in degrees between the fib er direction and the angle at which it blinks out is called the angle of extinction. When this angle can be measured, it is useful in identifying the mineral. The procedure for measuring the angle of extinction is to first identify the polarization direc tion in the microscope. A commercial alignment slide can be used to establish the polarization directions or use anthophyllite or another suitable mineral. This mineral has a zero degree angle of extinction and will go dark to Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 113 extinction as it aligns with the polarization directions. When a fiber of anthophyllite has gone to extinction, align the eyepiece reticle or graticule with the fiber so that there is a visual cue as to the direction of polarization in the field of view. Tape or otherwise secu re the eyepiece in this position so it will not shift. After the polarization direction has been identified in the field of view, move the particle of interest to the center of the field of view and align it with the polarization direction. For fibers, al ign the fiber along this direction. Note the angular reading of the rotating stage. Looking at the particle, rotate the stage until the fiber goes dark or \"blinks out.\" Again note the reading of the stage. The difference in the first reading and the se cond is an angle of extinction. The angle measured may vary as the orientation of the fiber changes about its long axis. Tables of mineralogical data usually report the maximum angle of extinction. Asbestos forming minerals, when they exhibit an angle of extinction, usually do show an angle of extinction close to the reported maximum, or as appropriate depending on the substitution chemistry. (e) Crossed Polars With Compensator When the optical axes of a crystal are not lined up along one of the polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the analyzer) part of the light travels along one axis and part travels along the other visible axis. This is characteristic of birefringent materials. The color depends on the difference of the two visible indices of ref raction and the thickness of the crystal. The maximum difference available is the difference between the alpha and the gamma axises. This maximum difference is usually tabulated as the birefringence of the crystal. For this test, align the fiber at 45 de grees to the polarization directions in order to maximize the contribution to each of the optical axes. The colors seen are called retardation colors. They arise from the recombination of light which has traveled through the two separate directions of th e crystal. One of the rays is retarded behind the other since the light in that direction travels slower. On recombination, some of the colors which make up white light are enhanced by constructive interference and some are suppressed by destructive inte rference. The result is a color dependent on the difference between the indices and the thickness of the crystal. The proper colors, thicknesses, and retardations are shown on a Michel -Levy chart. The three items, retardation, thickness and birefringenc e are related by the following relationship: Lambda R = t(n__) R = retardation, t = crystal thickness in micron, and alpha, gamma = indices of refraction. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 114 Examination of the equation for asbesto s minerals reveals that the visible colors for almost all common asbestos minerals and fiber sizes are shades of gray and black. The eye is relatively poor at discriminating different shades of gray. It is very good at discriminating different colors. I n order to compensate for the low retardation, a compensator is added to the light train between the polarization elements. The compensator used for this test is a gypsum plate of known thickness and birefringence. Such a compensator when oriented at 45 degrees to the polarizer direction, provides a retardation of 530 nm of the 530 nm wavelength color. This enhances the red color and gives the background a characteristic red to red -magenta color. If this \"full -wave\" compensator is in place when the asbe stos preparation is inserted into the light train, the colors seen on the fibers are quite different. Gypsum, like asbestos has a fast axis and a slow axis. When a fiber is aligned with its fast axis in the same direction as the fast axis of the gypsum p late, the ray vibrating in the slow direction is retarded by both the asbestos and the gypsum. This results in a higher retardation than would be present for either of the two minerals. The color seen is a second order blue. When the fiber is rotated 90 degrees using the rotating stage, the slow direction of the fiber is now aligned with the fast direction of the gypsum and the fast direction of the fiber is aligned with the slow direction of the gypsum. Thus, one ray vibrates faster in the fast directi on of the gypsum, and slower in the slow direction of the fiber; the other ray will vibrate slower in the slow direction of the gypsum and faster in the fast direction of the fiber. In this case, the effect is subtractive and the color seen is a first ord er yellow. As long as the fiber thickness does not add appreciably to the color, the same basic colors will be seen for all asbestos types except crocidolite. In crocidolite the colors will be weaker, may be in the opposite directions, and will be altere d by the blue absorption color natural to crocidolite. Hundreds of other materials will give the same colors as asbestos, and therefore, this test is not definitive for asbestos. The test is useful in discriminating against fiberglass or other amorphous fibers such as some synthetic fibers. Certain synthetic fibers will show retardation colors different than asbestos; however, there are some forms of polyethylene and aramid which will show morphology and retardation colors similar to asbestos minerals. This test must be supplemented with a positive identification test when birefringent fibers are present which cannot be excluded by morphology. This test is relatively ineffective for use on fibers less than 1 micron in diameter. For positive confirmatio n TEM or SEM should be used if no larger bundles or fibers are visible. (f) Dispersion Staining Dispersion microscopy or dispersion staining is the method of choice for the identification of asbestos in bulk materials. Becke line analysis is used by some laboratories and yields the same results as does dispersion staining for asbestos and can be used in lieu of dispersion staining. Dispersion staining is performed on the same platform as the phase -polar analysis with the analyzer and compensator removed. One polarizing element remains to define the direction of the light so that the different indices of refraction of the fibers may be separately determined. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part Dispersion microscopy is a dark -field technique when used for asbestos. Particles are imaged with scattered light. Light which is unscattered is blocked from reaching the eye either by the back field image mask in a McCrone objective or a back field image mask in the phase condenser. The most convenient method is to use the rotating phase condenser t o move an oversized phase ring into place. The ideal size for this ring is for the central disk to be just larger than the objective entry aperture as viewed in the back focal plane. The larger the disk, the less scattered light reaches the eye. This wil l have the effect of diminishing the intensity of dispersion color and will shift the actual color seen. The colors seen vary even on microscopes from the same manufacturer. This is due to the different bands of wavelength exclusion by different mask siz es. The mask may either reside in the condenser or in the objective back focal plane. It is imperative that the analyst determine by experimentation with asbestos standards what the appropriate colors should be for each asbestos type. The colors depend also on the temperature of the preparation and the exact chemistry of the asbestos. Therefore, some slight differences from the standards should be allowed. This is not a serious problem for commercial asbestos uses. This technique is used for identific ation of the indices of refraction for fibers by recognition of color. There is no direct numerical readout of the index of refraction. Correlation of color to actual index of refraction is possible by referral to published conversion tables. This is no t necessary for the analysis of asbestos. Recognition of appropriate colors along with the proper morphology are deemed sufficient to identify the commercial asbestos minerals. Other techniques including SEM, TEM, and XRD may be required to provide addit ional information in order to identify other types of asbestos. Make a preparation in the suspected matching high dispersion oil, e.g., n = 1.550 for chrysotile. Perform the preliminary tests to determine whether the fibers are birefringent or not. Take note of the morphological character. Wavy fibers are indicative of chrysotile while long, straight, thin, frayed fibers are indicative of amphibole asbestos. This can aid in the selection of the appropriate matching oil. The microscope is set up and the polarization direction is noted as in Section (4)(d). Align a fiber with the polarization direction. Note the color. This is the color parallel to the polarizer. Then rotate the fiber rotating the stage 90 degrees so that the polarization direction is across the fiber. This is the perpendicular position. Again note the color. Both colors must be consistent with standard asbestos minerals in the correct direction for a positive identification of asbestos. If only one of the colors is correct while t he other is not, the identification is not positive. If the colors in both directions are bluish -white, the analyst has chosen a matching index oil which is higher than the correct matching oil, e.g. the analyst has used n = 1.620 where chrysotile is pres ent. The next lower oil (Section (3)(e)) should be used to prepare another specimen. If the color in both directions is yellow -white to straw -yellow - white, this indicates that the index of the oil is lower than the index of the fiber, e.g. the preparatio n is in n = 1.550 while anthophyllite is present. Select the next higher oil (Section (3)(e)) and prepare another slide. Continue in this fashion until a positive identification of all asbestos species present has been made or all possible asbestos Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -1 General Antho phyllite, and Actinolite _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I -1, Page 116 species have been ruled out by negative results in this test. Certain plant fibers can have similar dispersion colors as asbestos. Take care to note and evaluate the morphology of the fibers or remove the plant fibers in pre -preparation. Coating material on the fibers such as carbonate or vinyl may destroy the dispersion color. Usually, there will be some outcropping of fiber which will show the colors sufficient for identification. When this is not the case, treat the sample as described in Section (3)(c) and then perform dispersion staining. Some samples will yield to Becke line analysis if they are coated or electron microscopy can be used for identification.

WAC 296 -62-08590 Appendix B: Protection from wildfire smoke information to be provided to employees (mandatory). (1) The health effects of wildfire smoke. Although there are many hazardous chemicals in wildfire smoke, the main harmful pol lutant for people who are not very close to the fire is \"particulate matter,\" the tiny particles suspended in the air. Particulate matter can irritate the lungs and cause persistent coughing, phlegm, wheezing, or difficulty breathing. Particulate matter ca n also cause more serious problems, such as reduced lung function, bronchitis, worsening of asthma, heart failure, and early death. Sensitive groups. People who are at higher risk of experiencing adverse health effects as a result of exposure to wildfire s moke include those with preexisting health conditions; those with increased duration of exposure; and those whose work results in an increased breathing rate, including outdoor workers. Although everyone is impacted by wildfire smoke exposure, sensitive gr oups are among those most likely to experience health problems from exposure to wildfire smoke. Examples of sensitive groups include: People with lung diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including bronchitis and emphyse ma, and those who smoke; People with respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, acute bronchitis, bronchiolitis, colds, flu, or those with, or recovering from COVID -19; People with existing heart or circulatory problems, such as irregular heart beat, conge stive heart failure, coronary artery disease, angina, and those who have had a heart attack or stroke; Children under 18 years old, and adults over age 65; People who are pregnant; People with diabetes; People with other medical or health conditions that can be exacerbated by exposure to wildfire smoke as determined by a physician; Outdoor workers. The Washington state department of health classifies1 outdoor workers as a sensitive group with increased risk, as well as: People with health conditions: - Lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD; - Heart diseases; - Respiratory diseases; - Diabetes.

Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -3 General Occupational Health Wildfir e Smoke _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I-3, Page 8 (2) The right to obtain medical tre atment without fear of reprisal. Employers must allow employees who show signs of injury or illness due to wildfire smoke exposure to seek medical treatment, and may not punish affected employees for seeking such treatment. Employers must also have effecti ve provisions made in advance for prompt medical treatment of employees in the event of serious injury or illness caused by wildfire smoke exposure. (3) How employees can obtain the current PM2.5 in the air. Various government agencies monitor the air at l ocations throughout Washington and report the current PM2.5 for those places. The Air Quality Index (AQI) uses the air quality data from these regulatory monitors. Although the government monitoring stations may measure several pollutants, this chapter onl y uses PM 2.5. The easiest way to find the current and forecasted PM 2.5 is to go to enviwa.ecology.wa.gov and find the nearest sensor on the map, or www.AirNow.gov and enter the zip code of the location where you will be working. The current PM 2.5 is also available from the U.S. Forest Service at tools.airfire.org. Employees who do not have access to the internet can contact their employer for the current PM 2.5. The U.S. EPA website www.enviroflash.info can transmit daily and forecasted air quality by text or email for particular cities or zip codes. If you choose to use an index such as the AQI, use the following table to find the equivalent AQI for PM 2.5. PM 2.5 in micrograms per cubic meter (g/m3) Air Quality Index for PM 2.5 (AQI) 20.5 g/m3 69 35.5 g/m3 101 555 g/m3 Beyond the AQI (4) The requirements of WAC 296 -62-085, wildfire smoke rule. If employees may be exposed to wildfire smoke, then the employer is required to do all of the following: (a) Check the current PM2.5 before and periodically during each shift. (b) Provide training to employees. (c) Implement a two -way communication system. (d) Provide engineering and administrative controls when the curre nt PM2.5 is 35.5 g/m3 (AQI 101) or more if feasible. (e) Provide respirators and encourage their use when the current PM2.5 is 35.5 g/m3 (AQI 101) or more. (f) Provide more protective respirators such as powered air purifying respirators, and require the ir use when the current PM2.5 is 555 \u00b5g/m3 or more. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -3 General Occupational Health Wildfir e Smoke _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I-3, Page 9 Employers must alert employees when at least two consecutive current PM 2.5 readings are 20.5 g/m3 (AQI 69) or more, when the current PM 2.5 is 35.5 g/m3 (AQI 101) or more, and when the current PM 2.5 is 555 \u00b5g/m3 or more, and what protective measures are available to employees. Employers must encourage employees to inform their employers if they notice the air quality is getting worse, or if they are suffering from any symptoms due to the air quality, without fear of reprisal. The employer's communication system is: _______________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ___________________ The employer's methods to protect employees from wildfire smoke. Employers must take action to protect employees from wildfire smoke when the current PM2.5 is 35.5 g/m3 (AQI 101) or more. Examples of protective methods include: (a) Locating work in enclosed structures or vehicles where the air is filtered. (b) Changing procedures such as moving workers to a place with a lower PM 2.5. (c) Reducing work t ime in areas with unfiltered air. (d) Increasing rest time and frequency, and providing a rest area with filtered air. (e) Reducing the physical intensity of the work to help lower the breathing and heart rates. The employer's control system at this worksi ___________________ (5) The limitations, and benefits of using a properly fitted respirator when exposed to wildfire smoke. Respirators can be an effective way to protect employee health by reducing exposure to wildfire smoke, when they are properly se lected and worn. Respirator use can be beneficial even when the PM2.5 is less than 20.5 g/m3, to provide additional protection. When the current PM2.5 is 20.5 g/m3 (AQI 69) or more, your employer is encouraged to make proper respirators available to work ers who may choose to use them voluntarily. When the current PM2.5 is 35.5 g/m3 (AQI 101) or more, your employer must make proper respirators available to workers who may choose to use them voluntarily. When the current PM2.5 is 555 \u00b5g/m3 or more (beyond the AQI), respirators that are more protective than N95s are required. Your employer must provide and require you to wear one of the following respirators equipped with high efficiency particulate air filters: (a) Loose -fitting powered air purifying respir powered air purifying respirator; or (d) Other respirators that are at least as effective. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -3 General Occupational Health Wildfir e Smoke _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I-3, Page 10 These respirators are more protective than N95s. You will need to have a fit test, medi cal evaluation, and must be clean shaven to use these respirators, except for loose -fitting powered air purifying respirators (PAPR), which can be worn without a fit test, and can be used with facial hair. A respirator needs to be used properly and kept cl ean. The following precautions must be taken: (a) Employers must select respirators certified for protection against the specific air contaminants at the workplace. NIOSH, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the U.S. Centers for Di sease Control and Prevention certifies respirators. A label or statement of certification should appear on the respirator or respirator packaging. It will list what the respirator is designed for (particulates, for example). Surgical masks or items worn ov er the nose and mouth such as scarves, T -shirts, and bandannas will not provide protection against wildfire smoke. A NIOSH approved N95 filtering facepiece respirator, shown in the image below, is the minimum level of protection for wildfire smoke. (b) Read and follow the manufacturer's instructions on the respirator's use, maintenance, cleaning and care, along with any warnings regarding the respirator's limitations. The manufacturer's instructions for medical evaluations, fit testing, and shaving should also be followed to ensure the best protection against wildfire smoke. (c) Do not wear respirators in areas where the air contains contaminants for which the respirator is not designed. A respirator designed to filter particles will not protect you against gases or vapors, and it will not supply oxygen. (d) You should keep track of your respirator so you do not mistakenly use someone else's respirator. (e) Particularly if you have a heart or lung problem, or if you have other medical problems and have questi ons about whether it is safe for you to wear a respirator, you should talk to your doctor. (6) How to properly put on, use, and maintain the respirators provided by the employer. To get the most protection from a respirator, there must be a tight seal arou nd the face. A respirator will provide much less protection if facial hair interferes with the seal. Loose - fitting powered air purifying respirators may be worn by people with facial hair since they do not have seals that are affected by facial hair. The p roper way to put on a respirator depends on the type and model of the respirator. For those who use an N95 or other filtering facepiece respirator that is made of filter material: (a) Place the mask over the nose and under the chin, with one strap placed b elow the ears and one strap above. (b) Pinch the metal part (if there is one) of the respirator over the top of the nose so it fits securely. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -3 General Occupational Health Wildfir e Smoke _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part I-3, Page 11 (c) Perform a seal check: (i) Cover the respirator with both hands and exhale. If air leaks where the respirator seals against the face, adjust the respirator and nosepiece and try again. When a proper fit is achieved, the respirator should bulge from the face and not leak around the seal. (ii) Cover the respirator with both hands and inhale. If air leaks where the respirator seals against the face, adjust the respirator and nosepiece and try again. When a proper fit is achieved, the respirator should collapse slightly and not leak around the seal. https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/Documents/4300//waqa%20infographic_English.pdf Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part I -3 General Occupational Health Wildfir Part I-3, Page 12 WAC 296 -62-08595 Appendix C: Calculating the air quality index for PM 2.5 (nonmandatory).

The degree of hotness or coldness measured by use of a thermometer. Vibration . Rapid movement to and fro or oscillating movement. WAC 296 -62-09004 Ionizing radiation. (1) Definitions applicable to this section. Note : Definitions also appear in some subsections. (a) Radiation . Includes alpha rays, beta rays, gamma rays, x -rays, neutrons, hi gh-speed electrons, high -speed protons, and other atomic particles; but such term does not include sound or radio waves, or visible light, or infrared or ultraviolet light. (b) Radioactive material . Any material which emits, by spontaneous nuclear disintegrat ion, corpuscular or electromagnetic emanations. (c) Restricted area . Any area access to which is controlled by the employer for purposes of protection of individuals from exposure to radiation or radioactive materials. (d) Unrestricted area . Any area access to w hich is not controlled by the employer for purposes of protection of individuals from exposure to radiation or radioactive materials. (e) Dose . The quantity of ionizing radiation absorbed, per unit of mass, by the body or by any portion of the body. When the provisions in this section specify a dose during a period of time, the dose is the total quantity of radiation absorbed, per unit of mass, by the body or by any portion of the body during such period of time. Several different units of dose are in curren t use. Definitions of units used in this section are set forth in subdivisions (f) and (g) of this subsection. (f) Rad. A measure of the dose of any ionizing radiation to body tissues in terms of the energy absorbed per unit of mass of the tissue. One rad i s the dose corresponding to the absorption of 100 ergs per gram of tissue (1 millirad (mrad) = 0.001 rad).

A measure of the dose of any ionizing radiation to body tissue in terms of its estimated biological effect relative to a dose of 1 roentgen ( r) of x -rays (1 millirem (mrem) = 0.001 rem). The relation of the rem to other dose units depends upon the biological effect under consideration and upon the conditions for irradiation. Each of the following is considered to be equivalent to a dose of 1 rem: A dose of 1 roentgen due to x - or gamma radiation; A dose of 1 rad due to x -, gamma, or beta radiation; A dose of 0.1 rad due to neutrons or high energy protons; A dose of 0.05 rad due to particles heavier than protons and with sufficient energy to re ach the lens of the eye; If it is more convenient to measure the neutron flux, or equivalent, than to determine the neutron dose in rads, as provided in item (iii) of this subdivision, 1 rem of neutron radiation may, for purposes of the provisions in this section be assumed to be equivalent to 14 million neutrons per square centimeter incident upon the body; or, if there is sufficient information to estimate with reasonable accuracy the approximate distribution in energy of the neutrons, the incident number of neutrons per square centimeter equivalent to 1 rem may be estimated from the following table: Neutron Flux Dose Equivalents Neutron Energy (millon electron volts (Mev)) Number of Neutrons per Square centimeter Equivalent to a Dose of 1 rem (neutron/cm2) Average flux To deliver 100 millirem in 40 hours (neutrons/cm2 per sec.)

A sufficient number of signal unit s must be installed such that the requirements of item (i) of this subdivision are met at every location where an individual may be present whose immediate, rapid, and complete evacuation is essential. The signal must be unique in the plant or facility in which it is installed. The minimum duration of the signal must be sufficient to ensure that all affected persons hear the signal. The signal -generating system must respond automatically to an initiating event without requiring any human action to sound the signal. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part J -1 General Occupational Health Physical Agents _____________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________ Part J -1, Page 11 (b) Design objectives. The signal -generating system must be designed to incorporate components which enable the system to produce the desired signal each time it is activated within one -half second of activation. The signal -generating system must be provided with an automatically activated secondary power supply which is adequate to simultaneously power all emergency equipment to which it is connected, if operation during power failure is necessary, except in those systems using batteries as the prim ary source of power. All components of the signal -generating system must be located to provide maximum practicable protection against damage in case of fire, explosion, corrosive atmosphere, or other environmental extremes consistent with adequate system p erformance. The signal -generating system must be designed with the minimum number of components necessary to make it function as intended, and should utilize components which do not require frequent servicing such as lubrication or cleaning. Where several activating devices feed activating information to a central signal generator, failure of any activating device must not render the signal -generator system inoperable to activating information from the remaining devices. The signal -generating system must be designed to enhance the probability that alarm occurs only when immediate evacuation is warranted. The number of false alarms must not be so great that the signal will come to be disregarded and shall be low enough to minimize personal injuries or excess ive property damage that might result from such evacuation. (c) Testing. Initial tests, inspections, and checks of the signal -generating system must be made to verify that the fabrication and installation were made in accordance with design plans and specifica tions and to develop a thorough knowledge of the performance of the system and all components under normal and hostile conditions. Once the system has been placed in service, periodic tests, inspections, and checks must be made to minimize the possibility of malfunction. Following significant alterations or revisions to the system, tests and checks similar to the initial installation tests must be made. Tests must be designed to minimize hazards while conducting the tests. Prior to normal operation the sign al-generating system shall be checked physically and functionally to ensures reliability and to demonstrate accuracy and performance. Specific tests must include: (A) All power sources. (B) Calibration and calibration stability.

See tables in WAC 402-24-220, radiation. (1) Introduction . Employees must be protected from exposure to hazardous levels of nonionizing radiation. Health standards have been established for ultraviolet, radiofrequency/microwave, and laser radiations which must be used to promote a healthful working environment. These standards refer to levels of nonionizing radiation and represent conditions under which it is believed that nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed day after d ay without adverse effects. They are based on the best available information from experimental studies. Because of the wide variations in individual susceptibility, exposure of an occasional individual at, or even below, the permissible limit, may result in discomfort, aggravation of a preexisting condition, or physiological damage. (a) Permissible exposure limits (PELs) refer to a time weighted average (TWA) of exposure for an 8 -hour work day within a 40 -hour workweek. Exceptions are those limits which are given a ceiling value. (b) These PELs should be interpreted and applied only by technically qualified persons. (c) Ceiling value. There are nonionizing radiations which produce physiological responses from short intense exposure and the PELs for these radiations are more appropriately based on this particular hazard. Nonionizing radiations with this type of hazard are best controlled by a ceiling value which is a maximum level of exposure which must not be exceeded. (2) The employer must establish and maintain a prog ram for the control and monitoring of nonionizing radiation hazards. This program must provide employees adequate supervision, training, facilities, equipment, and supplies, for the control and assessment of nonionizing radiation hazards. (3) Radiofrequency/m icrowave radiation permissible exposure limits . (a) Definition: Partial body exposure . The case in which only the hands and forearms or the feet and legs below the knee are exposed. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part J -1 General Occupational Health Physical Agents _____________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________ Part J -1, Page 17 (b) Warning symbol. The warning symbol for radiofrequency/microwave radiation must consist of a red isosceles triangle above an inverted black isosceles triangle, separated and outlined by an aluminum color border. The words \"Warning - Radiofrequency/microwave radiation hazard\" must appear in the upper triangle. See Figure 1. All a reas where entry may result in an exposure to radiofrequency/microwave radiation in excess of the PEL must have a warning symbol prominently displayed at their entrance. American National Standard Safety Color Code for Marking Physical Hazards and the Iden tification of Certain Equipment, Z53.1 -1953, must be used for color specification. All lettering and the border must be of aluminum color. The inclusion and choice of warning information or precautionary instructions is at the discretion of the user. If such information is included it must appear in the lower triangle of the warning symbol. 1. Place handling and mounting instructions on reverse side. 2. D = Scaling Unit. 3. Lettering: Ratio of letter height to thickness of letter lines.

Symbol is square, triangles are right -angle isosceles. (c) These PELs refer to radiofrequency/microwave radiation exposures in the frequency range of 300 kHz to 100 GHz. Ba sed on current knowledge, it is believed that workers may be exposed at these PELs without adverse health effects. Table I gives the PELs in terms of the mean squared electric (E2) and magnetic (H2) field strengths and in terms of the equivalent plane -wave free-space power density, as a function of frequency. The average exposure for any 6 minute (0.1 hour) period must not exceed the PEL. Measurements must be made at distances of 5 cm or greater from any object. For mixed or broadband fields at a number of frequencies for which there are different PELs, the fraction of the PEL incurred within each frequency interval must be determined and the sum of these fractions must not exceed unity. PELs given in Table I for frequencies between 300 kHz and 1 GHz may be exceeded for partial body exposures if the output power of the radiating device is 7 watts or less.

(a) Definitions. Diffuse reflection . A change of the spatial distribution of a beam of radiation when it is reflected in many directions by a surface or medium. Specular reflection . A mirror like reflection. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part J -1 General Occupational Health Physical Agents _____________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________ Part J -1, Page 19 Accessible radiation . Laser radiation to which human access is possible. (b) All lasers and laser systems must be classified in accordance with the Federal Laser Product Performance Standards (21 CFR 1040.10) or, if manufactured prior to August 2 , 1976, in accordance with ANSI Z136.1 -1980. Class I. Laser systems that are considered to be incapable of producing damaging radiation levels and are thereby exempt from control measures. This is a no hazard category. Class II. Visible wavelength laser systems that have a low hazard potential because of the expected aversion response. There is some possibility of injury if stared at. This is a low hazard category. Class III. Laser systems in which intrabeam viewing of the direct beam or specular refle ctions of the beam may be hazardous. This class is further subdivided into IIIa and IIIb. This is a moderate hazard category. Class IV. Laser systems whose direct or diffusely reflected radiation may be hazardous and where the beam may constitute a fire hazard. Class IV systems require the use of controls that prevent exposure of the eye and skin to specular or diffuse reflections of the beam. This is a high hazard category. (c) Warning signs and classification labels shall be prepared in accordance with 21 CFR 1040.10 when classifying lasers and laser systems, and ANSI Z136.1 - 1980 when using classified lasers and laser systems. All signs and labels must be conspicuously displayed. The signal word \" CAUTION \" must be used with all signs and labels associate d with Class II and Class IIIa lasers and laser systems. The signal word \" DANGER \" MUST be used with all signs and labels associated with Class IIIb and Class IV lasers and laser systems. (d) Personal protective equipment must be provided at no cost to the empl oyee and must be worn whenever operational conditions or maintenance of lasers may result in a potentially hazardous exposure. Protective eyewear must be specifically designed for protection against radiation of the wavelength and radiant energy of the las er or laser system. Ocular exposure shall not exceed the recommendations of ANSI Z136.1 - 1980. For Class IV lasers and laser systems protective eyewear must be worn for all operational conditions or maintenance which may result in exposures to laser radiation. (e) Engineering controls must be used whenever feasible to reduce the accessible radiation levels for Class IV lasers and laser systems to a lower classification level. These controls may include, but are not limited to: Protective housings, interlock s, optical system attenuators, enclosed beam paths, remote controls, beam stops, and emission delays with audible warnings. (f) All employees who may be exposed to laser radiation shall receive laser safety training. The training must ensure that the employee s are knowledgeable of the potential hazards and control measures for the laser equipment in use. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part J -1 General Occupational Health Physical Agents _____________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________ Part J -1, Page 20 (5) Ultraviolet radiation . (a) These permissible exposure limits refer to ultraviolet radiation in the spectral region between 200 and 400 nanometer (nm) and repres ent conditions under which it is believed that nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed without adverse effect. These values for exposure of the eye or the skin apply to ultraviolet radiation from arcs, gas, and vapor discharges, and incandescent sour ces, but do not apply to ultraviolet lasers or solar radiation. These levels should not be used for determining exposure of photosensitive individuals to ultraviolet radiation. These values must be used in the control of exposure to continuous sources whe re the exposure relation must not be less than 0.1 sec. (b) The permissible exposure limit for occupational exposure to ultraviolet radiation incident upon skin or eye where irradiance values are known and exposure time is controlled are as follows: For the ne ar ultraviolet spectral region (320 to 400 nanometer (nm)), total irradiance incident upon the unprotected skin or eye must not exceed 1.0 milliwatt/sq. centimeter for periods greater than 10 3 seconds (approximately 16 minutes) and for exposure times less than 10 3 seconds shall not exceed one Joule/sq. centimeter. For the actinic ultraviolet spectral region (200 - 315 nm), radiant exposure incident upon the unprotected skin or eye must not exceed the values given in Table 4 within an 8 -hour period. To deter mine the effective irradiance of a broadband source weighted against the peak of the spectral effectiveness curve (270 nanometer (nm)), the following weighting formulas shall be used. Eeff = (E-Lambda) (S -Lambda) (Delta -Lambda) Where: Eeff = relative a 270nm E-Lambda = spectral irradiance in S-Lambda = relative spectral effectiveness (unitless) Delta -Lambda = band width in nanometers Permissible exposure time in seconds for e xposure to actinic ultraviolet radiation incident upon the unprotected skin or eye may be computed by dividing 0.003 Joules/sq. centimeter by Eeff in Watts/sq. centimeter. The exposure time may also be determined using Table 5 which provides exposure times corresponding to effective irradiances in W/cm2.

(1) Employees exposed to pressures above normal atmospheric pressure which may produce physiological injury must adhere to decompression schedules or other tables as are or may be adopted by the department of lab or and industries: for example, state of Washington \"safety standards for compressed air work\" and \"safety standards for commercial diving operations.\" The employer must provide and supervise the use of decompression equipment and schedules in accordance with applicable requirements. (2) If no specific requirements prevail for an unusual condition, a plan based on the recommendations of professionally qualified advisors, experienced with hazards associated with such exposures, must be followed by both the emp loyer and employee. WAC 296 -62-09009 Vibration. Reasonable precautions must be taken to protect workmen against the hazardous effects of unavoidable exposure to vibrations. WAC 296 -62-09013 Temperature, radiant heat, or temperature -humidity combinations. Workmen subjected to temperature extremes, radiant heat, humidity, or air velocity combinations which, over a period of time, are likely to produce physiological responses which are harmful must be afforded protection by use of adequate controls, methods o r procedures, or protective clothing. This must not be construed to apply to normal occupations under atmospheric conditions which may be expected in the area except that special provisions which are required by other regulations for certain areas or occup ations must prevail. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part J -1 General Occupational Health Physical ____________________________________________________________________________________ Part J -1, Page 296 -62-095 through 296 -62-09560: (1) Applies to all employers with employees performing work in an outdoor environment. (2) Applies to outdoor work enviro nments when employees are exposed to outdoor heat. (3) Does not apply to incidental exposure. Incidental exposure means an employee is not required to perform a work activity outdoors for more than 15 minutes in any 60 -minute period. This exception may b e applied every hour during the work shift. (4) Does not apply to work within the scope of chapter 296-305 WAC, Safety standards for firefighters or chapter 296-307 WAC, Safety standards for agriculture. WAC 296 -62-09520 Definitions. (1) Acclimatization . The body's temporary adaptation to work in heat that occurs as a pe rson is exposed to it over a period of seven to 14 days depending on the amount of recent work in the heat and the individual factors. Acclimatization can be lost after seven consecutive days away from working in the heat. (2) Buddy system . A system wher e individuals are paired or teamed up into work groups so each employee can be observed by at least one other member of the group to monitor and report signs and symptoms of heat -related illness. (3) Drinking water . Potable water that is suitable to drink and suitably cool in temperature. Other acceptable beverages include drinking water packaged as a consumer product , and electrolyte -replenishing beverages (i.e., sports drinks) that do not contain high amounts of sugar, caffeine , or both such as energy d rinks . (4) Engineering controls . The use of devices to reduce exposure and aid cooling , not including wearable items. Examples of engineering controls include fans, misting stations, air-conditioning, etc. (5) Heat -related illness . A medical condition r esulting from the body's inability to cope with a particular heat load, and includes, but is not limited to, heat cramps, heat rash, heat exhaustion, fainting, and heat stroke. (6) Outdoor environment. An environment where work activities are conducted out side. Work environments such as inside vehicle cabs, sheds, and tents or other structures may be considered an outdoor environment if the environmental factors affecting temperature are not m anaged by engineering controls. (7) Risk factors for heat -relate d illness . Conditions that increase susceptibility for heat - related illness including: (a) Environmental factors such as air temperature, relative humidity, air movement, radiant heat from the sun and other sources, conductive heat sources such as the ground; Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part J -1 General Occupational Health Physical Agents _____________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________ Part J -1, Page 26 (b) Workload (light, moderate, or heavy) and work duration; (c) Personal protective equipment and clothing worn by employees; and (d) Personal factors such as age, medications, physical fitness, and pregnancy. (8) Shade . A blockage of direct sunlig ht. Shade may be provided by any natural or artificial means that does not expose employees to unsafe or unhealthy conditions and that does not deter or discourage access or use. One indicator that blockage is sufficient is when objects do not cast a sha dow in the area of blocked sunlight. Shade is not adequate when heat in the area of shade defeats the purpose of shade, which is to allow the body to cool. For example, a car sitting in the sun does not provide acceptable shade to a person sitting in it, unless the car is running with air -conditioning. (9) Vapor barrier clothing .

(b) Inlet or supply ductwork used to transport makeup air to spray booths or surrounding areas must be constructed of noncombustible materials. If negative pressure exists within inlet ductwork, all seams and joints must be sealed if the re is a possibility of infiltration of harmful quantities of noxious gases, fumes, or mists from areas through which ductwork passes. Inlet ductwork must be sized in accordance with volume flow requirements and provide design air requirements at the spray booth. Inlet ductwork must be so supported throughout its length to sustain at least its own weight plus any negative pressure which is exerted upon it under normal operating conditions. (c) Ducts must be so constructed as to provide structural strength and st ability at least equivalent to sheet steel of not less than the following thickness: Diameter or Greater Dimension (U.S. gauge) Up to 8 inches inclusive No. 24 Over 8 inches to 18 inches inclusive No. 22 Over 18 inches to 30 inches inclusive No. 20 Over 30 inches No. 18 Exhaust ductwork must be adequately supported throughout its length to sustain its weight plus any normal accumulation in interior during normal operating conditions and any negative pressure exerted upon it. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part L General Occupational Health Standards Atmospheres and Ventilation _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part L, Page 4 Exhaust ductwork must be sized in accordance with good design practice which shall include consideration of fan capacity, length of duct, number of turns and elbows, variation in size, volume, and character of materials being exhausted. See American National Standard Z9.2 -1960 for further details and explanation concerning elements of design. Longitudinal joints in sheet steel ductwork must be either lock -seamed, riveted, or welded. For other than steel construction, equivalent securing of joints must be provided. Circumferenti al joints in ductwork must be substantially fastened together and lapped in the direction of airflow. At least every fourth joint must be provided with connecting flanges, bolted together or of equivalent fastening security. Inspection or clean -out doors must be provided for every 9 to 12 feet of running length for ducts up to 12 inches in diameter, but the distance between clean -out doors may be greater for larger pipes. (See 8.3.21 of American National Standard Z9.1 -1960.) A clean -out door or doors must be provided for servicing the fan, and where necessary, a drain shall be provided. Where ductwork passes through a combustible roof or wall, the roof or wall must be protected at the point of penetration by open space or fire -resistive material between t he duct and the roof or wall.

Ductwork used for ventilating any process covered in this standard must not be connected to ducts ventilating any other process or any chimney or flue used for conveying any products of combustion. (6) Velocity and air flow requirements . (a) Except where a spray booth has an adequate air replacement system, the velocity of air into all openings of a spray booth must be not less than that specified in Table 14 for the operating conditions specified. An adequate air replacement system is one which introduces replacement air upstream or above the object being sprayed and is so designed that the velocity of air in the booth cross section is not less than that specified in Table 14 when measured upstream or above the object being sprayed.

(2) Cross drafts can be eliminated through proper design and such design should be sought. Cross drafts in excess of 100 fpm (feet per minute) should not be permitted. (3) Excessive air pressures result in loss of both efficiency and material waste in addition to creating a backlash that may carry overspray and fumes into adjacent work areas. (4) Booths should be designed with velocity shown in the column headed \"Design.\" However, booths operating with velocities shown in the column headed \"Range\" are in compliance with this standard. (b) In addition to the requirements in (6)(a ) of this section the total air volume exhausted through a spray booth must be such as to dilute solvent vapor to at least 25 percent of the lower explosive limit of the solvent being sprayed. An example of the method of calculating this volume is given b elow. Example: To determine the lower explosive limits of the most common solvents used in spray finishing, see Table 15. Column 1 gives the number of cubic feet of vapor per gallon of solvent and column 2 gives the lower explosive limit (LEL) in percenta ge by volume of air. Note that the quantity of solvent will be diminished by the quantity of solids and nonflammable contained in the finish. To determine the volume of air in cubic feet necessary to dilute the vapor from 1 gallon of solvent to 25 percent of the lower explosive limit, apply the following formula: Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part L General Occupational Health Standards Atmospheres and Ventilation _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part L, Page 6 Dilution volume 4 (100 -LEL) (cubic feet of vapor per gallon) required per = ____________________________________ gallon of solvent LEL Using toluene as the solvent. (1) LEL of toluene fr om Table 15, column 2, is 1.4 percent. (2) Cubic feet of vapor per gallon from Table 15, column 1, is 30.4 cubic feet per gallon. (3) Dilution volume required = 4 (100 -1.4) 30.4 ______________ = 8,564 cubic feet. 1.4 (4) To convert to cubic feet per minut e of required ventilation, multiply the dilution volume required per gallon of solvent by the number of gallons of solvent evaporated per minute.

Where downdraft booths are provided with doors, such doors must be closed when spray painting. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part L General Occupational Health Standards Atmospheres and Ventilation _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part L, Page 8 (7) Mak e-up air . (a) Clean fresh air, free of contamination from adjacent industrial exhaust systems, chimneys, stacks, or vents, must be supplied to a spray booth or room in quantities equal to the volume of air exhausted through the spray booth. (b) Where a spray booth or room receives make -up air through self -closing doors, dampers, or louvers, they must be fully open at all times when the booth or room is in use for spraying. The velocity of air through such doors, dampers, or louvers must not exceed 200 feet per min ute. If the fan characteristics are such that the required air flow through the booth will be provided, higher velocities through the doors, dampers, or louvers may be used. (c) Where the air supply to a spray booth or room is filtered, the fan static pressu re must be calculated on the assumption that the filters are dirty to the extent that they require cleaning or replacement. The rating of filters must be governed by test data supplied by the manufacturer of the filter. A pressure gauge must be installed to show the pressure drop across the filters. This gauge must be marked to show the pressure drop at which the filters require cleaning or replacement. Filters must be replaced or cleaned whenever the pressure drop across them becomes excessive or whenev er the air flow through the face of the booth falls below that specified in Table 14. (d) Means of heating make -up air to any spray booth or room, before or at the time spraying is normally performed, must be provided in all places where the outdoor temperatu re may be expected to remain below 55 F. for appreciable periods of time during the operation of the booth except where adequate and safe means of radiant heating for all operating personnel affected is provided. The replacement air during the heating se asons must be maintained at not less than 65 F. at the point of entry into the spray booth or spray room. When otherwise unheated make -up air would be at a temperature of more than 10 F. below room temperature, its temperature must be regulated as provi ded in section 3.6 of ANSI Z9.2 -1960. As an alternative to an air replacement system complying with the preceding section, general heating of the building in which the spray room or booth is located may be employed provided that all occupied parts of the b uilding are maintained at not less than 65 F. when the exhaust system is in operation or the general heating system supplemented by other sources of heat may be employed to meet this requirement. No means of heating make -up air must be located in a spray booth. Where make -up air is heated by coal or oil, the products of combustion must not be allowed to mix with the make -up air, and the products of combustion must be conducted outside the building through a flue terminating at a point remote from all point s where make -up air enters the building. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part L General Occupational Health Standards Atmospheres and Ventilation _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part L, Page 9 Where make -up air is heated by gas, and the products of combustion are not mixed with the make -up air but are conducted through an independent flue to a point outside the building remote from all points where make -up air enters the building, it is not necessary to comply with (7)(d)(vi) of this section. Where make -up air to any manually operated spray booth or room is heated by gas and the products of combustion are allowed to mix with the supply air, the following precautions must be taken: (A) The gas must have a distinctive and strong enough odor to warn workmen in a spray booth or room of its presence if in an unburned state in the make -up air. (B) The maximum rate of gas supply to the make -up air heater burners must not exceed that which would yield in excess of 200 r.p.m . (parts per million) of carbon monoxide or 2,000 r.p.m . of total combustible gases in the mixture if the unburned gas upon the occurrence of flame failure were mixed with all of the make -up air supplie d. (C) A fan must be provided to deliver the mixture of heated air and products of combustion from the plenum chamber housing the gas burners to the spray booth or room. (8) Scope . Spray booths or spray rooms are to be used to enclose or confine all spray finishi ng operations covered by this paragraph. This paragraph does not apply to the spraying of the exteriors of buildings, fixed tanks, or similar structures, nor to small portable spraying apparatus not used repeatedly in the same location. WAC 296 -62-135 Ox ygen deficient atmospheres . (1) Definition . A lack of sufficient oxygen is deemed to exist if the atmosphere at sea level has less than 19.5% oxygen by volume or has a partial pressure of oxygen of 148 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or less. This may deviate when working at higher elevations and should be determined for an individual location. Factors such as acclimatization, physical conditions of the persons involved, etc., must be considered for such circumstances and conditions. (2) Entering areas with possibl e oxygen deficient atmospheres . Workers entering any area where a lack of sufficient oxygen is probable must be supplied with and must use approved equipment (for specific requirements see applicable provisions of chapters 296-62, 296-307 (Part -U3), 296-809 and 296-841 WAC) capable of providing safe respirable air, or prior to entry and at all times when workers are in such areas a sufficient supply of safe, respirable air must be provided. All workers so exposed must be under co nstant observation. If the oxygen content is unknown or may change during occupation, tests must be required prior to and during occupation of questionable areas.

(4) Exposure monitoring and measurement . (a) General. For the purposes of this section, employee exposure is that exposure which would occur if the employee were not using a respirator. The sampling device to be used must be either the vertical elutriator cotton dust sampler or an equivalent instrument. If an alternative to the vertical elutriator cotton dust sampler is used, the employer must establish equivalency by demonstrating that the alternative sampling devices: (A) It collects respirable particulates in the same range as the vertical elutriator (approximately 15 microns); (B) Replicate exposure data used to establish equivalency are collected in side-by-side field and laboratory comparisons; and (C) A minimum of 100 samples ov er the range of 0.5 to 2 times the permissible exposure limit are collected, and ninety percent of these samples have an accuracy range of plus or minus twenty -five percent of the vertical elutriator reading with a ninety -five percent confidence level as demonstrated by a statistically valid protocol. (An acceptable protocol for demonstrating equivalency is described in Appendix E of this section.) WISHA will issue a written opinion stating that an instrument is equivalent to a vertical elutriator cotton d ust sampler if: (A) A manufacturer or employer requests an opinion in writing and supplies the following information: (I) Sufficient test data to demonstrate that the instrument meets the requirements specified in this paragraph and the protocol specified in Appen dix E of this section; (II) Any other relevant information about the instrument and its testing requested by WISHA; and (III) A certification by the manufacturer or employer that the information supplied is accurate; and (B) If WISHA finds, based on information submitted about the instrument, that the instrument meets the requirements for equivalency specified by this subsection. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part N General Occupational He alth Standards Cotton Dust _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part N, Page 4 (b) Initial monitoring. Each employer who has a place of employment within the scope of subsections (1)(a), (d) or (e) of this section must condu ct monitoring by obtaining measurements which are representative of the exposure of all employees to airborne concentrations of lint -free respirable cotton dust over an eight -hour period. The sampling program must include at least one determination during each shift for each work area. (c) Periodic monitoring. If the initial monitoring required by (4)(b) of this section or any subsequent monitoring reveals employee exposure to be at or below the permissible exposure limit, the employer shall repeat the monitor ing for those employees at least annually. If the initial monitoring required by (4)(b) of this section or any subsequent monitoring reveals employee exposure to be above the PEL, the employer shall repeat the monitoring for those employees at least every 6 months. Whenever there has been a production, process, or control change which may result in new or additional exposure to cotton dust, or whenever the employer has any other reason to suspect an increase in employee exposure, the employer must repeat th e monitoring and measurements for those employees affected by the change or increase. (d) Employee notification. Within 15 working days after the receipt of monitoring results, the employer must notify each employee in writing of the exposure measurements whic h represent that employee's exposure. Whenever the results indicate that the employee's exposure exceeds the applicable permissible exposure limit specified in subsection (3) of this section, the employer must include in the written notice a statement that the permissible exposure limit was exceeded and a description of the corrective action taken to reduce exposure below the permissible exposure limit. (5) Methods of compliance . (a) Engineering and work practice controls. The employer must institute engineering a nd work practice controls to reduce and maintain employee exposure to cotton dust at or below the permissible exposure limit specified in subsection (3) of this section, except to the extent that the employer can establish that such controls are not feasib le. (b) Whenever feasible engineering and work practice controls are not sufficient to reduce employee exposure to or below the permissible exposure limit, the employer must nonetheless institute these controls to immediately reduce exposure to the lowest feasible level, and must supplement these controls with the use of respirators which must comply with the provisions of subsection (6) of this section. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part N General Occupational He alth Standards Cotton Dust _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part N, Page 5 (c) Compliance program. Where the most recent exposure monitoring data indicates that any employee is exposed to cotton dust levels greater than the permissible exposure limit, the employer must establish and implement a written program sufficient to reduce exposures to or below the permissible exposure limit solely by means of engineering controls and work practi ces as required by (a) of this subsection. The written program must include at least the following: (A) A description of each operation or process resulting in employee exposure to cotton dust; (B) Engineering plans and other studies used to determine the controls for each process; (C) A report of the technology considered in meeting the permissible exposure limit; (D) Monitoring data obtained in accordance with subsection (4) of this section; (E) A detailed schedule for development and implementation of engineering and work p ractice controls, including exposure levels projected to be achieved by such controls; (F) Work practice program; and (G) Other relevant information. The employer's schedule as set forth in the compliance program, must project completion of the implementation of t he compliance program no later than March 27, 1984 or as soon as possible if monitoring after March 27, 1984 reveals exposures over the PEL, except as provided in subsection (13)(b)(ii)(B) of this section. The employer must complete the steps set forth in his program by the dates in the schedule. Written programs must be submitted, upon request, to the director, and must be available at the worksite for examination and copying by the director, and any affected employee or their designated representatives. The written programs required under subsection (5)(c) of this section must be revised and updated at least every six months to reflect the current status of the program and current exposure levels. (d) Mechanical ventilation. When mechanical ventilation is use d to control exposure, measurements which demonstrate the effectiveness of the system to control exposure, such as capture velocity, duct velocity, or static pressure must be made at reasonable intervals. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part N General Occupational He alth Standards Cotton Dust _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part N, Page 6 (6) Use of respirators . (a) General. For employees who u se respirators required by this section, the employer must provide each employee an appropriate respirator that complies with the requirements of this section. Respirators must be used during: Periods necessary to install or implement feasible engineering controls and work -practice controls; Maintenance and repair activities for which engineering and work -practice controls are not feasible; Work operations for which feasible engineering and work -practice controls are not yet sufficient to reduce employee e xposure to or below the permissible exposure limits; Work operations specified under subsection (7)(a) of this section; Periods for which an employee requests a respirator. (b) Respirator program. The employer must develop, implement and maintain a respiratory protection program as required by chapter 296-842 WAC, Respirators, which covers each employee required by this chapter to use a respirator. Whenever a physician determines that an employee who works in an area in which the cotton -dust concentration exceeds the PEL is unable to use a respirator, including a powered air -purifying respirator, the employee must be given the opportunity to transfer to an available pos ition, or to a position that becomes available later, that has a cotton -dust concentration at or below the PEL. The employer must ensure that such employees retain their current wage rate or other benefits as a result of the transfer. (c) Respirator selection . The employer must: Select and provide to employees the appropriate respirators by following requirements in this section and WAC 296-842-13005 found in the res pirator rule. Provide employees with a powered air -purifying respirator (PAPR) when the employee chooses to use a PAPR instead of a negative -pressure air -purifying respirator, and the PARP will provide adequate protection. Limit the use of filtering facepi ece respirators for protection against cotton dust to concentrations less than or equal to 5 times (5x) the PEL. Provide high -efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters or N -, R-, or P -100 series filters for powered air -purifying ative -pressure air - purifying respirators when used in cotton dust concentrations greater than 10 times (10x) the PEL. (7) Work practices. Each employer must , regardless of the level of employee exposure, immediately establish and implement a written program o f work practices which must minimize cotton dust exposure. The following must be included where applicable: Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part N General Occupational He alth Standards Cotton Dust _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part N, Page 7 (a) Compressed air \"blow down\" cleaning shall be prohibited, where alternative means are feasible. Where compressed air is used for cleaning, the em ployees performing the \"blow down\" or \"blow off\" must wear suitable respirators. Employees whose presence is not required to perform \"blow down\" or \"blow off\" must leave the area affected by the \"blow down\" or \"blow off\" during this cleaning operation. (b) Cleaning of clothing or floors with compressed air must be prohibited. (c) Floor sweeping must be performed with a vacuum or with methods designed to minimize dispersal of dust. (d) In areas where employees are exposed to concentrations of cotton dust greater than the permissible exposure limit, cotton and cotton waste must be stacked, sorted, baled, dumped, removed or otherwise handled by mechanical means, except where the employer can show that it is infeasible to do so. Where infeasible, the method used for handl ing cotton and cotton waste must be the method which reduces exposure to the lowest level feasible. (8) Medical surveillance . (a) General. Each employer covered by the standard must institute a program of medical surveillance for all employees exposed to cotton du st. The employer must ensure that all medical examinations and procedures are performed by or under the supervision of a licensed physician and are provided without cost to the employee.

Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part N General Occupational He alth Standards Cotton Dust _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part N, Page 14 WAC 296 -62-14535 Appendix A --Air sampling and analytical procedures for determining concentrations of cotton dust. (1) Sampling locations. The s ampling procedures must be designed so that samples of the actual dust concentrations are collected accurately and consistently and reflect the concentrations of dust at the place and time of sampling. Sufficient number of six -hour area samples in each di stinct work area of the plant should be collected at locations which provide representative samples of air to which the worker is exposed. In order to avoid filter overloading, sampling time may be shortened when sampling in dusty areas. Samples in each work area should be gathered simultaneously or sequentially during a normal operating period. The daily time -weighted average (TWA) exposure of each worker can then be determined by using the following formula: Summation of hours spent in each location and the dust concentration in that location. Total hours exposed A time -weighted average concentration should be computed for each worker and properly logged and maintained on file for review. (2) Sampling equipment . (a) Sampler. The instrument selected for monitor ing is the Lumsden -Lynch vertical elutriator. It should operate at a flow rate of 7.4 \u00b10.2 liters/minute. The samplers should be cleaned prior to sampling. The pumps should be monitored during sampling. (b) Filter holder. A three -piece cassette constructed of polystyrene designed to hold a 37-mm diameter filter should be used. Care must be exercised to insure that an adequate seal exists between elements of the cassette. (c) Filters and support pads. The membrane filters used should be polyvinyl chloride with a 5-um pore size and 37 -mm diameter. A support pad, commonly called a backup pad, should be used under the filter membrane in the field monitor cassette. (d) Balance. A balance sensitive to 10 micrograms should be used. (3) Instrument calibration procedure. Samplers must be calibrated when first received from the factory, after repair, and after receiving any abuse. The samplers should be calibrated in the laboratory both before they are used in the field and after they have been used to collect a large number of field samples. The primary standard, such as a spirometer or other standard calibrating instruments such as a wet test meter or a large bubble meter or dry gas meter, should be used. Instructions for calibration with the wet test meter follow. If another calibration device is selected, equivalent procedures should be used: (a) Level wet test meter. Check the water level which should just touch the calibration point at the left side of the meter. If water level is low, add water 1 -2 F. warmer than room temperature of till point. Run the meter for thirty minutes before calibration; (b) Place the polyvinyl chloride membrane filter in the filter cassette; (c) Assemble the calibration sampling train; Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part N General Occupational He alth Standards Cotton Dust _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part N, Page 15 (d) Connect the wet test meter to the train. The pointer on the me ter should run clockwise and a pressure drop of not more than 1.0 inch of water indicated. If the pressure drop is greater than 1.0, disconnect and check the system; (e) Operate the system for ten minutes before starting the calibration; (f) Check the vacuum gaug e on the pump to insure that the pressure drop across the orifice exceeds seventeen inches of mercury; (g) Record the following on calibration data sheets: Wet test meter reading, start and finish; Elapsed time, start and finish (at least two minutes); Pressur e drop at manometer; Air temperature; Barometric pressure; and Limiting orifice number. (h) Calculate the flow rate and compare against the flow of 7.4 \u00b10.2 liters/minute. If flow is between these limits, perform calibration again, average results, and record orifice number and flow rate. If flow is not within these limits, discard or modify orifice and repeat procedure; (i) Record the name of the person performing the calibration, the date, serial number of the wet test meter, and the number of the critical orif ices being calibrated. (4) Sampling procedure . (a) Sampling data sheets should include a log of: The date of the sample collection; The time of sampling; The location of the sampler; The sampler serial number; The cassette number; The time of starting and stopping the sampling and the duration of sampling; The weight of the filter before and after sampling; The weight of dust collected (corrected for controls); The dust concentration measured; Other pertinent information; and Name of person taking sample. (b) Assembly of filter cassette should be as follows: Loosely assemble three -piece cassette; Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part N General Occupational He alth Standards Cotton Dust _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part N, Page 16 Number cassette; Place absorbent pad in cassette; Weigh filter to an accuracy of 10 g; Place filter in cassette; Record weight of filter in log, using cassette number for id entification; Fully assemble cassette, using pressure to force parts tightly together; Install plugs top and bottom; Put shrink band on cassette, covering joint between center and bottom parts of cassette; and Set cassette aside until shrink band dries tho roughly. (c) Sampling collection should be performed as follows: Clean lint out of the motor and elutriator; Install vertical elutriator in sampling locations specified above with inlet 4 -1/2 to 5-1/2 feet from floor (breathing zone height); Remove top section of cassette; Install cassette in ferrule of elutriator; Tape cassette to ferrule with masking tape or similar material for air -tight seal; Remove bottom plug of cassette and attach hose containing critical orifice; Start elutriator pump and check to see i f gauge reads above 17 in. of Hg vacuum; Record starting time, cassette number, and sampler number; At end of sampling period stop pump and record time; and Controls with each batch of samples collected, two additional filter cassettes should be subjected to exactly the same handling as the samples, except that they are not opened. These control filters should be weighed in the same manner as the sample filters. Any difference in weight in the control filters would indicate that the procedure for handling sample filters may not be adequate and should be evaluated to ascertain the cause of the difference, whether and what necessary corrections must be made, and whether additional samples must be collected. (d) Shipping. The cassette with samples should be colle cted, along with the appropriate number of blanks, and shipped to the analytical laboratory in a suitable container to prevent damage in transit. (e) Weighing of the sample should be achieved as follows: Remove shrink band; Remove top and middle sections of ca ssette and bottom plug; Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part N General Occupational He alth Standards Cotton Dust _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part N, Page 17 Remove filter from cassette and weigh to an accuracy of 10 g; and Record weight in log against original weight. (f) Calculation of volume of air sampled should be determined as follows: From starting and stopping times of sampling pe riod, determine length of time in minutes of sampling period; and Multiply sampling time in minutes by flow rate of critical orifice in liters per minute and divide by 1000 to find air quantity in cubic meters. (g) Calculation of dust concentrations should be made as follows: Subtract weight of clean filter from dirty filter and apply control correction to find actual weight of sample. Record this weight (in g) in log; and Divide mass of sample in g by air volume in cubic meters to find dust concentration in g/m. Record in log.

The spirometric measurements of pulmonary function must conform to the following minimum standards, and these standards are not intended to preclude additional testing or alternate methods which can be determined to be superior. (1) Apparatus . (a) The instrument must be accurate to within \u00b150 mi lliliters or within \u00b13 percent of reading, whichever is greater. (b) The instrument should be capable of measuring vital capacity from 0 to 7 liters BTPS. (c) The instrument must have a low inertia and offer low resistance to airflow such that the resistance to ai rflow at 12 liters per second must be less than 1.5 cm. H2O/liter/sec. (d) The zero time point for the purpose of timing the FEV 1 must be determined by extrapolating the steepest portion of the volume time curve back to the maximal inspiration volume (1, 2, 3, 4) or by an equivalent method. (e) Instruments incorporating measurements of airflow to determine volume must conform to the same volume accuracy stated in (a) of this subsection when presented with flow rates from at least 0 to 12 liters per second. (f) The inst rument or user of the instrument must have means of correcting volumes to a body temperature saturated with water vapor (BTPS) under conditions of varying ambient spirometer temperatures and barometric pressures. (g) The instrument used must provide a tracing or display of either flow versus volume or volume versus time during the entire forced expiration. A tracing or display is necessary to determine whether the patient has performed the test properly. The tracing must be stored and available for recall and must be of sufficient size that hand measurements may be made within requirement of (a) of this subsection. If a paper record is made it must have a paper speed of at least 2 cm/sec and a volume sensitivity of at least 10.0 mm of chart per liter of volum e. (h) The instrument must be capable of accumulating volume for a minimum of ten seconds and shall not stop accumulating volume before (i) the volume change for a 0.5 second interval is less than 25 milliliters or (ii) the flow is less than 50 milliliters per second for a 0.5 second interval. (i) The forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in l second FEV 1.0 measurements must comply with the accuracy requirements stated in (a) of this subsection. That is, they should be accurately measured to wit hin \u00b1 50 ml or within \u00b13 percent of reading, whichever is greater. (j) The instrument must be capable of being calibrated in the field with respect to the FEV 1 and FVC. This calibration of the FEV 1 and FVC may be either directly or indirectly through volume a nd time base measurements. The volume calibration source should provide a volume displacement of at least 2 liters and should be accurate to within \u00b130 milliliters. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part N General Occupational He alth Standards Cotton Dust _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part N, Page 42 (2) Technique for measurement of forced vital capacity maneuver. (a) Use of a nose clip is recom mended but not required. The procedures must be explained in simple terms to the patient who must be instructed to loosen any tight clothing and stand in front of the apparatus. The subject may sit, but care should be taken on repeat testing that same po sition be used and, if possible, the same spirometer. Particular attention must be given to insure that the chin is slightly elevated with the neck slightly extended. The patient must be instructed to make a full inspiration from a normal breathing patte rn and then blow into the apparatus, without interruption, as hard, fast, and completely as possible. At least three forced expirations must be carried out. During the maneuvers, the patient must be observed for compliance with instructions. The expirat ions must be checked visually for reproducibility from flow -volume or volume -time tracings or displays. The following efforts must be judged unacceptable when the patient: Has not reached full inspiration preceding the forced expiration, Has not used maxi mal effort during the entire forced expiration, Has not continued the expiration for at least 5 seconds or until an obvious plateau in the volume time curve has occurred, Has coughed or closed his glottis, Has an obstructed mouthpiece or a leak around the mouthpiece (obstruction due to tongue being placed in front of mouthpiece, false teeth falling in front of mouthpiece, etc.), Has an unsatisfactory start of expiration, one characterized by excessive hesitation (or false starts), and therefore not allowing back extrapolation of time 0 (extrapolated volume on the volume time tracing must be less than 10 percent of the FVC), Has an excessive variability between the three acceptable curves. The variation between the two largest FVC's and FEV 1's of the three s atisfactory tracings should not exceed 10 percent or \u00b1100 milliliters, whichever is greater. (b) Periodic and routine recalibration of the instrument or method for recording FVC and FEV 1.0 should be performed using a syringe or other volume source of at least 2 liters. (3) Interpretation of spirogram . (a) The first step in evaluating a spirogram should be to determine whether or not the patient has performed the test properly or as described in subsection (2) of this section. From the three satisfactory tracings, the forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1.0) must be measured and recorded. The largest observed FVC and largest observed FEV 1.0 must be used in the analysis regardless of the curve(s) on which they occur. (b) The following gu idelines are recommended by NIOSH for the evaluation and management of workers exposed to cotton dust. It is important to note that employees who show reductions in FEV 1/FVC ratio below .75 or drops in Monday FEV 1 of 5 percent or greater on their initial screening exam, should be reevaluated within a month of the first exam. Those who show consistent decrease in lung function, as shown on the following table, should be managed as recommended. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part N General Occupational He alth Standards Cotton Dust _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part N, Page 43 (4) Qualifications of personnel administering the test . Technicians who perform pulmonary function testing should have the basic knowledge required to produce meaningful results. Training consisting of approximately 16 hours of formal instruction should cover the following areas. (a) Basic physiology of the forced vital capa city maneuver and the determinants of airflow limitation with emphasis on the relation to reproducibility of results. (b) Instrumentation requirements including calibration procedures, sources of error and their correction. (c) Performance of the testing including subject coaching, recognition of improperly performed maneuvers and corrective actions. (d) Data quality with emphasis on reproducibility. (e) Actual use of the equipment under supervised conditions. (f) Measurement of tracings and calculations of results. WAC 296 -62-14543 Appendix E --Vertical elutriator equivalency protocol. (a) Samples to be taken --In order to ascertain equivalency, it is necessary to collect a total of 100 samples from at least 10 sites in a mill. That is, there should be 10 replicate readings at eac h of 10 sites. The sites should represent dust levels which vary over the allowable range of 0.5 to 2 times the permissible exposure limit. Each sample requires the use of two vertical elutriators (VE's) and at least one but not more than two alternative devices (AD's). Thus, the end result is 200 VE readings and either 100 or 200 AD readings. The 2 VE readings and the 1 or 2 AD readings at each time and site must be made simultaneously. That is, the two VE's and one or two AD's must be arranged togeth er in such a way that they are measuring essentially the same dust levels. (b) Data averaging --The two VE readings taken at each site are then averaged. These averages are to be used as the 100 VE readings. If two alternate devices were used, their test resu lts are also averaged. Thus, after this step is accomplished, there will be 100 VE readings and 100 AD readings. (c) Differences --For each of the 100 sets of measurements (VE and AD) the difference is obtained as the average VE reading minus the AD reading. Call these differences Di. Thus, we have. Di = VEi - ADi, i = 1,2, . . . ,100(1) Next we compute the arithmetic mean and standard deviations of the differences, using equations (2) and (3), respectively.

SUBSTANCE IDENTIFICATION (1) Substance: Coke oven emissions (2) Definit ion: The benzene -soluble fraction of total particulate matter present during the destructive distillation or carbonization of coal for the production of coke. (3) Permissible exposure limit: 150 micrograms per cubic meter of air determined as an average over an 8-hour period. (4) Regulated areas: Only employees authorized by your employer should enter a regulated area. The employer is required to designate the following areas as regulated areas: the coke oven battery, including topside and its machinery, pushs ide and its machinery, and the screening station; and the wharf, the beehive ovens and machinery. II. HEALTH HAZARD DATA Exposure to coke oven emissions is a cause of lung cancer, and possibly kidney cancer, in humans. Although it does not have an excess number of skin cancer cases in humans, repeated skin contact with coke oven emissions should be avoided. III. PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT (1) Respirators: Respirators will be provided by your employer for routine use if your employer is in the process o f implementing engineering and work practice controls or where engineering and work practice controls are not feasible or insufficient. You must wear respirators for nonroutine activities or in emergency situations where you are likely to be exposed to le vels of coke oven emissions in excess of the permissible exposure limit. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part O General Occ upational Health Standards Coke Ovens _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part O, Page 18 Since how well your respirator fits your face is very important, your employer is required to conduct fit tests to make sure the respirator seals properly when you wear it. These te sts are simple and rapid and will be explained to you during your training sessions. (2) Protective clothing: Your employer is required to provide, and you must wear, appropriate, clean, protective clothing and equipment to protect your body from repeated ski n contact with coke oven emissions and from the heat generated during the coking process. This clothing should include such items as jacket and pants and flame resistant gloves. Protective equipment should include face shield or vented goggles, protectiv e helmets and safety shoes, insulated from hot surfaces where appropriate. IV. HYGIENE FACILITIES AND PRACTICES You must not eat, drink, smoke, chew gum or tobacco, or apply cosmetics in the regulated area, except that drinking water is permitted. Your em ployer is required to provide lunchrooms and other areas for these purposes. Your employer is required to provide showers, washing facilities, and change rooms. If you work in a regulated area, you must wash your face, and hands before eating. You must s hower at the end of the work shift. Do not take used protective clothing out of the change rooms without your employer's permission. Your employer is required to provide for laundering or cleaning of your protective clothing. V. SIGNS AND LABELS Your emp loyer is required to post warning signs and labels for your protection. Signs must be posted in regulated areas. The signs must warn that a cancer hazard is present, that only authorized employees may enter the area, and that no smoking or eating is allo wed. In regulated areas where coke oven emissions are above the permissible exposure limit, the signs should also warn that respirators must be worn. VI. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS If you work in a regulated area at least 30 days per year, your employer is requ ired to provide you with a medical examination every year. The medical examination must include a medical history, a chest x -ray; pulmonary function test; weight comparison; skin examination; a urinalysis and a urine cytology exam for the early detection of urinary cancer. The urine cytology exam is only included in the initial exam until you are either forty -five years or older, or have five or more years employment in the regulated areas when the medical exams including this test, but excepting the x -ray exam, are to be given every six months; under these conditions, you are to be given an x -ray exam at least once a year. The examining physician will provide a written opinion to your employer containing the results of the medical exams. You should also receive a copy of this opinion. VII. OBSERVATION OF MONITORING Your employer is required to monitor your exposure to coke oven emissions and you are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are entitled to receive an explanation of the measureme nt procedure, observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure, and to record the results obtained.

WAC 296 -62-20029 Appendix B --Industrial hygiene and medical surveillance guidelines. APPENDIX B INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE AND MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE GUIDELINES I. INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE GUIDELINES (1) Sampling . (Benzene -Soluble Fraction Total Particulate Matter.) Samples collected should be full shift (8 -hour) samples. Sampling should be done using a personal sampling pump with pulsation damper at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. Samples should be collected on 0.8 mic rometer pore size silver membrane filters (37 mm diameter) preceded by Gelman glass fiber type A filters encased in three -piece plastic (polystyrene) field monitor cassettes. The cassette face cap should be on and the plug removed. The rotameter should b e checked every hour to ensure that proper flow rates are maintained. A minimum of three full -shift samples should be collected for each job classification on each battery, at least one from each shift. If disparate results are obtained for particular job classification, sampling should be repeated. It is advisable to sample each shift on more than one day to account for environmental variables (wind, precipitation, etc.) which may affect sampling. Differences in exposures among different work shifts may indicate a need to improve work practices on a particular shift. Sampling results from different shifts for each job classification should not be averaged. Multiple samples from same shift may be used to calculate an average exposure for a particular jo b classification. (2) Analysis . (a) All extraction glassware is cleaned with dichromic acid cleaning solution, rinsed with tap water, then deionized water, acetone, and allowed to dry completely. The glassware is rinsed with nanograde benzene before use. The Tef lon cups are cleaned with benzene then with acetone. (b) Pre-weigh the 2 ml Perkin -Elmer Teflon cups to one hundredth of a milligram on a Perkin -Elmer autobalance AD 2 Tare weight of the cups is about 50 mg. (c) Place the silver membrane filter and glass fiber fil ter into a 15 ml test tube. (d) Extract with 5 ml of benzene for five minutes in an ultrasonic cleaner. (e) Filter the extract in 15 ml medium glass fritted funnels. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part O General Occ upational Health Standards Coke Ovens _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part O, Page 20 (f) Rinse test tube and filters with two 1.5 ml aliquots of benzene and filter through the fritted g lass funnel. (g) Collect the extract and two rinses in a 10 ml Kontes graduated evaporative concentrator. (h) Evaporate down to a 1 ml while rinsing the sides with benzene. (i) Pipet 0.5 ml into the Teflon cup and evaporate to dryness in a vacuum oven at 40\u00f8 C for 3 h ours. (j) Weight the Teflon cup and the weight gain is due to the benzene soluble residue in half the sample. II. MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE GUIDELINES (1) General . The minimum requirements for the medical examination for coke oven workers are given in WAC 296 -62-20017. The initial examination is to be provided to all coke oven workers who work at least thirty days in the regulated area. The examination includes a 14\" x 17\" posterior -anterior chest x - ray and a ILO/UC rating to assure some standardization of x -ray readin g, pulmonary function tests (FVC and FEV 1.0), weight, urinalysis, skin examination and a urinary cytologic examination. These tests are to serve as the baseline for comparing the employee's future test results. Periodic exams include all the elements of the initial exams, except that the urine cytologic test is to be performed only on those employees who are forty -five years of age or older or who have worked for five or more years in the regulated area; periodic exams, with the exception of x -rays, are to be performed semiannually for this group instead of annually; for this group, x -rays will continue to be given at least annually. The examination contents are minimum requirements, additional tests such as lateral and oblique x -rays or additional pulmo nary function tests may be performed if deemed necessary. (2) Pulmonary function tests . Pulmonary function tests should be performed in a manner which minimizes subject and operator bias. There has been shown to be learning effects with regard to the results obtained from certain tests, such as FEV 1.0. Best results can be obtained by multiple trials for each subject. The best of three trials or the average of the last three of five trials may be used in obtaining reliable results. The type of equipment use d (manufacturer, model, etc.) should be recorded with the results as reliability and accuracy varies and such information may be important in the evaluation of test results. Care should be exercised to obtain the best possible testing equipment.

Closed system drug -transfer device . A drug-transfer device that mechanically prohibits the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system and the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations outsid e of the system. Decontamination . Inactivation, neutralization, or removal of toxic agents, usually by chemical means. Engineering controls . Devices designed to eliminate or reduce worker exposure to hazards. Examples include biological safety cabinets, laboratory fume hoods, containment isolators, safer sharps devices, and safety interlocks. Hazardous drugs . Any drug identified as hazardous by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) or any drug that meets at least one of the following six criteria: (a) Carcinogenicity. (b) Teratogenicity or developmental toxicity. (c) Reproductive toxicity in humans. (d) Organ toxicity at low doses in humans or animals. (e) Genotoxicity. (f) New drugs that mimic existing hazard ous drugs in structure and toxicity. Health care facilities . All hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, laboratories, offices or similar places where a health care provider provides health care to patients. For purposes of this chapter this includes veterina ry medicine, retail pharmacies, home health care agencies and also those research laboratories in settings where a health care provider provides health care to patients. It does not include the drug manufacturing sector or research laboratories where heal th care providers do not provide health care to patients. HEPA filter . A high-efficiency particulate air filter rated 99.97% efficient in capturing 0.3 - micron -diameter particles. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part R General Occupational Healt h Standards Hazardous Drugs _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part R, Page 3 Isolator . A device that is sealed or is supplied with air through a micro bially retentive filtration system (HEPA minimum) and may be reproducibly decontaminated. When closed, an isolator uses only decontaminated interfaces (when necessary) or rapid transfer ports (RTPs) for materials transfer. When open, it allows for the in gress and/or egress of materials through defined openings that have been designed and validated to preclude the transfer of contaminants or unfiltered air to adjacent environments. An isolator can be used for aseptic processing, for containment of potent compounds, or for simultaneous asepsis and containment. Some isolator designs allow operations within the isolator to be conducted through attached rubber gloves without compromising asepsis and/or containment. Aseptic isolator . A ventilated isolator des igned to exclude external contamination from entering the critical zone inside the isolator. Aseptic containment isolator . A ventilated isolator designed to meet the requirements of both an aseptic isolator and a containment isolator. Containment isolat or. A ventilated isolator designed to prevent the toxic materials processed inside it from escaping to the surrounding environment. Occupational exposure . Reasonably anticipated inhalation, skin, ingestion, or injection contact with hazardous drugs as a result of the performance of an employee's duties. Some drugs defined as hazardous may not pose a significant risk of occupational exposure because of their dosage formulation (for example, coated tablets or capsules that are administered to patients without modifying the formulation). However, they may pose a risk if altered (for example, if tablets are crushed or dissolved, or if capsules are pierced or opened). Safety data sheet . A summary provided by the manufacturer to describe the chemical properti es and hazards of specific chemicals and ways in which workers can protect themselves from exposure to these chemicals. Ventilated cabinet . A type of engineering control designed for purposes of worker protection. These devices are designed to minimize w orker exposures by controlling emissions of airborne contaminants through the following: (a) The full or partial enclosure of a potential contaminant source. (b) The use of airflow capture velocities to capture and remove airborne contaminants near their point of generation. (c) The use of air pressure relationships that define the direction of airflow into the cabinet. Examples of ventilated cabinets include biological safety cabinets and containment isolators. WAC 296 -62-50015 Hazardous drugs control program. (1) Each h ealth care facility covered under the scope of this chapter must develop and implement a written hazardous drugs control program. Elements of the hazardous drugs control program may be located in other documents such as the employer's accident prevention program or other policies and procedures as long as they are referenced in the program. The hazardous drugs control program must, at a minimum, include the following: (a) A written inventory of hazardous drugs in the workplace. Chapter 296 -62 WAC Part R General Occupational Healt h Standards Hazardous Drugs _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Part R, Page 4 (b) A current hazard assessment f or hazardous drugs for which there is reasonably anticipated occupational exposure. (c) Hazardous drugs policies and procedures including, but not limited to: Engineering controls (equipment use and maintenance). Personal protective equipment. Safe handling pr actices (receiving and storage, labeling, preparing, administering, and disposing of hazardous drugs). Cleaning, housekeeping, and waste handling. Spill control. Personnel issues (such as exposure of pregnant workers). Training. (2) A standard or universal pre cautions approach to managing occupational exposure to hazardous drugs is recommended by NIOSH; however, due to the variety of factors that affect occupational exposure some health care facilities may find it more effective to institute precautions based o n exposure risk. For example a tiered approach that effectively matches precautions to the nature of exposure may be used including, but not limited to, handling, storing, cleaning, preparing and engineering controls. (3) Review and update the written hazardo us drugs control program annually and whenever changes that affect occupational exposure occur, such as introduction of a new hazardous drug, or a change in handling practices. (4) Seek and consider input from employees who may be exposed to hazardous drugs as a result of the performance of their duties regarding the quality and effectiveness of the hazardous drugs control program. WAC 296 -62-50020 Hazard assessment. (1) Each health care facility covered under the scope of this chapter must conduct hazard assessme nts in order to determine the appropriate precautions to be taken. These assessments may be limited to the hazardous drugs for which there is reasonably anticipated occupational exposure. (2) Assessments must include the following elements as appropriate : (a) Personal protective equipment. (b) Engineering controls (e.g., ventilated cabinets, closed -system drug transfer devices, glovebags, and needleless systems). (c) Physical layout of work areas. (d) Types of hazardous drugs being handled. (e) Volume, frequency, packaging, and f orm of hazardous drugs handled (tablets, coated versus uncoated, powder versus liquid). (f) Equipment maintenance. (g) Decontamination and cleaning. (h) Waste handling.

Examples of engineering controls include, but are not limited to: (a) Closed system transfer devices. (b) Safer sharps devices. (c) Safety interlocks. (d) Ventilated cabinets. (2) Ventilated cabinets . (a) Prepare (e.g., mix, compound, crush) hazardous drugs inside an appropriate ventilated cabinet or barrier isolators designed to prevent worker exposure. Alternate precautions may be used where the hazard assessment determines a low occupational exposure risk while preparing hazardous drugs other than chemotherapy agents (e.g., crushing and splitting tablets, drawing medication into a syringe). These may include, but are not limited to, te mporarily designating a preparation area, use of appropriate personal protective equipment, and instituting cleaning procedures. Chemotherapy drugs must be prepared in an appropriate ventilated cabinet with the exception of circumstances where the employer can document evidence of a clinical need (e.g., there is a nonroutine need to provide chemotherapy treatment, compounding services are not readily available, and it is in the best interest of the patient to provide local care). In such circumstances alte rnate precautions must be instituted as described above. (b) Hazardous drugs that volatilize must be handled only in a ventilated cabinet that captures the volatilized material to prevent employee exposure, or in a ventilated cabinet that does not recirculate air inside the cabinet or exhausts air back into the room environment. (c) Install and maintain the ventilation equipment determined by your hazard assessment in accordance with: The ventilation equipment manufacturer's design, instructions, and precautions; Appropriate and most current national safety and industry standards.
