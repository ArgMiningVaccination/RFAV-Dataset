It should be noted that not all dogs will respond to antihistamines to provide relief from seasonal allergies. This is because the mediators of the allergic response in dogs are not completely related to histamines. People who suffer from allergies typically have a runny nose, watery eyes, and sneezing as a result of histamine release. These are all symptoms that are not commonly seen in dogs with allergies. Dogs will typically have redness and itchiness of their skin as their main symptoms.
