BCN does not make eligibility determinations, but updates its files to record eligibility information provided by M SU. Please contact MSU Human Resources at (800)353 -4434 or (517)353 -4434 for e ligibility information. 1.2 Additional Eligibility Guidelines The following guidelines apply to all Members: Medicare: If you become eligible to enroll in Medicare, you will only be eligible for the Medicare complementary program except when Medicare is the secondary payer by law.

If you are admitted to a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility prior to the effective date of this Certificate of Coverage you will be covered for Inpatient care on the effective date of Coverage only if: You have no continuing coverage under any other health Benefits contract, program or insurance; BCN or BCN authorizes inpatient care as M edically Necessary upon notification of admission; and Your medical management is transferred to your Primary Care Physician before or on the effective date. Section 2: O ther Party Liability BCN does not pay claims or coordinate Benefits for Services tha t: Are not Preauthorized by BCN ; or Are not Covered Services under this Certificate of Coverage . It is your responsibility to provide complete and accurate information requested by us in order to administer Section 2. Failure to provide requested informati on, including information about other Coverage, may result in denial of claims. 2.1 Non-duplication BCN Coverage provides you with Benefits for health care services as described in this Certificate of Coverage . BCN does not duplicate Benefits or pay more for Covered Health Services than the actual fees. Coverage described in this Certificate of Coverage will be reduced to the extent that the 14 CB15681 MSUGAF \u00a9 20 21 Blue Care Network Effective 08/16/20 21 services are available or payable by other health plans or policies under which you may be covered, whether or not y ou make a claim for the payment under such health plan or policy. 2.2 Auto Policy and Worker 's Compensation Claims This Certificate of Cove rage is a coordinated Certificate of Coverage. This means that for medical care needed as the result of an automobil e accident, if the Member has a coordinated no-fault insurance policy, then BCN will assume primary liability for Covered Services. The no-fault automobile insurance would be secondary. If the Member has coverage through a non -coordinated (sometimes calle d a \"full medical\") no -fault automobile insurance policy, then the automobile insurance will be considered the primary plan.

Servic es and treatment for any work -related injury that are paid, payable or required to be provided under any workers' co mpensation program will not be paid under Coverage. If any such services are paid or provided by BCN , BCN has the right to seek reimbursement on behalf of the Group Health Plan from the other program, insurer or Member who has received reimbursement. Appli cable BCN authorization and Coverage requirements must always be followed for auto or work -related injuries . Failure to follow applicable Preauthorization or Coverage requirements may leave you solely responsible for the cost of any services received. 2.3 Coordination of Benefits (COB) We co ordinate Benefits payable under this Certificate of Coverage per Michigan's Coordination of Benefits Act. When you have coverage under a policy or certificate that does not contain a coordination of benefits provision, that policy will pay first as the Pr imary Plan. This means benefits under the other coverage will be determined before the benefits of your BCN Coverage. After those benefits are determined, your BCN benefits and the benefits of the other plan will be coordinated to provide 100% coverage wh enever possible for services covered partly or totally 15 CB15681 MSUGAF \u00a9 20 21 Blue Care Network Effective 08/16/20 21 under either plan.

If you receive Covered Services in another state, the claims will be processed through the BlueCard\u00ae Program , a Blue Cross\u00ae and Blue Shield\u00ae Association program. It does not expand your Coverage to include out -of-state provider s. It defines the payment method used should an incidental out -of-state claim be incurred. Overview Blue Care Network (\"BCN\") has a v ariety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees referred to generally as \"Inter -Plan Arrangem ents.\" These Inter -Plan Arrangements operate under rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (\"Association\") . Whenever you, the Member, access healthcare services outside the geographic area we serve, the claim for those service s may be processed through one of these Inter -Plan Arrangements. The Inter -Plan Arrangements are described generally below. Typically, when accessing care outside the geographic area BCN serves, you obtain care from healthcare providers that have a contractual agreement (\"participating providers\") with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geographic area (\"Host B lue\"). In some instances, you may obtain care from providers in the Host Blue geographic area that do not have a contractual agreement (\"nonparticipating providers\") with the Host Blue. BCN remains responsible for fulfilling our contractual obligations to you. Our payment practices in both instances are described belo w. BCN covers only limited healthcare services rec eived outside of our Service Area. As used in this section \"Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services\" include, emergency care, urgent care, routine care and/or follow -up care obtained outside the geographic area we serve, subject to BCN coverage and authorization rules. Any other services will not be covered when processed through any Inter -Plan Arrangements, unless Preauthorized by your Primary Care Physician (\"PCP\") or BCN. Inter -Plan Arrangements Eligibility - Claim Types All claim types are eligible to be processed through Inter -Plan Arrangements, as described above, except for all Dental Care Benefits except when paid as medical claims/bene fits, and those Prescription Drug Benefits or Vision Care Benefits that may be administered by a third party contracted by BCN to provide the specific service or services. 26 CB15681 MSUGAF \u00a9 20 21 Blue Care Network Effective 08/16/20 21 A. BlueCard\u00ae Program The BlueCard\u00ae Program is an Inter -Plan Arrangement. Under t his Arrangement, when you access Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services outside the BCN Service Area, the Host Blue will be responsible for contracting and handling all interactions with its participating providers. The financial terms of the BlueCard Pr ogram are described generally below. Liability Calculation Method Per Claim Unless subject to a fixed dollar Copayment, the calculation of the Member liability on claims for Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services processed through the BlueCard Program w ill be based on the lower of the providers billed charges for Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services or the negotiated price made available to us by the Host Blue. Host Blues determine a negotiated price, which is reflected in the terms of each Host Blue' s healthcare provider contracts. The negotiated price made available to BCN by the Host Blue may be rep resented by one of the following: (i) An actual price. An actual price is a negotiated rate of payment in effect at the time a claim is processed withou t any other increases or decreases; or (ii) An estimated price. An estimated price is a negotiated rat e of payment in effect at the time a claim is processed, reduced or increased by a percentage to take into account certain payments negotiated with the p rovider and other claim - and non -claim -related transactions. Such transactions may include, but are not limited to, anti -fraud and abuse recoveries, provider refunds not applied on a claim -specific basis, retrospective settlements and performance -related b onuses or incentives; or (iii) An average price. An average price is a percentage of billed charges fo r Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services in effect at the time a claim is processed representing the aggregate payments negotiated by the Host Blue with all of its providers or a similar classification of its providers and other claim - and non -claim -relat ed transactions. Such transactions may include the same ones as noted above for an estimated price. The Host Blue determines whether or not it will use an actual price, an estimated price or an average price. The use of estimated or average pricing may re sult in a difference (positive or negative) between the price you pay on a specific claim and the actual amount the Host Blue pays to the provider. Howev er, the BlueCard Program requires that the amount paid by the Member is a final price; no future price adjustment will result in increases or decreases to the pricing of past claims. 27 CB15681 MSUGAF \u00a9 20 21 Blue Care Network Effective 08/16/20 21 B. Nonparticipating Providers Outside of the BCN Service Area 1. Membe r Liability Calculation When Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services are provided outside of the BCN S ervice Area by nonparticipating providers, the amount(s) you pay for such services will generally be based on either the Host Blue's nonparticipating pro vider local payment or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state law. In these situations, you may be responsible for the difference between the amount that the nonparticipating healthcare provider bills and the payment BCN will make for Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services as set forth in this paragraph. Payments for out -of-network emergency services will be governed by applicable federal and state law. 2. Exceptions In some exception cases, BCN may pay claims from nonparticipating provide rs for Out -of-Area Covered Healthcare Services based on the provider's billed charge. This may occur in situations where you did not have reasonable access to a participating provider, as determined by BCN in our sole and absolute discretion or by applicab le state law. In other exception cases, BCN may pay such a claim based on the payment BCN would make if BCN were paying a nonparticipating provider for the same Covered Healthcare Services inside of BCN Service Area, as described elsewhere in this contract . This may occur where the Host Blue's corresponding payment would be more than BCN in -Service Area non participating provider payment. BCN may choose to negotiate a payment with such a provider on an exception basis. Unless otherwise stated, in any of the se exception situations, you may be responsible for the difference between the amount that the nonparti cipating provider bills and the payment BCN will make for the covered services as set forth in this paragraph. C. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global \u00ae Core General Information If you are outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (hereinafter: \"BlueCard Service Area\"), you may be able to take advantage of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global \u00ae Core when accessing Covered Healthcare Services. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Global \u00ae Core is unlike the BlueCard Program available in the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in certain ways. For instance, although the Blue Cross Blue Shield Glob al\u00ae Core assists you with accessing a network of inpatient, outpatient and professional providers, the network is not served by a Host Blue. As such, when you receive care from providers outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands, you will typically have to pay the providers and submit the claims yourself to obtain reimbursement for these services. 28 CB15681 MSUGAF \u00a9 20 21 Blue Care Network Effective 08/16/20 21 Inpatient Services In most cases, if you contact the service center for assistance, hospitals will not require you to pay for covered inpatient hospital services, except for any cost sharing you may owe. In such cases, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global \u00ae Core contracting hospital will submit your claims to the service center to initiate claims processing. However, if y ou paid in full at the time of service, you must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement for Covered Services. You must contact us to obtain Preauthorization for non -emergency inpatient services. Outpatient Services Physicians, urgent care centers and oth er outpatient providers located outside the BlueCard Service Area will typically require you to pay in full at the time of service. You must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement for Covered Healthcare Services . Submitting a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global \u00ae Core Claim When you pay for Covered Services outside the BlueCard Service Area, you must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement. For institutional and professional claims, you should complete a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global \u00ae Core claim form and send the claim form with the provider's itemized bill(s) to the service center (the address is on the form) to initiate claims processing. The claim form is available from BCN, the service center or online at www.bcbsglobalcore.com. If you need assistance with the claim submissions, you should call the service center at 1.800.810.BLUE (2583) or call collect at 1.804.673.1177, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. D. Exclusions and Limitations This addendum will not apply if: the services are not a benefit under your C ertificate of Coverage; the services are performed by a vendor or provider who has a contract with BCN for those services. E. General Information If you have a Deductible, you will be responsible for payment of applicable Deductible for covered services at the time those services are received. Your Deductible, Coinsurance and Copayment requirements are based on your Certificate and Riders and remain the same regardless of which Host Blue processes your claim for services. Until further notice, all the t erms, definitions, limitations, exclusions and conditions of your Certificate and related Riders remain unchanged.

Stabilization - the point at which there is reasonable probability that no material deterioration of a condition is likely to result from or occur during your transfer. Urgent Care Services - Services that appear to be required in order to prevent serious deterioration to your health resulting from an unexpected illness or injury that could be expected to worsen if not treated within 2 4 hours.

Phase III: If a treatment has shown to be effective in Phase II, it is subjected to additional scrutiny in Phase III. In this phase, the sample size of the stu dy population is increased to between 1,000 and 3,000 people. The goals in Phase III are to confirm the effectiveness noted in Phase II, monitor for side effects, compare the study treatment against current treatment protocols, and collect data that will f acilitate safe use of the therapy or treatm ent under review. Phase IV: These studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed or the new treatment has become a standard component of patient care. These studies continue testing the study drug or treatment to collect information about their effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long -term use.
