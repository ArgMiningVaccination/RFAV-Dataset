We treat people with chronic conditions as well as people who want to prevent disease and optimize their health. Dr Sisu has training in the fields of conventional medicine, integrative and functional medicine, acupuncture and osteopathic medicine that allows her to offer true comprehensive holistic assessments and treatment plans. Her approach combines conventional medicine treatments with proven, personalized complementary therapies to treat your physical, mental, emotional or spiritual well-being. Because complete wellness is much more than simply the absence of disease. It is about balance - the balance of body, mind and spirit. And having that balance restores your vitality, promotes wellness, prevents disease and helps you live your life to its fullest potential. Are you tired of feeling tired? Do chronic issues like headaches, digestive issues such as IBS or back and neck pain cause you to miss out on the enjoyable things in life? Do you suffer from a variety of daily symptoms that traditional medicine cannot explain? This keeps you sitting on the sidelines while life moves on around you. Yet there are root causes to your chronic conditions, and very often visiting a variety of medical specialists and undergoing endless clinical testing yields no answers. Functional medicine is how we get beneath those symptoms to discover the true underlying root causes. We look for the connections between your chronic symptoms like fatigue, inflammation, digestive issues, and examine your lifestyle choices, genetic history and the environment you live in to address every factor possible. Mind-body health is more than lab work and diagnostics; it requires a comprehensive treatment modality that encompasses all systems working together. If you are not getting any definitive answers and are being told that your diagnostic testing is \"normal,\" then functional medicine is for you. At Restore Balance Integrative Medicine, we can help. We utilize a personalized approach that combines the best of conventional and functional medicine, acupuncture, botanical extracts and nutritional supplementation to deliver the most efficient healing experience. We provide you with the professional medical expertise, the resources and the support you need, and we partner with you on your journey to wellness. Get in touch with us below, and we can start you on the right track toward health and wellness! [Request a complimentary 10-minute phone consultation](https://restorebalance.net/contact/). If the answers to these questions are yes, we will convert the appointment to telemedicine or reschedule your appointment to a future date.
