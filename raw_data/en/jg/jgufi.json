Int J Complement Alt Med 3(3): 00072. DOI: [10.15406/ijcam.2016.03.00072](https://doi.org/10.15406/ijcam.2016.03.00072) Among all the vaccinations performed today - the strongest scientific experience about the disease itself and its vaccination results is with DTaP and MMR ( [Figure 1](#fig1)). Two essential vaccinations performed during infancy - D.P.T.P. and M.M.R - present severe side-effects and will induce recurrent pathologies similar to the vaccine toxic agents. The first booster might open a Pandora's Box. Side effects must be analyzed with meticulous care - capricious, weeping, insomnia, fever, skin, thirst, abscess, otitis, etc. - along with the rhythm and periodicity of the different diseases Homeopathic Drainage must be performed in the infant or child who presents diseases and/or changes in behaviour following the booster, from the first minutes after the injection and up to 3months later. The ISOTHERAPEUTIC OF VACCINATION must be used after Homeopathic Drainage: one dose in 15CH and going up to 200K then MK and XMK as needed. Note the reaction after the remedy - in most cases they happen around the 8th day. A skin rash augurs well - fever and physical symptoms are to be taken more seriously - neurological reactions such as nightmares testify a deep impact and sensitiveness of the Toxin. About 50% of children have reactions in the first days following the booster, such as local inflammation, fever, loss of appetite, otitis, rhinopharyngitis, and cough. Some have severe symptoms such as abscess, asthma, eczema or even neurological disorders - weeping and screaming, restlessness or sleepiness, nightmares, and convulsions. The distant consequences are of the same order with a dominance of respiratory tract pathologies from E.N.T. to lungs - but also intestines, colon, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic disorders. The vaccination aggravates the existing hereditary immune system weaknesses and causes an immune blockage. Measles dominate the MMR pathologies with allergies, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, spasmodic coryza, nose obstruction, cough, hay fever and asthma, physical and psychological growth disorders - essentially decalcification and language - and all the Tuberculin anergic diseases. Boosters might provoke a local abscess, screaming, restlessness, sleepiness, nightmares, fever. All children presenting \"measles-like syndromes\" during the week following the booster - called classical side-effects - need a specific homeopathic treatment. The immune system has a hereditary program which must be studied during the first years of the infant and child through his diseases and the side effects appearing from the boosters, all has to be noted in the Line of Life. The person with an immune dysfunction from a vaccination will present recurrent diseases most likely similar to the toxin effects. The Wheel of Emunctories might be disrupted from its elimination function - apart from the skin - first at all digestive and respiratory levels. In most chronic cases, a prolonged Homeopathic Drainage protocol is required before a Toxin remedy can be given. Analyze the family pathologies - mother and father, sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles. The treatment contains 3 levels: Homeopathic Drainage of the sensitive organs, Constitutional fortifying, and Reactive Modes regulation with Central and Satellite remedies. Add Tissue salts, it is always very beneficial for children. Oligotherapy is used in mild cases, Organotherapy is helpful when severe recurrent pathologies, Phytogemmotherapy is very effective but it contains alcohol and has to be handled accordingly.
