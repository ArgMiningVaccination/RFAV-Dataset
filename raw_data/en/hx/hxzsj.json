You would expect a hospi - tal to be safe and its service of high quality. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), patient safety can be defined as the prevention of errors and adverse effects to patients associated with health care.1 However, reports in the past decades showed that around 1 in 10 admitted patients experience care related harm.2-6 Converted to global numbers these are approximately 42.7 million adverse events (AEs). An AE could lead to a temporary or permanent injury, but also to the death of a patient.7-9 Together, these AEs result in 23 million disability lost life years (DALYs) per year worldwide.10 Although the numbers mentioned seem large, we should realise that only a part of these AEs are preventable.8,11-13 Moreover, it is impossible to investigate all cases which means that the numbers mentioned above are extrapolations made from a sample of cases. However, since these reports with large estimated numbers of AEs worldwide were publis - hed, many countries decided to implement measures to improve patient safety. They used various instruments to detect and improve quality and safety and created specific safety programs.11,14-18 In short, it was put on the social agenda. Quality and safety of care are thus important for health care institutions, policy makers and healthcare professionals but most importantly patients. In order to be able to improve quality and safety, organizations have to measure their basic performance, identify bottlenecks and find ways to implement improvement strategies. The result of these actions should then preferably lead to measurable improvement of the parameters used to measure quality and safety. However, this is actually a surrogate mar - ker for improvement because in the end the patient should profit. In this thesis we zoom in on the measurement of the basic performance and identification of bottlenecks as an important start of the improvement process. To get an indication of quality, several hospital parameters are nowadays registered. For example, hospitals in the Netherlands are participating in, on average, 45 quality regi - stries, nineteen quality accreditations and seven patient experience reports.19-24 To get this registration done, in the Netherlands alone approximately 80 million euros are spend on a yearly base.25 Some examples of these quality indicators and safety parameters are waiting time, number of patients with decubitus, number of fall incidents, excess length of stay, AEs, complicati - ons, hospital standardized mortality rate (HSMR), number of reoperations etcetera.26-31 To measure these indicators and parameters correctly, health care institutions have several instruments at their disposal. One of them, which will be discussed here in more detail, is AE analysis. This is a commonly used instrument in patient safety research. AEs can be detected in many different ways, for example with medical record review, voluntary data reporting, incident reporting, patient interviews, complaints registries and morbidity and mortality conferences.32,33-40Introduction11 Medical record review is one of the most frequently used methods for identifying AEs.5,13,41- 43 This is also in our hospital the key method for evaluating potentially preventable AEs and a basic measurement of performance. Approach to quality control in Maastricht UMC+ using medical record review In 2008, the project ''preventing medical injury'' was started in Maastricht UMC+. The founders of this project had the impression that the HSMR was sensitive to improper and unintended influences and the nature of the hospital population. The HSMR would therefore not give useful insights into the causes of AEs and possible points for improve - ment.44,45 Moreover; it only has a signal function and does not yield information about where to improve the quality of care and what to change.46,47 Hence, the aim of the project was to decrease and prevent unintended medical harm to patients in the MUMC+. They chose to use systematic retrospective evaluation of the records of all deceased patients. To learn from preventable medical harm and to prevent it in the future, the goal was also to stimulate an open culture in which caregivers are open to communicate about, and learn from (the consequences of) their own actions. Because, in their opinion, the most severe outcome of AEs was death, they chose to use the records of deceased patients. The board of directors of the Maastricht UMC+ installed a committee with the assignment to evaluate all medical records of patients who died during their stay in the hospital. This committee was named: Committee Investigating Deceased Patients (In Dutch: Commissie Onderzoek Overleden Pati\u00ebnten; COOP). Medical record review method Reviewing all medical records is extremely time consuming. Therefore, usually samples are taken of prespecified patient groups but also trigger tools are used.17,48,49 A trigger is a warning signal that an AE could be present in the record thus limiting the number of records to be investigated and still yield a useful number of AEs to change policy or learn about an institutions weakness concerning quality and safety. The most well-known trigger tools are the Global trigger tool (GTT) and the Harvard Me - dical Practice Study (HMPS).5,50-52 The HMPS is more often deployed in research settings, whereas the GTT is usually deployed for reviews in patient safety work.17,53,54 The records of the deceased patients are first explored by a team of trained nurses for the presence of triggers (see table 1). Subsequently, a committee consisting of medical speci - alists from all major disciplines analysed the records to search for AEs. Both the screeners and the specialists were not time restricted. All results were saved using software which was specially designed for this purpose. The bottlenecks identified are then used to advise on improvement measures for the management of the departments. Between 2008 and 2015 we noticed regularly that in our feedback to the departments the quality of our assessment method was an often-dis - cussed issue. Because this hampered the implementation of improvement measures we decided to measure the quality of the instrument we used. 1 Chapter 112Therefore, this PhD project was started to assess the quality and performance of our medi - cal record review method looking for potential preventable AEs. An AE was defined as an unintended outcome arising from the (non)-action of a caregiver and/or the health care system with damage to the patient resulting in temporary or per - manent disability or death of the patient.55 If a potentially preventable AE was suspected, this was discussed with the involved medical department. Finally, the committee decided on the definite presence of an AE, its potential preventability and the contribution to death. For the purpose of the study in this thesis, we used the committee result as a gold standard for AEs. Of all the available trigger systems we chose to use the HMPS list becau - se this was already used by the Netherlands Institute for health services research (NIVEL) in their evaluation of hospital performance.13,56,57 Our screeners were already trained because they participated in the NIVEL screenings in using this list which made implemen - tation easy. We hypothesized that this list would also be redundant in deceased patients.58 Due to the very nature of deceased subjects and experience with the triggers the list was slightly adapted. Trigger 1 (patient was admitted before (in the previous 12 months) for a reason related to the current admission) was adapted to a shorter period (in the previous 3 months) because analysis of previous years showed this trigger was not discriminative for potentially preventable AEs. The 12-month cut-off contained a large number of patients with planned chemotherapy or planned second stage operations. Furthermore, two other triggers were not applicable in a deceased population and were omitted (the trigger re - garding unplanned transfer to another acute care hospital and inappropriate discharge to home). Introduction13 Table 1: A list of the triggers which are used in the MUMC+ Description of the triggers Unplanned readmission after discharge from index admission within 3 months Hospital-incurred patient injury (temporarily or lasting) Adverse drug reaction Unplanned transfer to ICU Unplanned return to the operating room Unplanned removal, injury or repair of an organ during surgery Healthcare related infection or sepsis Other complications such as CVA/pulmonary embolism Development of neurological deficit not present on admission (initial) unexpected and/or sudden death (not palliative care) Cardiac or respiratory arrest Injury related to abortion or delivery Dissatisfaction with care Documentation indicating litigation Other patient complications 1 Chapter 114Although this method has similarities with the original method (which has been studied by other groups), there are also some differences.5,11,59-62 First, we focus only on deceased patients. Second, we don't use reviewer pairs since these don't improve the reliability.61,63 Instead, one reviewer evaluates the medical record and then presents his findings to the other members of the committee. During this meeting it is decided whether or not the event was an AE. Third, we use internal reviewers for the fact that we believe they have the best knowledge of the medical process in our centre.64 Finally; the final decision on the presence of an AE is made after the committee weighed the opinion of the involved care givers. Thesis outline The focus of this thesis was to assess the quality of medical record review as an instrument to increase patient safety in clinical care eventually. An overview of these sub studies is shown in figure 1. Part I: What is already known? Trigger tools are frequently used as a screening instrument to select cases for extensive re - view. Because searching for triggers, but even more scrutinizing medical records, is a time consuming and therefore costly procedure we assumed that these methods were tho - roughly studied for their performance. Therefore, in the first part of the thesis we focus on what is already known about medical record review, more specific concerning the trigger tools which are often used combined with medical record review. In chapter two we provided a systematic narrative review on the two most frequently used trigger tools, the HMPS and the GTT. We evaluated their performance regarding 7 criteria, which were created by the WHO to evaluate screening methods on their performance.65 These criteria consist of an evaluation of the effectiveness in capturing the extent of harm, availability of reliable data and an evaluation of the costs of AEs. Furthermore, its effective - ness in influencing policy, hospital and local safety procedures and outcomes was investi - gated. Finally, the synergy with other domains of quality of care was assessed. Part II: Assessing the quality of medical record review After the evaluation of the current knowledge of medical record review in part I, we deci - ded to perform further evaluations of the quality of MRR. The method used in our hospital is slightly different, since it evaluates only AEs in deceased patients. Also, the final conclusi - on on the presence of an AE is decided after a group discussion. In this part we evaluate the quality of medical record review. Therefore, we have split the evaluation in the trigger part (performed by the nurses) and the assessment of the AEs (performed by the committee). In chapter three , we performed an analysis on the predictive value of the triggers. In chapter four , we evaluated the internal reproducibility of the triggers. Therefore, the screening nurses of our medical record review committee evaluated 50 medical records for Introduction15 a second time. In chapter five , we investigated the internal reproducibility of the committee judgment. Therefore, 50 medical records were re-evaluated by the medical specialists of our medical record review committee. In chapter six , we evaluated the external reproducibility of the committee judgment. The - refore, two committees from different hospitals evaluated each other's medical records. Part III New developments The results in part II made us decide to attempt to further improve the quality of the trigger tool. We discovered that still many cases are selected with the triggers, that don't contain an AE. This results in a waste of time and money. In this part we assessed how the current methodology could be improved. Time- and cost wise, but also to improve its efficiency. In chapter seven , we evaluated if the current trigger system could be improved by adding patient characteristics in the screening. In chapter eight , we used a text mining tool for the screening of the medical records and compared these outcomes with the results of the manual screening by the nurses and specialists in the committee. 1 Chapter 116Figure 1: Overview of our studies concerning the process of improving quality and safety with medical record review Introduction17 References 1.Europe WROf.

Chapter 2Chapter 224Abstract Objectives: Evaluation of the two most used trigger tools according to the criteria of the WHO for evaluating methods. Methods: We searched Embase, Pubmed and Cochrane databases for studies between 2000 and 2017. Studies were included if medical record review (MRR) was performed with either the Global Trigger Tool (GTT) or the Harvard Medical Practice Study (HMPS) in a hospital population. Quality assessment was performed in duplicate. Extracted outcome data included: prevalence of adverse events (AEs), kappa agreement for AEs, percentage agreement, summary of main results and costs of (detecting) AEs. Results: 50 studies and several reports were included and results were reported for every criterion separately. MRR reveals more AEs than any other method. But at the same time, it detects different AEs compared to other methods. The costs of an AE were on average \u20ac4296. Considerable efforts have been made worldwide in healthcare to improve safety and to reduce errors. These efforts have resulted in some positive effects. The literature showed that MRR is focused on several domains of quality of care and seems suitable for both small as large cohorts. Furthermore, we found a moderate to substantial agreement for the presence of a trigger and a moderate to good agreement for the presence of an AE. Conclusions: MRR with a trigger tool is a reasonably well researched method for the evalu - ation of the medical records for AEs. However, looking at the WHO criteria, much research is still lacking or of moderate quality. Especially for the cost of detecting AEs, valuable information is missing regarding. Moreover, knowledge of how MRR changes quality and safety of care should be evaluated.Systematic review25 Introduction Several studies have shown significant rates of adverse events (AEs) that cause harm to patients during their stay in the hospital.1-3 Therefore, interest in the implementation of quality and safety programs that prevent these harmful events has grown. According to the report 'to Err is Human' (1992) of the Institute of Medicine, at least 44,000 people (and possible even 98,000) died each year in US hospitals due to possibly preventable AEs.3 An update, fifteen years after this first report, showed little improvement and stresses the need for further improving patient safety.4 In the Netherlands, a report in 2009 by the Dutch institute for research in healthcare (NIVEL) evaluated care related harm in Dutch hospitals. It was estimated that yearly about 1,700 patients (4.1% of the total number of deaths in hospitals) die because of unintentional, but preventable, harm.5 Follow-up showed slight improvement, but still 2.6% of the total number of inpatient deaths appea - red to be preventable.6 In other countries, an incidence between 2.5% and 11.5% has been found.7-11 Several factors contribute to the risk of AEs. First, the growing number of elderly patients with severe comorbidity12,13 and, at the same time, increasing medical technical possibi - lities for more complex treatments and interventions. Second, due to this expansion in treatment options estimation of the possible health benefits is more complex. This could lead to treating more patients in which the predicted outcome is unclear, especially in the elderly with many comorbidities and vulnerable new-borns.14-16 Furthermore, part-time working leads to more clinical hand-over moments and hence discontinuity of care which could result in AEs.17-21 Teamwork and integrated care are necessary, but they depend on good communication within and between teams.22,23 Also, economic limitations and cuts put health-care under pressure.24-31 Together, these factors have serious impact on patient safety. To diminish care related harm most hospitals have several instruments to detect preven - table harm: direct observation, incident reporting systems, autopsy reports, mortality and morbidity conferences are some examples.32-35 For medical record review, trigger tools are often used to prevent time and cost consuming investigation of all records. The most well-known trigger systems are the Harvard Medi - cal Practice Study trigger system (HMPS)36 with 18 triggers36,37 and the global trigger tool (GTT), developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) with 54 triggers.38 Information about sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of these screening tools for detecting AEs is important in striving for effective and affordable me - thods to detect AEs. Also, MRR independently of the method used, is a costly process since it takes time of both experienced physicians and nurses hence it is of importance that the process is indeed improving quality and safety. However, adequate detection of AEs is only a small part of the review process. The total procedure also involves feedback to the medical departments, adjustments in the de - livery of care and hence improved outcome for patients resulting in less AEs. From this viewpoint, searching for AEs using medical record review is actually a screening method in which the AE is the disease or complication for which early intervention should improve the outcome (more of the same AEs). Previous studies mainly focused on the evaluation of a single part of this evaluation process.39-41 We were interested in all stages of this scree - ning method. Therefore, we investigated if the whole screening process based on medical 2 Chapter 226record review was evidence based according to the WHO criteria (box 1) for evaluating methods.42 With these WHO criteria in mind, we searched the literature for evidence about the use of this specific method to improve patient safety. Box 1: WHO criteria for evaluating methods42 1. Effectiveness in capturing the extent of harm (in different environments) 2. Availability of reliable data 3. Suitability for large-scale or small, repeated studies 4. Costs (financial, human resources, time and burden on system) 5. Effectiveness in influencing policy 6. Effectiveness in influencing hospital and local safety procedures and outcomes 7. Synergy with other domains of quality of care Methods Search strategy and information sources We identified potentially eligible studies by searching Pubmed, Embase and the Cochra - ne library for every criterion described in box 1. Our search was restricted to studies, in English or Dutch published between 2000 and 2017 because we assumed that older results might not be applicable because of rapidly changing healthcare. The search strategy and corresponding search terms are shown in the appendix, table 1. The flowchart for every criterion separately is shown in the appendix, table 2. Selection criteria and process Studies were included if, medical record review was performed with either the GTT or the HMPS in a hospital population with a wide variety of patient groups. Suitable study designs were observational studies (cross-sectional, retrospective or prospective cohorts, or case-control studies). Studies were excluded if they took place in a non-hospital setting, described only a single department, and used computer detection for finding triggers and/or AEs. Reviews, posters, comments, studies solely focusing on adverse drug events, patient populations <18 years were also excluded. Duplicate references were removed using the software program EndNote\u00ae (EndNote X8, Thomson Reuters, New York, USA). Afterwards, all retrieved citations based on the titles and abstracts were screened. Study selection was performed in duplicate by two independent reviewers (DK and RR) according to the aforementioned in and exclusion criteria. Study eligibility was thereafter assessed by reading the full text. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus in which both reviewers had an equal vote. Quality assessment The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Gilbert criteria complemen - ted with criteria composed by Worster et al and Badcock et al.43-45 The criteria from these three studies combined, resulted in 15 criteria on which every study was evaluated. Qua - lity assessment was performed in duplicate by DK and RR. Rating categories used in the assessment were ''present'' or ''missing''. These were transformed into 1 and 0 and after scoring, the numbers were added together resulting in a score between 1 and 15. Scores Systematic review27 between 0-5 were seen as weak, between 6-10 as reasonable and between 11-15 as good. In table 4 (in the appendix) the results of this quality assessment are shown. Data extraction and analysis Data extraction was performed by DK. General data extracted from full-text included: author, year of publication, country, study aim, study design, instrument(s), sample characteristics, number of screening criteria, number of reviewers and number of records analysed for the measurement of the reliability. Extracted outcome data included: preva - lence of AEs, kappa agreement for AEs, percentage agreement, summary of main results and costs of AEs (appendix, table 3). Using basic descriptive statistics (mean with confi - dence intervals if available) these variables were summarized. We report all results of the WHO criteria separately. Costs were not corrected for inflation. Different currencies were transformed to euros to make comparison easier. We used the exchange of August 2018 (1 euro = 1.13 US dollar). The results of this systematic review are presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (appendix, table 5).46 Results Our search resulted in a total of 832 citations (step 1-4), after title and abstract screening 752 were discarded leaving 80 full text articles to assess their eligibility. Another 63 were excluded after full text evaluation leaving 17 for inclusion. After reading the references in these studies we found 76 additional studies. The included studies originated from 24 countries and sample size varied from 9647 to 210 million48 patients. Some studies were relevant for more than 1 criterion. Below, we report the results for every criterion separa - tely and according to the trigger tool (GTT or HMPS). The average quality of the included studies was reasonable (score 8.3). Criterion 1: Effectiveness in capturing the extent of harm (in different environments) 16 studies were identified of reasonable quality, which compare the use of the medical record review method to the use of another method to detect AEs in a hospital setting. A wide diversity of methods were compared with the GTT such as reporting notification systems49,50, a hospital survey on patient safety51, patient safety indicators (PSIs)49,52, com - plaints and claims by patients and their relative and incident reports53,54. For the HMPS, the outcomes were primarily compared with incident reports and furthermore patient-repor - ted AEs55 and patient complaints.56 1.1 GTT Kurutkan et al (2015) found that the GTT was 19 times more sensitive compared to in - ternal voluntary reporting for the detection of AEs.50 Another study by Farup et al (2015) detected an inverse association between the patient safety culture survey and AEs.51 Kennerly et al (2014) found that voluntary reports and PSIs captured less than 5 percent of the total AEs49 and this was also found by other studies.52,57 Rutberg et al (2014) found that 6.3% of the AEs detected by the GTT where reported with voluntary reporting.54 Mull et al (2015) compared three methods (veterans affair quality improvement programs, PSIs and voluntary incident reporting) with GTT and concluded that 12% of the AEs were also detected by one of the other methods.53 2 Chapter 2281.2 HMPS Christiaans-Dingelhoff et al (2011) linked four reporting systems with HMPS reviewed records: informal and formal complaints by patients or relatives, medico-legal claims by patients or relatives and incident reports by healthcare professionals. Less than 4% of the AEs identified by record review were found in at least one of the four reporting systems.58 Michel et al (2004) compared three methods: cross sectional, prospective and retros - pective review of records. The prospective and retrospective methods identified similar numbers of AEs (70% vs. 66% of the total) but the prospective method detected more pre - ventable AEs (64% vs. 40%). The cross sectional method showed a large number of false positives and identified none of the most serious AEs.35 Several studies compared the number of AEs found when using incident reports compa - red to the use of HMPS. Blais et al (2008) showed that in 15.5% of the cases with an AE an incident report was present.59 Also Sari detected underreporting by voluntary incident reporting, only 24% of all patient safety incidents and only 5% of those resulting in patient harm were detected with the HMPS method.60 de Feijter compared both patient com - plaints, medical record review (MRR) and incident reporting systems, they found that the type of AE found, was depending on the method used. Therefore, they recommend using a combination of methods when assessing patient safety in a hospital.56 Macharias' (2016) findings were in line with the other studies.61 Weissmann et al (2008) found that 23% of the patients had at least 1 patient-reported AE and 11% according to medical record review. The agreement between these two were poor for occurrence of any type of AE and slightly better for life-threatening or serious AEs.55 Bjertnaes et al (2015) showed a significant correlation between the two measure - ment methods.62 Criterion 2: Availability of reliable data 27 suitable studies of reasonable quality were found regarding the availability of reliable data in studies which a trigger tool method for medical record review. 2.1 Trigger tool The IHI method showed a PPV of 30.4% (95%CI:13.3-47.6).40,50,52,63-67 There was only one study that calculated the negative predictive value (NPV), which was 99%.52 The agreement on the presence of a trigger had on average a moderate agreement (kappa= 0.48 (95%CI: 0.18-0.77).2,63,64,66-68 In studies using the HMPS procedure, the positive predictive value (PPV) was on average 33.4% (95% CI:21.1-45.8).5,7-9,11,60,69-74 The agreement between the nurses on the presen - ce of a trigger showed on average a substantial agreement (kappa=0.63; 95% CI 0.55- 0.71).5,7,60,70,71,73,75 2.2 The AE assessment strategy Within the studies using the IHI trigger tool38 the kappa on the presence of an AE was on average 0.67 (good agreement, 95%CI:0.56-0.82).1,2,40,50,57,63,64,66,68,76-79 In three studies the agreement on the severity of the AE was investigated, which showed an average K of 0.40 (fair agreement, 95%CI:0.06-0.73).1,40,77,78Systematic review29 In HMPS studies the kappa between medical doctors on the presence of an AE in the medi - cal record was on average 0.58 (moderate agreement, 95%CI:0.33-0.82).5,7,11,60,72,80-82 Criterion 3: Suitability for large-scale or small, repeated studies 43 suitable studies of reasonable quality were found regarding the suitability of MRR for large-scale or small repeated studies. In the last decades, several large scale studies have been executed to assess the prevalen - ce of AEs in hospitals on a national level or the financial impact of AEs.1,2,5,9,40,41,69,71,76,79,83-92 The smaller studies were used for the training of the reviewers68, comparison with the detection rate of other methods 49,52,54,56,57,61,93-95, or for assessing the interrater reliability72,96 of the review. 3.1 Size The size of the studies varied from 1568 (training) records to 40,85187 and the number of hospitals investigated also varied, from 1 to 25 hospitals. Most of the studies were carried out in the US (16) and in Europe (14). 3.2 Cross country comparison Deilkas et al97 compared the AE rate between Norway and Sweden. There were significant - ly higher AE rates of surgical complications in Norwegian hospitals compared with Swed - ish hospitals. Swedish hospitals had significantly higher rates of pressure ulcers, falls and 'other' AEs. No significant difference between overall AE rates was found between the two countries.97 Criterion 4: Costs (financial, human resources, time and burden on system) Of the 12 studies found concerning the costs of AEs, 6 reported these results based on the review of medical records, the quality of these 6 studies was reasonable. Other reported the costs based on a hospital claim database48, a national medical and drugs claim databa - se, hospital cost accounting system.98 Furthermore, some studies used consensus based methodology, diagnostic coding error99 and estimation of social cost.100 The costs of an AE ranged between \u20ac2600 and \u20ac6436 with an average of \u20ac4296.8,73,79,91,101,102 Next to the cost of an AE, the cost of finding an AE using MRR is of equal importance. No studies were available on the cost of detecting an AE. Based on our own data (unpublished) the cost of detecting an AE with HMPS was \u20ac150.000 on a yearly basis and approximately \u20ac1800 for a single potentially preventable AE. Criterion 5: Effectiveness in influencing policy We found no trials or studies but only reports of projects concerning this issue. Short overview of studies mentioned in the context of PASQ (European Union Network for Patient Safety and Quality of Care) In the Netherlands, the reports by NIVEL have been published in the context of a research program named patient safety in the Netherlands. The first study was first performed to gain insight regarding AEs in Dutch hospitals.5 The two follow-up studies were executed to evaluate whether the safety programs had a positive influence on these AEs.85,103 According to experience in Norway and Sweden, MRR by the GTT method gives a valua - 2 Chapter 230ble overview of kind and incidence of AEs affecting patients and a good starting point for intensified patient safety improvement work.104,105 Criterion 6: Effectiveness in influencing hospital and local safety procedures and out - comes Our search revealed 5 studies investigating changes in AE rates during the study period. Kennerly et al (2013) showed a 7% reduction in AEs in 2 years (on average 3.5% per year).88 Suarez et al (2014) found during a 6-year study period a decrease of 2.5% (on average 0,4% per year).106 Deilkas et al (2017) showed that AEs rates decreased from 16.1% to 13.0% in two years (1.55% per year).87 However, Rutberg et al (2014) found no improvement during the 4 year study period in which the GTT was used, despite several initiatives for improving the quality in the hospital.107 Same for Landrigan (2010)1 and Mortaro (2017)90. Three national studies in the Netherlands (2004-2012) showed no changes in overall AE but did show a decrease of 45% regarding preventable AEs.103 However, the latest update in 2017 didn't show a further decrease of the preventable AEs and preventable deaths but did show a 2% decrease in overall AE.108 Landrigan et al also found slight improvements in a 5 year time period in the US.1 Criterion 7: Synergy with other domains of quality of care We found no trials or studies but only reports of projects concerning this issue. The IHI has defined six domains of quality of care.109 Medical record review has common ground with a few of these domains; safe, effective, timely and equitable. During medical record review a committee assesses whether AEs have occurred. The goal is to improve care, making it safer. Furthermore, it is evaluated whether the specific treatment of a particular patient was correct, right on time (effective and timely) and independent of personal characte - ristics (equitable). The project 'Deepening our Understanding of Quality Improvement in Europe' (DUQUE) investigated the relation between quality systems and patient related outcomes. Almost 200 hospitals in 8 European countries participated in DUQUE. Beside questionnaires, also medical record review and data registries were analysed. One of the conclusions of this project was that presence of quality systems has a positive effect on the safety culture in a hospital.109 Discussion Our study clearly shows there is abundant literature concerning MRR in hospitals. Howe - ver, almost 75% of these articles were of rather moderate quality (step 1-4). The first four WHO-criteria relate to characteristics of medical record review concerning validity, relia - bility and costs. They could effortlessly be extracted from the existing literature. The last three criteria relate to the ability of MRR to generate improvements in safety procedures and the quality of safety programs. Data concerning criterion five and seven was indirectly described or concealed in reports and therefore we were unable to evaluate the quality according to the quality checklist. The literature we found in relation to the first criterion showed that MRR reveals more AEs than any other method. But at the same time, MRR detects different AEs compared to Systematic review31 other methods. Furthermore, we found a moderate agreement for the presence of a trig - ger and a good agreement for the presence of an AE for the GTT. For the HMPS we found a substantial agreement for the presence of a trigger and a moderate agreement for the presence of an AE. Also, MRR seems suitable for both small and large cohorts as shown in several studies with different sample sizes. The costs concerning AEs can be the cost of the event itself (which is usually the topic of the literature we found), but also the cost of MRR. It is striking that most studies inves - tigating costs of AEs only evaluated costs related to the event. The only study we found evaluating also the costs of the detection method was published by Bates et al in 1995, but was not included in the current study because we selected studies published from the year 2000 and onwards. The costs for the detection of a single AE in 1995 was 103\u20ac and 241\u20ac for a preventable AE (\u20ac11.10 for every admission). Translating this to the current situation means a considerable amount of money for the detection instrument, let alone the costs of the AEs themselves. Because there is no agreement on which costs exactly should be taken into account concerning AEs, comparison between studies is difficult. For future research it is important to have a complete overview of all costs involved. It should contain the cost of the detection instrument, the direct cause of the AE itself, but also loss of working days, up to implementation of other protocols and their costs to prevent AEs. Only with these total costs we will be able to estimate the costs per quality adjusted life year to see if this is acceptable. The above is also underlined by a report of \u00d8vretveit (2009)110 and a more recent report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The results of the fifth criterion show that MRR can have an effect on healthcare policy. In Europe, the network for patient safety and quality of care (PASQ) has been active for 4 years. This network was co-funded and supported by the European Commission within the Public Health Program. Its focus was 'to improve Patient Safety and Quality of Care in Europe by supporting the implementation of good organizational practices and safe clinical practices in health care organizations and through sharing of information and experiences'. PASQ builds on the experience of the European Union Network for Patient Safety (EUNet - PaS) project (2008-2010 ) which established patient safety platforms in several European member states. The main outcome will be the consolidation of the permanent network for patient safety. Considerable efforts have been made worldwide in the healthcare systems to improve safety and to reduce errors in the treatment of patients. As is shown in criterion 6, these efforts have translated into only slight improvements in the overall safety of patients or in better quality of care. Finally, the last criterion shows that medical record review has focused on several domains of quality of care. Michel has composed an overview of strength and weaknesses of available methods for assessing AEs.111 MRR is one of these methods. Since then (2003) no update has been performed to investigate how well the trigger tools comply according to the WHO criteria. Instead of giving an overview of the available methods, we decided to focus on the 2 most used trigger tools. Also, in this overview Michel didn't give an insight into the quality of the included studies, rather compared the methods with each other. Furthermore, he evalua - ted the evidence-based rating of the methods for estimating AEs, for each criterion. 2 Chapter 232Our systematic review had several strengths and some limitations. We used extensive se - arch criteria (table S1) in several databases and also screened the references of the finally selected articles which, to our opinion, minimize the risk of missing important literature. Moreover, we used an accepted WHO strategy to evaluate this screening tool. Further - more, we combined several quality checklists to evaluate the quality of the included studies. An important limitation for drawing aggregate conclusions was the different methods stu - dies deployed. Although the same trigger tool method was used, almost every study adap - ted the triggers or the review process slightly. Besides that, different definitions and scales were used for both AEs and their preventability. Moreover, some studies used external reviewers, some internal reviewers or experienced reviewers. Although the intention was to evaluate the quality of all included studies, this was only possible for five out of seven WHO criteria. The reason was that the others were not suitable for evaluation according to our fifteen quality requirements. These were actually more reports than studies. For other studies, we found that important detailed information was not reported (for example: information on positive and negative agreement, reproducibility regarding the individual triggers). We only searched for studies from the year 2000 and onwards. There is a chance that important older studies have therefore been missed. However, we doubt that these findings would still be generalizable to today's care because of rapidly developing health - care and quality and safety improvements. Also, we were forced to write a systematic narrative review, due to the number of different studies we were not able to combine the numbers and create a meta-analysis. In conclusion, medical record review with either the GTT or the HMPS trigger tool is a reasonably well researched method for the evaluation of the medical records for AEs. However, looking at the WHO criteria for the evaluation of methods, much research is still lacking or of moderate quality. Also, more information is needed concerning costs of the detection method and the improvements in care and patient outcome. Only with this information MRR could be evaluated on its cost-effectiveness. Moreover, more insight in how MRR changes quality and safety of care is needed. We found no studies analysing the whole string that starts with the application of the triggers and ends with quality and safety improvement for individual patients at acceptable costs.Systematic review33 References 1.

Because it's too labour-intensive to screen the records of all patients, usually a sample is screened. Our sample consists of patients who died during their hospitalization because chances of finding preventable AEs in this subset are highest. Methods: Records were reviewed for fifteen triggers (n=2182). When a trigger was pre - sent, the records were scrutinized by specialized medical doctors who searched for AEs. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the total trigger system and of the individual triggers was calculated. Additional analyses were performed to identify a possible optimisation of the trigger system. Results: In our sample, the trigger system had an overall PPV for AEs of 47%, 17% for potentially preventable AEs. More triggers present in a record increased the probability of detecting an AE. Adjustments to the trigger system slightly increased the positive predic - tive value but missed about 10% of the AEs detected with the original system. Conclusion: In our sample of deceased patients the trigger system has a PPV comparable to other samples. However still, an enormous amount of time and resources are spent on cases without AEs or with non-preventable AEs. Possibly, the performance could be further improved by combining triggers with clinical scores and laboratory results. This could be promising in reducing the costly and labour-intensive work of screening medical records.The ability of triggers to predict potentially preventable AEs43 Introduction Unintentional medical harm received increased attention during the past years.1-10 Several years have passed since the report ''to err is human'' was published, in which the need for a safer health care system was emphasized. Fifteen years after this initial report, a recent update stressed the importance of continuing efforts to improve patient safety.11 Also, a recent Dutch paper (2013) showed that an average of 12% of patients who died in the hospital still experienced care related injury, which sometimes even contributed to the death of the patient.12 It is, therefore, important to identify AEs and to determine the risk factors related to their occurrence, in order to reduce harm to patients and improve the quality of care.13 It is time-consuming to screen all records for the presence of AEs. Therefore, \"triggers\" that can be easily identified in the medical records by well-trained nurses in a relatively short time, have been developed. Several trigger systems were created to screen medical records of hospitalized patients for AEs. These triggers are indicators or characteristics of the disease course, known to be often associated with AEs.14 The fact that cases can be missed, is generally accepted because investigating all records would be too time and cost-consuming in relation to the positive effect of screening. A well-known trigger system is the Global Trigger Tool (GTT), developed by the Institute for Healthcare improvement (IHI). Also, the system from the Harvard medical practice study (HMPS), with a smaller set of triggers, is often used.15,16 For the aforementioned trigger systems, the positive predic - tive value has been determined in several studies.3,17 However, the part of the quality cycle where medical records are scrutinized is still time-consuming and costly. Therefore, it is important to minimize the number of false positive results without increasing the num - ber of false negative results. Because it is too labour-intensive to screen the records of all patients, usually the screening is performed in a sample. Our sample consists of records of all patients who died during their stay. Therefore, in this study, we used a slightly adapted list of triggers. Examples of cases are illustrated in the supplementary data, to explain some of the most used triggers and the ones which needed extra explanation. It closely resembles the trigger list from the HMPS, but adjusted to be applicable to medi - cal records of deceased patients. Admittedly, AEs in diseases with negligible mortality but with an unfavourable outcome or hospitalization in departments with low mortality (e.g. ENT, ophthalmology, obstetrics, paediatrics etc.) would escape the opportunity for impro - vement of care using this sample. Although there are conflicting reports, the most recent and largest study concerning detection of preventable AEs showed that this is particularly effective in deceased patients.18-20 However, patients who die in hospitals are usually older with more comorbidities and therefore studies in these patients are not generalizable to the average hospital patient. In this study, we assumed that the probability of detecting (serious) AEs was highest in this subset of patients. This would then result in a manageable number of cases to be scrutinized by the committee, but still acquiring a fair overall esti - mation of the quality of treatment and causes of treatment failure. We wondered whether the positive predictive value (PPV) of the trigger system in deceased patients was accepta - ble compared to other study samples. Therefore, we analysed our database with informa - 3 Chapter 344tion on triggers and AEs of all in-hospital deaths in the past years. In addition to this, we performed supplementary analyses in an attempt to optimise the current trigger system. Methods This study was performed at the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC+), a teaching hospital in the south of the Netherlands. The medical records used in this study included all inpatient wards including children's. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospital. We also checked whether patients ever expressed objec - tions against the use of their data for research (this is recorded in a special database in the hospital). If so, their data were excluded. However, none of the patients that were in this sample, did so. The medical records of all patients who died in our hospital between January 1st, 2012 and January 1st, 2015 were explored by a team of trained nurses for the presence of triggers. Subsequently, a committee consisting of medical specialists from all major disciplines analysed the records to search for AEs. Both the screeners and the specialists were not time restricted. All results were saved using software provided by Medirede\u00ae, Clinical File Search version 3 (Mediround BV, 2015). This software was designed to store these data in a clear and easily accessible way. An AE was defined as an unintended outcome arising from the (non)-action of a caregiver and/or the health care system with damage to the patient resulting in temporary or permanent disability or death of the patient.21 If a potentially preventable AE was suspected, this was discussed with the involved medical department. Finally, the committee decided on the definite presence of an AE and its potential preven - tability. For the purpose of this study, we used the committee result as a gold standard for AEs. We did not evaluate the effect of hindsight bias, inter- and intrarater reliability. The starting point of our trigger system was the HPMS list, and we hypothesized that this list would be redundant in deceased patients.16 Trigger 1 (patient was admitted before (<12 months) for a reason related to the current admission) was adapted to a shorter period (<3 months) because analysis of previous years showed this trigger was not discriminative for potentially preventable AEs. The 12-month cut-off contained a large number of patients with planned chemotherapy or planned second stage operations. Two other triggers were not applicable in a deceased population. To create a simplified method of triggering, we calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) for the combination of triggers that can be detected by a computer search of the medical records (trigger 1, 4 and 5) and a combination of three triggers that generate the highest number of potentially preventable AEs (trigger 4, 7 and 8). Here, we only looked at the PPV for potentially preventable AEs as the outcome. The PPV of individual triggers was calculated as the rate at which a trigger was associated with an AE, both potentially preventable and not preventable.22 Furthermore, we calculated risk scores for an AE in pa - tients with a trigger taking the patient characteristics into account. These risk scores could then be used, to generate cut-off points leading to a smaller selection of records with a varying number of AEs depending on the chosen cut-off point.The ability of triggers to predict potentially preventable AEs45 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics are used to describe the general characteristics of the screened medi - cal records and the triggers used in this retrospective analysis. Chi-square tests and independent t-tests were performed to determine the differences between the groups of patients who experienced an AE during their stay, compared to the group of patients who did not develop an AE. Furthermore, multivariable backward logistic regression analyses (with classification cut- off 0.5) were performed for three scenarios, the first one to detect only computer detec - table triggers. The second algorithm contains all 15 triggers to identify the trigger with the highest odds for AEs and potentially preventable AEs. The last algorithm was used to determine the contribution of patient characteristics to the occurrence of AEs to identify possible additional factors that could improve the selection of cases with AEs. The presence of an AE was used as the dependent variable. Independent variables were: origin (coming from another hospital yes/no), emergency admission, age, gender, admissi - on specialism, and length of stay (in days). Referred by emergency admission was applica - ble when the patient was admitted via the emergency ward. Admission specialties were divided into surgical (e.g. urology, vascular surgery, gynaecology etc.) and medical depart internal medicine, gastroenterology, cardiology, pulmonology, rheumatology, paediatrics etc.). For evaluating the additional value of including the patient characteristics in this last logistic regression algorithm (algorithm 3), we have calculated the probability of every individual of having an AE, given the fact, one or more triggers would be positi - ve. In this algorithm, the following patient characteristics were included: urgent admis - sion, origin, age, gender, length of stay and admission specialism. The logistic regression algorithm yields a continuous outcome, i.e. the predicted probability ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. However, the algorithm will likely be used to classify patients into high risk versus low risk, or positive versus negative. To aid in choosing the right cut-off point for classification, we evaluated 6 different cut-off points. By computing test characteristics for each cut-off point, one cut-off point can be chosen that fits the need for either ruling in or ruling out an adverse event. Analyses were executed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23 (IBM Corporation, 2015), a p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The medical records of 2182 patients were investigated (shown in figure 1). The general characteristics of these patients are shown in table 1. Men were significantly younger than women (p=0.004) and they had a significantly higher chance of experiencing an AE (p=0.021). The length of stay is significantly longer in patients with an AE compared to pa - tients without an AE (p<0.001), whereas preventable and non-preventable AEs don't differ concerning the length of stay (p=0.911). 3 Chapter 346Figure 1 : Flowchart of the medical record analysis in this study The number of patients admitted to the medical departments is higher than to surgical departments. However, the percentage of patients with an AE is significantly higher at the surgical departments (p<0.001). The PPV of our trigger system is 47%, 589 of the 1,262 positively triggered cases had an AE. 217 of the 1,262 (17%) triggered cases were considered potentially preventable. Table 2 shows the distribution of the individual triggers and their PPVs. In the triggered cases, the number of unique triggers occurred with a mean of 2.39 per patient (95%CI:2.31-2.46). Finding more triggers gradually increased the likelihood of fin - ding a (potentially preventable) AE.

Total number of AEs is 625. 3 Chapter 350Table 3: Number of triggers and (potentially preventable) AEs with their PPV *PPV is positive predictive value Detecting AEs with a simple computer algorithm (algorithm 1) For this analysis, only computer detectable triggers were selected (trigger 1, 4 and 5). 777 cases were positively triggered and contained 391 AEs (this is 63% of the AEs (625) found with the original trigger set). The PPV for an AE with this selection of triggers is therefore 50%. This set of triggers found 147 potentially preventable AEs (66% of potentially preven - table AEs (222) found with the original complete trigger set). When we combine triggers that generate the highest number of potentially preventable AEs (trigger 4, 7 and 8), 162 AEs were found. The PPV for a potentially preventable AE with this system is therefore 20% (this is 73% of potentially preventable AEs (222) found with the original complete trigger set). Logistic regression with all fifteen triggers (algorithm 2) In the supplementary data (table 2), the results of individual triggers and AE is shown. The OR was highest for trigger 5 (OR=5.055) and trigger 6 (OR=3.501). Although not statistically significant, trigger 1 (OR=0.884) and trigger 15 (OR=0.826) sug - gest a lower risk for finding an AE. For preventable AEs, the OR was the highest for trigger 14 (OR=2.795), trigger 5 (OR=1.671) and trigger 6 (OR=1.588). Logistic regression with all fifteen triggers and patient characteristics (algorithm 3) The patient characteristics which were included in the logistic regression combined with the triggers were: urgent admission (yes/no), origin (coming from another hospital yes/ no), age, gender, the length of stay (days) and admission specialism (surgical/medical). In the supplementary data (table 4 and 5), the results of the combination of all triggers and these additional characteristics are shown.

A cut-off point of 0.3 would mean that 532 of the 589 cases with AE would be found and that fewer records were selected for review than in the original review (PPV is therefore 50%). With a cut-off point of 0.3, 194 of the 217 possibly preventable AEs will be detected. Higher cut-off points detected less AEs. Table 4: Cut-off points Discussion This study showed that the trigger system had an average PPV for AEs of 47% and for potentially preventable AEs of 17%. The more triggers found in a case, the higher the pro - bability of finding an AE. Adjustments to the trigger system slightly increased the PPV for AEs and potentially preventable AEs but fail to identify around 10% of cases (cut-off point 0.3) compared to the complete original trigger system. The triggers of the ''Harvard Medical Practice Study'' and the \"Global Trigger Tool'' have an overall PPV of 40.3% and 30.4% respectively.17 This matches well with the results in our sample. Looking at the individual triggers we found that unplanned removal, damage or repair of an organ (PPV=76.3% for total AE) and unplanned return to the operating room (PPV=82.1% for total AE) had the highest predictive value for an AE. A study by Naessens et al (2010) also showed that the trigger with the highest yield was 'return to the ope - rating room' where 80.6% of these patients suffered from an AE.22. Hwang et al (2014) analysed the global trigger tool. They found that only six triggers had positive predictive values of greater than 50%.23 Two of these PPV's could be reproduced by the triggers in our data. The definitions of the other triggers were not comparable. 12 of our triggers had a PPV higher than 50%. Possibly this is caused by a difference in patient selection (we only investigated deceased patients) or in the expertise of the committee that investigated the records and adjudged AEs. Clinical and patient characteristics associated with increased occurrence of AEs were admission through the emergency room, transfer from another hospital, a higher number of triggers and admission for a surgical specialism. Although the first three seem logical the latter suggests a higher risk in surgical wards that has no easy explanation. This has been noticed in other studies.4 Freund et al (2013) also found no significant difference in terms of age and sex.24 However, the data were not corrected for comorbidities or the condition Cut-off point Number of medical records selected AE found Cases AE 1259 589 0 217 0 >0.3 1061 532 57 194 23 >0.4 537 360 229 134 83 >0.5 437 310 279 118 99 >0.6 386 281 308 110 107 3 Chapter 352of the patients. Furthermore, the complications are usually closely related to a surgical intervention making the allocation of an AE to the intervention easy, whereas in medi - cal specialties the complications of, for instance, pharmacological interventions, are less predictable or occur later making the detection of a link more difficult. Moreover, surgeons are ahead with registration of complications compared to medical departments and this might simplify the finding an AE in these patients.25,26 One would expect that cases with multiple triggers or a longer duration of stay in the hos - pital experience more AEs. Our study indeed shows a higher risk for AEs as the number of triggers per case increases. Although there seems to be a trend in more risk for an AE with longer hospitalization, this was not statistically significant for preventable AEs. A report published by NIVEL (The Netherlands) in 2013 showed that on average 12% of all patients who die in the hospital experience an AE. In academic hospitals, this was 15.1% (95%CI 11.8-19.0). Four percent of the patients who died during their stay experienced a preventable AE according to this report (2.3% in academic hospitals).27 Our study found that 27% of all patients who died in the hospital experienced an AE of which 37% (10% of all patients) was considered potentially preventable. This might partially be explained by the fact that we, in contrast to NIVEL, also incorporated gynae - cology, psychiatry and neonatology cases. Although the subjects in the NIVEL study were older (75 vs. 69.6 years) they had a shorter length of stay (10.4 vs. 12.9 days) indicating this sample might not be completely comparable to ours. Furthermore, internal reviewers are known to find more AEs than external reviewers and NIVEL only recruited external reviewers which had a medical, surgical, or neurological background.28,29 A certain level of bias in judging single cases cannot be excluded and might also increase the number of AEs found. Internationally preventability of AEs ranges from 43 to 70%.30-32 This indicates that there are considerable differences in the way judgments about preventability, or even the presence of an AE, are made. Although some studies use different grades of preventability, there is no international consensus on how to specifically apply these grades. Therefore, comparisons can hardly be made in view of different methods used. Combining triggers and clinical characteristics seems promising in reducing the review of cases without an AE. However, some (potentially preventable) AEs will be missed. Quality and safety departments in hospitals have to decide on the optimal cut-off point. This could then result in less medical records necessary to be screened by the specialist, saving a fair amount of time and costs. Possibly entering additional variables into the system might increase the gain of this system. For example, clinical scores of vital functions (like modified early warning score) or laboratory results (like albumin, creatinine, haemoglobin level etc.). These might be combined with the existing triggers to improve the PPV. The strength of our study is the specific and reliable recording of triggers and AEs using software specifically developed for this purpose. Also, the number of cases from a single hospital over a period of 3 years is large enough to generate reliable results with small confidence intervals. Furthermore, there was a stable trigger team during the period se -The ability of triggers to predict potentially preventable AEs53 lected for this study and the presence of an AE was decided on after discussion within the committee generating broad support for the final decision. Preventability was judged by the consensus of several doctors with a variable background. In the face of a lacking inter - national consensus on this concept of preventability, this seems an optimal and acceptable method. Clearly, there are also points for improvement. We compared formerly reported PPV's of these two commonly used trigger sets in different patient samples with the result of a slightly adapted HPMS trigger set in our sample of deceased patients. We have a single measurement of our PPV over a period of three years whereas the PPV of the other trigger systems is based on an average of several studies presented in the literature. Furthermore, we have no information on the negative predictive value of our trigger system. It is possi - ble that some of the cases that were not triggered contain AEs or potentially preventable AEs. We realise that we looked into a subset of patients which makes our results not generaliza - ble to the average hospital patient. He or she might be younger with fewer comorbidities and other diseases in different departments. Therefore, important potentially preventable AEs in these patients could have been missed. Our data also gave us no information about the reproducibility of the trigger system. For the HMPS method, Kappa values are reported between 0.5333 and 0.7634 (moderate to good agreement), for the IHI method between 0.2035 and 0.7836 (slight to good agreement). Lastly, it is likely that in a confirmation stu - dy that the PPVs will be lower than we have found in this derivation study. In our opinion, it is disappointing that trigger systems select over 50% of cases without an AE. Even after combining several triggers the PPV does not significantly improve. This me - thod remains, therefore, labour-intensive until we can define triggers or trigger sets with a higher PPV. Further research to optimise these systems concerning the combination of triggers with patient characteristics or possible even laboratory results seems warranted. Due to the expected higher number of AEs in deceased patients, we expected this tool to perform better in this subsample of patients. However, we think that the PPV of the HPMS in this sample is disappointing but compares well to results from general inpatient samples using the HPMS or IHI trigger system. 3 Chapter 354References 1.

His previous history reports epilepsy after excision of a meningioma. His anti-epileptic drugs were recently changed because of his liver failure. During hospitalization he suffered a seizure with aspiration making transfer to the ICU necessary. Despite maximal treatment including intubation there was no improvement and the patient died several days later. Trigger 1 re-admittance Trigger 4 unexpected transfer to the ICU Trigger 15 seizure possibly related to medication change? Case B: A 78-year-old male was admitted because of chest-pain. Two vessel coronary disease and an aortic stenosis with a gradient of 40 mmHg were diagnosed. After CABG with aortic valve replacement the patient remained unstable on the ICU due to cardiac tamponade. There was a re-operation were blood was removed from the pericardium but no clear bleeding focus was identified. Thereafter, his condition deteriorated quickly with intestinal ischemia for which a colectomy was done. Despite this and maximal treatment he died one day later. Trigger 5 unplanned return to the operating roomThe ability of triggers to predict potentially preventable AEs57 Case C: A 89-year-old male was admitted because of cholecystitis due to an obstructing gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. He was treated with an external drain and amoxicillin/clavu - lanic acid. His condition improved gradually. After 4 days he was found in bed early in the morning with a Glasgow coma score of 1-1-1. A cerebral CT-scan revealed a large subdural hematoma with midline shift. He died the same day. Trigger 10 Unexpected death Case D: A 93-year-old male was admitted because of sudden delirium. His previous history revea - led atrial fibrillation for which he used warfarin. The primary analysis, including CT of the brain, did not reveal a direct cause. On day four he fell to the floor on his way to the toilet. He hit his head and a new CT scan showed a subdural hematoma. His INR was 5.5 and he immediately received coagulation factor concentrate.

One of them is retrospective chart review. A team of experts scrutinizes medical records, selected by trigger systems, to detect possible adverse events (AEs). The most important AEs and more hints for possible improvement of care appear in deceased patients. Using triggers in a sample of these patients might increase the performance and lower the burden of scrutinizing records without possible preventable AEs. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the performance of the trigger system in a sample of deceased patients and to calculate the specificity and the sensitivity of this trigger system for predicting AEs. Methods: We performed a study in which the records of deceased patients were screened for triggers by a team of trained nurses. A sample of 100 medical records was randomly se - lected out of records which had been screened before, prior to the study in 2016. For the determination of significant differences between the first and second screening, McNe - mar's test of symmetry was used. Also, observed agreement, Cohen's Kappa and prevalen - ce-adjusted and-bias-adjusted-kappa (PABAK) statistics were calculated. This was done for the two trigger rounds on both any trigger present and for every trigger separately. Results: The observed agreement for any given trigger was 75% with a Kappa and PABAK of 0.5. For the individual triggers, the observed agreement was on average 90%. The corres - ponding Kappa was on average 0.42 -0.03-0.78) and the average PABAK was 0.8 (range: 0.44-0.92). Two adverse events were found in cases without triggers previously. The recalculated specificity and sensitivity for the original population were 58% and 92% respectively. Conclusion: For the reproducibility of triggers it seems that some perform better than others, but on average this is to our opinion suboptimal. The low specificity implies that many records are selected without AEs. This leads to a high false-positive rate making this labour-intensive record review process costly. Therefore, research for better and more expedient systems is required. Performance of the HMPS trigger system65 Introduction Improving quality and safety of care in hospitals has become an important focus of health care policy in the past decades. This was initiated by reports such as ''to err is Human'' (1999), and in the Netherlands by the report \"adverse events in Dutch hospitals\" (2004).1,2 The latter study was repeated in 2008 and 2012. Although there was an improvement, still a considerable number of (potentially preventable) adverse events (AEs) was found.3,4 Also a report by Landrigan et al (2010) stated that further efforts are necessary to improve safety strategies and to monitor health care safety over time.5 To detect possible threats to quality and safety, multiple systems have been developed. One of them is retrospective chart review. A team of experts scrutinizes medical records to detect possible AEs. The involved departments should then be able to learn from these events and improve their care by increasing awareness and adapting protocols or guidelines. It is clear that screening of the medical records of all patients by specialists is time-consu - ming and costly.6 Therefore, trigger systems have been developed to select cases in which an AE is probably present.7 Triggers are clues which alert screeners for potential AEs (for example \"unplanned transfer to the intensive care unit''). The medical record can then be thoroughly reviewed to determine if an actual AE has occurred. There are two main trigger systems used widely and the triggers are usually applied to the medical files by trained screeners in both systems. The first one was developed for the Harvard Medical Practice Study (HMPS) study and has 18 triggers.8 Thereafter, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) tried to improve the performance of this trigger tool and developed their system with 54 triggers.9 Both systems are used for retrospective medical record review. However, in contrast to the IHI trigger system, the HMPS method is mostly used for research purposes.10 Although the HMPS trigger set is rather old, it is still used in national screening programs to evaluate patient safety in hospitals.10-13 Usually, these trigger systems are applied to records of discharged patients which are func - tioning well. However, the literature shows that the most important AEs and more hints for possible improvement of care in all patients appear in deceased patients.14-17 Moreover, several studies have shown higher numbers of preventability of AEs in this subgroup.2,12,14,18 Thus, apart from optimizing the trigger tool itself, using it in this sample of patients might increase the performance and lower the burden of scrutinizing records without possible preventable AEs.19 Finding AEs and possible points of improvement is considered impor - tant by our hospital and therefore medical record review of deceased patients has been applied for many years. We wondered if the performance of the trigger system would be better in a sample of deceased patients because it was shown that in these patients more triggers can be easily found.20 Therefore, we performed a study in which the records of deceased patients were screened twice for these triggers by the same team of trained nurses. Our aim was to determine the agreement for the two trigger rounds on both any trigger present and for every trigger separately using the HMPS trigger system in deceased patients. 4 Chapter 466Methods Medical record review Screeners Since 2008 a stable team of seven nurses with broad clinical experience (all working more than 10 years in their clinical department) has screened the medical records of all de - ceased patients for the presence of triggers from the HMPS system. They were trained in record review and patient safety initially for the national monitoring on triggers and AEs as described by the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL).21 During their work at the intensive care and emergency departments, they have been confronted frequently with dying patients. This has resulted in them being pre-eminently suitable to judge events concerning these patients. Trigger system Patient identification details of those who died during their stay were uploaded in a secu - red software program designed to aid medical record review of deceased patients (Medire - de\u00ae, Clinical File Search version 3; Mediround BV, 2015). Then the matching records were screened by one of the nurses from the team using the HPMS trigger system. If a medical record contained at least one trigger, it was regarded as positive and was then forwarded to the review committee and scrutinized for the potential presence of AEs. This is shown in figure 1. Figure 1: Procedure of medical record review in our centre (A) Identification details of all deceased patients are inserted in the Medirede\u00ae database (B) and the corresponding medical record is screened by one of the nurses. (C) When one or more triggers are found in the medical record (registered in Medirede), the case is flagged and will continue to the review committee. (D) When no trigger is found (also registered in Medirede), no further action will be taken in the normal screening procedure. (E) The committee evaluates the cases and will determine whether (F) an adverse event occurred or (G) not. Performance of the HMPS trigger system67 We used a slightly adapted version of the HMPS trigger system to make it suitable for the screening of deceased patients.22 The triggers regarding transfer to another acute care hospital and unplanned inappropriate discharge to home were omitted as they have no relevance in deceased patients. The same triggers were used throughout the whole period except the trigger regarding readmission of the patient which was changed in 2013 (originally; the patient was admitted before (<12 months) for a reason related to index admission). Analysis of our database showed that this trigger was not discriminative for (potentially preventable) AEs (data not shown). For example: within the 12-month period, many patients were selected with planned repeated chemotherapy or planned reversal operations (which by their very nature are not related to AEs and thus not useful for our purposes). Therefore, the definition of trigger 1 was adapted to ''patient has been admit - ted in the previous three months for a reason related to the index admission''. Example of cases with corresponding triggers is explained in further detail elsewhere.23 Each record was reviewed twice by one of the nurses, once prior to the study in the context of their regular work as screeners and once during this study. Review committee Usually, only medical records with a trigger were forwarded to one of the members of the review committee. The committee consisted of several clinical specialists representing the departments with most of the in-hospital deaths who were trained to identify AEs accor - ding to NIVEL standards.21 For this study, they also evaluated records without a trigger (figure 1, D). After an evaluation of the medical record, they decided together (in a consen - sus meeting) whether an AE had occurred during the hospitalisation of the patient. Study This study was performed in 2016 at the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC+), a large teaching hospital in the south of the Netherlands. The medical records that were used in this study included a sample of all inpatient deaths between January 2012 and January 2015 (in total 2182 cases). The study protocol was approved by the medical ethics committee of our hospital. Data and analysis We aimed to get a point estimate with an exact 95% confidence level and a confidence interval of 5% to each side, based on the total number of records. Hence, we needed to in - clude at least 92 cases. Therefore, a sample of 100 medical records was randomly selected (with the use of Excel's random generator) out of records which had been screened in the preceding years. Characteristics of the patient sample are presented in table 1. 4 Chapter 468Table 1: General characteristics of the patient sample (2012-2015) Average age (years) 67.6 Gender 15% surgery 24% internal medicine Average length of stay (days) 13.5 We selected fifty of these records from the set without triggers in the first screening and fifty from the set with at least one trigger present. The study flow is depicted in figure 2. To ensure that the nurses were blinded to the results of the first screening we changed the ID numbers of the records, making it impossible to consult previous results. Figure 2: Study flow In the primary analysis, the nurses were analysed as a group instead of as individuals. If a small subsample of at least ten cases was triggered by the same nurse during the first and second round, we calculated the Kappa also separately in this subgroup analysis. For the determination of significant differences between the two screening rounds, McNe - mar's test of symmetry was performed. Observed agreement and Cohen's Kappa statistics (with 95% confidence interval; CI) were calculated between the two trigger rounds on both any trigger present and for every trigger separately. For the calculation of the observed Performance of the HMPS trigger system69 agreement (reliability), we divided the total number of cases with a comparable judgment in both screening rounds by the total number of reanalysed records (100). We also chec - ked whether there was a difference between objective triggers (trigger 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 14) and subjective triggers (trigger 2, 12, 13, 15). Furthermore, we calculated prevalence-adjusted and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) and reported this along with Kappa, to show how data would have been with equal distribu - tions of positive and negative test results. Finally, we determined prevalence-indexes and bias-indexes.24 Analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23 (IBM Corporation, 2015). A p<0.05 was indicated as significant. All selected records were evaluated by the review committee (regardless if triggers were found by our screeners). We recalculated the numbers of triggers and AEs to represent the original number of patients in the specific population. With this information, we were able to calculate the specificity and sensitivity of the trigger system. Results Results for any trigger present Table 2 shows that the second screening revealed 20 new cases with a trigger. 45 cases had a trigger in both screening rounds. This resulted in 65 records with a trigger in this study. After the screening in the study, 35 records didn't have a trigger. 30 of these records didn't have a trigger in both screening rounds. 5 of these records had a trigger after the first screening but remained without trigger after the screening in the study. The observed agreement for the triggers was 75%, and the corresponding Cohen's Kap - pa was 0.50 (95%CI:0.34-0.66). PABAK was calculated as 0.5 (95%CI:0.29-0.66). An exact McNemar's test confirmed that there was a significant difference in the proportion of positively triggered records the first and second time, with p=0.004.

In the cases without a trigger in both rounds 2 AEs, were found. After recalculating the numbers of these propor - tions to represent the whole population we found a specificity of 58% (95% CI 55.7-60.8) and a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 90.1-94.2) for detecting AEs. Results for the individual triggers In table 3, the results are shown for the individual triggers during the first and second screening. Trigger 12 was not present in both screening rounds. Eleven triggers were more often detected during the assessment in this study. Kappa for agreement ranged between 0.03 and 0.78 for the individual triggers, with an average of 0.42. The average PABAK was 0.80. The observed agreement was on average 90%. McNemar's test was executed for every single trigger but was only significant for trigger 15 (p<0.0001). Trigger 15 was significantly more found in the second round. Furthermore, the objective triggers had a higher average Kappa (0.46) compared to the subjective triggers (average K= 0.28). The corresponding PABAK was 0.82 and 0.71, respectively. Subanalyses These subanalyses were executed because twelve cases were analysed by the same nurse during the two screenings. For any trigger present, the Kappa was 0.63 (95%CI:0.15-1), PABAK was 0.67 (95%CI:0.25-1). The average Kappa of the individual triggers was 0.70 and the average PABAK was 0.83. If these twelve cases would be excluded from the total analyses, the Kappa for any trigger present would be 0.48 (95%CI:0.30-0.67) (compared to 0.5 with these 12 included) and PA - BAK would be 0.48 (95%CI:0.29-0.66). The average Kappa for the individual triggers would be 0.39 (compared to 0.42 in the total sample) and corresponding PABAK 0.78.

The average Kappa of individual triggers was 0.42 (range 0-0.78). Our average Kappa of 0.5 (moderate agree - ment according to Landis et al), appears to be slightly lower than results found in other studies, where a range between 0.49-0.76 was reported.3,4,21,25-28 However, compared to three Dutch reports which included results of screening for triggers in a sample of cases in 21 hospitals, our Kappa was within the same range.3,4,21 Naessens (2010) and Ock (2015) evaluated the inter-rater reliability for individual triggers selected either from the HMPS study or the IHI trigger system or both. Four of the triggers investigated by Naessens et al, were comparable to our triggers. Half of these had a higher Kappa agreement in our study compared to Naessens et al. Two out of the three comparable triggers in the study of Ock et al (2015) performed better in their study compared to ours.29,30 However, again, the population here was sampled from living non-pediatric inpatients. Concerning the average observed agreement for individual triggers, Unbeck et al (2014) reported that the reproducibility of the individual triggers was on average 46%, in com - parison with 67% reproducibility in our study. The total agreement for any trigger present was 65.0% compared to 90% in our study.31 Regrettably, Unbeck et al didn't report the per - formance of the triggers on an individual level and studied only living pediatric inpatients. Therefore, this is the first study investigating the performance of the individual triggers of the HMPS trigger system solely in deceased patients. Not surprisingly, objective triggers were more reproducible than subjective triggers. The Kappa coefficient is influenced by the prevalence of the condition and by bias. Therefore, we also calculated the PABAK. This improved the reliability score, resulting in moderate substantial to almost perfect inter-tester reliability for the individual triggers. An exception was the trigger concerning other patient complications which showed almost no improvement with an end result still well below moderate reliability. The outcomes of these calculations suggest that the low value of Kappa was influenced mainly by the low prevalence of triggers. Obviously, the performance of the trigger system is important. It should not miss records with serious and potentially preventable AEs and preferably not select any records without AEs. Because trigger systems are used as an aid to reduce the burden of scrutinizing all re - cords, it implies that important AEs could be missed. The fact that new cases with triggers were found in the second round supports this idea. Due to our random sample of records, we believe that the calculation of the estimated sensitivity and specificity approaches reality. Therefore, when we apply these values found in this study to the entire population of deceased patients in our hospital the false negati - ve rate would be 8%. The high sensitivity of the system to find cases with an AE was rather comforting. In contrast to a high sensitivity, the specificity of this trigger system was rather low (58%) compared to most of the other studies.22,32-35 This results in a substantial number of cases 4 Chapter 474that have to be scrutinized without finding an AE. However, equal results were presented by Howard et al (2017) and our results were slightly better in comparison to Neubert et al (2006), Eggleton et al (2014) and Matlow et al (2011).36-39 The variability in triggered cases with a low Kappa suggests unfavourable characteristics of this system. This possibly results in considerable useless time-consuming scrutinizing of records by expensive specialists. Solutions to improve efficacy could be the use of more reproducible triggers (such as the objective ones), combining triggers with patient cha - racteristics, or fully computerized trigger detection by \"data mining\" software.23 Before implementing such adaptations, we suggest thorough research concerning the exact performance and costs for finding preventable AEs. However, at the moment there are no better systems available for case selection. Among the strengths of our study is the fact that the nurses were blinded to the results of the first trigger round. Furthermore, in our system, there were no time limitations while searching for triggers. We, therefore, assume that cases were investigated thoroughly and complete which makes the possibility of a missed trigger as low as possible. A disadvantage of our study is the small randomly selected sample of all cases that were screened previously. However, this sample was strong enough to detect the real propor - tion of triggers. Another issue could be the selection of deceased patients. Some studies report that a focus on deaths may not be the most efficient approach or an unsuitable indicator to compare the quality of hospitals.11,40 Yet, mortality is the event caretakers and patients want to prevent. Of course, departments with low mortality or those who treat non-life-threatening diseases, such as ENT and dermatology, will rarely hear about their AEs from this type of medical record review. As several studies show, AEs don't have to result in death.2,26,41 They can also cause temporary or permanent injury. Triggers are indi - cations for all AEs, not necessarily for those who cause death. Hence, another chart review system could be more applicable to those departments. Finally, trigger 1 was changed during the time course in which we selected cases for this study. This could have potential - ly influenced the results. However, trigger 1 was found more often in the second screening round where we expected less often because we shortened the time period making it positive. Therefore, we do not think this influenced our results materially. Interestingly, more triggers were found during the second round, especially trigger 15 was significantly more present being responsible for most of the difference. In our opinion, supported by a p-value <0.0001 resulting from the McNemar's chi-square test this cannot be attributed to chance alone. We suspect that extra attention among the nurses due to the fact that the second round of review was part of a study might have contributed to this. Furthermore, one could suspect an increase in experience although our team of nur - ses was deployed for many years in a stable team and cases were selected from a recent period. However, some of the cases that were triggered the first time were not found in the second round. Although memorizing the results in a specific case could have given rise to bias, we found only 12 cases that were checked by the same nurse. Excluding these 12 cases did not influence the results significantly. We realise that we only analysed a small part of the complete process of looking back at Performance of the HMPS trigger system75 our proceedings, determine essential parts, develop new solutions and applying them in future care. Moreover, there is no information about the performance of this trigger system in improving health care. However, we think it is important to increase knowledge about these components to optimise care in the end. Conclusion In conclusion, applying the adjusted HMPS trigger system as an aid to select records of deceased patients with possible AEs has, in our opinion, a suboptimal Kappa possibly influenced by the low prevalence of individual triggers. Awaiting better selection systems this is, however, the best way to avoid doing a time consuming and costly analysis of all cases. Moreover, it can identify possible threats to quality and safety which can then be further investigated by other methods. However, we have to realise that selection of cases for a more thorough investigation by these common trigger systems, with many subjective triggers, is only moderately reproducible with a low specificity for AEs. Therefore, studies to evaluate possible improvements of these systems or even other systems are important to increase the expediency of these costly tools. 4 Chapter 476References 1.

Moreover, we also evaluate the root cause of AEs and their reproducibility of these AEs concerning their preventability and their contribution to death?'' Methods: Reviewers re-examined fifty medical records of deceased patients regarding the presence of AE, their potential preventability and their possible contribution to death. Also we investigated the root causes of the preventable AEs. Results: The Kappa on the presence of an AE was 0.64 and 0.32 for the potential preven - tability. The intrarater agreement showed a Kappa of 0.61 on the AE presence and 0.64 for the potential preventability. Interrater agreement showed a Kappa of 0.66 for the AE presence and 0.03 for the potential preventability. Conclusion: We found a fair reproducibility for the detection of AEs, but a poor reproduci - bility for the potential preventability. Possibly this was caused by lack of a definition for the preventability of AEs. To our opinion an international consensus on what exactly constitu - tes preventability of AEs and agreement on a definition is necessary.Internal reproducibility of medical record review81 Introduction The quality and safety of patient care have gained attention in the past decades. Many methods are used with the aim to improve the quality of care. One of these methods is medical record review. In several university hospitals in the Netherlands the focus of medical record review is on the detection of preventable adverse events (AEs) in patients who have died during their stay. The records of this group of patients are assumed to contain more (preventable) AEs in comparison with discharged (alive) patients.1 Often, trigger systems are used for medical record review because these lower the burden of review, by selecting records. Triggers are clues to alert the screeners for potential AEs so the medical record can be reviewed to determine if an actual AE has occurred.2-5 Nonet - heless, the conclusion that a potentially preventable AE has occurred is stressful for the involved professionals. A common reaction is therefore to dispute the judgment of the committee instead of evaluating the case itself and subsequently improving care.6,7 To prevent discussions regarding the accuracy of the judgment post hoc, this judgment should be reliable and reproducible.8-13 It is likely that if the committee judgment would prove to be reproducible, professionals are more inclined to accept the outcome. There are several studies which investigated the inter-rater reliability using the Harvard medical practice study (HMPS) trigger tool regarding the presence and the preventability of an AE in a mixed (alive and deceased) population. However, these studies showed a moderate reliability for the presence and preventability of an AE.14-29 Moreover, improving quality and safety of care in an already reasonable safe environment leads to an exponential increase in costs. Therefore, we think health care providers should select the most optimal tests to measure and improve their performance. In order to determine the best methods, qualifying them, making them com - parable, and optimising their use, further research is necessary. In our search for better, more reliable methods we hypothesized that our method would show better outcomes compared to previous studies because in our centre the entire review committee discusses the results of the medical record evaluation instead of in pairs or by oneself as is usually reported.4,30-32 Therefore, our main question in this study was: ''What is the reproducibility of the judg - ment of medical records by an internal committee reviewing medical records of deceased patients regarding AE presence. Moreover, we also evaluate the root cause of AEs and their reproducibility of these AEs concerning their preventability and their contribution to death?'' 5 Chapter 582Methods Medical record review method Since 2008, a stable team of experienced nurses (each with more than 10 years of clini - cal experience) with an affinity for record review and patient safety, screen the medical records of all deceased patients for the presence of triggers. Medical record review was introduced in our hospital in 2008 as a project called ''preventing medical injury.'' The aim of this project was to improve the quality and safety of patient care by reducing and pre - vention of unintended medical injury happening to patients in our hospital. We use a slightly adapted version of the HMPS trigger system16 to make it suitable for the screening of deceased patients. Therefore, triggers regarding transfer to another acute care hospital and unplanned inappropriate discharge to home were omitted, as they have no relevance in deceased patients. In case a medical record has at least one trigger, it is forwarded to the review committee. Further explanation on the trigger system is published in larger detail elsewhere.33 The procedure of the medical record review is also shown in figure 1. The study protocol was approved by the medical ethics committee of our hospital. The committee explicitly gave their oral consent to participate in this study and publication of the results. Figure 1: Flowchart of the medical record review procedure Internal reproducibility of medical record review83 Definitions The following definitions were applied in the medical record review: An AE was defined as an unintended outcome caused by the (non-)action of a caregiver and/ or the healthcare system resulting in temporary or permanent disability or death of the patient. An AE was considered as preventable, if in retrospect after a systematic analy - sis of the events, it seems that certain measures could have resulted in the prevention of the AE.34 Committee The medical records with a trigger which are forwarded to the review committee are redirected to the member with experience and expertise concerning the case. For exam - ple, if a patient died during a surgical procedure, a surgeon analyses the medical record for AEs. We chose this approach because we believe that the considerations on the presence of an AE are best made by a specialist experienced with the usual procedures, protocols and the possible treatments for a certain disease. The committee consists of 9 specialists with different specialties (internist, neurologist, pulmonologist, pediatrician/neonatologist, internist/oncologist, anaesthetist, surgeon, cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon and inter - nist/geriatrician) representing the departments with most of the in-hospital deaths. The members are both active (working in our hospital) and recently retired (who used to work in our hospital) experienced specialists. After a thorough investigation by this committee member, the results are presented to the rest of the committee. A first conclusion on the potential presence of an AE is establis - hed in a weekly meeting with at least 4 committee members present. Subsequently, after consulting the involved physicians, the committee finally decides on the presence of an AE, the potential preventability, and the possible contribution of this AE to the death of the patient. If an AE was considered potentially preventable the committee identified the preventable cause according to a standard list of factors (supplementary data, table 1). Data The results of the triggering by the nurses and the review by the specialists are saved using software provided by Medirede\u00ae, Clinical File Search version 3 (Mediround BV, 2015). This software was designed to store the data of the medical record review in a clear and easily accessible way. Selection of records for this study With regard to our main research question we aimed to get a point estimate with a 95% confidence interval of 6% to each side. Hence, we needed to include 50 cases for the evaluation of the reproducibility of the AE. We randomly selected these medical records out of the database which contained 1262 previously triggered and evaluated medical records of deceased patients between 2013 and 2015. This period was chosen to avoid the presence of recently debated cases in the study sample and therefore minimizing the risk of recognition of cases and remembering former decisions by the committee members. Fig 1 shows the random selection procedure. We used the Excel random generator for the random selection of the study records. Of the 50 randomly selected cases, 25 had an AE after the first evaluation by the committee. We blinded the committee for the previous results of their medical record review. Therefore, the digital results of the first screening 5 Chapter 584round were inaccessible and thus irretrievable for the reviewers. Figure 2: Flowchart of the selection of the medical records in this study Analysis After this re-evaluation of the medical records by the committee, we compared the outcomes of the two rounds regarding the presence of AEs, the preventability and their contribution to the death of the patient on a team level. The preventability of an AE was scored as being potentially preventable or not preventable. The contribution of an AE to the death of the patient was also scored dichotomous as potential contributing to death or no contribution. Hence, we calculated the observed overall agreement (in %) to get an impression of the reproducibility of the judgment. By using cross tabulation, we calculated the observed overall agreement (accuracy) within the three groups (presence, preventability, and contribution) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval. Therefore, the number of both rounds negative (without AE) and both rounds positive (with AE) was summed and divided by the total number of medical records. Furthermore, we calculated the positive and negative agreement separately. To determine the reliability for AE presence, preventa - bility, and contribution to death, we executed Cohen's Kappa statistics and the McNemar's test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Because the judgment of the committee might be influenced by the presenter of a case, we also evaluated the out - comes of the medical record review after the review and presentation to the committee by different specialists (inter-rater reliability) and by the same specialist (intra-rater reliabili - ty). Thereafter, we checked if the AEs found in the second evaluation were the same as the original ones found. Finally, we compared the preventable causes to determine agreement between the first and second evaluation. Internal reproducibility of medical record review85 Results Analyses comparing the outcomes of the first and the second round on a team level Presence of an AE (Table 1a) During the first screening of the medical records (previous to the study), the committee found 25 AEs, the second time (during the study) 28 AEs were found. There was an overlap of 22 AEs which were found both times. The observed agreement for the presence or ab - sence of an AE was 82.0%. The corresponding Cohen's Kappa was 0.64 (95%CI 0.48-0.80). McNemar's test showed a value of 0.51, this means there was no significant difference in the proportion of AEs found in both rounds. Table 1a: AEs found in first and second round Second round Total Absent Present First round Absent 19 6 25 Present 3 22 25 Total 22 28 50 Presence of potential preventability In the first round, 17 of the 25 AEs had the indication to be potentially preventable, in the second round 11 of the 28 AEs were found to be potentially preventable. The corres - ponding observed overall agreement of the preventable AES was 65% (Table 1b), and the Cohen's Kappa was 0.32 (95%CI 0-0.65). McNemar's test showed a value of 0.070, which indicates there was no significant difference in the proportion of preventability found in both rounds. Table 1b: Potential preventability of the AEs found Second round Total Not preventable Potentially preventable First round Not preventable 5 1 6 Potentially preventable 7 10 17 Total 12 11 23 Possible contribution to death of the patient For the calculation of the agreement regarding the possible contribution of the AE to the death of the patient, we compared the cases (22) with the same AEs in both rounds. 21 of these AEs were considered to possibly have contributed to the death of the patient, in the first round. (McNemar=0.125) During the second screening, the committee concluded that 22 of the 22 AEs possibly contributed to the death of the patient. The accuracy was, therefore, 95%. 5 Chapter 586Table 1c: Potential contribution to death in both rounds Second round Total No contribution Potential contribution First round No contribution 0 1 1 Potential contribution 0 21 21 Total 0 22 22 Intrarater reliability - repeatability (individual level) 31 of the 50 cases were reviewed by the same committee member during the evaluation in both rounds. The observed overall agreement for the presence of an AE in this subgroup was 81%, and the corresponding Kappa was 0.61 (95%CI:0.33-0.89). The agreement on the presence of an AE was 79% and the agreement on the absence of an AE was 82%. McNe - mar's test showed a value of 1.000, thus there was no significant difference found in the proportion of AEs in both rounds. For the preventability of the AEs the observed overall agreement was 57% and the corresponding Kappa 0.64 (95%CI:0.18-1). The agreement on the presence of an AE was 100% and the agreement on the absence of an AE was 60%. An exact McNemar's test determined that there was no significant difference in terms of the preventability of the AEs found the first and second time (p=0.500). 11 cases in which a possible contribution to death was concluded in the first screening, the second screening found the same result, this means a 100% agreement. Interrater reliability - reproducibility (individual level) 19 of the 50 medical records were scrutinized by different doctors during their evaluati - on in both rounds. The observed overall agreement for the presence of an AE was 84%, and the Cohen's Kappa was 0.66 (95%CI:0.30-1) in this subgroup. The agreement on the presence of an AE was 79% and the agreement on the absence of an AE was 100%. Mc - Nemar's test showed a p-value of 0.250, no significant difference in the proportion of AEs found in both rounds. For the preventability, the observed overall agreement was 45%, and the Cohen's Kappa was 0.03 (95%CI:0-0.55). The agreement on the presence of an AE was 75% and the agreement on the absence of an AE was 29%. An exact McNemar's test determined that there was no significant difference in the proportion of preventability of the AEs found the first and second time (p=0.219). In 10 out of the 11 cases in which a possible contribution to the death of the patient was determined in the first screening, the second screening concluded the same, resulting in 91% agreement. Root cause analysis The total number of cases with a potentially preventable adverse event in both sessions, hence labeled with a suspected cause, was nine. The overall agreement on this cause was 78%, with a Kappa of 0.5 (95%CI:0-1). McNemar's test was 1.00 indicating no significant difference. Internal reproducibility of medical record review87 Discussion This is the first study assessing the inter- and intrarater reliability for the presence of AEs, their preventability and potential contribution to death among deceased hospital patients. We showed that independent of the committee member involved in the second evaluati - on, there is a good reliability for the presence of an AE, but only a fair reliability regarding the preventability of an AE. Potential contribution to death was highly reproducible. Howe - ver, it should be realised that this finding could be distorted by the small number of cases (11) with the same AE in both rounds which were considered to contribute to the death of the patient. Moreover, there was almost no AE that did not contribute to the death of a patient. At the same time, it was difficult to exclude that an AE did not contribute to the death of the patient. It seems, therefore, that the trigger system especially selects cases with AEs that contribute to or cause death. In addition, we couldn't calculate the Kappa for this section due to the low numbers in the cells of the two by two tables. Our committee found more AEs when scrutinizing the same records for the second time. Therefore, the question remains if the number of AEs found eventually is the true number of AEs. Even if the inter-rater reliability would be acceptable, there is no evidence that this kind of record review really detects all AEs.14 A strong point of our study is, in contrast to most other studies, the fact that reviewers discussed the outcomes of the medical record analyses in a group session. In these other studies, usually pairs of reviewers perform the medical record review. A study by Hofer et al (2000) found that discussion between reviewers didn't improve the overall reliability, with a Kappa of 0.36 before and a Kappa of 0.40 after discussion.35 Interestingly, in our study, in which we discussed cases twice (during the first and second round), we found a substantially higher level of agreement with a Kappa of 0.64. However, the discussion in our study was between the same committee members both times, whereas in the study of Hofer et al, it was between different pairs of reviewers. The results from our subgroup analyses suggest a rather low inter-rater reproducibility concerning the preventability of the AEs, in contrast to a higher intra-rater reproducibility. The same phenomenon is also seen in other studies in which both hospital survivors and deceased patients were included.23,25,26,28-30,36,37 Although our system is different in some crucial parts, the judgement concerning the preventability of AEs is comparable with the results in these studies. Several studies use different classifications for preventability. 3-level classification systems and also a 5- and 6- level classification systems are used in studies.23,28,29,36 This makes comparisons between studies difficult. There is no gold standard concerning potential preventability which leaves us with the consensus of the medical record research commit - tee as second best. Differences in opinion will therefore always exist, this might give rise to an ongoing discussion. Nevertheless, the effort to detect AEs and their preventability is in our opinion useful because any preventable cause that can be abolished is important, therefore adequate feedback, resulting in consecutive change of procedures if necessary, is needed. 5 Chapter 588Our study had some limitations. A few methodological aspects of our study require attenti - on. We blinded our reviewers and used records from several years ago, which we consider as a strong point, although we cannot exclude that they may have been able to recognize cases from their memory. Furthermore, there is the lack of a clear definition (which is also not available in international literature) to determine preventability. We think this is the reason why the reliability of the judgment on preventability is disappointing. Although the committee judgment on preventability became based on more experience over the past years, there are no strict guidelines or rules on how to judge. Previous studies sometimes use Likert scales or percentages which in our opinion creates a false sense of precision, with inconsistent reproducibility.13,20,38-42 Secondly, the sample size of the re-examined cases was rather small, especially in the subgroup analysis. This was reflected in the root cause analysis in which only nine cases remained to be analysed. Therefore, we were una - ble to answer all of our sub questions, especially the one focusing on the reproducibility of the contribution of the AE to the death of the patient. The small number of cases was the result of powering the study to our main question. Moreover, increasing the number of cases to answer our sub-questions with sufficient power would have been very time and hence cost consuming. In conclusion, we showed that the judgment on the presence of an AE by a committee investigating medical records of deceased patients was reproducible. However, their judg - ment on preventability is less so, possibly because there is a lack of clear definitions on this subject. It is difficult to comment on the reliability of contribution to death because all AEs seem somehow to contribute to the death of the patient in both rounds. Despite this, we think giving feedback to professionals based on the review of preventable AEs is manda - tory. Yet, we should focus on finding more reliable methods to identify preventable AEs. The next step should be a clear international accepted definition on preventability which could aid to increase the reproducibility of these methods and thus make them more valuable. Thereafter, respectful communication with the involved professionals in order to improve the quality and safety of care is of utmost importance to increase the chance that care will really become better.

It's increasingly used to compare institutions. Therefore, the external reproducibility should be high. In the current study, we evaluated this external reproducibility for the assessment of an adverse event (AE) in a sample of records from two university medical centres in the Netherlands, using the same review method. Methods: From both hospitals, 40 medical records were randomly chosen from patient files of deceased patients that had been evaluated in the preceding years by the internal review committees. After reviewing by the external committees, we assessed the overall and Kappa agreement by comparing the results of both review rounds (once by the own internal committee and once by the external committee). This was calculated for: the pre - sence of an AE, preventability and contribution to death. Results: Kappa for the presence of AEs was moderate (k=0.47). For preventability, the agreement was fair (k=0.39) and poor for contribution to death (k=0.109). Conclusion: We still believe that medical record review is suitable for the detection of ge - neral issues concerning patient safety. However, based on the outcomes of this study, we would advise to be careful when using medical record review for benchmarking.External reproducibility of medical record review95 Introduction In many countries worldwide, healthcare inspection increasingly demand information on the quality and safety of patient care in hospitals. Several tools have been implemented by hospitals for the monitoring of their patients' safety.1,2 A widely used tool is systematic medical record review (MRR). In the Netherlands, hospitals are obliged to either arran - ge an internal MRR system or take part in a national monitoring program of care related harm (performed every 4 years) executed by the Netherlands Institute for health services research (NIVEL).3-5 Hospitals using an MRR system frequently evaluate a subset of records (for example every tenth admission) to lower the burden of MRR or select cases most likely to contain adverse events (AEs) (for example only patients who died during hospitalization). An additional me - thod to lower the burden of MRR for physicians is to use a trigger system, which is execu - ted by nurses in a previously defined set of records. When one or more triggers are found, the record is evaluated by a review committee. The results of this medical record review should be reliable and valid, because the outcome could lead to changes in care for future patients. Therefore, ideally, results must be both internally and externally reproducible. Internal reproducibility is necessary to obtain support for proposed improvements within a given institution. External reproducibility is necessary to compare results across instituti - ons (benchmarking). However, well-defined criteria guiding the reviewer in how to fulfil a good MRR have not been specified clearly in international literature or guidelines.6-11 In the current study, we focus on the committee judgment and analyse the external repro - ducibility of the committee judgment on a sample of records from two university hospitals in the Netherlands, using the same review method. Moreover, we also evaluate the root cause of potentially preventable AEs and their corres - ponding reproducibility. Methods Selection of records For both hospitals, 40 medical records were extracted from patient files of deceased patients that had been investigated and completed in the preceding 2 years by the internal committees (2014-2016) (hospital 1: 448 out of 717 records, hospital 1: 379 out of 512 records, figure 1A and 1B). The first step of the selection was: records were selected ac - cording to the expertise of the committee members that participated (see section study). Then the sample was randomly chosen from these departments. The selection of the records was executed by DK using the Excel\u00ae random generator. 6 Chapter 696Figure 1A: Selection of records in centre 1 Figure 1B: Selection of records in centre 2 Furthermore, 50% of the records were selected out of the group with suitable records with an AE and the other half out of the group without an AE. Records selected for the committee from hospital one comprise patients originally treated by cardiology, surgery or internal medicine departments. For the committee from hospital two, they were originally treated by internal medicine, surgery, ICU, cardiology or the neurology department. Since we wanted to investigate the external reliability of the review process only, we selected records in which nurses had found triggers when they were evaluated for the first time by the internal committee. Study In 2016 we gathered two times for three consecutive days (in 2016) the selected medical records were evaluated on location by the delegates of the external hospital committee. The committee of centre 1 thus evaluated in this study the records of centre 2 and vice versa. The admission department of the patient determined which specialist would (pre - ferably) investigate a specific record. If this would be, for example, surgery, then a surgeon from the committee would evaluate the record. After these three days, the outcome of the evaluation by the delegates was discussed in a consensus meeting in which at least the three delegates were present. This consensus meeting was performed by the committees separately. During this meeting, a conclusion had to be reached on whether an AE had oc - curred. Furthermore, its potential preventability was assessed and the potential contributi - on of the AE to the death of the patient was determined. There was no time limitation for the review or the discussion in the committee. Each committee was blinded for the results External reproducibility of medical record review97 of the first evaluation of the records by the other committee. The study process is further clarified in figure 2.12 Figure 2: Medical record review procedure Committees For hospital 1, the delegates were: an internist, a surgeon, and a cardiologist; there has been an MRR committee in this centre since 2008. At hospital 2, the delegates were: an internist, cardiothoracic surgeon, and a neurologist; they started with MRR, according to the same format as hospital 1, in 2014. All reviewers took part in the national NIVEL studies and were therefore trained in the same fashion.5 6 Chapter 698During the previous years, both committees used the same review procedure. Previous research showed the results of this internal medical record review to be acceptably relia - ble.12 Training For the participation in the NIVEL studies, the nurses and physicians followed a one-day training in small groups (max 12 participants) led by one member of the research team and one experienced nurse or physician, respectively. During the training, the study protocol, definitions and review forms were explained and examples of (preventable) adverse events were discussed. The reviewers practiced with cases and they were provided with a review manual. After one month of reviewing, the reviewers had a half-day training session to discuss their problems concerning the review process and definitions and to update the reviewers with the latest insights about the review process. These training sessions were frequently repeated during data collection. Statistics and analyses We aimed for a Kappa of 0.6 or more, while we expected a Kappa of 0.75. With a type 1 error of 0.05 and a type 2 error of 0.20, a sample size of 80 cases was found to be suffi - cient.13 To evaluate the output of the external review, we performed the following analyses: over - all agreement and corresponding Kappa agreement with a 95% confidence interval. This was executed for the following variables: the presence of an AE, the presence of a poten - tially preventable AE and the presence of an AE which had contributed to the death of the patient. By using cross tabulation, we calculated the observed overall agreement (accuracy) within the four groups (presence, preventability, contribution to death and root cause) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval. Prevalence-adjusted and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) calculations were done and re - ported along with kappa, to show how data would have been with equal distributions of positive and negative test results. Finally, corresponding prevalence and bias indices were calculated.14 Furthermore, for every medical record separately, we evaluated the AEs that the commit - tees found. We checked if the same AEs were found as during the first evaluation. If more than one AE was found, we checked if at least the same AE compared to the first evalua - tion was present. This was also done for preventability of the AEs and the contribution to death of all AEs. The values of kappa were categorized as follows, the degree of agreement was categorized as poor (< 0), slight (=0.00-0.20), fair (=0.21-0.40), moderate (=0.41-0.60), substantial (=0.61-0.80) or almost perfect (=0.81-1.00).15External reproducibility of medical record review99 Definitions An AE was defined as an unintended outcome caused by the (non-)action of a caregiver and/ or the healthcare system resulting in temporary or permanent disability or death of the patient.16 When an AE had been identified, its potential preventability was assessed (subdivided in the categories not preventable and potentially preventable) and the potential contribution of the AE to the death of the patient was determined (subdivided into: no contribution and potential contribution). Data storage All results were saved using software provided by Medirede\u00ae, Clinical File Search version 3 (Mediround BV, 2015). Data safety The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee (of both participating centres). To guarantee patients' privacy, the medical records were only accessible at the centre itself. The selected records were accessible in the digital environment of the hospital. Furthermore, reviewers signed confidentiality contracts. Results Eighty records in total were reassessed here we present the results after review by the other committee. Outcomes for all records were available. Medical records overall agreement Table 1 shows the evaluation of the cases regarding the presence of an AE. The overall agreement was 74% and the corresponding Kappa 0.48 (95%CI:0.28-0.67). PABAK was 0.48 (95%CI:0.28-0.67). Table 2 shows of the number of AEs that were found by two teams, the evaluation regar - ding the potential preventability of this AE. The overall agreement regarding the preven - tability was therefore 71% and the Kappa agreement 0.39 (95%CI:0.08-0.69). PABAK was 0.41 (95%CI:0.11-0.72) Table 3 shows the evaluation of both teams regarding the contribution of the AE to death of the patient. The overall agreement regarding this contribution of the AE was 65% and the corresponding Kappa agreement was -0.109 (95%CI:-0.24-0.02). PABAK was 0.29 (95%CI:0-0.61). Root cause analysis number of cases with a potentially preventable AE according to both committees, hence labeled with a suspected cause, was 4. The overall agreement on this cause was 71%, with a Kappa of 0.481 (95%:CI 0-1). 6 Chapter 6100Table 1: Evaluation of the committees regarding the presence of an AE AE present (committee 1)AE not present (committee 1) AE present (committee 2) 34 14 48 AE not present (committee 2) 7 25 32 41 39 80 Table 2: Evaluation of the committees regarding the potential preventability of the AEs AE potentially preventable (committee 1)AE not preventable (committee 1) AE potentially preventable (committee 2) 8 3 11 AE not preventable (committee 2) 7 16 23 15 19 34 Table 3: Evaluation of the committees regarding the potential contribution of the AEs to death AE contributed (commit - tee 1)AE no contribution (committee 1) AE contributed (committee 2) 22 2 24 AE no contribution (committee 2) 10 0 10 32 2 34 Discussion This study shows that, although the overall agreement of a judgment seems promising (as shown in table 1) the agreement of the reviewers for the presence of an AE is moderate with a Kappa of 0.47. The agreement for the preventability was fair (K=0.39) and for the contribution of the AEs to death was poor (K=-0.109).17 The calculations of the PABAK show that the prevalence and bias had a negligible effect on the results. Only for the con - tribution of the AE to the death of the patient, an effect of the prevalence was shown. This indicates that the external reproducibility of medical record review isn't optimal and needs improvement.18 The NIVEL studies reported comparable results for the agreement between external revie - wers. Their Kappa agreement ranged between 0.24 and 0.47 for the presence of an AE. For preventability of an AE, the kappa was found to be 0.43. The improvement was explained by more intensified training.3,4 Sharek et al, and Landrigan et al, also show a moderate agreement for the AE presence and its severity between internal review teams and external review teams. However, the performance of these teams was not evaluated in a second hospital with different cases. This makes a comparison with our study difficult.19,20 Finally, Schildmeijer et al, showed a comparable agreement for the presence of an AE between teams using the GTT method.21External reproducibility of medical record review101 Strong points of our study are; the blinding of the two committees for the results of the first review by the other committee. Furthermore, we have chosen two comparable committees from two university hospitals using the same review method, to exclude that the review method itself caused any differences that would be found. Also, this is the first study in which committees of two hospitals review each other's medical records for the evaluation of the external reproducibility. Contrarily to the NIVEL studies, which only compare results of two external committees, we compared the review of an external with an internal committee as is more common in other studies.19,22 Also, we believe that the re - viewers in both committees can be seen as experts, since they evaluate medical records on a regular base (not only for study purposes).23 Furthermore, when we started the study, both teams already performed medical record review for at least three years. The number of records evaluated by these 2 committees per year far exceeded the total number of records in the study by Landrigan et al.23 This study showed that the agreement improved when the reviewers gained more experience, which we don't think could be the case for our reviewers since they were already experienced at the start of our study. Obviously, there are also some points for improvement. In our study, we can't exclude differences in the performance of the two committees alt - hough both of them apply the same review method. Reasons for this could be as follows. First, the clinical background of the reviewers was slightly different. Second, committee 1 gave their final judgment after consulting other committee members who were not invol - ved in scrutinizing the 40 cases from the external review. Whereas committee 2 recorded the final judgment after reaching consensus in their group of three members. Finally, cen - tre 2 has been active for a shorter period and aims to detect all adverse events, whereas centre 1 with a longer experience focuses on the most severe and preventable AEs. The detection rate of AEs in all records (preventable and not preventable) is therefore much higher in centre 2 than in centre 1 (29% vs. 18%). Also, the number of records in which the root cause of the AE was noted was too small to draw conclusions on the agreement (this is also reflected by the large confidence interval). Furthermore, committee 1 consisted partly of recently retired specialists while the other committee consisted of solely active physicians. Centre 1 chose to use the expertise of reti - red specialists since they have more time for the investigation of the records compared to presently active specialists who need to review medical records on top of their usual work. At the same time, in centre 2 the active specialists in the committee get dedicated time for their MRR. Additionally, although the committees were instructed to use their common method for review and final decision we cannot exclude any influence of the fact that the review of the 40 cases in the other hospital was done especially for study purposes. Finally, some of the medical records contained more than 1 AE, which made it easier for the ex - ternal committee to find at least one of these AE; this could have led to an overestimation of the external reproducibility. Most MRR studies call for more research and exploration of possibilities for improving the inter-rater reliability since there is a need for more good quality studies on this topic.9,24-28 However, a recent article by Leistikow endorses other - wise. According to this article, the main reason for the disappointing reproducibility of MRR is because it depends on the values and view of the person who is performing the review.29,30 At the same time, the definitions of an AE and its preventability are changing 6 Chapter 6102over time.31 Moreover, we should not only apply traditional medical research methods for evaluating patient safety, but also involve behavioural- and social sciences. Organisational behaviour research in healthcare, for example, has highlighted the psychological, social, cultural and economic obstacles to a simple implementation of a solution. These sciences can help in understanding the complexity of patient safety.32,33 Combining these approa - ches could provide a better understanding of the complexity of patient safety and help with the design of interventions that are really beneficial for patients.29 In conclusion, we think that medical record review is suitable for the detection of general issues in patient safety and also for the discussion of individual cases. However, the subop - timal reproducibility of MRR reduces its potential for benchmarking. Finally, we think at least a better definition of preventability and also of contribution to death is needed if we want to compare the outcomes between hospitals.

Design: Retrospective medical record review compared with computer algorithm results. Methods: The basic dataset consisted of 2987 medical records of patients who died during their hospitalization. To gain insight into the signal to noise ratio of the various resources, several subsets of our basic dataset were tested (first experiment). In the second experi - ment we tested the scalability. After the best subset was chosen, several NLP algorithms were tested to select the best performing algorithm for the detecting of AEs (third expe - riment). In the last experiment we tested the performance of the computer algorithms to predict potentially preventable AEs. Results: The dataset with the last three letters showed the biggest potential. The scalability experiment showed that more data leads to a better performance of the algorithm. The best performing algorithm in the third test was the algorithm based on support vector machine (SVM), with a positive predictive value of 79%, a negative predictive value of 95% and a specificity of 85%. The results of the preventability experiment showed that the performance of the algorithms was almost equal to the results of the AEs. Discussion and conclusion: In this study, we have shown that the SVM algorithm generates the most accurate results for the selection of cases for further investigation in the search for a (potentially preventable) AE. The sensitivity of the algorithms was around 75%. Ho - wever, the SVM algorithm selected fewer cases to be examined for AEs compared to the original method. Consequently, this would lead to a lower workload for the committee. At the same time, there are a substantial number of cases, with potentially preventable AEs, not detected by machine learning.Textmining of medical records111 Introduction Current methods for retrospective review of medical records require both time- and cost-wise a substantial effort. Although trigger systems aim to decrease the burden, they still select many cases without adverse events (AEs). To optimise the process, sometimes cases are preselected leading to the investigation of a specific subset of cases. Examples are: deceased patients, patients of a particular department or patient with a longer length of stay. Results are therefore not generalizable to all hospital patients. Another issue is the relatively high inter-rater variation and low reproducibility of trigger results and subse - quently AE detection with current methods.1-7 This suggests that these methods generate results that make translation to clinical practice difficult. To increase the efficacy, computer assisted detection of triggers, or even better AEs, in medical records has been developed. The aim is to reduce the labour-intensive manual chart review and to increase the reproducibility.8 Thus far, text mining software is available for the detection of triggers or a limited selection of AEs.9-17 The software has to be taught what triggers or AEs are, preferably with a large database of well characterized cases with their triggers and AEs. Until now, the most optimal dataset with patient details to be inves - tigated is not known. For example, incorporating all information about the patients might influence the signal to noise ratio negatively and thus also the reliability of the results. Therefore, the optimal dataset has to be determined. Thereafter, different natural lan - guage processing (NLP) algorithms can be tested to detect the algorithm with the highest sensitivity and specificity for detecting triggers or AEs. In this study, we wanted to find the most optimal method to select cases for further inves - tigation in search for a (potentially preventable) AE. We describe our stepwise approach for developing a computer algorithm to search reliably for AEs in medical records. First, we used an NLP algorithm with excellent computing power restrictions to identify the optimal dataset selected from the medical record in our database with well characterized cases of deceased patients. Second, we evaluated the influence of the amount of records to be included for finding optimal results concerning agreement (true positives combined with true negatives divided by the total group). Third, several experiments were performed with different NLP algorithms in this optimal dataset to find the algorithm with the best performance for finding AEs and their preventability. Then, the performance of the best computer algorithm was validated in a different part of the data. Methods The usual procedure of the medical record review (our \"gold standard\") Since 2008, a team of trained (according to the EMGO/NIVEL standards)18 nurses scree - ned the medical records of all deceased inpatients (approximately 700 annually) for the presence of triggers (figure 1). To accommodate the process, a database facilitating the necessary steps in this procedure was introduced in 2010 (Medirede\u00ae, Clinical File Search; Mediround BV). We used the triggers originally proposed by the Harvard medical practice study (HMPS) in 199119 with a slight adjustment to fit the group of deceased patients. The - refore, the triggers regarding transfer to another acute care hospital and unplanned inap - 7 Chapter 7112propriate discharge to home were omitted as they have no relevance in deceased patients. The medical records with at least one trigger were redirected to the review committee. This committee consisted of both active and retired medical specialists with considera - ble clinical experience in the field of quality and safety in healthcare and medical record review. After a thorough review by a member specialised in the field of medicine related to the main diagnosis of the case (e.g. a surgeon investigates surgical patients etc.), this case was presented to the other members of the review committee in a regular meeting. A first conclusion on the potential presence of an AE was then established. Subsequently, after consulting the involved specialists, the committee finally decided on the presence of an AE and the potential preventability of this AE. Since 2012 there is a stable formation of the review committee. Previous research showed that the average time nurses needed for the manual screening of triggers was 38 minutes (they had no time restrictions), for the reviewers this was on average 60 minutes (excluding the time needed for the discussion in a meeting). Thus, it takes approximately 1.5 hours for the total review of a single medical record. Textmining of medical records113 Figure 1: Presentation of the regular medical record review procedure Data The basic dataset (originated from our \"gold standard\" procedure) consisted of 2987 medi - cal records of patients who died during their hospitalization. All records between 2011 and 2016 were included. 1763 of these records (59%) contained one or more triggers after the screening by the nurses. In 742 of these medical records (42%) with a trigger, one or more AEs were detected by the review committee. 208 of these AEs were classified as poten - tially preventable. For these records, there was full access to surgical reports, discharge letters, patient records, nursing reports, use of medication, radiology reports, lab results and the medical history. 7 Chapter 7114Definitions An AE was defined as an unintended outcome arising from the (non)-action of a caregiver and/or the health care system with damage to the patient resulting in temporary or per - manent disability or death of the patient.20 The clinical notes were defined as the document which describes the day-to-day report of the patient during admission. The patient file was defined as the document including all reports, letters, lab results, scans, reports and medical history. Modified data From the basic dataset several parts of data were selected. Machine learning is based on NLP . This is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spo - ken. It is a component of artificial intelligence. In machine learning, it is important to make a selection out of data with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Preferably you would like to find the \"signal\" in the data, rather than fitting the noise. The signal was in this case the useful information in the medical record that is pointing towards the adverse event and the noise is the information in the medical record that is not helpful in locating/finding the adverse event. To gain insight into the signal to noise ratio of the various resources, several subsets of our basic dataset were tested (A-F). A: Last general GP letter In this selection, all records without a last general GP letter were excluded. There were 476 medical records without this letter, leaving 2511 (84%) for inclusion in the analysis. We have chosen the last GP letter because we assumed this contained the most useful infor - mation regarding the hospitalization of the patient. B: Last letter In this selection, the last general GP letter was used, but for the 476 cases in which this letter was missing, the last written document was used instead. Therefore, in this analysis, the original 2987 records were included. C: Last three letters In this analysis, the last three letters of all medical records were included. D: Patient record For this selection, the full patient record was used. E: General GP letter combined with patient record In this selection, the general GP letter was combined with the patient record, for every record with a general GP letter. F: Last (general GP) letter combined with the edited patient record. For this dataset, the patient record was electronically edited, leaving only 20% of the rarest words in the patient record. After the editing, the patient record was combined with datas - et B. This was executed by a pre-processing script. First the whole text was evaluated and then the rare words were filtered out. After the editing, the patient record was combined with the last letter (dataset B). Outcome measures The following outcome measures were determined; - Accuracy (agreement): calculated as the sum of true positives and true negatives Textmining of medical records115 divided by the total population. - Positive predictive value (PPV): calculated as the sum of true positives divided by the number of predicted condition positives (in this case AE present) = precision. - Sensitivity (recall): calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of medical records which were identified as containing an AE. - Negative predictive value (NPV): calculated as the number of true negatives divi ded by the number of predicted condition negative (in this case no AE present). - Specificity: calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the total num ber of medical records which were identified as not containing an AE. Computer NLP algorithms We tested different computer algorithms and explored the feasibility of this software (Open Mines Platform supplied by \"the Praktijk Index''). The following NLP algorithms have been used: Naive Bayes (NB) with input Fast-text (FT) 2-layer neural network with hierarchical softmax output - Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on pre-trained word vectors21,22 Experiments As a first step, the 6 datasets (described in section datasets) were provided to the NB algorithm to select the dataset that provided the highest performance in predicting an AE. This selected dataset was then used for the next experiments. To correct for the variation of the initialization, this experiment was repeated 28 times. Due to time and computing power restrictions, we chose to test the fast NB algorithm for all selections. In the second experiment (scalability) was tested whether the performance would decrease if a smaller training set was available. In the second experiment, we attempted to predict the preven - tability of an AE. AEs were therefore categorized as ''probably not preventable'' or ''poten - tially preventable''. In the third experiment all four algorithms were trained, optimised and tested for AE pre - diction with use of the best-fitted dataset, which resulted from the first experiment (see box 1). Box 1: Explanation of training, test and optimisation of the algorithm 1. Training set: this dataset consisted of examples used for the NLP to learn. In this case the NLP was taught which cases contained an AE and which didn't. learning, that is to fit the parameters (e.g., weights) of, for example, a classifier.[7][8] 2. Validation set: a set of examples used to tune the parameters of a classifier. It is sometimes also called the development set or the \"dev set\". 3. Test set : A test dataset is a dataset that is independent of the training dataset, but that fol lows the same probability distribution as the training dataset. A test set is therefore a set of examples used only to assess the performance (i.e. generalization) of a fully specified classi fier.[7][8] 60% of the data was used for training, 20% for validation and 20% for testing. 7 Chapter 7116Privacy To guarantee patients' privacy, information such as names, addresses, and other personal information were deleted from the data. After the anonymization, the data was checked by the privacy officer and researcher DK. Results Experiment 1: Dataset selection In table 1 the results are presented for the individual datasets. The positive predictive value and the sensitivity varied widely for the different datasets. The accuracy was for all datasets around 75% and the specificity was close to 100% for every dataset. Dataset C, which contained the last three letters, showed the biggest potential and was therefore used in the next experiment to test the performance of the different algorithms. Table 1: Performance of the six datasets Dataset Accuracy Precision (PPV) Sensitivity (recall) Specificity A 74.9 66.8 75.1 98.8 B 75.3 72.1 75.2 67.6 74.9 99.0 Experiment 2: Scalability Figure 2 below shows the influence of the amount of data plotted against the accuracy. This is shown for the NB algorithm. In this figure can be seen that more data leads to a better performance of the algorithm. Figure 2: Influence of the amount of data against the accuracy of the algorithm The size of the dataset is plotted against the accuracy of the NB algorithm. The resulting line is flatte - ned and shown with corresponding trend line.Textmining of medical records117 Experiment 3: Algorithm performances with dataset C For accuracy, sensitivity and specificity the results were close together for the four algorit - hms (shown in table 2). The best performing algorithm was the SVM algorithm, with a PPV of 75.8%, an accuracy of 82.3% and a specificity of 94.9%. Figure 3 shows the precision presented against the recall/sensitivity for the SVM algorithm. This shows if we would create a set with 82% precision, this would result in a recall/sensitivity of 40% (percentage AEs with respect to all AEs). In figure 4, the ROC curve of the SVM algorithm is presented. Table 2 shows the performance of the four algorithms separately. These results are based on 12 repetitions of the experiment, with the same settings for the algorithm but with a different distributi - on for the training set and the test set. Figure 3: SVM algorithm with corresponding precision and accuracy Figure 4: ROC curve of the SVM algorithm 7 Chapter 7118Table 2: Performance for every algorithm separately for dataset C 0.99 0.15 Experiment 4: Preventability Table 3: Performance for the four algorithms separately for dataset C Algorithm Accuracy PPV The results of this experiment show that the performance of the algorithms for the pre - ventability is almost equal to the results of the AEs. However, it must be considered that these results are based on a small dataset. This experiment was repeated five times. Discussion and conclusion In this study, we have shown that the SVM algorithm generates the most accurate results for the selection of cases for further investigation in the search for a (potentially preven - table) AE. The sensitivity of the algorithms was around 75%. However, the SVM algorithm selected about 50% fewer cases to be examined for AEs compared to the original method. Consequently, this would lead to a lower workload for the committee.7 At the same time, there are a substantial number of cases, with potentially preventable AEs, not detected by machine learning. If we look at the best accuracy, then the SVM algorithm performs best. However, for precision, also the CNN algorithm performs well. The CNN and the SVM algo - rithm used the letters and the patient record. By using more structured information, which is already generated by hospitals, such as age and length of stay, the algorithms could be improved. Another option is using more data. The number of examples of which an algorit - hm will learn has an influence on the performance of the algorithm. Because of an unfavorable signal to noise ratio in the total record the performance of the algorithms is dependent on the selected dataset. When different dataset selections are compared, it was indeed shown that the use of the unedited total patient record doesn't improve the output and can even have a negative effect on the results. Different datasets show different results for sensitivity and specificity. This is probably caused by the length of a patient record in itself and especially by long sentences. The use of discharge letters, in particular, the letters for the GP , appeared to be useful be - cause of a more favorable signal to noise ratio. These letters contain brief information re - garding the hospitalization of the patient in contrast to the extensive patient record which contains a lot of \"noise\". The scalability experiment shows that the size of the dataset has Textmining of medical records119 an effect on the precision of detecting AEs. Finally, the results of the preventability experiment showed that the preventability can be adequately estimated despite scarce records in the training set. Until now, the literature concerning the automatic detection of AEs focused on a short list of pre-specified AEs or only the triggers for which the data were searched. 9,11,14,16,17 Forster et al 23 and Murff et al (2003) screened discharge letters in two small patient samples for the presence of terms that could indicate an AE but the actual evaluation was performed by physician reviewers.23,24 Murff showed a sensitivity of 69%, a specificity of 48% and a PPV of 52%. For Forster, the results were a sensitivity of 23%, specificity of 92%, PPV of 41% and NPV of 83%. In general, our results suggest a more optimal performance compa - red to these studies. The strengths of our study were the careful step by step analysis with NLP to find the best algorithm that improved the PPV for a potentially preventable AE compared with the cur - rent trigger system. Several, currently common NLP algorithms were tested. Experiments were repeated until saturation was reached. Also, we tested different datasets to find the most useful one with the most valuable information. Still, some questions remain because of some weaknesses in our study. First, it is not clear what an optimal cut off point for sensitivity or specificity could be. This has to be determined by further research to see if the data generated with this study make policy - makers draw the same conclusions as with conventional methods (in this study our \"gold standard\"). Second, the number of well-characterized records can be considered as rather small for NLP programs to be optimised, especially when we take the potential preventa - bility into account. Finally, this was a selection of deceased patients and it might be even more interesting to use this method in patients that were alive at discharge from the hos - pital. Therefore, we think these data are not generalizable to living patients. We think if the algorithms' performance is considered acceptable it should be tested prospectively and compared to the conventional methods. Considering that the conven - tional method is our \"gold standard\" the agreement will never be 100%. However, this is not an issue if the conclusions that can be drawn from the final results are comparable to the original ones. Still, we think the committee work cannot be fully replaced because the communication with the involved departments is crucial in the success of this quality and safety instrument. In conclusion, the result of NLP algorithms to predict potentially preventable AEs in spe - cific datasets from patient records is a promising tool to simplify record review. Further research is necessary, to investigate if the results of this method lead to the same overall conclusions from medical record review compared to the more expensive and labor-inten - sive conventional methods. 7 Chapter 7120References 1.

Thereafter, we tried to optimise this PPV by adding characteristics (urgent admission, admission specialism) to the equation. However, this resulted only in a slightly better performance and the trigger method remained labour-intensive. Further research to optimise this system concerning the combination of triggers with patient cha - racteristics and lab values seemed warranted. Additionally, literature showed that Interna - tional Normalized Ratio (INR)2, albumin-3, creatinine-4 and haemoglobin (Hb) levels5 could be indicators for adverse events (AEs). Based on this information we decided to analyse our data with these variables. Instead of INR we included the use of anticoagulants and the number of different anticoagulants. For this report, we extended the dataset to include a total of 4438 medical records of deceased patients (2011-2018). We created six algorithms using logistic regression with backward stepwise elimination to evaluate which variables contributed significantly to the prediction of the presence of AEs. Lab values were entered in the algorithm once as being measured yes or no, and once categorized as unmeasured, measured but normal, measu - red and abnormal using cut-off values used in the laboratory of our centre. Table 1 shows the area under the curve (AUC) for these algorithms and sensitivity and specificity for a cut-off point chosen to optimise the algorithm's sensitivity. The AUC for the best predictive algorithm (algorithm 2) showed a value of 0.66 (with a p-value of <0.001). Adding lab results to the equation did not improve this and even the use of anticoagulants had no influence on the prediction. Therefore, we think adding lab results or use of anti - coagulants to the equation does not improve the selection of cases with an AE.

General discussionGeneral discussion128Discussion The general aim of this thesis was to evaluate the performance of medical record review (MRR) as an instrument to measure and improve patient safety in clinical care. This me - thod consisted of the Harvard Medical Practice Study (HMPS) trigger tool, although slightly adapted and only applied to patients who died during their stay in our hospital.1 We calculated the predictive value of the triggers (chapter 3) and the reproducibility of the triggers (chapter 4). Furthermore, we assessed the inter- and intrarater reproducibility for the decision on the presence of an adverse event (AE), the potential preventability and the contribution to death of a patient (chapter 5). After that, we assessed the external repro - ducibility of MRR regarding this second stage (chapter 6). Additionally, we investigated if an automatic trigger tool could be helpful in the selection of cases with a (potentially preventable) AE (chapter 7). Finally, we evaluated the potential improvement of the trigger system by adding lab values (chapter 8). In this chapter, we will provide an overview of our main findings also in relation to existing literature. Moreover, we will touch upon methodological considerations of our studies and future recommendations. Main findings Although MRR is performed on a large scale (both for study purposes as well as in daily practice) in health care institutions throughout the world, we concluded from this thesis that this method needs some improvement to make it more (cost)effective. Hereafter we will first summarize the highlights of this thesis and then discuss them. Review In our review of the literature we found that MRR is a reasonably well studied method for the evaluation of medical records for AEs.2-15 Still, looking at the WHO quality criteria for screening instruments, much research concerning the separate quality requirements is still lacking or the methodology is questionable. Especially research concerning the cost of detecting AEs, valuable information is missing regarding the cost of the method itself.16 Moreover, knowledge on how MRR changes quality and safety for patients has hardly been investigated and, to our opinion, should be evaluated. Triggers We demonstrated that the current trigger system has a positive predictive value (PPV) of 47%, which results in a selection of medical records without an AE in more than 50% of the cases.17 However, these results are slightly better compared to other studies, with an aver - age PPV of 33% for the HMPS triggers.2-5,9,12,14,18-20 Unfortunately, a comparison of the PPV of the individual triggers isn't possible since these have not been reported on an individual level in previous studies. Although this trigger system seems to perform better in our subset of patients we still think the PPV is disappointingly low. However, as we concluded from this study, in our opinion not all triggers are equally reliable for selecting records with a potential AE. This General discussion129 was shown by a (on average) moderate kappa for the individual triggers (with a range bet - ween 0 and 0.78).21 Nonetheless, our results for the observed agreement of the individual triggers was higher than in other studies. Unbeck et al (2014) reported a reproducibility of 46% compared to a 67% reproducibility in our study. In addition, the total agreement for any trigger present was 65% in their study, compared to 90% in our study.22 Again, no com - parison was possible for the individual triggers in the studies presented in the literature. Our results therefore seem slightly better. However, this might be due to the fact that we only use records of deceased patients which generally contain the most serious events and perhaps therefore most easy detectable triggers.23 Moreover, our trained nurses are very experienced in searching for triggers in medical records because several years of screening and training preceded this study. Improvement of the predictive value of the trigger system After the evaluation of the predictive value of the trigger system we also attempted to improve this. As a first step we added patient characteristics to the trigger system. This resulted in a lower number of records which were selected for review than in the original review (PPV is 50% compared to 47% previously). As a second step, we added laboratory results to the trigger system to further improve this PPV. The PPV was now 54% in the algorithm with the best area under the curve. Which is unfortunately still a disappointing figure but also gives a distorted image since also a large percentage of AEs is missed. Ideally, the trigger system would have a PPV of nearly 100%. This would minimize the re - view of medical records without AEs and also lower the cost of the whole process. Howe - ver, this would probably mean that AEs would be missed in records that are not selected by the system. A weakness of this current study is that we were not aware of potential AEs in records that were previously not selected for extensive review due to the lack of a trigger.17 AE We were convinced that using internal reviewers combined with a group discussion for the determination of an AE and the use of a 3 level scale for the determination of preventabi - lity, would lead to a higher internal reliability compared to other studies in which external reviewers or a pair of reviewers were used.4,24-30 Our study showed a substantial agreement for the presence of an AE. However, for the potential preventability the kappa had only a fair agreement. When we calculated the intrarater and interrater agreement concern - ing potential preventability, the kappa showed that, mainly for interrater agreement, the reproducibility was low.31 The result of our external reproducibility study showed a moderate kappa for the presence of an AE. For preventability of an AE the agreement was fair and it was poor for contributi - on of an AE to death.32 We believe that this could be caused by lack of a clear definition for preventability.33 Preventability is a difficult concept. Although there is usually consensus about the ex - tremes, there is a large grey area. To improve this agreement on preventability, we are convinced there is need for a more uniform definition. Although a six-point scale, like some other studies use, seems to show a higher reproducibility with a moderate kappa, we think GD General discussion130this is still not a satisfying result.34 Moreover, a multilevel scale suggests precision that seems disputable because of the moderate reproducibility.12 MRR seems not useful for the evaluation of individual cases, as is shown by the disappoin - ting results of the reproducibility. However, we still believe that MRR is suitable to detect trends in AEs. This might then give rise to management decisions aimed to diminish the occurrence of certain types of AEs. For example, the assignment of a thrombosis vigilance officer to lower the occurrence of improper use of anticoagulants in patients and hence AEs concerning bleeding or thrombosis. Text mining Text mining was developed as an instrument to quickly scan plain text with great accuracy. In our study where we explored the possibilities of automatic screening of medical records for triggers and AEs, we have shown that it is possible to select cases with a high probabili - ty of having an AE. A disadvantage of this method is that, when including more text docu - ments of a single medical record, the results became less precise. To address this problem, we selected specific documents from the database (such as the last letter to the general practitioner) that led to results with more precision. Compared to the selection of cases by trained nurses applying triggers, only a small part of the medical records were selected by the computer. This could mean that AEs are missed in records that are not selected for review by the text mining software. However, this does not have to be a problem if the general conclusion from the small amount of selected cases and their AEs, after thorough review, show the same trend in AEs and possible preventable causes. The final conclusi - ons in the annual report from the committee should then also be the same. However, this wasn't investigated in this study and should be further explored in future studies. Still, the screening possibilities for huge amounts of data by text mining tools are much greater than the screening possibilities for humans. Here, we selected cases of deceased patients only, but it could easily be used to scan medical records of all patients (in less time). The program is also likely to improve because it is self-learning. The more data is used, the better the prediction algorithm will become like in other artificial intelligence setups with big data. Concerning big data, our data volume is much too small to expect the program to improve the results revolutionary. Another disadvantage of this study was that we compared the results of the automatic de - tection with the ''gold standard''. Our Gold Standard is the normal procedure with trained nurses. This means that the automatic selection could never show better results than the current manual evaluation of the medical records. General discussion131 Methodological considerations MRR is often subject of debate whether it is the best method for the evaluation of patient safety. The main arguments for this are listed below: General Marking your own paper An often-heard argument against MRR by an internal review committee is that it is seen as ''marking your own paper''. But from experience with MRR in our centre, we can conclude that if you would let an external committee evaluate the medical records, they don't have the insights in the local health care process that an internal committee has. A view that is shared by others.24 On the other hand, if one encourages specialists (of the involved department), instead of a separate committee, to evaluate their own medical records, chances are that almost no AEs are found. Therefore, we believe that it is best when me - dical records are evaluated by an internal committee in which representatives of several departments are present.24 Hindsight bias Hindsight bias, also known as the knew-it-all-along phenomenon refers to the common tendency for people to perceive events that have already occurred as having been more predictable than they actually were before the events took place. It also plays a role in retrospective MRR, where the reviewers already know the outcome. In this view, it is difficult to judge decisions made with the available information at the time of the decision without knowing what is really going to happen. It is difficult for reviewers, policymakers and families to acknowledge that a correct decision was made that turned out to be false as time progressed. It is therefore easy to classify a decision as false, but one has to look at the dilemma with only the available information at the time of the dilemma. Questions regarding medical decisions when reviewing files of deceased patients are difficult to rise without prejudice induced by hindsight. They should be inquiring about why certain decisi - ons were made and why other options were not pursued or considered. If sufficient effort was deployed to retrieve the necessary information and the reasoning with the available information was correct, there is no AE. Regardless of the fact that in the end (with more information in or after time progressed) this turned out to be wrong.35-40 Retrospective Another disadvantage of a retrospective method is that it can be only reactive. Which me - ans that AEs are evaluated after they occurred. In fact, you are always ''running behind''. An advantage of a prospective measuring method would be, that one would be able to prevent AEs.41 However, this would necessitate information about predictors of an AE in individual patients which, to our knowledge, are not available yet. Moreover, it will be difficult to find predictors that are uniformly applicable to hospitals. It will probably be necessary for every hospital to develop these predictors specific for patients in their own hospital. This also will necessitate the analysis of big data to make them as precise as pos - sible. Moreover, one should then still investigate if an intervention in the identified patient would indeed result in the prevention of an AE. GD General discussion132Specific for our studies Sample size Due to time and cost restrictions, the sample sizes of our internal and external reproduci - bility studies were small. Still, we based our sample size for the reproducibility of the AEs on the study of Walter et al.42 For the sample size calculation of the internal reproducibility we estimated that a sample size of 50 records would provide sufficient power to exclude a kappa of as low as 0.6 given an expected kappa of 0.8. For the external reproducibility a sample size of 80 records would provide sufficient statistical power to exclude a kappa of as low as 0.6 given an ex - pected kappa of 0.75. However, the results from both these studies indicated that the true Kappa is much lower than anticipated. Hence, we were not able to reject the null-hypothe - sis that Kappa is not significantly different from 0.6. Triggers In the study where we evaluated the reproducibility of the triggers, more triggers were found the second time that the medical records were evaluated. We suspect that extra attention among the nurses due to the fact that the second round of review was part of a study might have contributed to this. Also, we found AEs in cases without triggers. Howe - ver, the percentage of AEs in cases without triggers was much lower (7%) than in the cases with a trigger (47%).21 External reproducibility For the external reproducibility study, the two committees were not entirely compara - ble. There was a difference in experience and also a difference in the composition of the committee. Additionally, although the committees were instructed to use their common method for review and final decision we cannot exclude any influence of the fact that the review of the 40 cases in the other hospital was done especially for study purposes. Finally, a substantial number of the medical records contained more than 1 AE, which made it easier for the external committee to find at least one of these AEs; this could have led to an overestimation of the external reproducibility. Patient selection We chose to evaluate the medical records of patients who died during their stay. In our opinion, the most severe cases of AEs can be found in patients that eventually die. Moreover, in deceased patients twice as much preventable AEs can be found. Therefore, investigation of records in this population appears to be more efficient for identifying pre - ventable AEs than reviewing records of patients who were discharged alive.23 General discussion133 Generalizability The results of our external reproducibility study showed that the lack of a clear definiti - on on preventability is a major problem. We believe that this problem is generalizable to other large hospitals in the Netherlands. This makes comparison of preventability results of such committees between hospitals, a challenge if not impossible. A single external committee might prevent this to a certain level. However, as explained previously, we think that external committees are less valuable in helping to improve local procedures. Besides that, the use of a better definition concerning preventability might also improve the internal reproducibility in other hospitals. Although discussion between experts gene - rates a general conclusion, the lack of a clear definition can lead to a different conclusion when the same case is discussed again on a different moment amongst the same experts. Furthermore, our results concerning text mining are only representative for our hospi - tal. Although one could think this is generalizable to others, we think that this should be proven by repeating these investigations in other hospitals (external validation). GD General discussion134Future recommendations This thesis has shown that, to our opinion, MRR needs some improvement. They are listed below. Definitions First, it is important that the definitions used in MRR are better specified. In particular the definition of the preventability of an AE. Several severity scales are used in the literature for preventability. For the outcome, some consist of only two options (yes/no) but there are also systems that make you choose for a graded scale outcome between 4, 5 or even 6 options.4,24,27,43-46 It isn't known if the outcomes are related to the conditions. The latter suggests achieving precision in the assessment of preventability is possible. However, the - re is to our knowledge no sound research proving this precision to be reproducible.12,34,47 We are convinced that there is a need for a clear definition that can be widely used and accepted. This could be done on a national level in the Netherlands, although it would be even better to have an international standardisation. In that case, hospitals in different countries could also compare their outcomes. A Delphi round amongst experts seems the best solution to define these criteria for preventability in the future. In the end, the classification of an AE is now highly dependent on the skills, experience and beliefs of the medical record investigator. Yield Second, the percentage of records that is triggered is relatively high with eventually a low yield of AEs.17 Hence, it would be beneficial if we could devise a system in which the actual percentage of records that contain a preventable AE after evaluation is higher. This could be achieved by optimizing our selection instruments or the selection of the popula - tion in which we look for AEs. A promising future option is the deployment of computer algorithms designed after big data analysis.48-53 A computer is able to screen an enormous number of variables and measure their influence on adverse outcomes. Hence, it might even be possible to predict a chance for a patient to suffer from an AE in the near future. This would enable us to design and test preventive strategies. Until now, the reviewer's decision is considered the \"gold standard\". But is this the best we can get? Because there are so many variables it might be impossible for humans to balance them repeatedly in the same manner. Therefore, computer algorithms might be better equipped to manage big data. Still, the acceptance of computer output that can only be explained with difficulty will probably be very low. Computer results always have to be translated to workable plans that can be grasped by people on the work floor. Hence, the reasons for this classification by a computer should always be as clear as possible. Costs Third, an evaluation of the costs of MRR versus the effect on the daily practice of the he - althcare workers and thereafter the results on AEs should be carefully evaluated. However, there are to our knowledge no well validated instruments that measure the complete cycle (detection, interpretation, feedback, change in care, outcome). We are of opinion that such programs or instruments should be thoroughly evaluated for their exact costs and General discussion135 benefits. We then could incorporate them in daily practice but only if the costs of such a screening program are acceptable in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY).54-56 This might be complicated because although some improvements in safety seem obvious, changes in daily practice could cause \"collateral\" damage. For example, double check of intravenously administered medication by nurses seems a good idea.57 But the time spent on the double check cannot be spent on other tasks. Which choices will then be made and will this lead to possible other unexpected AEs for patients.58,59 Moreover, we should realise that improving the quality and safety of an already high-quality system means an exponential increase in costs.60 That obligates us to perform thorough research on this matter and finally incorporate the most optimal strategies in our health care.61 Improvement of care This thesis investigated the current MRR process in our centre and possibilities for impro - vement. It would also be of interest to expand the research and evaluate if and how this process affects the improvement of care. The whole process could then be evaluated. This is also shown in the overview figure 1 in the introduction. Conclusion In short, medical record review can be used to evaluate the trend of adverse events in a hospital. Due to its low reproducibility it is less useful for the evaluation of individual cases. To improve the reproducibility of preventability, it is advisable to define a uniform definiti - on for preventability. Also, an evaluation of the costs versus the effect is necessary.

For this research we highlighted different aspects of medical record review and we subdivided this process in its various sub processes. In the introduction (chapter 1) we describe how quality and safety is evaluated in hos - pitals. Furthermore, we explain the method of medical record review, which is used in Maastricht UMC+. Also, we describe the outline of this thesis (figure 1). Figure 1: Overview of our studies regarding the process of improving quality and safety by medical record review Summary143 Part I In part I we evaluated what has been investigated in the domain of quality and safety in health care. The review article describes the literature specifically for two trigger tools which can be deployed for medical record review (chapter 2). For this review we evaluated the literature based on the 7 steps which have been compo - sed by the WHO for the evaluation of methods. 50 studies met the inclusion criteria and we discussed the results stepwise. We found that with medical record review, more AEs are detected than with any other method. But at the same time, other AEs are found. Each method detects some AEs that are not detected with other methods. The average costs of an AE were \u20ac4296. Considerable efforts have been made worldwide in the healthcare systems to improve sa - fety and to reduce errors in the treatment of patients. These efforts have resulted in some positive effects. The literature also showed that medical record review focused on several domains of quality of care such as safety and effectiveness and seems suitable for both small as large cohorts. Furthermore, we found a moderate agreement for the presence of a trigger and a good agreement for the presence of an AE for the GTT across studies. For the HMPS we found a substantial agreement for the presence of a trigger and a moderate agreement for the presence of an AE. Medical record review, regardless of the trigger tool used, is a reasonably well researched method for the evaluation of the medical records for AEs. However, looking at the WHO criteria, much research is still lacking or of moderate quality. Especially for the cost of AEs, valuable information is missing regarding the costs of their detection. Moreover, knowled - ge of how MRR changes quality and safety of care should be evaluated. Part II In chapter 3 we investigated the performance of the triggers regarding the prediction of the presence of a (potentially preventable) AE. Furthermore, we evaluated the possibility to increase this predictive value. Our study showed that the total predictive value was 47%. If more triggers were present in a case, this would increase the chance of detecting an AE. By adaptation of the trigger system (for example: adding length of stay, age, gender and admission from another hospital) it seemed possible to increase the predictive value consi - derably. But, we should keep in mind that a part of the AE could be missed (depending on the chosen cut-off value). SSummary144In chapter 4 we evaluated the reproducibility of the 15 individual triggers. For this study, the nurses evaluated 100 medical records for a second time. The observed agreement for the presence of a trigger was 75% with a moderate kappa. We found that certain triggers such as unplanned transfer to the ICU and unplanned readmission to the operating room had a higher reproducibility than others such as dissatisfaction with care and adverse drug event. For the individual triggers the agreement was 90% and the corresponding kappa moderate. In chapter 5 we investigated the internal reproducibility of the committee outcome. The - refore, the committee evaluated their previously processed medical records for a second time. This was done for presence of an AE, the potential preventability and the contributi - on to death. Also, we again evaluated the root cause of the AEs. Kappa for the presence of an AE had a substantial agreement and a fair agreement for the (potential) preventability. The intrarater agreement showed a substantial agreement for the presence of an AE and for a (potential) preventable AE. The interrater agreement showed a substantial agreement for the AE presence and a slight agreement for a (potential) preventable AE. We concluded that an international consensus on a definition for preventability is needed. This would results in a better comparison between studies. In chapter 6 we evaluated the external reproducibility of the committee outcome. There - fore, a second committee reviewed previously reviewed medical record, and vice versa. The two committees functioned as each other's external committee. From both hospitals we selected 40 medical records, which had been checked by the internal committee in the previous years. After the second evaluation round we calculated the total agreement and the kappa agreement. We did this for the presence of an AE, the potential preventability and the contribution to death. Kappa for the presence of AEs was moderate. The kappa for preventability was weak and poor for the contribution to death. Although both committees applied the same methods for medical record review, there is a difference in results, possibly because the committees differ in their experience with MRR (3 vs. 8 years) and have different medical backgrounds. However, we think that medical re - cord is suitable for the detection of general issues regarding patient safety and also for the discussion of individual cases. However, the suboptimal reproducibility of MRR reduces its potential for benchmarking. Finally, we think at least a better definition of preventability and also of contribution to death is needed if we want to compare the outcomes between hospitals. Part III In chapter 7 we investigated the usefulness of an automatic trigger tool for the screening of medical records for triggers and AEs. For this study we compared the results of medical records which had been evaluated by the committee in the previous years (2011-2016) with the outcome of different computer algorithms. We defined various datasets as derived from the electronic patient record as input, to check which dataset would perform best. After this we investigated the scalability. In the third experiment we tested four different natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to Summary145 find the algorithm which performed best in the detection of AEs. In the last experiment we investigated if it would be possible to use NLP in the search for preventable AEs. The sub - set which contained the last three letters of the medical records had the biggest potential and was therefore used for the next experiments. The scalability experiment showed that more data leads to a better performance of the computer algorithm. From the third expe - riment we concluded that support vector machine (SVM) leads to the best results with a positive predictive value of 79% with a negative predictive value of 95% and a specificity of 85%. The results of the last experiment were comparable with this. The SVM algorithm selected fewer cases with a (potential) AE. This would lead to a lower workload of the committee. But at the same time a considerably amount of the AE wouldn't be detected with this new method. Chapter 8 describes the (potential) improvement of the predictive value of the current trigger tool, by adding laboratory results and other patient characteristics. This study ela - borates on the research described in chapter three. In the analyses we added the following variables: albumin, creatinine, haemoglobin, glucose, use of anticoagulants and number of anticoagulants. Our total dataset contained 4438 medical records of deceased patients (2011-2018). We created six algorithms based on backward logistic regression, to evaluate which combination of variables had the best predictive values. The area under the curve for the best predictive algorithm showed a value of 0.73 (with a p-value of <0.001), which means that a patient with an AE will have a more abnormal test result than 70% of the patients without an AE. Although in this algorithm only 3 variables (age, gender and length of stay) are included, further inclusion of more variables didn't fu - rther improve the predictive value. Based on these results it seems that adding laboratory results doesn't improve the PPV of the trigger system considerably.

However, we think the results should mainly be used by hospital quality officers who have to implement preventive strategies for improvement in quality and safety control. More - over, it stresses the necessity to investigate other instruments for their effectiveness. Social relevance Nobody wants to be a victim of unintended medical harm. To prevent this, it is necessary to identify risky situations. The methods we use to identify these situations should be precise and valid because otherwise we might change clinical practice in a way that won't solve the problem. Preventing unintended harm to patients is the key role of these instru - ments and methods to detect adverse events (AEs) in health care. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that these methods are of good quality. In this thesis we aimed to improve our knowledge about the precision and performance of a commonly used method for detec - ting AEs. This knowledge enables us to increase the accuracy of the method and therefore optimise the chance for better choices in improving health care safety. Better instruments with well-known characteristics are expected to result in more benefits to society. First by less harm inflicted by health care and second by lower costs. Economic relevance In the Netherlands, 10% of patients who die during their stay in hospital experience an AE according to the medical record review (MRR) method.1 According to Hoogervorst-Schilp et al (2015), the costs of AEs in the Netherlands are around \u20ac300 million each year.2 A sub - stantial number of these AEs was considered preventable and these costs could therefore be reduced. These extra costs are caused by the impact on the patient itself and its family, and also by additional - and costly- care. Moreover, there are substantial extra costs for the patient, insurance companies and also for the economy since every extra day a patient stays in the hospital leads to inevitable 'costs' through lost income, payments by insurers etc. Therefo - re, it is necessary to use a test with optimal test characteristics to detect these AEs and use the results to prevent them in the future. Moreover, scarce research has been performed regarding the balance between the costs of these methods themselves and the savings from safer healthcare they are eventually meant realise. Therefore, we think that spen - ding a substantial part of our healthcare budget on tests and instruments that give blurry answers does not seem like a good idea.Valorisation155 Relevance for patients Improving the measurements of healthcare quality and patient safety gives us more relia - ble and precise information about the delivered care. It then enables us probably to target our efforts in making care safer with better quality. Ideally this would subsequently result in less AEs and less extra days in the hospital and is therefore of importance for patients. At the moment, medical record review is suitable for evaluating the trends of AEs. It is less suitable for individual cases, which has been shown in this thesis by its low reproducibility. Relevance of measurements By studying the properties of this commonly used method we learn more about the preci - sion with which it tells us about medical situations that carry substantial risks for adverse events. If this information is reliable, we can advise professionals and policy makers to think about reducing risks in these situations. The better the quality of the measurements the better the advice and, in our opinion, the greater the chance that changes will really improve quality and safety. In this thesis we did not yet measure the specific results of MRR on changes in policy or care and finally the effect on the occurrence of AEs. Medical record review with the use of triggers (as shown in this thesis) gives valuable information on the potential presence of an AE, its potential preventability and the contribution to death. Discussing the committees' findings with the involved health care providers might urge them to adapt protocols and workflow in order to improve quality and safety of the delivered care. Also, the right instrument is needed to measure the change in AEs. While there are other methods available for measuring patient safety and quality, medical record review is seen as the gold standard. Relevance for health care providers Based on the results in this study, we advise health care providers to evaluate detection and measuring tools before they implement them. If a decent instrument is used, this will not only give the best results but also will be cost- and timesaving compared to the use of an instrument which is not optimal. Also, the use of a method which has been shown to be a valid method is more justified than a method which hasn't been evaluated. Innovation Besides the evaluation of the current method, we have evaluated new options to improve of the detection tool for AEs. We added readily available variables to the trigger tool me - thod and deleted less discriminative ones. We also explored the possibilities for artificial intelligence to help us with searching for AEs. This might make the detection process more efficient in the future. V Valorisation156Future perspectives First and most important future perspective is an evaluation of the costs of MRR versus the effect on daily practice of health caretakers and thereafter the results on AEs should be done. However, this is a real challenge because care is developing quickly and it will be difficult to tell which improvements are the result of MRR indirectly or were realised by general improvements in care. Second, harmonisation in the definitions used in MRR is better specified. In particular the term preventability. Third, the percentage of records that are selected for the possible presence of an AE, with an actual AE after evaluation should be higher to make the time and costs consuming part of manually scrutinizing records more efficient. Fourth, the investigation on automatic selection of MRR and AEs has only been briefly researched by us. More research is warranted because this might make it possible to inves - tigate all records and not just a selection. Fifth, the next step in the evaluation of the quality of MRR is the measurement of the effect of outcomes of the committee on the daily practice in the hospital. So, do the health caretakers adapt their way of working after the findings of the MRR and also does this adaptation results in less (preventable) AEs? Finally, the evaluation of the MRR is a first analysis of one of the instruments that are used in the hospital but this evaluation can also be used for other instruments. Such as the cen - tral incident committee, complaint committee, complaint service point, quality parameters registries. Valorisation157 References 1.
