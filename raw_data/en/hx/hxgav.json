The center is located in the Southern High Pl ains and is centrally located in the largest crop area in New Mexico. The center is comprised of 156 acres of land, which has an approximate 0.8% slope to the southeast. The center is located at 34.60o N, -103.22o W, at an elevation of 4,435 feet above sea level. The Olton clay loam soil at the center is representative of a vast area of the High Plains of New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle. Research at the center began in 1948, originally as dryland field research. Irrigation studies were initiated in 1960, when an irrigation well was developed. Water for irrigation is derived from the Ogallala Aquifer. Since 2005, the center has improved its irrigation delivery by developing two center pivot irrigation systems and subsurface and surface drip irrigation syst ems.

Materials and Methods The irrigated winter wheat trial was planted October 23, 2017 into a conventionally tilled flat bed plots for center pivot irrigation. Soil ty pe is an Olton clay loam and elevation is 4,435 feet. Individual plots consisted of 11 rows, 6.25 inches apart, 30 feet long. There were three replications for each entry, planted in a randomized complete block design. Individual plots were planted at a rate of 70 lb/ac irrigated and 30 lb/ac dryland. Plots were planted with a Great Plains solid stand plot drill (3600). The irrigated planting area was fertilized with a pre -plant mixture of 150, and 30 lb/ac of nitrogen, and P 205 respectively and 40 lb/ac of Sulphur. Fertilizers were incorporated into soil immediately after application. Additional nitrogen was applied on February 20, 2018 at a rate of 64 lb/ac. Affinity, Lo -Vol6 (2,4 -D), and Prowl H20 herbicides were applied at a rate of 0.6 oz/ac and 12 oz/ac, and 3 pt/ac respectively on February 5, 2018. Lorsban 4E (chlorpyrifos) insecticide was applied at a rate of 1 pt/ac on February 5, 2018. Total irrigation amount for the trial was 17.6 inches. The amounts were applied during October, Novem ber, February, March, April, May and June. Precipitation during the period after planting until harvest of the irrigated plots was 6.2 inches. Height, lodging, and date of bloom measurements were collected during the growing season. The trial was harves ted on June 27, 2018 with a WinterSteiger combine. A Harvest Master HM 800 Classic Grain Gage was used to determine percent moisture and test weight (lb/bu). The dryland trial was planted on October 11, 2017 in the same manner as described above, except at a seeding rate of 30 pounds/acre. The planting area was not furrowed. 36 lb/ac of nitrogen was applied pre -plant. Fertilizers applied on February 7, 2017 were 30 lb/ac, and 5.5 lb/ac of nitrogen and sulphur respectively. Herbicides applied on February 7, 2018 include Affinity BS, Lo -Vol6 (2,4-D), and Prowl H20 at a rate of 0.6 oz/ac and 12 oz/ac, and 3 pt/ac respectively. Precipitation during the period after planting until harvest was 5.7 inches. Dryland plots were harvested on June 13, 2017 in the same manner as described above for the irrigated trial. All data were analyzed using SAS\u00ae procedures and means were separated using protected least significant difference (LSD ) at 5% probability level. Results and Discussion Yield data for 2017 -2018 are presented in Tables 1 for the irrigated trial and Table 2 for the dryland trial. Grain yields for the irrigated trial averaged 78.8 bushel/acre. The dry land trial produced an average yield of 17.2 bushel/acre. 18 Table 1.

Herbicides applied during the study period included Affinity BroadSpec (0.6 oz/ac), Lo -Vol 6 (12 oz/ac), Govern (1pt/ac), and Prowl H2O (3pts/ac) on February 5, 2018. Plots were center pivot irrigated throughout the season. October and November irrigation consisted of 2.5 inches of water to aid in establishment. Inadequate precipitation through the fall and earl y winter required additional irrigation; and 16.6 inches of water was applied after the post -planting watering event. These irrigations occurred in February (1.7 in.), March (3.6 in.), April (5.6 in.), and May (3.2 in.). These small grains were managed fo r a one -cut, silage oriented harvest in spring of 2018 (Table 1). Harvests began on April 18, 2018 with the earliest maturing species (rye and triticale) and continued through May 11. Plants were harvested at boot stage (Feekes scale: 10.0 -10.3; Zadoks scale: 45 -53) for maximum forage quality. Although yield is maximized at later growth stages, cutting earlier at boot to early head stages allows for a balance of good yields and optimum nutritive value. Considering the high nutritional needs of dairy cat tle in the region and the common practice of double cropping with corn or sorghum, an early cutting of forages was deemed most appropriate for the area. All plots were harvested with a sickle bar mower set at a height of 2 inches, and total plot weights w ere obtained to estimate yield on both a green forage and dry matter basis. Canopy height and lodging data were collected at harvest. All data were analyzed using SAS\u00ae procedures and means were separated using protected least significant difference (LSD) at 5% probability level. Results and Discussion Yield data are presented in Table 2 . Total precipitation and irrigation amounts were less in 2017 - 2018 (19.51 in.) than in the previous year (21.47 in.). Yields from the 2017 -2018 season were slightly high er than 2016 -2017 and averaged 21.8 tons/acre for green forage. The Small Grain Winter Forage tests at Clovis were harvested and fresh weights were obtained. However, a drying oven fire consumed all the subsamples used for estimating dry matter and nutriti ve value parameters. Hence, no DM yield or quality results are reported for these tests. 21 Table 1.

Materials and Methods The grain corn variety trial was planted May 17, 2018 in 30 -inch rows under center pivot irrigation. Soil type is an Olto n silty clay loam and elevation is 4,435 feet. Individual plots consisted of two, 30-inch rows 20 feet long. There were three replications for each entry, planted in a random complete block. Individual plots were planted at a rate of 27,000 seeds/acre. Plots were planted with a John Deere Max Emerge planter fitted with cone metering units. On February 16, the planting area was fertilized with 18 lb N/ac, 3 qt zinc and, 60 lb/ac of P 2O5. Additional nitrogen was applied pre -plant (122 lb N/ac) and May 17 (30 lb N/ac). Sulphur was applied at plant (22 lb/ac) and May 17, (5.5 lb/ac). Pre -plant herbicide applications included Atrazine (1 pt/ac), Balance Diflex (5 oz/ac) and, Glyphosate (40 oz/ac). Diflex and Brawl herbicides were applied on 20 June at 8 oz/ac and 16 oz/ac respectively. Onager miticide (16 oz/ac) was applied on 20 June. Insecticide and Miticide was applied on August 1 (Prevathon, 20 oz/ac; Oberon, 8 oz/ac) Total irrigation amount for the trial was 16.0 inches. Amounts wer e applied during May, June, July, August and, September. Monthly amounts were 1.4, 3.2, 5.3, 4.4, and 1.7 inches, respectively. Precipitation during the period after planting until harvest of the irrigated plots was 15.9 inches. The plots were harvested on November 5, 2018 with a WinterSteiger combine. Individual plot weights were recorded using a Harvest Master HM 800 Classic Grain Gage, which was also used to determine percent moisture and test weight (lb/bu). Reported yields are adjusted to standard 15.5% moisture and bushel weight of 56 pounds.

Individual plots consisted of two, 30 - inch rows, 20 feet long. Plots were planted at a rate of 27,000 seeds/acre with a two -cone planter (Table 1). On February 16, the planting area was fertilized with 18 lb N/ac, 3 qt zinc and, 60 lb/ac of P 2O5. Additional nitrogen was applied pre -plant (122 lb N/ac) and May 17 (30 lb N/ac). Sulphur was applied pre -plant (22 lb/ac) and May 17 (5.5 lb/ac). At plant herbicide applications included Atrazine (1 pt/ac), Balance Flex (3 oz/ac), Diflex (5 oz/ac) and, Glyphosate (40 oz/ac). Diflex and Brawl herbicides were applied on 2 0 June at 8 oz/ac and 16 oz/ac respectively. Onager miticide (16 oz/ac) was applied on 20 June. Two insecticides were applied on August 1 (Prevathon, 20 oz/ac; Oberon, 8 oz/ac) Total irrigation amount was 14.3 inches applied from May to August at varying rates during the growing season. Monthly amounts were 1.4, 3.2, 5.3, and 4.4 inches for May, June, July, and August, respectively. Precipitation during the period after planting until harvest was 11.0 inches. Plots were harvested on September 6, 2018 with a tractor -drawn commercial forage chopper and forage material was collected in a large basket where plot weight was determined. After plot weight was recorded, approximately 500 grams of freshly cut forage was placed in brown paper bags for later est imation of moisture content and nutritive value. Samples were dried for 72 hours prior to dry matter determination. Dry forage was ground with a Thomas -Wiley Mill to pass a 1 mm screen and ground material was sent to the University of Wisconsin for quali ty analyses via near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) and Milk 2006 technology. All data were analyzed using SAS\u00ae procedures and means were separated using protected least significant difference (LSD) at 5% probability level. Results and Discussi on Data for the forage corn performance trial are presented in Table 2. Highest dry matter yields were above 10.00 tons/ac for the trial. Average dry matter yield was 8.7 tons/acre and significant differences existed among varieties for both dry and gre en forage yields. All forage nutritive value parameters differed (P < 0.05) among the varieties and estimates included moisture at harvest, crude protein, ADF, NDF, NDFD -48hr, starch, ash, milk/ton, milk/acre and Table 1.

Scott1 1New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science C enter at Clovis, NM 88101 Objective: Evaluate Red Root Pigweed control and corn response to several herbicides applied as post - emergence or pre -plant followed by post -emergence. Materials and Methods Plots were established under limited sprinkler irriga tion at the Clovis Agricultural Science Center, NM . Plots were three rows wide and 30 ft. long with three replications arranged in a randomized complete block design. Corn (var. Pioneer 1151) was seeded at the rate of 22,000 seeds /A in 30\" rows on June 1, 2018. Soil at the experimental site is Olton clay loam with 1.6% organic matter and pH 7.9. Herbicide treatments were applied broadcast with a CO 2 pressurized knapsack sprayer delivering 15 gpa. at 40 psi. Pre-emergence treatments (A) were applied on June 1, 2018 (air temperature 82F, relative humidity 13%, wind north east at 7 mph., sky clear, and soil temperature at 0 -inch 92F, 2 -inch 70F, and 4 -inch 70F). Post -emergence treatments (B) were applied broadcast on June 21, 2018 (air temperature 90F, relative humidity 19%, wind south west at 5-7 mph., sky partly cloudy, and soil temperature at 0 -inch 94F, 2 -inch 83F, and 4 -inch 80F). Plots were evaluated for herbicides injuries twice on June 21 and 28. Red root pigweed infestation was uniform throughout the ex perimental site. Weed control evaluation was done visually on June 21 and July 5. The middle row of each plot (20ft) was harvested by hand on October 30, and thrashed on November 8, 2018. Individual plot weights were recorded using a Harvest Master HM 80 0 Classic Grain Gage, which was also used to determine percent moisture and test weight (lb/bu). Reported yields were adjusted to standard 15.5% moisture and bushel weight of 56 pounds. All data were analyzed using SAS\u00ae procedures and means were separat ed using protected least significant difference (LSD) at 5% probability level. Results and Discussion In the post -emergence trial (Table 1) , no injury was recorded with any of the treatments. Red root pigweed control was good to excellent ( 95 to 100%) with all treatments except for Laudis+Liberty the control was around (73%) . Corn yield ranged from 168 to 192 bu/A. Yields were 74 to 104 bu/ac higher in herbicide treated plots, comp ared to the weedy check plots (94 bu/A). In general, corn yields were closel y related to weed control. In the pre -plant followed by post -emergence treatment trial (Table 2) , no injury was recorded with any of the treatments . Redroot pigweed control was good to e xcellent (97 to 100%) with all the treatments. Y ields were 46 to 58 bu/ac higher in herbicide treated plots, compared to the weedy check plots (1 24 bu/A). In general, corn yields were closely related to weed control. 29 Table 1.

Forage corn is the main row crop for dair y industry, but production system removes most of the vegetation out of field living soil exposed to wind and water erosion. With wide row spacing of 30\", 3 to 6\" silage cutting height and long fallow period, the system is inefficient to conserve soil and water resources and hence corn silage system is unsustainable. Recent observations are also suggesting that bottom portion of the stem in corn is of lower quality and it lowers overall quality of forage. We hypothesized that increasing corn cutting height and decreasing row spacing has the potential to conserve soil and water and also improve forage quality without affecting forage yield significantly. Objective: On-farm demonstration /research to evaluate effect of increased forage corn cutting height (6 vs. 21\") and reduced row spacing (15 vs. 30\") on forage yield, forage quality, soil quality (soil organic matter components), soil moisture, wind dynamics and economics. Materials and Methods The second year of the project was established in spring of 2018 in dairy producer's (co - operator, Heritage Dairy Farm) field near Clovis, NM in a half -circle of a center pivot (6o acres). The field has seven spans encompassing two corn row spacing, two forage corn (silage) cutting height. The experimental design i s a split -plot design with four replications (span 4, 5, 6 and 7); row spacing and silage cutting height as main and sub -plots, respectively. Corn was planted on May 12 and 17, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2017 corn was planted into no -tilled field (previous crop canola) , while in 2018 was into previous corn field using commercial planter (model DB60, John Deer Planter, Moline IL, USA). The corn variety '9678VT3P' was selected for the trial for both years. It was planted at 22 ,000 seeds ac-1 in both ye ars. Liquid fertilizer blend (32 -0-0) was pumped through sprinkler at a rate of 5.35, 6.58 and 5.59 tons in June 16, 24 and July 27, 2018 resulting in total equivalent of 187 lbs ac -1 of nitrogen. Herbicide Glyphosate and Keystone nxt at 32oz and 1.4 qt ac -1 in May 13 and Glyphosate and Status at 32 oz and 2 oz qt ac -1 in June 24, 2017 were applied for weed control. The field operation follows producer's management practices. Crop was irrigated although the availability of irrigation water was limited (13 inches in total). Soil samples were taken in May 18, 2017 before fertilizer application and after final harvest in fall of both years . Samples were taken by a graduate student (partially funded by this grant) guided by supervisor (Co -PI) with the GPS grid mapping approach prepared earlier. Samples processing/analysis for soil organic matter components (such as mineralizable carbon, nitrogen, available phosphorus, and inorganic N (NH4 and NO3) taken in October of 2017 and 2018 after forage harvest. Soil qual ity, forage 31 yield and quality were assessed each year. A strip of 20 ft wide in the center of each plots of varying length depending on the span size (ranging from 1983 ft to 3680 ft) was harvested using producer's commercial forage chopper and collected i n a separate truck. Plot weights were determined by weighing the truck with and without forage from the plot. Two samples of about 500 grams were collected from each plot harvest and placed in paper bags and plastic bags for estimation of moisture content and nutritive value. After fresh weights were recorded, samples were dried to a constant weight at 65C. Dried and fresh weights were used to estimate forage biomass production per acre. The dried samples were ground to pass through a 1 -mm screen using a W iley Mill (Thomas Manufacturing) and submitted to the certified Laboratory in University of Wisconsin to estimate nutritive values using near -infrared spectroscopy and Milk 2000 technology. A cover cropping (Rye -winter pea mixture, variety Elbon and Austr ian, respectively) treatment was also added in the section of the field (span 1, 2 and 3) in conjunction with short cut/stubble height and narrower spacing after forage harvest for comparisons with other treatments mentioned above. The rye -pea mixture (65: 35 %) was planted at 41 lbs ac -1 rate. Cover crop was planted in November of 2017. Once cover crop was established sensors were set for wind and soil moisture dynamics monitoring. Sensors (wind and soil temperature) for microclimate observations were set in December of 2017 and 2018 and monitoring of wind, temperature and periodical soil moisture readings (with portable soil moisture reader) under the different corn cutting/stubble height -row spacing combination treatments including cover crop treatment is underway. Since the project is being conducted in producer's field it involves a lot of coordination. Collection of production records (such as seeding rate, seed type, irrigation events, and nutrient and pesticide applications) is going on and a process to continue until the middle of 2019 the time most of the data and information will be compiled and analyzed for publication . Data Analysis Forage yield and quality data were analyzed using SAS procedure on combined two years' data (SAS 9.3, SAS Instit ute Inc.). Statistical analysis was performed on the basis of split -plot design (row spacing as main and silage cutting height as sub -plot factors). To detect differences between row spacing treatments and their interactions with silage cutting heights typ es, PROC GLM procedures were used. Significance was considered at P < 0.05, and Fisher's protected LSD was used to separate means. Results and Discussion Forage yield and quality results involving row spacing and silage cutting heights are presented in Table 1. Significant difference was detected between 15\" than 30\" row spacing for dry and green forage yield, moisture at harvest, starch content and milk production per acre (Table 1 ). The two row spacings, however, were not significantly different for th e other measured parameters. 32 Dry forage yield was higher with 15 than 30\" row spacing (7.7 vs. 6.0 t/ac) which was also reflected in milk production per acre (25179 vs. 19720 lbs/ac; an increase in milk by 22%). Similarly, significant difference s were detected between 6\" than 21\" silage cutting heights for dry and green forage yield and moisture at harvest and milk production per acre. Dry forage yield production per acre were reduced by 20 % with silage cutting height of 21\" compared to the 6\" (6.2 vs. 7. 6 t/ac). This was also reflected in milk production per acre as well. However, cutting height had no significance effect on milk production per ton. In general, a significant improvement in forage quality was observed with increasing silage cutting height (reduction in fiber by 6 to 8%, increase in starch by 11% and reduction in nitrate by 39%). In a separate trial conducted at NMSU -Agricultural Science Center at Clovis in 2017 involving three silage cutting heights (6, 13, 21\") and five corn varieties reve aled similar reduction in dry forage yield with the highest silage cutting height. However, yield reduction with 13\" cutting height was only 5% suggesting the possibility of raising cutting height to 13\" with minimum yield loss. In the long run, tall stubb le (with higher silage cutting heights) in conjunction with narrow row spacing is expected to leave more plant residue in field potentially resulting in better soil coverage, improvement in soil conservation and moisture retention, carbon sequestration, an d in overall improvement and sustainability of forage corn production and hence dairy farming systems and rural economies in New Mexico.

Material and Methods Experiment location during 2018 was NMSU Agricultural Science Center in Clovis NM (340 35' N, 103\u00b0 12' W and elevation of 1348 m above mean sea level). Design: Strip plot with split -split a rrangement . plot: Pre-irrigation plot: Four irrigation treatments [Fully irrigated (FI), Irrigation water stress at veget ative stage (Vstss), Irrigation water stress at reproductive irrigated ] Sub-Sub plot: Guar cultivars Kinman (branching) and Monument (less branching) Date of sowing: July 3, 2018 . Spacing: Row to row distance was 30 inches . Seed rate: 8 lbs/acre . Replications: 4 (Four replica tion of each treatment) Results and Discussion Seed yield under pre -irrigation treatment recorded 23% more than seed yield under no pre - irrigation treatment (Table1). Pre -Irrigation treatment increased seed y ield in all in season irrigation treatment. The highest percentage seed yield increase (27%) was obtained under Rstss treatment with pre -irrigation as compared to Rstss treatment without pre -irrigation. Thus skipping irrigation during reproductive growth s tage and applying a pre -irrigation to guar crop is beneficial with a seed yield loss of 3.8% as compare to fully irrigated treatment which was pre - irrigated before. (Table2). The effect of pre -irrigation was also observed in other in season irrigation trea tments as seed yield increased (26.12%) under Vstss treatment with pre -irrigation as compared to Vstss treatment with no pre -irrigation and 26.03 % seed yield increased was recorded under Rainfed with pre -irrigation as compare to Rainfed without any pre -irrigation. Least seed yield increase (14.39%) was observed under fully irrigated with pre -irrigation as compare to fully irrigation without any pre -irrigation. Among the cultivars, Kinman performed better than Monument cultivar and making a yield difference of 10.33%. Pre-irrigation had effect on s esonal pattern of biomass production as well . Aboveground dry biomass increased during initial growth and then 34 started decreasing in the later growth of guar crop (Fig.1) . During initial crop growth (32 DAP) in seas on aboveground dry weight under Rstss was 19.23% higher than Vstss and during late crop growth this difference further increased to 32.2%. This indicates that guar crop needs irrigation during its early growth for better biomass production and seed yield. Table 1 .

The soil type was an Olton clay loam (fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Paleustolls). Based on soil test results no fertilizer was recomm ended for the crop . Guar was planted in June 7 but because of herbicide drift damage of the plan, crop was re -replanted in July 2, 2018 in a conventionally tilled seedbed using a commercial field drill (Model 2010HD, Great Plains Drill) under limited cente r pivot irrigation. Herbicide Treflan was applied at the rate of 1.5 pints ac -1 before plantin g for weed control. Hand weeding was also done as needed. All varieties were planted at s eeding rate of 8 lbs ac-1. The experim ental design was a randomized c omplete block with a split -split plot arrangements with four replications. Main plot involved variety (Kinman, Monument and Jud) while r ow spacing ( 30, 20 and 6 inches) was the sub -sub-plot. At plant maturity a large area of 115 ft2 was harvested in mid -Decem ber of 2018 using a plot combine (Model Elite Plot 2001, Wintersteiger, Ried, Austria) from center two rows of each plot for seed yield determination. Seed yield was adjusted to a standard seed moisture content of 1 2.5%. Data Analysis: Statistical analy sis was performed on the basis of a split -plot design (variety as main and row spacing as sub plot factors). To detect differences between the factors and their interactions, PROC GLM procedures were used (SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc.). Significance was con sidered at P < 0.05, and Fisher's protected LSD was used to separate means. Results and Discussion The interaction of variety \u00d7 row spacing effect was not significant on s eed yield. However, variety and row spacing had significant effect on seed yield. Seed yield of variety Jud was significantly higher (by 26% and 39%) than seed yield of Kinman and Monument, respectively (Table 1) indicating its high yielding potential over the other varieties. However, Kinman and Monumnet were not significantly differen t for seed yield . On the other hand, row spacing of 6\" produced the lowest seed yield compared to 20 and 30\" row spacing (Table 1) . Results suggests that similar yield can be achieved with both 20 and 30\" row spacing potentially giving growers to choose sp acing that fits their operations. The trial will be repeated in 2019 and using two years results a recommendation can be made to growers. 37 Table 1.

Winter canola is a new crop in the US and this Nationally coordinated project aims at identifying suitable varieties for each region. Efforts to introduce hybrid winter canola in to North America is new and mostly European hybrids are being ass essed for adoptions and yield performance. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted at NMSU -Agricultural Science Center at Clovis in 2017 -18 growing seasons. The soil type at the site was an Olton clay loam (fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Paleustolls). Based on soil test results, recommended fertilizer of 125 -0-20-35 lbs ac-1 (N-P-K-S) in 2017 was pre -plant incorporated into soil. Planting was on September 20, 2017 into a conventionally tilled seedbed using a plot drill (Model 3P600, Great Plains Drill) under center pivot irrigation. Seeding rate was 5 and 4 lbs ac-1 for open pollinated and hybrid varieties. Limited irrigation was provided as needed (11 inches in total). Treflan herbicide at 1.5 pints ac-1 was applied for weed control befor e planting. This is a good and commonly used herbicide for weed control in canola. Some hand weeding was also done as needed. Insecticides were applied as needed for insect control. The experimental design was a randomized complete block arrangement with three replications. The trial was composed of open pollinated and hybrid variety groups. Open pollinated and hybrid varieties were kept separate with buffer strip. The trial involved 39 varieties representing both hybrid (21) and open pollinated (18) varie ties coming from diverse seed companies (such as DuPont Pioneer, Croplan Genetics, DL Seeds Inc/Rubisco Seeds LLC, Monsanto, Kansas State University). Fall plant stand, winter survival rating, flowering (50% bloom) dates were recorded for each plot. Before final harvest, plant height was measured from soil surface to the tip of the plant. A 115 ft2 area in the middle of each plot was harvested for seed yield using a plot combine (Model Elite Plot 2001, Wintersteiger). Seed yield was adjusted to 10% moisture . Data Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed on data on the basis of randomized complete block design for open pollinated and hybrid groups separately. Analysis followed PROC GLM procedures (SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc.). Significance was considere d at P < 0.05, and Fisher's protected LSD was used to separate means. Results and Discussion: The most important measured variables in 2017 -18 growing season are shown in Table 1. Based on nine years of data, crop establishment and winter survival has be en excellent (Table 2) 39 indicating its easy adaptability to the growing conditions of the region and hence acceptance by farmers. There were significant differences among canola varieties within open pollinated and hybrid types for measured variables. Days required for 50% bloom in hybrids ranged from 91 (variety: MH 15HIB002) to 102 (variety: QUARTZ) days while in open pollinated varieties it ranged from 94 (varieties: KS4670 and KS4675 ) to 100 (variety: Riley) days. Plant height of hybrids ranged from 38 t o 45 inches, while in open pollinated varieties height ranged from 36 to 40 inches (Table 1). Averaged over varieties, test weight of hybrid was slightly higher (50 lbs/Bu) than that of open pollinated (48 lbs/Bu) reflecting hybrids inherent bigger seed si ze. Seed yield was significantly different among varieties within canola types (hybrids and open pollinated). Seed yield of hybrids ranged from 2851 (variety: MH 15HIB002) to 3713 (variety: Mercedes) lbs ac-1, while seed yield in open pollinated varieties ranged from 1995 (Star 915W) to 3208 (variety: Riley) lbs ac-1. Averaged over varieties, seed yield of open pollinated was 84% of hybrid's yield indicating the continuous improvement in yield of open pollinated varieties. Thus, open pollinated varieties p roducing comparable seed yield to hybrid varieties suggest that they have potential to be used by growers with less cost associated with seeds. Canola seed yields of 2017 -18 growing season is within the range achieved in the past nine years of variety trials (Table 2) conducted at NMSU -Agricultural Science Center at Clovis; and this is with limited irrigation (less than 15 inches). Planting date of early -to late -September (Table 2) is a wide window and has worked well. This is a very important agronomic in formation that growers need for canola production in our area. Thus, if a grower misses early September planting he/she can still plant the crop even in late September and still get good crop. However, the earlier the planting date the higher yield potenti al of the crop can be realized if growing condition is favorable. Seed yield produced by canola in very dry years (Table 2) clearly shows that canola has potential to produce at least 3000 lbs ac-1 with less than 15 inches of irrigation. Again, this is key and important information for an area with rapidly declining underground irrigation source. The results of 2017 -18 and previous multi years variety testing suggest that canola not only is a potential, less water requiring alternative crop (with some varie ties yielding more than 4000 lbs ac-1) but also adaptable to the growing conditions of the region to become a cash and rotational break crop in the region dominated by cereal mono -cropping systems. 40 Table 1.

POTENTIAL BENEFITS: Each component of the design, perennial grass, buffer strip, circular design and multiple circles, add or improve benefits to the system. Benefits include Agronomic, Environmental, Ec onomic and Quality of Life. Main benefits anticipated include.1. Improve water cycle and water use efficiency (capture more precipitation and reduce losses) 2. Protect soil and crop (reduce wind, soil abrasion injury) 3. Increase biodiversity (microbial, p lants and wildlife) 4. Improve carbon sequestration (deeper root, longer growing season, and higher productivity) 5. Circular rings trap agrochemicals, water and soil moving in any direction (improve efficiency) 6. Better quality of life (reduced pollution , improved air quality, diverse wildlife) 7. Practical benefits (well pressure, pivot tire, wiper irrigation) Objectives: To assess the effect of circular buffer strips of native perennial grasses on microclimate of center pivot irrigated corn To character ize effect of CBS on corn biomass and seed yield productivity in center pivot irrigated corn Materials and Methods : A long term project was initiated at the New Mexico State University Agricultural Science Center, Clovis (34.60 N, 103.22 W, elevation 1331m). Assuming a center pivot not having irrigation water to irrigate one third of the pivot was used for the proje ct. One third of the pivot was rearranged as circular buffer strips (Fig 1). A mixture of native warm season and cool season grasses (seven species) were planted on August 8, 2016 to establish CBS. Outer most strip in the pivot was 30 ft wide grass strip, which alternated with 60 ft wide crop strips. Grass strips were periodically watered during the first year to establish. During 2017 and 2018, we used grain corn for crop strip. Grass strip was allowed establish during 2017. In 2018, when the corn was grow n above grass height (when the benefit of CBS is minimum on corn), grass was swathed and baled in August and allowed to regrow rest of the season. It was proposed not to irrigate grass strips in the CBS pivot to reduce irrigation water use. However, we wat ered them to establish and also to initiate growth in extremely dry year of 2018. But, it did not receive water during corn growing season. Observations focused on microclimate, crop growth and seed yield. The purpose was to compare with or without buffe r strips on corn performance and microclimate. We also assessed distance to which buffer strip benefits were observed. The effect of multiple buffer strips was also assessed to a limited level. Visual observations in 2018 indicated that corn emergence was 43 quicker and more uniform in CBS pivot compared to control pivot. Similarly, early growth showed significant differences between CBS and control pivots. Moderating wind close to soil surface might have contributed for the benefits. We will characterize the se differences by taking relevant observation in 2019. To characterize microclimate, wind anemometers (sonic and cup) were installed close to the ground (2 inches) to characterize incoming, in buffer strip, in crop strip close to buffer and in the center o f crop strip. Due limited availability of sensors, only outer most buffer and crop strip was focused. Limited soil and air temperature, relative humidity were also measured at a limited location. Aboveground biomass samples were collected couple of times d uring the growing season. They were taken at different distance from the border or from buffer strips to assess edge effect. For biomass sampling 10 plants from different rows were harvested, chopped and fresh weight was recorded. Samples were oven dried a t 65 C for 72 h. Dry biomass weight was recorded when a constant dry weight were obtained after drying for three days. At harvest, biomass and seed yield from different rows were harvested. To assess effect on large plots and integrate effects on differen t locations in the edge, a few passes of 8 rows wide were harvested at different locations in CBS pivot and control pivot. The seed yield was adjusted to a standard seed moisture content. We also used an ET system in outermost and third buffer and crop str ips and assessed effect of CBS on microclimate or ET were assessed. This basically integrates buffer strip effect on corn and grass performance. Results and Discussion Preliminary observations in 2017 on microclimate improvements and corn crop performance strongly supported CBS over control pivot (Fig. 2). In general, emergence of corn was quicker and more uniform with CBS compared to control pivots. Due to limited funds, most of our observations were focused on outer grass strip and were in select locatio ns. During seedling stage of corn, grass (Angadi et al., 2016) Figure. 1. Rearranging unirrigated portion of a partial pivot into circular buffer strips (top) . An example of a partial pivot with 1/3 area not irrigated is used. During the crop growing season (middle) grass buffer strip doesn't receive any irrigation water. It is protecting the young crop. Once the crop is harvested, grass can be stimulated to grow and protect the soil in the early spring (bottom). 44 buffers reduced wind speed by more than 50% at 1.5m from the inside edge of first grass strip (Fig. 2A). The benefit was also seen in the middle and end of the first crop strip (9.0 m and 16.5 m). Relative humidity measured with ET tower (Fig. 2B) showed that CBS improved microclimate for crop growth (eg. higher RH) as we moved from edge of the pivot to center of the pivot (eg. crop strips 1 vs 3). In response to improved microclimate, the relationship between corn biomass production in the middle of the season and distance from outer edge (either from inside edge of first grass strip or from pivot edge) showed significant improvement in CBS compared to control pivot (Fig. 2C). The final harvest with a combine, which integrates all benefits of CBS over traditional practice, showed 24% seed yield increase with grass buffer strips in the outer 6 m and the average benefit was 9% in three 6m wide random passes in side pivot (up to 51 m). Thus, limited observations prove C BS benefits beyond edge effect, which needs to be studied in depth to realize the benefits in SGP and beyond. Understanding effects of CBS on FEW components and their interactions will help us in developing models, which can be used for adoption of the technology in diverse situations in SGP.

A B D C 45 WINTER CANOLA NITROGEN MANAGEMENT STUDY Sangu Angadi, Sultan Begna and Rajan Ghimire Agricultural Science Clovis, New Mexico State University, Clovis, NM Objective: To study the effects of nitrogen applica tion time on seasonal biomass production, nitrogen allocation, seed oil and protein content and seed yield of winter canola under limited irrigation. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted at NMSU -Agricultural Science Center at Clovis. Soil type a t the site was an Olton clay loam (fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Paleustolls). Based on soil test results, recommended fertilizer of 120-0-25-17 lbs ac-1 (N-P-K-S) was applied in October 20, 2017 as full rate, fall time nitrogen (N) application . We consider this as 100% rate -fall application: N1. Canola was planted on September 20, 2017 into a conventionally tilled seedbed using a plot drill (Model 3P600, Great Plains Drill) under center pivot irrigation. Seeding rate were 6 and 4 lbs ac-1 for Ri ley (open pollinated) and 46W94 (hybrid) varieties, respectively. Limited irrigation was provided as needed (11inches in total). Treflan herbicide at the rate of 1.5 pints ac-1 was soil incorporated before planting for weed control . This is a good and comm only used herbicide for weed control in canola. Some hand weeding was also done as needed. Insecticides were applied as needed for insect control. The study used a randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement of eight treatments with four replications. Nitrogen application rate -time was the main plot while variety was sub -plot. The main plot factor had four nitrogen application rate -time treatments (100% rate - fall: N1; 100% spring: application with 50% fall and 50% spring: N3; 25 + 25 + 25% fall and spring with spring before bolting and at flowering: N4). Nitrogen was applied in early - spring (February 2, 2017) for spring application treatments, while application for part of N4 treatment was done during canola flowering stage (Apri l 10, 2017). The sub -plot involved two canola varieties (46W94 and Riley). Aboveground biomass of canola was estimated from two 0.5 m2 harvests of each plot at different harvest times (December 15, 2016: late -fall; and February 13, 2018: mid -winter) . The mid- winter harvest was done before spring nitrogen application. After the harvested fresh weight was recorded, a subsample of known weight was dried to a constant weight at 65\u00b0C. Dried and fresh weights were used to estimate forage biomass production per acre. The dried subsamples were ground to pass through a 1 -mm screen using a Wiley Mill (Thomas Manufacturing) and submitted to Ward Laboratories, (Kearney, NE) to estimate crude protein (CP) values using near - infrared spectroscopy. This value was used to c alculate crude protein production per acre. A 115 ft2 area in the middle of each plot was harvested for seed yield using a plot combine (Model Elite Plot 2001, Wintersteiger). Seed samples were submitted to the Brassica Breeding and Research Laboratory (University of Idaho ) for seed oil and protein content analysis. Value w ere used to calculate oil yield and crude protein production per acre . Data Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed on data using split-plot design ( nitrogen application time as the main plot and canola variet ies as sub -plots). To detect differences between nitrogen application time treatments and their interactions with variety types, PROC GLM procedures 46 were used (SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc.). Significance was considered at P < 0.0 5, and Fisher's protected LSD was used for mean separat ion. Results and Discussion : There were significant differences among nitrogen treatments for most of the measured variables. However, varieties were not significantly different for variables measure d. Canola dry mater accumulation of late -fall harvest was the lowest (Table 1) with spring nitrogen application time alone (N2 -spring) compared to the other treatments reflecting low nitrogen availability in the soil because of no nitrogen was applied for this treatment in the fall. However, the other nitrogen application time treatments (N1, N3 and N4) were not significantly different in dry matter accumulation with late -fall harvest. Canola dry matter accumulation of late -fall harvest ranged from 1990 to 2957 lbs ac-1. Similar trend was observed among nitrogen application time treatments for crude protein accumulation in above ground plant tissues confirming plant's usage of the available nitrogen in the soil. The trend in canola dry matter and crude prote in accumulation in above ground plant tissues with mid -winter harvest was similar as late -fall harvest among nitrogen application time treatments. Seed oil content, seed and oil yield are the most important variables in canola production. Seed yield was si gnificantly affected by time of nitrogen application. The lowest seed yield was measured with fall -application (N1) treatment while the highest was measured with 50% fall and 50% spring -application (N3) treatment (Table 1). This translates into 15% more se ed yield with split nitrogen (N3) application compared to full rate fall only nitrogen application suggesting the advantage of split nitrogen application over fall application (N1). This can help producers manage nitrogen more efficiently and have a succes sful canola production with split application of nitrogen. Interestingly, nitrogen treatments those applied at least half of nitrogen in spring (N2, N3 and N4) were not significantly different for seed yield (Table 1). This suggests that nitrogen need for winter canola seed yield formation is in the spring. Unlike winter wheat, most of the fall foliage of winter canola is lost by winter kill. So excessive nitrogen use in the fall may not be converted into seed yield. However, minimum vegetative growth in th e fall is required for surviving winter. It was interesting to see that nitrogen application in three splits and reducing total N application by 25% (N4) had no significant effect on canola seed yield. Since pumping additional nitrogen through center pivot irrigation is relatively easy and cost effective, keeping the option of applying additional nitrogen from bolting to flowering, depending on the seasonal growing condition will help canola productivity greatly. Seed oil content (avg. 38%) was not signific antly different among the nitrogen treatments suggesting seed oil content is stable and is not affected by the time of nitrogen application. Oil yield is the product of seed yield and seed oil content. Since there was no significant difference among the ni trogen treatment for seed oil content, seed yield was the main driver of winter canola oil yield . Therefore, oil yield followed the same pattern as seed yield in relation to nitrogen treatments. Nitrogen treatments were not significantly different for seed protein content , mirroring seed oil content response to nitrogen application time treatments. The trial is planted again in the 2018 -19 season at two locations (second location is Tucumcari, ASC). Two year data will provide insight into nitrogen managem ent (timing, in particular) for winter canola under limited irrigation in New Mexico. Canola is a relatively new, potential alternative less water requiring crop for diversifying the cropping systems of New Mexico. Thus, developing a nitrogen management gu ide for producers is critical for successful canola production and sustainable agriculture with limited irrigation in the region. 47 Table 1.

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted at NMSU -Agricultural Science Center at Clovis in 2016 -17 and 2017 - 18 growing seasons. The soil type at the site was an Olton clay loam (fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Paleustolls). Based on soil test results, recommended fertilizer of 120-0-35-28 and 125 -0-20-35 lbs ac-1 (N-P-K-S) in 2016 and 2017, respectively was pre -plant incorporated into s oil. Crop was planted on September 20, and 18 in 2016 and 2017 respectively into a conventionally tilled seedbed using a plot drill (Model 3P600, Great Plains Drill) under center pivot irrigation. Seeding rate was 4 lbs ac-1 in both years. Limited irrigati on was provided as needed (11 inches in total in both years). Treflan herbicide at 1.5 pints ac-1 was applied in both years for weed control before planting . This is a good and commonly used herbicide for weed control in canola . Some hand weeding was also done as needed . Insecticides were applied as needed for insect control. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with a split -plot arrangement with four replications. Stress treatments imposed through cutting (mechanical removal) of inflore scence at different stages (none/control, at bolting and at full- bloom) were the main plots and winter canola varieties (hybrid and open pollinated) were sub -plots. The trial involves 10 varieties representing both hybrid (5 varieties) and open pollinated (5 varieties) coming from diverse seed companies (such as DuPont Pioneer, Croplan Genetics, DL Seeds Inc/Rubisco Seeds LLC, Monsanto, Kansas State University). Stress treatment imposed through cutting of inflorescence at different stages was done on April 3 (2017 and 2018: bolting stage with 7 inches cutting height ) and on April 12 (2017 and 2018: full- bloom stage with 14 inches cutting height ). Flowering (beginning, 50% and ending) dates were recorded for each plot. Seed yield and biomass were determined on samples of canola hand harvested ( in mid -June both in 2017 and 2108 ) at ground level from an area of 1 m2 from each plot. Plant samples were dried to a constant weight at 65\u00b0C before threshing with a plot combine (Elite Plot 2001, Wintersteiger ). Yield components were determined on five randomly harvested plant samples for each plot. Harvest index, calculated as the ratio of grain to total biomass (grain plus aboveground dry matter), was also determined for each plot. Seed samples from each plot was ana lyzed using near -infrared spectroscopy to determine oil content ( Brassica Breeding and Research Laboratory, University of Idaho). 49 Data Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed on combined 2 y ears' data on the basis of split -plot design (stress treat ment as main and canola variety as sub -plot factors). To detect differences between stress treatments and their interactions with variety types, PROC GLM procedures were used (SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc.). Significance was considered at P < 0.05, and Fishe r's protected LSD was used to separate means. Results and Discussion : The main assumption in this trial was that if we remove the inflorescence at bud formation or flowering stage, canola plant will regrow from auxiliary buds and produce inflorescence a t a later stage. Typically, daytime temperatures increase in the region during March to May months. Thus, delayed flowering in inflorescence stress imposed treatments will be exposed to higher temperature stress which will significantly affect seed and oil formation. Crop established well and reached to the recommended stage (6 -8 leaf stage) for good winter survival before the first killing frost, which is critical for successful winter canola production. Results of the most important variables measured: p od numbers, 1000 seeds weight, seed oil content, seed and oil yield and biomass are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Calculated flowering duration based on beginning and ending flowering dates are included in the table. There w as significant difference among i nflorescence removal (cutting ) treatments for all measured variables. Averaged over varieties, seed yields were 1999, 1363 and 1121 lbs ac-1 for control (no cutting), cutting at bolting, and cutting at full -bloom treatments, respectively (Table 1). Imposin g stress through mechanical removal of inflorescence at flowering reduced seed yield by 44 % while cutting at bolting reduced seed yield by 32 % compared to the control (no cutting) treatment. Yield components (pods per plant and 1000 seeds weight) were re duced by removal of inflorescence and more so at flowering than bolting stage compared to control treatment. The reduction in seed yield resulted from not only form reduction in pods formation per plant and 1000 seeds weight but also reduced flowering dura tion (Table 1) which could be linked to higher temperatures occurred during reproductive growth stage. Seed oil content and oil yield were significantly affected by inflorescence removal at bolting and flowering stages compared to control treatment. Highes t seed oil content was recorded with control while lowest value w as recorded with stress imposed at flowering treatment. There was no difference between bolting and full -bloom treatments in pods per plant and biomass production suggesting enough time for plants even with stress imposed at flowering to recover and produce similar biomass as bolting stressed treatment (Table 1) . However, plants stressed at full bloom treatment was the least efficient in harvest index reaching just 14%, which was 33% and 18% l ower compared to control and stressed at bolting treatments, respectively. Nevertheless, the se result suggest that canola 's sensitiv ity to stress at both stages to result in significant yield reduction but more so when stress occurs at flowering than bolti ng stages. Averaged over variety types, hybrids produced more seed yield than open pollinated (by 8%). Seed yield ranged from 1321 to 1695 lbs ac-1. The highest yield was produced by Hekip (hybrid) while lowest yield was achieved by DKW46 -15 (open pollin ated). Nevertheless, half of the open pollinated varieties produced similar seed yield as hybrids suggesting their potential to be used by growers with less cost associated with seeds. Stress imposed through cutting at bolting and flowering had a less pron ounced effect on biomass than on seed yield. These results suggest that plants stressed through cutting at bolting and flowering were limited more by sink (less pods and 50 seeds) than source (biomass) since sufficient source was produced by the plants with c utting treatments at both stages. Seed oil content was different between inflorescence removal treatments. I nflorescence removal at flowering produced seed with lowest seed oil content compared to control (no cutting of inflorescence treatment) but similar seed oil content to that of inflorescence removal at flowering treatment. Oil yield response of canola in relation to stress imposed through cutting of inflorescence followed same pattern as seed oil content. Both seed yield and seed oil content are major oil yield determining factor. 51 Table 1.

This information can be useful for developing optimum silage corn harvesting height recommendations that could be used as a strategy/ tool for farmers to harvest silage corn sustainably , conserve soil and water resources . Materials and Methods The study was conducted at NMSU -Agricultural Science Center at Clovis in 2018. Based on soil test results recommended fertilizer was applied at rate of 18 (N), 60 (P 2O5) lbs ac-1, 3qt ac-1 (Zn) in February16 and 122 (N), 22 (S) lbs ac-1 as pre -plant and 30 (N) and 5.5 (S) lbs ac-1 at plant. Herbicide mixture Atrazine, Balance Flex, Diflex, Glyphosate was applied pre -plant at 1 pint, 3 oz, 5 oz, and 40 oz ac-1, respectively. Additional herbicide mixture of Diflex and Brawl at 8 oz and 1.3 pint ac-1 was appli ed for weed control in June 20, 2018. Insecticides Onager (16 oz ac-1) in June 20 and Prevathon (20 oz ac-1) and Oberon (8 oz ac-1) in August 1, 2018 were applied for insect control. The experimental design followed a randomized complete block design with three replications . The study involved f ive corn varieties [9678VT3P, 1151AQ, D58QC72, P1449xr (brown mid rib, BMR) and 1197P ]. Corn was planted in May 19, 2018 at the seeding rate of 27,000 seeds ac-1. For plant portions/sections contribution to biomass yield and quality determination, a 1m length of row of whole plant samples were harvested at 6\" height from soil surface for each plot of each variety. Whole p lant samples were then brought indoor and cut/partitioned into four portions (H7, H16, H32, and AE ) for each plot and variety. Besides these four portions , ear/cobs were kept separate and considered as additional plant portion. Plant portions H7, H16 and H32 represents below ear and AE represents above the ear portion of the plan. Forage sample were ha rvested in September , typical time period when silage corn is commonly harvested. After fresh weight were recorded, sample portions were choppe d and a subsample of known weight from each sample was dried to a constant weight at 65\u00b0C. Dr y and fresh weights were used to estimate plant portions biomass and contributions to total forage biomass yield per acre. Dry subsamples were ground to pass through a 1 -mm screen using a Wiley Mill (Thomas Manufacturing) and submitted to a certified laboratory (Ward Laborato ries, Kearney, NE) to estimate forage quality using near -infrared spectroscopy Data Analysis Forage (dry - and green -biomass) yield and quality data of the different plant portions were analyzed using SAS procedure. To detect differences between variety and their interactions with plant portions , PROC GLM procedures were used (SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc.). Significance was considered at P < 0.05, and Fisher's protected LSD was used to separate means. 53 Results and Discussion Forage (dry- and green -biomass) yield and quality results involving plant portion and variety are presented in Tables 1. Plant portion \u00d7 variety interaction effect was not significant for forage yield , quality and milk production . Varieties were not significantly different for most of the measured parameters. However, s ignificant difference was detected between the different plant portions for forage yield, quality characteristics, and milk production (Table 1). Corn ear/cob contributed the highest (58%) to total forage yield (10.8 t/ac) while the least contribution (5%) came from the bottom H7 plant portion. This was also reflected in milk production (Table 1). Moisture content in plant parts was the lowest in ear/cob while the highest moisture content was recorded in plant portion H32 fo llowed by H16 and H7 (Table 1). Forage quality of ear/cob and above the ear plant portions were significantly higher than below ear plant portions indicating the significant importance of ear and above ear plant portions in the overall corn forage quality and hence feed value in animal feed ration. Similarly, fiber and nitrate content of plant portions of below the ear are significantly lower than corn ear/cob and above the ear plant portions further enforcing the insignificant importance of this plant port ions in animal feed value. This suggests that raising silage corn cutting height to as high as H7 to H13 (5 to 11 % reduction in yield) can be used as a strategy to sustainably harvest silage corn with minimum forage yield loss and improve d forage quality that can and potentially conserve soil and water resources in forage corn production systems. In the long run, tall stubble (with higher silage cutting heights of at least 13\") in conjunction with a corn variety of producer 's choice is expected to leave mo re plant residue in the field potentially resulting in better soil coverage, improvement in soil conservation and moisture retention, carbon sequestration, and in overall improvement and sustainability of forage corn production and hence dairy farming syst ems in New Mexico. The study will be repeated i n 2019. 54 Table 1.

The soil type was an Olton clay loam (fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Paleustolls). Guar was planted in June 7 but because of herbicide drift damage, crop was re -replanted in July 2, 2018 in a conventionally tilled seedbed using a commercial field drill (Model 2010HD, Great Plains Drill) under center pivot ir rigation. Herbicide Treflan was applied at the rate of 1.5 pints ac -1 before planting for weed control. Hand weeding was also done as needed. All varieties were planted at seeding rate of 8 lbs ac-1. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with a split -split plot arrangements with four replications. Main plot involved rhizobium inoculation (with or without; for plots with rhizobium 0.2lb of inoculant for an acre of planting seeds was applied) while five phosphorus rate (0, 22, 45, and 67 an d 89 lbs/ac) was the sub -sub-plot. After a crop was planted, a furrow was created next to the crop row and the different phosphorus rate was applied manually. At plant maturity plant samples from center of each plot in a 2m length was harvested for biomass and seed yield determination. Plant samples were dried to a constant weight at 65\u00b0C . After dry weights were recorded samples were threshed using a plot combine (Model Elite Plot 2001, Wintersteiger, Ried, Austria). Seed yield was adjusted to a standard se ed moisture content of 12.5%. Data Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed on the basis of a split -plot design ( Rhizobium as main and phosphorus rate as sub plot factors) procedures . To detect differences between the factors and their interactions, PROC GLM procedures were used (SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc.). Significance was considered at P < 0.05, and Fisher's protected LSD was used to separate means. Results and Discussion: The interaction of rhizobium inoculant \u00d7 phosphorus rate effect was not significant on biomass and s eed yield production . Treatment with inoculant and without inoculant were significantly different for seed yield but not biomass production. Interestingly no -inoculant treatment had greater seed yield than treatment with inocula nt by 17% (Table 1). On the other hand, phosphorus application had no effect on both biomass and seed yield production. The trial will be repeated in 2019 and using two years results a conclusion and recommendation can be. 56 Table 1. Effects of rhizobium ino culant and phosphorus rate on guar biomass and seed yield at NMSU -Agricultural Science Center Clovis, NM 2018 Values within rhizobium inoculant and within phosphorus rate column with different letters are significantly different at (P<0.05). 57 Winter Canola under Dormant Period and Growth -Stage Based on Irrigation Strategies in the Southern High Plains of the USA Paramveer Singh, Sangu Angadi, Sultan Begna, Dawn VanLeeuwen, and Brian Schutte Objective Evaluate the effect of dormant period irrigation on growth and yield of winte r canola. Assess the impact of water stress at different growth stages on growth and yield. Materials and Methods A two -year field study was conducted during 2016 -17 and 2017 -18 growing season at the New Mexico State University Agricultural Science Center , Clovis (34.60 N, 103.22 W, winter canola ( Brassica napus L.) were planted under a center -pivot irrigation system with wheat as previous crop. Before planting, the field was disked and ploughed to incorporate wheat residue. Experimental plots were planted on 20th September 2016 and 12th September 2017, using an Eleven Row Plot Planter with one seed cone (John Deer Maximizer). The plot size was 9.1 m \u00d7 1.7 m with one pass per plot. Crop was planted at 15 cm row spaci ngs at a 4.5 Kg ha-1 seed rate. Based on soil test recommendations, 150 kg N ha-1, 28 kg P2O5 ha-1 and 28 kg S ha-1 were applied in 2016. A total of 140 kg N ha-1, 22 kg P 2O5 ha-1 and 40 kg S ha-1 was applied in pre -plant herbicide was incorporated at the 2.5 L ha- 1 for weed control. Strip -plot design with split -split arrangement was used with four replications. Main -Plot factor: Two levels of dor mant period irrigation (Yes - applied, No - not applied). Sub-Plot factor: Growth -Stage Based irrigation (Irr - fully irrigated, VStss - no irrigation during vegetative growth, RStss - no irrigation during reproductive period, RD - rainfed) Sub-sub Plot fa ctor: Three winter canola cultivars (Riley, Hekip, and DKW -46-15) Aboveground biomass samples were collected several times during the growing season. An area of 0.25 m2 was hand harvested and oven dried at 6 5 C for 72 h. Dry biomass weight was recorded when a constant dry weight was obtained after drying for three days. Five random plants were selected, and hand harvested at maturity to calculate yield components. Number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, 1000 seed weight and number of branches we re calculated as an average of five selected plants. An area of 1 m2 was harvested separately at maturity for harvest index. Dry plant biomass was obtained, and samples were threshed using a plot combine (Model Elite Plot 2001, Wintersteiger, Reid, Austria ) to obtain seed yield. Harvest index was calculated as the ratio of seed yield to total dry plant biomass. For final seed yield, plot area of 9.2 m2 was harvested using the above -mentioned plot combine. The seed yield was adjusted to a standard 10% seed moisture. Results and Discussion Applying irrigation during dormant period significantly increased aboveground biomass in both years (Table 2). This increased canola's capacity to intercept photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), as a strong relationship bet ween PAR and aboveground biomass has been reported in canola. Crop recovered from an early VStss and produced 8% (2016 -17) and 11% (2017 -18) more final biomass than RStss. Refilling of soil profile during dormant period increased seed yield by 58 41% (2016 -17) and 31% (2017 -18). Because of increased supply of assimilates and extended reproductive period by dormant period irrigation, canola produced more flowers and eventually formed more pods. Reproductive period was more susceptible to water stress than the v egetative period. RStss reported higher yield loss than VStss. Oil content (OC) was significantly increased by applying dormant period irrigation in 2016 -17. But no such effect was observed in 2017 -18. Pods per plant influenced seed yield more than other y ield components. Hekip and Riley performed similarly in both years. Relatively lower biomass and shorter reproductive phase of DKW46 -15 resulted in lower yield as compared to Hekip and Riley. Table 1.

Materials and Methods The study was conducted at the New Mexico State University Agricultural Science Center (ASC) at Clovis, NM (34\u00b035' N, 103\u00b012' W, 1348 m elevation), and nearby farmers' fields. Land use systems compared included grazed native pasture (GNP), cropland converted to grassland (CCG), conventional -tilled winter grazed (STC) and no -tilled cropland (NTC) with no grazing. The GNP and CCG were farmers' field with more than 50 years under native grasses. The CTGC was also an on -farm plot maintained with dryland sorghum -based rotation and occasional winter grazing. The STC and NTC fields were under corn -sorghum rotation since 2013 and under winter wheat -sorghum -fallow before. Soil samples were collected from 0 -8 inch and 8 -16 inch depths of each plot in the summer of 2017 using a tractor -mounted Giddings hydraulic probe (Giddings Machine Company Inc., Windsor, CO) fitted with 1.77 -inch diame ter plastic liner tubes. From each sample, approximately 50 -g subsamples were air dried and sieved through a 0.16 -inch sieve for particulate organic matter (POM), while the remaining samples were air dried and gently ground to pass through a 0.08 -inch siev e for soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and potassium permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) analyses. Soil pH and EC were determined in 1:5 soil to water suspension and measured using electrodes. Soil bulk density was determ ined by core method and SOC content was determined in a LECO CHNS analyzer (LECO Corporation, St. Joseph, MI). Soil inorganic carbon content was removed by treating soils with a 6 mole L-1 HCl solution. The POM content was determined by a procedure outline d by sieving, and POXC content by potassium permanganate extraction. Soil inorganic N was determined by measuring nitrate (NO 3-) and ammonium (NH 4+) ions in an automated flow injection N analyzer (Timberline Instruments, LLC, Boulder, CO). The data were s tatistically analyzed using the PROC GLM procedure in the SAS (v 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for completely randomized experiments. All the comparisons were made at the significant probability level P<0.05 unless otherwise stated. Results Soil pH was si gnificantly lower at surface (pH = 6.7) than subsurface (pH = 7.8) depth, while it was not significantly different between land uses or land uses \u00d7 sampling depths interaction. Soil EC was not significantly different between land uses, sampling depths, and their interaction. Soil bulk density was significantly lower at surface than subsurface depth and did not differ among land uses (Table 1). The SOC content was significantly different between land uses, sampling depths, and land uses \u00d7 sampling depths i nteraction. Averaged across land uses, the SOC content was greater at surface 61 than subsurface depth. At surface depth, the SOC content was not significantly different between GNP and CCG. However, the grasslands stored approximately 36.9% more SOC than cro plands (CTGC, NTC, and STC). Within croplands, SOC content under CTGC was significantly greater than under STC, while the SOC under NTC was not significantly different from CTGC nor from STC. No differences in SOC content were observed among land uses at s ubsurface depth. Soil POM content also differed significantly between land uses, sampling depths, and land uses \u00d7 sampling depths interaction. Soil POM at the surface depth was approximately 11.4 ton/acre with the GNP system, which was significantly great er than all other land uses (Table 1). No differences in soil POM content were observed between the croplands at surface depth. Soil POM content in croplands was in between GNP and CCG as CCG had the lowest POM content. Soil POM content was not influenced by the land uses at the subsurface depth. Land uses, sampling depths, and land uses \u00d7 sampling depths interaction did not affect soil POXC content at any depth. Soil inorganic N content was significantly different between land uses, sampling depths, and land uses \u00d7 sampling depths interaction. Though the soil inorganic N content at surface was greatest under NTC, it was not significantly different from CTGC and STC (Table 1). Soil inorganic N content was significantly lower in grasslands than in croplands at surface depth, while it did not differ significantly between GNP and CCG and among land uses at subsurface depth. Summary Healthy soils are integral to the sustainable agriculture because they provide multiple ecological functions such as soil organic matter formation and stabilization, nutrient cycling, and environmental quality improvement. The CTGS that integrate livestock in cropping system maintained higher or at least equivalent amount of SOC suggesting that light grazing may improve SOC and soil health status in semiarid drylands.

Acharya2, and Apar GC2 1New Mexico State University, Dep t. of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Las Cruces, NM 2New Mexico State University, Dept . of Economics, Applied Statistics & Internati onal Business, Las Cruces, NM Objective To evaluate the feasibility of using cover crops as a means to enhance soil organic matter, rainwater absorption and retention capacity of the soil, weed suppression, crop yield, and thereby farm profitability. Materials and Methods We use experimental data from the Agriculture Science Center -Clovis, NM and estimated costs for different farming related activities, revenue generated from each system and risks associated with each practice. The experiment had eight treatments including seven different combinations of cover crops and a fallow treatment as a control. The cover crop treatments included a fallow (no cover crop), three sole cover crops (pea, oat, canola), and four cover crop mixtures [pea + oat (POM), pea + canola (PCM), pea + oat + canola (POCM), and six species mixtures (SSM) of pea + oat + canola + hairy vetch + forage radish + barley]. The experiment was designed using a randomized complete block design, with three replications and eight treatments. Th e economic analysis used data from last two crop years (2016 -2017). The data from the first year are used for establishing the baseline yield. The data from the second year are used for calculating the net returns by treatment. The analysis involved prepa ring an enterprise crop budget for each treatment to generate net returns and identify potential stochastic variables. We used experimental yield data and market prices for outputs and production inputs to set up the budgets and used @Risk software to simu late the results. We incorporate the indirect benefit of the cover crop by accounting for the reduced soil erosion (15 tons/acres*imputed price of $2/ton as indicated in the literature). Results The enterprise crop budgets for seven different cover crop t reatments are reported in Table 1 below. Although identical cultivation practices used for each treatment, the crop budget differ in terms of seed cost. The crop budgets include indirect benefits of reduced soil erosion. Moreover, the cover crop can also b e harvested or grazed over for a fee and generate additional revenue. However, it was terminated by using herbicide and does not yield revenue. The values reported in table 1 are on per acre basis. From table 1 we can see that the treatment with six specie s mixture of cover crops (SSM) has the highest cost, whereas canola is the least cost option. Cover crops also have an alternative use as livestock feed that adds revenue. Economically, SSM come out to be the prominent alternatives for the New Mexico farme rs. Highest probable mean return to risk for SSM is 422 dollars per acre. In statically and economic terms, those data sets which have the higher variations through observations are considered risky, canola being the opposite is the safest. 63 We used Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the potential benefits of using cover crop in Eastern New Mexico to enhance soil organic matter and farm profitability. The results from the Monte Carlo simulations show that a cover crop treatment that includes a mixture of si x crops (SSM) yields highest net return, while treatment with only canola provides a least profitable option. Whereas SSM (highest) and POCM are the preferred treatments in various risk attitudes, and Pea and Canola are less preferred. The SSM has also the highest expected income. These results have significant policy and investment implication for growers in the Clovis and surrounding area. In particular, cover crop in general yield higher returns because of its potential to reduce soil erosion (i.e., it h as an added value of $30/acre). Moreover, adoption of the most profitable cover crop (e.g. SSM) would further enhance farm profitability and help in reducing soil erosion. These results also indicate that further research is needed to identify other cover crop options that may yield additional benefits of adding nitrogen, weed control, enhanced water retention capacity particularly in arid regions where the incidence of wind erosion is high. Summary Cover crop selection affects farm profitability and risk s associated with it. While adoption of the most profitable cover crop (e.g. SSM) would further enhance farm profitability and help in reducing soil erosion, the most profitable cover cropping option is associated with highest risk. Canola as a cover crop appears to be least risky option. 64 Table 1 Crop budgets for seven cover crop treatments used in the study SSM POCM Canola Pea Oat POM PCM Primary Yield 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Primacy Price 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Secondary Income (erosion) 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 Gross return 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 Operating expenses Seed 22.3 17.33 9 25 18 21.5 17 Fertilizer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Chemicals 2.54 2.54 2.54 2.54 2.54 2.54 2.54 Crop insurance 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Other Inputs 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fuel, oil an d lubricants 3 2.9 2.7 2.7 2.7 2.8 2.8 Repairs 1.15 1.1 0.9 0.9 0.9 1 1 Custom Charges 4.05 4 3.8 3.8 3.8 3.9 3.9 Land Taxes 14.4 14.4 14.4 14.4 14.4 14.4 14.4 Other expenses 3.5 Total expenses 50.94 45.77 36.84 -19.6 -15.1 Fixed costs 5.53 Total costs 56.47 51.3 operating profits -27.9 -22.7 -13.6 -29.67 -22.6 -26.5 -22.0 Capital costs Interest on operating capital 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 Interest on equipment 2.09 2.09 2.09 2.09 2.09 2.09 2.09 Total ca pital costs 2.29 2.29 2.29 2.29 2.29 2.29 2.29 Return to land and risk -30.2 -25.0 -15.9 -31.96 -24.9 -28.8 -24.3 Budget Mexico State University, Extension Budget, by Hawkes et al. 65 Understanding Spatial Variability of Soil Health Indicators In A Forage Corn Production System Rajan O. Mesbah1,3 1New Mexico State University, Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Las Cruces, NM 2New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center, Clovis, NM 3New Mexico State University, Department of Entomology, Plant Pathology, and Weed Science, Las Cruces, NM Objective The main objective of the research was to evaluate the field -scale s patial variability of selected soil health indicators and assess the effects of cutting heights, row spacing, and cover crop treatments on these indicators. Materials and Methods This study was conducted at Heritage Dairy Farm (HDF) near Clovis, NM. Soil s in the study site are an Amarillo fine sandy loam. The study was conducted on a 60 -acre field under a half -circle of an irrigation pivot (Fig. 1). The study had five large plot treatments and four replications. The treatments included two (15 -inch and 30 -inch) corn row spacing, two corn silage cutting height [6-inch short stubble (SS) and 18 -inch tall stubble (TS)], and a cover crop [cereal rye and Austrian winter pea mixture] with narrow row spacing and short silage cutting height (15 -SS- CC). Spans 1 -3 had 15 -SS-CC treatment, while spans 4 and 6 had a narrow row spacing and spans 5 and 7 had a wide row spacing treatments (Fig. 1). The study was established in May 2017. Corn was planted at 53340 seeds ha-1 in the second week of May. The '9678VT3P' corn va riety was used in both years of the study. A liquid blended urea and ammonium nitrate fertilizer (32 -0-0) was pumped through the sprinkler at a rate of 4.85, 5.97, and 5.07 metric tons on June 16, 24, and July 27, 2017, respectively. The cereal rye and Aus trian winter pea cover crop mixture (70% rye+30% pea) was planted on October 23, 2017 and terminated on April 12, 2018 in the cover crop treatment. The study area was divided into 80 experimental units (grids) of approximately 0.3 ha area within each grid. Each treatment represented 16 -grids and sampling points within each grid was georeferenced with GaiaGPS for repeated measurement throughout the study. Soil samples were collected on May 17, 2017, October 2, 2017, and May 21, 2018 and they were stored in a 4\u00baC refrigerator after each sampling event prior to laboratory analysis, which was done within a week of sampling. Laboratory analysis included inorganic N, potentially mineralizable C (PMC), and potentially mineralizable N (PMN). Geostatistical analysis was done on the data using RStudio. Results Semi -variograms were created for all soil properties for BP 2017 and 2018 to illustrate and understand the spatial changes that took place within the one year growing season (Fig. 1). The amount of short -range spatial autocorrelation can be seen in all of the BP '18 semi - variograms; meaning there is a high amount of short -range spatial uncertainty in 2018 as 66 mg kg-1 mg kg-1 compared to 2017. Kriging results were initially interpolated through predictions, followed by the stand ard deviation of predictions for BP 2017 and 2018. Because spatial changes were being observed for one year, AH 2017 was not reported. For all measured soil properties (inorganic N, PMC) there were visual fluctuations of spatial autocorrelation through tim e. Inorganic N shows an increase in spatial continuity, while PMC show a decrease for the one year growing season (Fig. 1, 2). This is quantified in the range values for each semivariogram. Although the range values are high, the scale for some of the meas ured parameters has a very short range. Figure 1.

Summary Understanding how C and N dynamics in agroecosystems function is crucial in improving soil health and sustainable agroecosystems. Understanding how crop management effects the spatial variability and autocorrelation helps in selection of the best management practices for eastern New Mexico.

Puppala1 1New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center at Clovis, NM Objective To develop a variety that can yield high, produce 3 or more kernels per pods, resistant to diseas es, maintain red skin and taste of Valencia with high oleic chemistry. Material and Methods Field studies were conducted at Morton in Texas on a producers farms in 2018. The experimental trial was planted on May 10, 2018 under center pivot irrigation. So il type is an Amarillo -Acuff - Olton and elevation is 3760 feet. Individual plots consisted of two rows, 40 -inch rows with 1000 feet long. Individual plots were planted at a seed rate of 5 seeds/foot. Plots were planted with a John Deere Max Emerge plante r fitted with cone metering units. Total irrigation amount was 5.1 inch applied over the growing period. Precipitation received during the growing period was 17.0 inches. The plots were dug with a Pearman digger on September 25, 2018. The peanuts were le ft for a ten to dry and thrashed on October 5, 2018 with a Lilliston thrasher. Individual plot weights were recorded after drying the samples to 8% moisture. The plot yield was converted to pounds per acre and the results are reported in Table 1. Peanut q uality, as measured by Total Sound Mature Kernels (TSMK) was graded using 500 samples of pods. The details of the breeding lines and the cross details are provided in Table 1 along with the yield and grade. Results and Discussion The average yield that was recorded by the grower was 3300 lb/ac for half the center pivot area that was planted with peanuts. The variety that was grown was H&W -101. All the seven advance breeding materials performed better than the growers check variety H&W 101. The top three lines were CR -101 (5351 CR -55B lb/ac). The grade (TSMK) was highest for growers check variety H&W -101 and CR -101 (72%) followed by improved Valencia - C variety (71%). No major diseases were noticed during the growing se ason. We will be evaluating these material for three different diseases namely pod rot, Sclerotinia and Southern Stem rot in 2019 under sick plot conditions. Net return was highest for CR -101 ($ 963) and CR -27 ($ 957) breeding lines, an increase of $ 370 o ver the check variety. All these advanced breeding lines are high oleic and can help the processors in extending the shelf life by at least six months compared to the existing commercial varieties that are grown currently in eastern New Mexico and west Texas. 69 Table 1 .

Puppala1 and S. Sanogo2 1New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center at Clovis, NM 88101 Entomology, Plant Pathology and Weed Science, New Mexico S tate University, Las Cruces, NM 88101 Objective To evaluate commercially available organic seed treatment products. Materials and Methods The experimental trial was planted on July 1, 2018 in 40 -inch rows under center pivot irrigation. Soil type is an Amarillo -Acuff -Olton and elevation is 3760 feet. Individual plots consisted of two rows, 40 -inch rows with 12 feet long. There were four replications for each entry, planted in a random complete block. Individual plots were planted at a seed rate of 5 s eeds/foot. Plots were planted with a John Deere Max Emerge planter fitted with cone metering units. The details of the seed treatments are provided in Table 1 along with the application type (seed treatment or liquid) and rate of application. After plan ting pre -plant soil incorporated herbicide Prowl 3.3 EC @ 2.4 pt/ac was applied for the control of annual grasses and small seeded broadleaf weeds such as pigweed. About 100 pounds of nitrogen was applied in split application. The experimental plots receiv ed 60 pounds of nitrogen in April and another 40 pounds through irrigation water in mid -August (45 DAP). Irrigation amount was roughly 1.5 inches per week except at planting it received 3 inches of water. Total irrigation amount including precipitation r eceived during the growing season was 30 inches. Due to late planting peanuts were dug on October 27, 2018 and were thrashed the same day with a small plot thrasher. Individual plot weights were recorded after drying the samples to 8% moisture. The plot y ield was converted to pounds per acre and the results are reported in Table 2. Peanut quality, as measured by Total Sound Mature Kernels (TSMK) was graded using 500 grams of pods. Statistical Analysis All data were subjected to SAS\u00ae procedures for test o f significance difference between varieties. Mean separation procedures ((protected (P<0.05) least significant differences)) were used to determine where differences exist. Results and Discussion Peanut pod yield data along with TSMK for the 2018 seed tr eatment study are presented in Table 2. Average pod yield was higher for the chemical check Dynasty (3328 lb/ac) which was significantly not different from the organic Neem (2622 lb/ac). The average pod yield for the trial was 2669 lb./ac. By treating the Valencia peanut seeds with organic products a grower can benefit anywhere from $ 156 wi th Thyme Guard to $ 254 with Neem oil compared to the Untreated Check (1956 lb/ac). Estimated net result will give a true picture based on the cost of the product and the rate of application. We plan to repeat this study again in 2019 growing season. 71 Table 1.

Puppala1 and A. Scott1 1New Mexico State University, Agri cultural Science Center at Clovis, NM 88101 Objective To evaluate commercial cotton varieties suitable for eastern New Mexico. Materials and Methods The cotton variety trial was planted April 27, 2018 in 30 -inch rows under center pivot irrigation. Soil type is an Olton silty clay loam and elevation is 4,435 feet. Individual plots consisted of single, 30 -inch rows 30 feet long. There were four replications for each entry, planted in a random complete block. Individual plots were planted at a seed rate of 5 seeds/foot. Plots were planted with a John Deere Max Emerge planter fitted with cone metering units. On April 18, the planting area was treated with herbicide Prowl H2O @ 3.0 pt/ac as pre -plant application. After planting Roundup (60 Oz/ac), Brawl (12 Oz/ac) and Caparol (1.6 pt/ac) sprayed irrigated. Fertilizer applied was 28 -0-0-5 N:P:K + Sulphur at the rate of 30 gallons per acre. Growth regulators applied were, Prevathon 20 Oz/ac, Pix 24 Oz/ac, Prep @ 20 Oz/ac and Def 6 2 pt/ac. Total irrigation amount was 5.1 inch applied over the growing period. Precipitation received during the growing period was 17.0 inches. The plots were harvested on November 27, 2018 with a cotton stripper. Individual plot weights were recorded. For fiber quality each individual plot was hand harvested with 25 bolls randomly picked within a plot. The fiber samples were sent to Louisiana State University ginning lab after calculating the lint percent from 25 boll samples. Statistical Analysis All data were subje cted to SAS\u00ae procedures for test of significance difference between varieties. Mean separation procedures ((protected (P<0.05) least significant differences)) were used to determine where differences exist. Results and Discussion Yield data along with qu ality traits for the 2018 cotton trial are presented in Table 1, lint yield for the 16 varieties in the trial, ranged from 1343 to 1715 lb/ac with a trial average of 1402 lb/ac.

NM dairy owners employ approximately 1 employee/100 cows: predominantly hired, immigrant labor with limited experience in working in agriculture. Dairying is vastly becoming a highly technical, highly automated industry characterized by extended periods of very low margins. Highly skilled and technically proficient labor is an absolute must for optimal performance. However, limited educational opportunities exist for training and educating the next generation of owners, managers and employees to prepare and refine a skilled and able dairy workforce to continue to provide wholesome dairy products for New Mexico, the nation and the world, while sustainably managing animals, emplo yees and the environment. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE: Given the unlikelihood of re -establishing an on -campus dairy herd for training and education, NMSU Dairy Extension established in 2008 the U.S. Dairy Education and Training Consortium (USDETC) together with th e Univ. of Arizona and Texas A&M Univ. The USDETC, located in Clovis, NM utilizes Clovis Community College facilities and commercial dairy operations in the New Mexico and Texas border region to teach the next generation of dairy owners and managers durin g a 6 -week, hands -on, capstone summer class advanced dairy herd management (ANSC 468). Students are instructed by leading faculty in the nation. The program is an intensive combination of classroom instruction, laboratory training, on - farm practice and all ied industry input. Many of the students leave Clovis with internships and job opportunities in hand. Area dairy producers, center to the success of the program, fully recognize and support the unique value, freely allowing students access and insight to t heir operations. REACH: Reach of the program in 11 years: 498 students from 51 different universities. A survey of former students was conducted in 2017 to determine the impact of the consortium on their careers (62% response rate). Of the 213 respondents , 99 were currently still enrolled at a university, 111 were employed and 3 were not employed. Of the students enrolled at a university 37% were undergraduate students, 30% were working towards advanced degrees and 30% were obtaining a veterinary degree. O f those employed, 87 students had obtained a BS, while 11 completed their MS, 2 students were Ph.D.'s and 9 students had graduated with a DVM degree. Key finding: of the students who had entered the job market 34% had found employment on a dairy, 33% were employed in a dairy related position (allied industry), 5% were in a non -dairy livestock positon, 6% were in a non -dairy ag position and 21% were employed outside of agriculture. In short: 4 out of 5 former USDETC students are employed in agriculture, 2 ou t of 3 students are employed in the dairy industry, and 1 out of 3 students are working on, or managing a dairy. IMPACT: When asked \"What impact attending the consortium had on their current status\", 92% replied important, very important or extremely impo rtant. When asked about the impact the classes and experiential learning experiences had on their course work and subsequent careers, 44% replied extremely helpful, 35% very helpful and 15% helpful. When asked to rank the consortium classes as compared to other courses taken, 55% gave the consortium an A+ and 36% an A. When asked for comments, the hands -on experience and access to exceptional faculty were the student's 80 main responses. In short: the USDETC has proven to be a positive alternative, or compleme ntary education opportunity for students who do not or have limited access to dairy courses or the related experiential learning experiences at their home universities. NEXT: with the Dairy Consortium as a capstone dairy course, NMSU's College of Agricult ural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences in June of 2017 reinstated an undergraduate minor in Dairy Science. As the Dairy Consortium continues to grow opportunities for expansion are being considered to in addition to the open -lots of the Southwest, add l earning experiences in the barns of the Midwest and the free -stall operations of the West. All with the goal to provide the next generation of dairy owners and managers with excellent educational opportunities.

NM dairy owners employ approximately 1 employee/100 cows: predominantly hired, immigrant labor. A large majority of dairy employees have or had little or no experience working in agriculture or with large animals or large equipment. Agriculture , Forestry and Fishing AFF) ranks among the most dangerous industrial sectors with an incident rate of 5.7 non -fatal occupational injuries per 100 FTE's and a rate of 23.2 fatal work injuries per 100,000 FTE's (BLS). In addition, about one -fifth of fatalit ies in 2016 were to foreign -born workers and roughly two -thirds of fatal work injuries were foreign - born Latino or Hispanic workers. Effective training and education of both current and future dairy employees is imperative for both safety and performance. However, limited educational opportunities exist to train and certify a skilled and able dairy workforce. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE: Beginning in 2011 -12 with the development of two dairy safety awareness training DVD's in English and Spanish to accomplish multi ple goals: 1. being able to document employees are trained on dairy safety issues, 2. improve job performance through understanding the \"why\" of work - and safety -procedures and 3. to prevent safety incidents through heightened safety awareness. To date app roximately 6,000 copies have been distributed worldwide, and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) subsequently translated the DVD's into a number of other languages for placement of refugees on dairies. The remaining question: what is the training effe ctiveness of viewing a DVD? Delivery of training content became center in training effectiveness evaluation. In collaboration with Dr. David Douphrate, UT School of Public Health, San Antonio Campus, small interactive video/audio vignettes were created in Articulate 360 and subsequently loaded on an IPad for individualized training purposes (m -learning). REACH: As part of two DOL Susan Harwood projects a total of 2,090 dairy employees in 7 states on 60+ farms were trained using mobile technology on iPads. The large majority of trainees were foreign -born with the majority from Mexico (52.4%), and 27.4% from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. About 88% male and 12% female. Average age 34.4 +12.0. About 6% had not received any education, 28% had attended (som e) elementary school, 24% (some) middle school, 29% (some) high school, and 13% had received (some) higher education. As anticipated, reading comprehension was a challenge, making the video/audio delivery method critical. We realized soon that many of the Central American trainees didn't speak any English or Spanish, but communicated in a Mayan language (K'iche). Training effectiveness evaluation (Kirkpatrick Four - Level Training Evaluation) analysis suggests that participants rated the m -learning training favorably (level -1). Pre -test to post -test scores changed from a 74.2% to a 92.5% (level -2). Interview results at about 3 -6 months post -training (level -3) indicate workers were applying the knowledge gained from the training in their work activities, as wel l as reporting safety hazards when identified. Findings suggest the utilization of m -learning techniques is an effective means to deliver safety awareness training content to dairy workers in remote and challenging work environments. IMPACT: NMSU Dairy Ex tension has now provided safety awareness training to about one -third of the NM dairy workforce. We have added safe animal handling with live demonstration to our 82 training tools, training which is picking up traction. In 2016 as a result of a several highl y publicized dairy fatalities in the Northwest, Idaho Dairymen's Association (IDA) took the lead in adopting our program with significant processor and co -op support. We were asked to help recruit and prepare a dairy safety specialist for IDA. The person w as hired in July of 2017, and is currently providing safety awareness training for Idaho dairy producers. Recognizing we were missing about 1 out of 3 -4 workers due to language issues, we just completed full translation and voiceover of all video materials into K'iche, a menu option to be added to the iPad library. As part of the NMPF FARM - Workforce development effort we have been charged with the development of a Dairy Safety Manual, which is at the date of this writing (Feb 2019) is nearing completion. Sparked by consumer questions, National Milk Producers Federation representing the majority of the U.S. milk supply formed (Nov. 2017) a Dairy Safety Task Force looking at national adaptation and implementation of the program. Continued content developmen t: safe feeds and feeding (2018) , safe young stock handling, safe hospital care and safe maternity care are the next items on our list. In Feb. 2018 a 5 -yr. leadership development project was initiated, addressing the needs of frontline supervisors and mi ddle managers to learn more about managing people vs. managing cows. In two separate groups, approximate 50 middle managers have now completed the 13 -week training program of this project. NEXT: Another project to be initiated in March 2019 is geared to e valuate the understanding of dairy workers of TB as a zoonosis, with the goal to develop appropriate educational tools for dairy workers. TB has been a reoccurring issue in the NM -West TX dairy shed over the last decade or so and even though most of the DN A seems to trace back to Mexican feeder steers, there is the potential of transmission, a persistent health risk both for humans and cows.

Each year in the United State s, 2 million people are infected with antimicrobial resistant organisms resulting in 23,000 deaths and 70 billion dollars in medical costs. As resistance becomes more common, cost is expected to continue to rise in order to fight infections. To combat resi stance, the Obama administration generated The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria aimed at better surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, better diagnostic testing, and the development of new vaccines and antibiotics, among other things. Antimicrobial drug resistance is of great concern for both animal and human health. Using antimicrobials to treat illness is a key element used by veterinarians and physicians alike to combat bacterial diseases. The Food and Drug Administrat ion (FDA) is charged with evaluating both the effectiveness and safety of these compounds. During the process of approving new animal drugs, a slaughter withdrawal period is established for each drug. The slaughter withdrawal time is the number of days bet ween the last time an animal is treated and when the animal can be slaughtered for meat to go into the human food supply. To date, the slaughter withdrawal time has been based upon the duration of time when a drug is still in the animal tissue. There has b een little to no consideration as to what management practices might be needed to minimize the risk of antimicrobial drug resistance. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE: This research project is to evaluate whether a voluntary extended withdrawal time could potentially r educe the level of bacteria resistant to an antibiotic (the specific antibiotic used for this study will be ceftiofur) that are being shed at time of slaughter. The ultimate goal of the project is to identify viable management options for producers to redu ce the potential exposure of consumers to resistant bacteria and to develop strategies that result in voluntary adoption of those management options. Over all, the goal is to ensure cattle are released to slaughter with levels of antibiotic resistant microbial populations comparable to their resistance level before being given an antibiotic. A decision -making tool will subsequently be created and made availa ble for dairy farmers and veterinarians to use for the development of antimicrobial stewardship programs. Additionally, developing a stewardship protocol beneficial to farmers, ranchers, and veterinarians is important for food safety. REACH: Lab work and data analysis has been completed and manuscripts have been submitted for publication. Expectations are we will be able to present take -home messages to producers in the spring of 2019. FUNDING: USDA NIFA Funding through Texas A&M University. "}
