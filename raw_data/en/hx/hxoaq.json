How it generated unprecedented stress on natural environments; increased social disparity; and exposure of the poor and minorities to environmental risks and loss of homes, livelihoods, and cultural resources. Discussion of the rise of environmental justice movements and policies in the region as the world comes to grips with living in the Anthropocene.Global Health Studies courses.yale.edu/ Biological Environmental Influences on HealthPolitical Economy & Governance in HealthEnvironmental Law and Politics: Global ChallengesEVST 255, F&ES 255, GLBL 282, PLSC 215John WargoSOWe explore relations among food, environment, health, and law. We consider global-scale avoidable challenges such as: starvation and malnutrition, obesity, other food related human diseases, climate instability, soil loss, water depletion and contamination, microbial hazards, chemical contamination, food waste, dietary convergence, air pollution, energy, packaging, culinary globalization, and biodiversity loss. We focus on laws that influence the world's food system, including those intended to reduce or prevent environmental and health damages. Other laws protect rights of secrecy, property, speech, confidential business information, free trade, worker protection, equal opportunity, and freedom from discrimination. Ethical concerns of justice, equity, and transparency are prominent themes. Examples of effective law, consumer movements and corporate innovations provide optimism for the future of responsible food.Biological & Environmental Influences on HealthEpigeneticsMCDB 350, Jacob, Josien van epigenetic and the various mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, including histone modification, DNA methylation, nuclear organization, and regulation by non-coding RNAs.

Diseases of civilization and their relation to humans' evolutionary past; the evolution of human defense mechanisms; antibiotic resistance and virulence in pathogens; cancer as an evolutionary process. Students view course lectures on line; class time focuses on discussion of lecture topics and research papers.Prerequisite: BIOL 101-104. Biological & Environmental Influences on HealthUnderstanding & Interpreting Quantitative DataEvolution of the Human DietANTH 665Jessica Thompson This course examines human nutrition and subsistence behavior from an evolutionary perspective. It begins with human nutritional literature and discussions of our biological requirements, then moves into comparison of modern human dietary ecology with those of other primates, especially our closest living relatives, the great apes. We then turn to literature that demonstrates the methods and theoretical approaches that are currently used to reconstruct past diets. As we begin to follow the evidence for changes in subsistence in the hominin lineage, case studies using these methods are integrated into discussions of how we know what we do about past nutrition. The course spends time on key issues and debates such as changes from closed-habitat to open-habitat foraging, the origins of meat-eating, the role of extractive foraging in human social systems, variation in hunter-forager subsistence systems, the origins of domestication, and the phenomenon of fad diets in industrialized nations. The course is delivered in a seminar-style format, with key readings each week that follow topical themes, with assessment based on in-class participation, critical essays, and a final research project.Biological & Environmental Influences on HealthHuman Evolutionary Biology and Life HistoryANTH 242Claudia ValeggiaSC, SOThe range of human physiological adaptability across environments and ecologies. Effects of energetic constraints on growth, reproduction, and behavior within the context of evolution and life history theory, with special emphasis on traditional non-Western societies.Global Health and Human HealthEPS 261, EVST 261, F&ES 261Ruth BlakeSCStudy of the interrelationships between Earth materials and processes and personal and public health. The transposition from the environment of the chemical elements essential for life.After one year of college-level chemistry or with permission of instructor; EPS 110 recommended.Biological & Environmental Influences on HealthPhysiology for Public HealthCDE 502Catherine YeckelThe objective of this course is to build a comprehensive working knowledge base for each of the primary physiologic systems that respond to acute and chronic environmental stressors, as well as chronic disease states. The course follows the general framework: (1) examine the structural and functional characteristics of given physiological system; (2) explore how both structure and function (within and between physiological systems) work to promote health; (3) explore how necessary features of each system (or integrated systems) are points of vulnerability that can lead to dysfunction and disease. In addition, this course offers the opportunity to examine each physiological system with respect to influences key to public health interest, e.g., age, race/ethnicity, environmental exposures, chronic disease, microbial disease, and lifestyle, including the protection afforded by healthy lifestyle factors.Biological & Environmental Influences on HealthWater, Sanitation, and Global HealthEHS 537, EMD 537Ying Chen, Elsio WunderWater is essential for life, and yet unsafe water poses threats to human health globally, from the poorest to the wealthiest countries. More than two billion people around the world lack access to clean, safe drinking water, hygiene, and sanitation (WASH). This course focuses on the role of water in human health from a public health perspective. The course provides a broad overview of the important relationships between water quality, human health, and the global burden of waterborne diseases. It discusses the basics of water compartments and the health effects from exposures to pathogenic microbes and toxic chemicals in drinking water. It also covers different sanitation solutions to improve water quality and disease prevention and discusses future challenges and the need for intervention strategies in the new millennium. Health & SocietiesHistorical ApproachesGlobal Health EthicsHLTH 420, EP&E 346Cara Kiernan FallonSO, WRWhen a new virus sweeps the globe, how should physicians, governments, and societies respond? What are an individual's rights and responsibilities in the face of illness, and how do public health organizations prioritize competing claims? How should issues of consent, quarantine, compulsory treatment, and surveillance be managed, and how do these issues change as they transcend geographic borders? This seminar examines critical issues in global health through the method of ethical analysis. The course begins with the foundations for analyzing ethical problems, considering moral and ethical frameworks for health. We examine dilemmas such as quarantines, access to care, and the limits of autonomy, and we delve into critical challenges of vulnerable populations and global inequities. We conclude by analyzing emerging tensions posed by artificial intelligence and digital health technologies. Drawing together global health perspectives and ethical analysis, we consider the principles, tradeoffs, and central tensions that inform global health today.Global Health Studies ContextER7M 127, SOCY 127, EVST 127, WGSS 127Alka MenonSOPresent-day medicine and health care provide solutions to an ever-increasing array of human problems. Yet the achievement of health can be elusive. This course provides a broad introduction to the domains of health and illness in the U.S., with some coverage of international trends and topics. Students analyze how our personal health and public health are shaped by social structures, political struggles, expert knowledge, and medical markets. Topics include the cultural and social meanings associated with health and illness; inequalities in health and health care access and provision; controversies surrounding healthcare, medical knowledge production, and medical decision-making; and the social institutions of the health care industry.Health & SocietiesHistorical ApproachesHealth 436Miriam RichHU, WRThis course examines the U.S. history of incarceration through the lens of health and medicine, covering the late eighteenth century to the present. Across this period, incarcerated populations have been subject to extensive health risks and harms; since 1976, they also comprise the only group in the U.S. with a recognized constitutional right to health care. In this seminar, we explore how medical practices and institutions have been involved in establishing, structuring, and challenging historical systems of incarceration. In the modern United States, incarceration has played a major role in the formation of racial disparities, the regulation and surveillance of marginalized communities, and the delineation of the state's relationship to its subjects. Within this history, health and medicine have been central to debates over the harms of the prison system, the extent of institutional authority over vulnerable bodies, and the state's obligations to provide care.Health & 150J, HSHM 406Sakena AbedinHU, WRExploration of the institutions, movements, and policies that have attempted to provide healthcare for the urban poor in America from the late nineteenth century to the present, with emphasis on the ideas (about health, cities, neighborhoods, poverty, race, gender, difference, etc) that shaped them. Topics include hospitals, health centers, public health programs, the medical civil rights movement, the women's health movement, and national healthcare policies such as Medicare and Medicaid. Health & SocietiesInequality in America ANTH 366Kathryn DudleySOSociocultural dimensions of social inequality in the contemporary United States. Ways in which the socioeconomic processes that produce inequality are inextricably embedded in worlds of cultural meaning; how those meanings are constructed and embodied in everyday practice. Perspectives from anthropology, sociology, economics, history, and popular media.Health & SocietiesPsychology of Prejudice, Stereotyping, and DiscriminationPSYC 429 Jennifer Richeson Examination of the social psychology of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.

Study of the patterns of educational and labor market outcomes, incarceration, and family formation of whites, blacks (African Americans), Hispanics, and Asian Americans in the United States, as well as immigration patterns and how they affect race and ethnic relations.Global Health Studies and Health EquityEPH 507Dayna KeeneThis course outlines the social and structural determinants related to health inequities in the United States and globally. Conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical approaches to understanding social justice and health equity are explored, with a focus on health determinants including health care, social class, poverty, oppression and power, stigma and discrimination, and neighborhood and social factors. The course takes a multidisciplinary approach, integrating methods and research from epidemiology, social sciences, and medicine to explore the individual, interpersonal, community, and societal influences that lead to healthy and unhealthy outcomes.Health & SocietiesHistorical MeyerowitzHU, WRStudy of the programs and policies that aimed to end global poverty from 1960 to the present, from modernization to microcredit to universal basic income. Topics include the green revolution, population control, the \"women in development\" movement, and the New International Economic Order. Extensive work with primary sources. May count toward geographical distributional credit within the History major for any region studied, upon application to the director of undergraduate studies. Health & SocietiesWriting Seminars: Magic, Shamanism, & MedicineENGL 114Larissa TsukamotoWRWhy are some healing practices seen as more legitimate than others? Has modern science really changed the way we look at healing? Is there a place today for so-called alternative medicine, like acupuncture? This course will explore the theory and history of diverse modalities of non-allopathic (non-mainstream) healing across time and space: from Medieval magic and amulets to Reiki and New Age crystals; Abbasid therapeutic music to modern music therapy; Traditional Chinese Medicine to Western herbalism; and Shamanism to neuroscience. Readings will draw from accounts by patients and their families, manuals and memoirs by care providers, and scientific studies. Throughout this course, we will explore the intersection of spirituality, science, and medicine. What contributions did non-European cultures have on Western medicine? What are the arguments of the proponents and skeptics of traditional healing practices? Together we will question assumptions about the users and practitioners of Western and complementary medicine.Historical ApproachesPolitical Economy & Governance in HealthAfrica, Politics, AnthropologyANTH 439Louisa LombardSOHistorical-anthropological study of politics in Africa since the early nineteenth century. The creation and operation of African states; the negotiation of legitimacy, authority, and belonging by state agents and the people they govern; anthropological theories about the workings of African politics, including the involvement of both state and nonstate actors.Historical ApproachesAfrican Independence: A Cup of Plenty or a Poisoned Chalice?HIST 344Benedito Machava HUIn every African colony after World War Two there emerged nationalist movements which no longer called for civil rights as in the pre-war years but demanded self-determination. While many of them got it easy, some had to fight long and bloody wars for it. By the 1960s the colonial edifice had crumbled except for the few settler colonies in southern Africa. But even here the winds of change could not be stopped. But what did decolonization and independence mean to Africa? Did Africans get what they wanted? Was independence a cup of plenty or a poisoned chalice? In addressing these questions, this course charts the economic, political, and cultural transformations of postcolonial Africa from the 1960s to the present. The argument is this: there can be no understanding of Africa's challenges today without an inquiry into the nature of what the continent got from the departing colonial powers.Global Health Studies TannenbaumHU, WRThis course considers the ways childbirth has been conducted in the United states over three centuries. Topics include the connections between childbirth and historical constructions of gender, race, and motherhood, as well as changes in the medical understanding and management of childbirth.Historical ApproachesHealth & SocietiesCultures of Western MedicineHIST 244, HSHM 321John WarnerHU, WRA survey of Western medicine and its global encounters, encompassing medical theory, practice, institutions, and healers from antiquity to the present. Changing concepts of health, disease, and the body in Europe and America explored in their social, cultural, economic, scientific, technological, and ethical contexts.Historical ApproachesHealth & SocietiesEpidemics and the Early Modern BodyHIST 924, HSHM 768Paola BertucciEpidemics in the history of the early modern world. Focusing on individual epidemics that contributed to shaping the early modern world, students discuss conceptions of the body and racist stereotyping, spaces and strategies of containment, visual and material culture of disease and treatment, and the relationship between public health and the early modern state.Historical ApproachesHistorical Perspectives on Global HealthHIST 146, HSHM 280Joanna RadinHUIn the 21st century \"global health\" is recognized as an influential framework for orienting action among a huge range of groups including public health workers, activists, philanthropists, economists, political leaders, and students. How did this come to pass? This survey class introduces you to the historical circumstances that have contributed to the contemporary landscape of global health. We travel through several centuries to examine how ideas about disease, colonialism, race, gender, science, diplomacy, security, economy, and humanitarianism have shaped and been shaped by attempts to negotiate problems of health that transcend geopolitical borders.Historical ApproachesHistories of Confinement: From Atlantic Slavery HIST 417, AFST 220Nana Osei QuarshieHUThis course looks closely at the history of asylums, hospitals, prisons, and schools. It seeks to understand their workings and the interplay between bureaucratic forms, spatial and material organization, and modes of discipline, control, and remediation. It asks, how is institutional power organized, displayed, deployed, and disputed, and what are the limits and contradictions inherent in these efforts? Our readings draw from a range of contexts and disciplines to consider the relationship between the built environment and institutional life.Historical ApproachesPlague in Early Modern EuropeHIST 239JPeter SahlinsHU, WRThis course studies the appearance and regular reappearance of plague from the fourteenth to the eighteenth century in Europe. Beyond a basic understanding of the debates over plague's epidemiology and transmission, we develop a multidisciplinary interpretation of the religious, medical, political, and cultural responses to and effects of the plague using a variety of different primary sources. Our concerns are two-fold: to understand daily life in times of plague; and to study plague as an agent of change and its contributions to the making of the modern world.Global Health Studies SocietiesProblems in the History of Medicine and Public HealthAMST 877, HSHM 703, HIST 926John WarnerAn examination of the variety of approaches to the social, cultural, and intellectual history of medicine, focusing on the United States. Reading and discussion of the recent scholarly literature on medical cultures, public health, and illness experiences from the early national period through the present. Topics include the role of gender, class, ethnicity, race, religion, and region in the experience of health care and sickness and in the construction of medical knowledge; the interplay between vernacular and professional understandings of the body; the role of the marketplace in shaping professional identities and patient expectations; health activism and social justice; citizenship, nationalism, and imperialism; and the visual cultures of medicine.Performance Representation & HealthChallenges to Realism 378Stephanie NewellHU, WRIntroduction to experimental African novels that challenge realist and documentary modes of representation. Topics include mythology, gender subversion, politics, the city, migration, and the self. Ways of reading African and postcolonial literature through the lenses of identity, history, and nation. Formerly ENGL 449.Performance Representation & InhornSOThe race, class, gender, and other axes of \"difference\" and their effects on women's health, primarily in the contemporary United States. Recent feminist approaches to intersectionality and multiplicity of oppressions theory. Ways in which anthropologists studying women's health issues have contributed to social and feminist theory at the intersections of race, class, and gender.Performance Representation & HealthLiterature Seminars: Pandemic LiteratureENGL 115Ryan WeplerHU, WRNarratives about mass illness and death challenge us to face truths that, until recently, had been obscured by the order of everyday life: they force us to confront the nature of existence when disaster has subverted norms and shattered the social order; they explore possibilities for creation and adaptation in a world freed from the constraints of materialism and conventional thinking; and they provoke us to make sense of not just our own death, but the death of our society\u2014thereby challenging the adage \"you die alone.\" In this course, we'll encounter plagues of sickness, sleep, blindness, and death\u2014events that double as outbreaks of tyranny, generosity, violence, and beauty. We'll consider the relationships between suffering and self-knowledge; destruction and imagination; terror and freedom\u2014all while seeking to understand how reading literature can help us make sense of the present. Preregistration required; see under English Department.Performance Representation & HealthHealth 390Rene AlmelingSO, WRReproduction as a process that is simultaneously biological and social, involving male and female bodies, family formation, and powerful social institutions such as medicine, law, and the marketplace. Sociological research on reproductive topics such as pregnancy, birth, abortion, contraception, infertility, reproductive technology, and aging. Core sociological concepts used to examine how the politics of reproduction are shaped by the intersecting inequalities of gender, race, class, and sexuality.Global Health SBS 585Ali MillerThis course explores the application of human rights perspectives and practices to issues in regard to sexuality and health. Through reading, interactive discussion, paper presentation, and occasional outside speakers, students learn the tools and implications of applying rights and law to a range of sexuality and health-related topics. The overall goal is twofold: to engage students in the world of global sexual health and rights policy making as a field of social justice and public health action; and to introduce them to conceptual tools that can inform advocacy and policy formation and evaluation. Class participation, short reaction papers, and a final paper are required. Performance Representation & HealthWe Interrupt this Program: The Multidimensional Histories of Queer and Trans PoliticsAFAM 115, WGSS 125Roderick FergusonHUIn 1991, the arts organizations Visual AIDS and The Kitchen collaborated with video artist and filmmaker Charles Atlas to produce the live television broadcast \"We Interrupt this Program.\" Part educational presentation, part performance piece, the show was aired in millions of homes across the nation. The program, in The Kitchen's words, \"sought to feature voices that had often been marginalized within many discussions of AIDS, in particular people of color and women.\"This course builds upon and is inspired by this aspect of Atlas's visionary presentation, an aspect that used the show to produce a critically multicultural platform that could activate cultural histories and critical traditions from various communities. In effect, the course uses this aspect as a metonym for the racial, gender, sexual, and class heterogeneity of queer art and organizing. It conducts its investigation by looking at a variety of primary materials that illustrate the heterogeneous makeup of queer and trans politics. The course also draws on more recent texts and visual works that arose from the earlier contexts that the primary texts helped to illuminate and shape.Performance Representation & HealthHistorical ApproachesWriting Seminars: Narrative and MedicineENGL 114Matthew MorrisonWRIn this Writing Seminar, we will focus on writing well-reasoned analyses and essays, with emphasis on the importance of reading, research, and revision. We will read major authors and texts that define the modern medical humanities, with primary works by Mikhail Bulgakov, Henry Marsh, Atul Gawande, and Lisa Sanders. Other topics will include the philosophy of science (with a focus on Karl Popper), rationalism and romanticism (William James), and epistemology and scientism (Wittgenstein). Preregistration required; see under English Department.Political HealthAfrica in International RelationsAFT 175, PLSC 175David SimonSOThis courses examines key facets of how African countries interact with the rest of the world, and with other countries on the continent. Focusing mostly on Sub-Saharan African countries, it looks at international economic relations (focusing on aid but also addressing trade, investment, and debt); peacemaking and peacebuilding; and regional governance institutions.Political Economy & Governance in HealthBioethics, Politics, and EconomicsPLSC 313, EP&E 380Stephen LathamSOEthical, political, and economic aspects of a number of contemporary issues in biomedical ethics. Topics include abortion, assisted reproduction, end-of-life care, research on human subjects, and stem cell research.Global Health Studies courses.yale.edu/ Political in HealthData Governance in the Digital AgeGLBL 395Nathaniel RaymondSOThe information revolution is causing the rapid mass adoption of information communication technologies (ICTs) across nations, demographics, and sectors in the early 21st Century-such as mobile devices, social media platforms, \"big data,\" artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning, geospatial mapping applications, and the Internet of Things (IoT). However, 20th Century international data governance policies, normative frameworks, and domestic regulations are struggling to keep pace with the disruptive impacts ICTs are having on an increasingly digitally networked world. This seminar explores critical issues, trends, and events relevant to both the adaption of existing data governance regimes to meet these challenges and the creation of new regimes by international organizations, the private sector, civil society, and national governments. The primary learning goal of the course is to equip students with the skills to critically read and apply extant international data governance policies in concrete sector-specific contexts (i.e. corporate, governmental, humanitarian, development, etc.). Additionally, students learn to identify gaps in current regimes and to be literate in the major ongoing debates on these issues at the United Nations, the EU, the United States Congress, and other critical loci of policy development.Political Economy & Governance in HealthBiological & Environmental Influences on and SustainabilityEVST 212, PLSC 212, EP&E 390Michael FotosSO, WRDemocracy, liberty, and the sustainable use of natural resources. Concepts include institutional analysis, democratic consent, property rights, market failure, and common pool resources. Topics of policy substance are related to human use of the environment and to U.S. and global political institutions. Political Economy & Governance in HealthFood and Drug Administration LawHPM 595Aaron KesselheimThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the premier consumer protection agency in the United States, with control over the availability and public discourse about potentially lifesaving therapeutics, foods, supplements, and related consumer products. Its authority has been built in response to public health crises and is constantly under scrutiny from all sides of the political spectrum. The class reviews the history of the FDA's regulation over the health care products market, the noteworthy legislation that has shaped its oversight in this area, Supreme Court and other cases that have impacted its authority, and an introduction to key current controversies related to the FDA that affect health care delivery. (This course does not cover food law.) The enduring theme is how the FDA balances its vital public safety role against countervailing forces of personal autonomy and the rights or interests of consumers, patients, physicians, and corporations. Each class is organized around interactive discussion introducing students to the material, including hypothetical cases that require students to apply the day's lessons and themes in determining legal and policy solutions. Political Economy & Governance in HealthHealth Economics and Public PolicyECON 170Howard FormanSOApplication of economic principles to the study of the U.S. health care system.

Emphasis on the role of politics. Political Economy & Governance in HealthHealth & SocietiesPolitics of Global HealthGLBL 366Vanessa KerrySOInterest in and attention to global health has expanded considerably in recent years. Public and private sector investments in solving global health challenges are increasing. Many of the challenges to solving global health problems though are not only in the resources required to close existing gaps. Politics, policy and power are dominant in the global health sphere. Understanding these dynamics is essential to helping to tackle the world's greatest global health challenges. This course examines the intricate and diverse politics of global health and how they shape our inclination, ability, and direction of response to global health challenges. We explore the historical and current day power dynamics affecting health burdens, and which actually have effects on the health system's ability to care for a population. We explore the principle actors in the global health space, and how they are governed. Discussions also consider how health intersects with economics, national security, the law and regulation, climate change and conflict. Finally we explore the power dynamics within \"ourselves\" and how health is valued on a personal level through examination of specific countries health systems; we explore how countries have embraced health as a right (or not) and designed their health systems to care for their complete populations (or not).Political Economy & Governance in HealthHealth & SocietiesPoverty and Social Welfare Policy in the United StatesSOCY 341Rourke O'BrienFormation and effectiveness of anti-poverty policies from a sociological and public policy perspective. Consideration of who is poor and who deserves federal assistance. Topics include: origins of the modern social safety net; the federal government's role in constructing and implementing anti-poverty policy; realities of work; the \"culture of poverty;\" and employment- and family-based policy strategies for alleviating poverty. Applied understanding of quantitative social science research methods is helpful, but not required. Political Economy & Governance in HealthPublic Health LawHPM 588Shelley GeballeThis course focuses on the law as it impacts the health of populations, focusing on the legal powers and duties of federal, state, and local governments to equitably promote and protect the health of their communities, as well as the constitutional constraints on those powers to protect individual rights. It is a course designed specifically for students with no legal training, introducing students to the multiple ways the law acts as a structural and social determinant of health and health inequities as well as how the law can be used as a tool to promote health in individuals and health justice among populations. Tools examined include the use of direct and indirect regulation to alter the information and built environments, control communicable disease, and reduce chronic disease and injury; governments' \"power of the purse\"\u2014to tax and spend\u2014to fund public health programs and services, and influence individual and corporate behavior; and the role of the courts in interpreting law and resolving disputes among branches and levels of government as well as among individuals, businesses, and government.
