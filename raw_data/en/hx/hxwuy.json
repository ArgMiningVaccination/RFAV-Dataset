Th is amendment is effective January 1 8, 2017, and will operate until the demonstra tion expiration date of September 30, 2021. Through this amendment and managed care contractual changes , the state will implement the Targeted Investments Program , to support physical and behavioral health care integration and coordination for beneficiaries with behavioral health needs enrolled in AHCCCS including beneficiaries who have transition ed to the community from criminal justice facilities . Through a subsequent state plan amendment, the state will also implement American Indian medical homes , supporting the integration and coordination of care for American Indian AHCCCS enrollees in the American Indian Health Program (AIHP). Through the Targeted Investments Program, t he state will direct its managed care plans to make specific payments to certain pr oviders pursuant to 42 CFR 438.6(c), with such payments incorporated into the actuarially sound capitation rates, to incentivize providers to improve performance. The Targeted Investments Program will : Reduc e fragmentation between acute care and behavi oral health care, Increas e efficiencies in service delivery for members with behavioral health needs, and Improv e health outcomes for the affected populations . To further support the state's targeted investment and to promote new expenditures that will result in more effective and efficient use of federal funds , CMS has approved time -limited expenditure authority for Designated State Health Programs (DSHP) . This one -time investment of DSHP funding will be phased down over the demonstration period. T he additional funds will provide a short term federal investment, such that by the end of the demonstration, the care coordination will be supported through ongoing payment arrangements without the nee d for Page 2 - Mr. Thomas Betlach demonstration authority. We can continue to provide technical assistance to assist the state in converting provider payments to alternative payment model arrangements that focus on improving quality and cost of care.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT Until 1982, Arizona was the only state that did not have a Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act. In October 1982, Arizona implemented the AHCCCS in the state's first section 1115 demonstration project. AHCCCS initially covered only acute care services, however, by 1989, the program was expanded to include the Arizona Long Term Care System (ALTCS), the state's capitated long term care (LTC) program for the elderly and physically disabled (EPD) and the developmentally disabled (DD) populations. In 2000, the state also expanded coverage to adults without dependent children wit h family income up to and including 100 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) as well as established the Medical Expense Deduction (MED) program for adults with income in excess of 100 percent of the FPL who have qualifying healthcare costs that reduce their income at or below 40 percent of the FPL. On March 31, 2011, Arizona requested to eliminate the MED program and implement an enrollment freeze on the adults without dependent children population. On April 30, 2011, and July 1, 2011, CMS approved the state's required phase- out plans for the MED program and the adults without dependent children population, respectively. The demonstration provides health care services through a prepaid, capitated managed care delivery model that operates statewide for both Medicaid state plan groups as well as demonstration expansion groups. The goal of the demonstration is to test health care delivery systems to provide organized and coordinated health care for both acute and long term care that include pre -establishe d provider networks and payment arrangements, administrative and clinical systems for utilization review, quality improvement, patient and provider services, and management of health services. The demonstration will also test the extent to which health out comes in the overall population are improved by expanding coverage to additional needy groups. The demonstration affects coverage for certain specified mandatory state plan eligibles by requiring enrollment in coordinated, cost effective, health care deli very systems. In this way, the demonstration will test the use of managed care entities to provide cost effective care coordination, including the effect of integrating behavioral and physical health services for individuals with serious mental illness and children participating in the Children's Rehabilitative Services program. In addition, the demonstration will provide for payments to IHS and tribal 638 facilities to address the fiscal burden for certain services not covered under the state plan and provided in or by such facilities. This authority will enable the state to evaluate how this approach impacts the financial viability of IHS and 638 facilities and ensures the continued availability of a robust health care delivery network for current and future Medicaid beneficiaries. As part of the extension of the demonstration in 2016, based on CMS clarifying its policy for claiming 100 percent federal matching for services received through IHS and 638 facilities , the state can transition from the curren t uncompensated care reimbursement methodology to service -based claiming. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 11 Amended: January 18, 2017 As part of the extension of the demonstration on October 1, 2016, beginning January 1, 2017 the state will implement its AHCCCS Choice Accountability Responsibility Engagement (CARE) program. Beneficiaries in the new adult group with incomes above 100 percent of the FPL are required to participate in AHCCCS CARE and will be required to make monthly contributions into AHCCCS CARE accounts. AHCCCS CARE will also provide certain incentives for timely payment of these monthly contributions and completion of \"healthy targets\" under the state's Healthy Arizona program that will also be implemented with AHCCCS CARE. On January 18, 2017, an amendment was approved which established the \"Targeted Investment s Program .\" The state will direct its managed care plans to make specific payments to certain providers pursuant to 42 CFR 438.6(c), with such payments incorporated into the actuarially sound capitation rates , to incentivize provide rs to improve performance . Specifically, providers will be paid incentive payments for i ncreas ing physical and behavioral health care integration and coordination for individuals with behavioral health needs . The Targeted Investments Program will: Reduce fragmentation that occurs between acute care and behavioral health care, Increase efficiencies in service delivery for members with behavioral health needs, and Improve health outcomes for the affected populations. III. GENERAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS 1. Compliance with Federal Non -Discrimination Statutes. The state must comply with all applicable Federal statutes relating to non -discrimination.

AACP Arizona State Plan *Arizona's 1115 demonstration provides the authority to waive some of the provisions. V. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS 18. Arizona Acute Care Program (AACP) . AACP enrollees receive most Medicaid - covered services through the Health Plans, but receive, on a \"carve out\" basis, behavioral health services through a separate MCO contr act. The one exception to the behavioral health carve out is for AACP members with a Serious Mental Illness Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 19 Amended: January 18, 2017 (SMI) who receive their acute care and behavioral health services through a geographically designated Regional Behavioral Health Authority (RBHA) and AHCCCS contracted MCO . In addition, AACP members with a CRS condition receive all of their care - acute care and treatment for CRS and behavioral health care conditions - through a separate MCO contract. a) Enrollment . The Arizona DES processes applications and determines acute care Medicaid eligibility for children, pregnant women, families and non- disabled adults under the age of 65 years. The Social Security Administration (SSA) determines eligibility for the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) cash -related groups, and AHCCCS determines eligibility for the SSI - related aged and disabled groups, Medicare Savings Programs, women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer, and Freedom to Work recipients. Individuals determi ned eligible must then select and enroll in a Health Plan, or they will be auto- assigned by the AHCCCS administration. b) Benefits . With the exception of the new adult group, benefits for AACP and the expansion population authorized by the 1115 demonstration will consist of all acute care benefits covered under the Medicaid state plan, unless otherwise noted within these STCs. The new adult group will receive benefits for AACP through the state's approved alternative benefit plan (ABP) state plan amendment (SPA). i. Notice. The state must include the CMS Central Office when submitting a SPA to the CMS Regional Office that would impact the expansion population authorized by the 1115 demonstration inclusive of: a. The proposed date of implementation; b. The date the state plans to submit the SPA; and c. Revised budget neutrality projections. ii. Demonstration Amendment. CMS reserves the right to require the state to submit an amendment if it is determined that it is warranted. iii. Behavioral health services are outlined in Tabl e 2 and subject to limitations set forth in the existing state plan.

The AHCCCS CARE Program . The AHCCCS CARE program is designed to engage Arizona's new adult group expansion population with income over 100 percent FPL (hereinafter \"Expansion Adults\") to prepare adults for successful transition to Marketplace or other coverage. AHCCCS CARE is als o designed to build health literacy by promoting incentives around achieving identified health targets. The AHCCCS CARE program is comprised of: an AHCCCS CARE Account (the \"Account\"), meeting a Healthy Arizona Target. The AHCCCS CARE program will be adm inistered by a third party AHCCCS contractor (\"Vendor\") upon completion and award of a Request for Proposal by the state. 20. Participation in AHCCCS CARE . a) Mandatory Participation . Expansion Adults - beneficiaries enrolled in the new adult group with incom es that exceed 100 percent of the FPL - are required to participate in AHCCCS CARE (hereinafter \"AHCCCS CARE member(s)\"). The following Expansion Adults are exempted from AHCCCS CARE participation: i. Persons with serious mental illness ; ii. American Indian/Alas ka Natives ; and iii. Persons considered \"medically frail\" as described in Attachment G . b) Hardship Exemptions . AHCCCS CARE members may be exempted from the program requirements for a period of one month if the member meets one of the following hardship exemption criteria during the prior month: i. A member of the household dies . ii. The income group has one or more of the following expenses which exceed 10 percent of the countable gross income of the income group: a. Medically necessary expenses for any member of the household that Medicaid or health insurance coverage did not pay for. Medically necessary means a covered service provided by a Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 21 Amended: January 18, 2017 physician or other licensed practitioner to prevent disease, disability, or o ther adverse health conditions or their progression or prolong life; b. Health insurance premiums for any member of the household; c. Unexpected expenses for repairs to the home. Repairs include items such as fixing a leaky roof, replacing a non- working air conditioner, repairing plumbing, etc. Repairs do not include remodeling or redecorating; or d. Expenses for repairs to an income group member's transportation so the individual can get to work. This does not include routine maintenance, such as tune- ups, oil cha nges, etc. iii. Reporting of a hardship exemption should be made by the AHCCCS CARE member directly to the Vendor. AHCCCS CARE members will be provided notice that will explain these hardship exemptions and give instructions for how to request an exemption. iv. AHCCCS CARE members may seek a hardship exemption at any time. The member must provide supporting documentation of the permitted hardship, but there are no limits to the number or duration of hardship exemptions a member may receive during the course of the year. c) Voluntary Participation. Nothing in this demonstration shall preclude the state from permitting a ll Expansion Adults exempted from AHCCCS CARE participation as outlined above as well as new adult group members at or below 100 percent of the FPL to choose to opt in to the AHCCCS CARE program. Opting in allows the member to open and maintain an AHCCCS CARE Account that will be funded by a third party, such as a charitable organization. In addition, members otherwise exempted from AHCCCS CARE m ay opt in and contribute their own funds. Such contributions would be voluntary with amounts and timing of contribution all at the discretion of the member. None of the other program requirements will apply. Accordingly, members who opt in will not be: i. Required to pay premiums or Strategic Coinsurance based on Medicaid enrollment ; ii. Disenrolled for failure to pay into the AHCCCS CARE Account; or iii. Required to participate in the Healthy Arizona or AHCCCS Works program. 21. Beneficiary Contributions. AHCCCS CARE members must make two types of payments that in total shall not exceed 5 percent of household income, calculated quarterly: strategic coinsurance and premium payments. a) Strategic Coinsurance. Strategic coinsurance will be applied retrospectively, rather than at the point of service. The strategic coinsurance payments are limited and targeted to support the medical home concept and steer members to the most appropriate care settings and types. Strategic coinsurance will not exceed 3 percent of household income and will be used to offset program costs. AHCCCS CARE members are responsible for making the following coinsurance payments: Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 22 Amended: January 18, 2017 i. $4.00 for opioids prescriptions or refills . This coinsurance requirement is part of a broader state e ffort to address the opioid epidemic. The only exceptions to this coinsurance requirement are for AHCCCS CARE members with a cancer diagnosis or terminal illness such that they have qualified for hospice care , or if the beneficiary's physician requests an exemption with supporting documentation as to medical necessity for the opioid prescription. ii. $8.00 for non -emergency use of the emergency room . This strategic coinsurance requirement is designed to help steer members to lower levels of care that are more appropriate in non- emergency situations. The coinsurance requirement will be paid for the following ED visits: Level 1 Emergency Department Code 99281; and Level 2 Emergency Department Code 99282. The state will ensure that hospitals: a. Conduct an appr opriate medical screening under 42 CFR 489.24 subpart G to determine that the individual does not need emergency services; b. Inform the individual of the amount of his or her coinsurance obligation for non- emergency services provided in the emergency departm ent; c. Provide the individual with the name and location of an available and accessible alternative non -emergency services provider; d. Determine that the alternative provider can provide services to the individual in a timely manner with the imposition of a le sser cost sharing amount or no cost sharing if the individual is otherwise exempt from cost sharing; and e. Provide a referral and coordinate scheduling for treatment by the alternative provider. iii. $5 or $10 Specialist Services without a PCP Referral. Because the state is emphasizing the medical home model as part of its managed care system, AHCCCS CARE members will pay a per visit coinsurance payment of $5 for a specialist office visit (when AHCCCS pays $50- $99.99) or $10 (when AHCCCS pays $100 or mor e) if there is no referral from their primary care physician (PCP) for that specialist visit. iv. $4.00 Brand Name Drugs when Generic Available. The brand name coinsurance payment will not apply if the physician determines that the generic drug is not as effective as the brand name drug. b) Calculation of Retrospective Strategic Coinsurance. AHCCCS CARE members will be responsible for coinsurance liability for the services outlined in (i) through (iv) of paragraph 21 based upon the most recent six months of uti lization for which data is complete of the identified services used by the member. The utilization review will occur quarterly; accordingly the AHCCCS CARE member will have a coinsurance liability for a three month period. The amount owed for the quarter will be divided into three monthly payments. The amount owed for the quarter or for any month within that quarter shall not exceed 3 percent of household income. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 23 Amended: January 18, 2017 c) AHCCCS CARE Account Contributions or Premium Payments. AHCCCS CARE members will make a monthly premium payment that will serve as their AHCCCS CARE Account contribution. The payment is set at the lesser of 2 percent of household income or $25. AHCCCS CARE members will make these payments to a Vendor, who will credit the amount of the payment t o the beneficiary's established AHCCCS CARE Account . . The AHCCCS CARE member will still access the full array of covered benefits as outlines in the state plan and 1115 demonstration. d) AHCCCS CARE Member Invoices Payments. AHCCCS CARE members will be sent a quarterly invoice by the state's Vendor that includes the following: i. Amount owed for strategic coinsurance for each month within that quarter that specified the basis for each included coinsurance charge, by the service for which the state charge applies, and explains to the member that the payment is connected to the services already received; ii. Identifies the method by which the individual may dispute incorrect charges; iii. Amount owed for premiums for each month within that quarter; iv. Member's 5 percent threshold articulated in a dollar amount; v. Account balance; vi. Outstanding or past due liabilities. e) AHCCCS CARE Payments. AHCCCS CARE members make their payments directly to the Vendor. The amount of any payment including the premium, or strategic coinsurance will be credited on the CMS -64 against program expenditures claimed by the state for federal matching . No strategic coinsurance payments ar e made to health care providers; such payments also do not effect enrollment. Premi um payments made by the AHCCCS CARE member are credited to the member's AHCCCS CARE Account that is recorded with the Vendor . (See Attachment G for example calculations of AHCCCS CARE payments.) f) Grace Period/Payment Period . AHCCCS CARE members will have two months from the date of the payment invoice to make the required monthly premium contribution. g) Disenrollment for Failure to Pay Premiums . AHCCCS CARE members will receive a notice of disenrollment for failure to make AHCCCS CARE premium payments. There is no lock out period. Anyone that has been disenrolled for failure to pay premiums may re -enroll in the Medicaid program at any time and does not have to pay any past -due liabilities. If re -enrollment occurs within 90 days, a new application is not ne eded. 22. AHCCCS CARE Contributions by Third Parties . Third parties such as employers or charitable organizations may make contributions on behalf of AHCCCS CARE members. Arrangements for billing the third party will be made on a case -by-case basis to accommodate the unique needs of the third party. Any such arrangement shall Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 24 Amended: January 18, 2017 be reviewed and approved by CMS and incorporated into the s tate's AHCCCS CARE Operational Protocol. There are no limits on the amounts third parties can contribute to any AHCCCS CARE member's Account. Health care providers or provider -related entities making contributions on individual's behalf must have criteri a for providing assistance that do not distinguish between individuals based on whether or not they receive or will receive services from the contributing provider(s) or class of providers. Providers may not include the cost of such payments in the cost of care for purposes of Medicare and Medicaid cost reporting and cannot be included as part of a Medicaid shortfall or uncompensated care for any purpose. 23. Beneficiary Protections for AHCCCS CARE Account Contributions. a) Arizona and/or its vendor may at tempt to collect unpaid premiums and the related debt from beneficiaries, but may not report the debt to credit reporting agencies, place a lien on an individual's home, refer the case to debt collectors, file a lawsuit, or seek a court order to seize a po rtion of the individual's earnings for enrollees at any income level. The state and/or its vendor may not \"sell\" the debt for collection by a third party. b) Beneficiaries described in 42 CFR 447.56(a) (including American Indians/Alaska Natives, as described therein) must be exempt from all coinsurance and premium contribution requirements, as applicable. c) Beneficiaries may not incur household cost sharing or premiums that exceeds 5 percent of the aggregate household income, following rules established in 42 C FR 447.56(f). d) Coinsurance amounts will not exceed Medicaid cost sharing permitted by federal law and regulation. e) The state may not pass along the cost of any surcharge associated with processing payments to the beneficiary. Any surcharges or other fees as sociated with payment processing must be considered an administrative expense by the state. f) The state will ensure that all payments from the beneficiary, or on behalf of the individual, are accurately and timely credited toward unpaid premiums and related debt, and will provide the beneficiary an opportunity to review and seek correction of the payment history. 24.

Hospitals cannot receive total payments, including DSH and SNCP payments, related to inpatient and outpatient hospital services furnished to Medicaid eligible and uninsured individuals that exceed the hospital's total eligible inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital uncompensated care costs. f) Intergovernmental Transfers (IGTs). The non- federal share of the SNCP payments for PCH will be funded by contributions from eligible governmental entities through IGTs. The state will submit to CMS for review and approval all IGT agreements to ensure compliance with Section 1903(w)(6)(A) of the Act and Part X of these STCs. Such agreements should specify the source and use of the IGT money. The agreements sh all ensure that the IGT is not derived from an impermissible source, including recycled Medicaid payments, Federal money precluded from use as state match, impermissible taxes, and non -bona fide provider -related donations. The agreements shall also ensure that providers will retain the SNCP payments. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 39 Amended: January 18, 2017 g) Annual Reporting Requirements for SNCP Payments . The state will submit to CMS an annual report specifically related to the amount of payments made from the SNCP per DY. The reporting requirements are as follow s: Within ninety (90) days after the end of each DY, the state shall provide the following information to CMS: 1) Actual SNCP payments to each provider for each DY, including the interim payments and any overpayments resulting from the recomputations of the uncompensated care cost limits in accordance with the protocol in Attachment E; 2) The uncompensated care cost limit computed for each provider for each DY, including the projected uncompensated care costs used for interim payment purposes, the uncompensate d care costs based on the as -filed cost reports, and the uncompensated care costs based on the finalized cost reports. 3) To the extent that the SNCP limits in paragraph 3 2(c) are stated for a period other than a DY, the state should allocate the SNCP payments to each DY proportionately based on the number of months in each DY that the payments cover. 33. Payments to IHS and 638 Facilities. The state is authorized through to make payments to IHS and tribal 638 facilities that take in to account furnishing specified types of care furnished by IHS and tribal 638 facilities to Medicaid - eligible individuals. Facilities must use the methodology discussed in Attachment F. VII. DELIVERY SYSTEMS 34. Arizona Acu te Care Program (AACP) . The AACP is a statewide, managed care system, which delivers acute care services through prepaid, capitated Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) that AHCCCS calls \"Health Plans.\" Most Health Plan contracts are awarded by Geographic Service Area (GSA), which is a specific county or defined grouping of counties designated by AHCCCS within which a Contractor provides, directly or through subcontract, covered health care to members enrolled with that Contractor. 35. Arizona Long Term Care S ervices (ALTCS) . The ALTCS is administered through a statewide, managed care system which delivers acute, long- term care, home- and- community based, CRS and behavioral health care services through capitated MCOs that AHCCCS calls \"Program Contractors.\" The one exception is ALTCS DES/DDD enrollees eligible under the CRS program receive specialty care for treatment of their CRS and behavioral health conditions through a separate MCO contract. Those enrollees will receive services for all conditions other than behavioral health or CRS related conditions through ALTCS DES/DDD. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 40 Amended: January 18, 2017 With one exception, ALTCS contracts are awarded in the same geographic service areas as AACP are awarded. The exception is for the ALTCS contract with the Arizona DES/DDD to provide coverage on a statewide basis of the full ALTCS benefit package to all eligible individuals with developmental disabilities. Under state law, A.R.S. 36-2940, AHCCCS is required to enter into an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with DES/DDD to serve as the managed care organization for individuals with developmental disabilities. The DES/DDD ALTCS contract is an at- risk MCO contract that complies with 42 C.F.R. Part 438 and as such is reviewed and approved by CMS. Payments to DES/DDD under the ALTCS contrac t shall not include any payments other than payments that meet the requirements of 42 C.F.R. 438.6(c) including the requirement that all payments and risk -sharing mechanisms in the contract are actuarially sound. State law, A.R.S. 36- 2953, requires DES/DD D to maintain a separate fund to account for all revenues and expenditures under the ALTCS contract and limits use of the fund for the administration of the ALTCS contract. ALTCS enrollees in Maricopa and Pima Counties have a choice of Program Contractor s, but ALTCS enrollees in the rest of the state enroll in the Program Contractor for their GSA. 36. Children Rehabilitative Services (CRS) . AHCCCS contracts on a sole -source, capitated basis for the CRS program. 37. Regional Behavioral Health Authority (RBHA) . Individuals who are AACP members and who are diagnosed with a serious mental illness will receive their acute care services and behavioral health services through a separate MCO called a RBHA. RBHAs serve as subcontractors of AHCCCS. All other AACP membe rs will receive their behavioral health services through the RBHA. 38. American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Medicaid -eligible AI/AN may opt in to AHCCCS and receive Medicaid benefits through managed care. They are otherwise provided benefits through Medicaid fee -for-service. 39. Contracts. All contracts and modifications of existing contracts between the state and MCOs must be prior approved by CMS. The state will provide CMS with a minimum of 45 days to review changes. VIII. DEMONSTRATION MONITORING AND REPORTING 40. Monitoring Calls. CMS will convene periodic conference calls with the state. The purpose of these calls is to discuss significant actual or anticipated developments affecting the demonstration. CMS will provide updates on amendments or concept papers under review, as we ll as federal policies and issues that may affect aspects of the demonstration. The state and CMS will jointly develop an agenda for the calls. Areas to be addressed during the demonstration include , but are not limited to: a. Transition and implementation activities b. Stakeholder concerns c. Enrollment Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 41 Amended: January 18, 2017 d. Cost Sharing e. Quality of care f. Beneficiary access g. Audits h. Lawsuits i. Financial reporting and budget neutrality issues j. Progress on evaluation activities and contracts k. Related legislative developments in the state l. Demon stration changes or amendments the state is considering. 41. Quarterly and Annual Reports . The state must submit three quarterly reports and one compiled annual report each demonstration year. The reports must follow the framework provided by CMS, which is subject to change as monitoring systems are developed/evolve, and be provided in a str uctured manner that supports federal tracking and analysis. The reports will include all required elements and should not direct readers to links outside of the report, unless provided as part of a bibliography. Quarterly reports are due no later than 60 days following the end of each demonstration quarter. Annual reports are due no later than 90 days following the end of the demonstration year. The reports will include all required elements and should not direct readers to links outside of the report, unless provided as part of a bibliography. In addition to the components of the compiled, annualized data provided from the quarterly reports, the annual reports, at a minimum must include: a) Total annual expenditures for the demonstration population for eac h demonstration year, with administrative costs reported separately; b) Total contributions, withdrawals, balances and credits related to AHCCCS CARE accounts ; and c) Yearly enrollment reports for demonstration enrollees for each demonstration year that include the member months, required to evaluate compliance with the budget neutrality agreement. 42. Compliance with Federal Systems Innovation. As federal systems continue to evolve and incorporate 1115 demonstration reporting and analytics, the state shall work with CMS to revise the reporting templates and submission processes to accommodate timely compliance with the requirements of the new s ystems. The state will submit monitoring and evaluation reports to the appropriate system as directed by CMS. 43. Deferral for Failure to Submit Timely Demonstration Deliverables. The state agrees that CMS may issue deferrals in the amount of $5,000,000 when deliverables are not submitted timely to CMS or are found to not be consistent with the requirements approved by CMS. a) Thirty (30) days after the deliverable was due, CMS will issue a written notification to the state providing advance notification of a pending deferral for late or non- compliant submissions of required deliverables. b) For each deliverable, the state may submit a written request for a n extension in which to submit the required deliverable. Should CMS agree to the state's request, a cor responding extension of the deferral process described below can Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 42 Amended: January 18, 2017 be provided. CMS may agree to a corrective action as an interim step before applying the deferral, if requested by the state. c) The deferral would be issued against the next quarterly expendit ure report following the written deferral notification. d) When the state submits the overdue deliverable(s) that are accepted by CMS, the deferral(s) will be released. e) As the purpose of a section 1115 demonstration is to test new methods of operation or service delivery, a state's failure to submit all required reports, evaluations and other deliverables may preclude a state from renewing a demonstration or obtaining a new demonstration. f) CMS will consider with the state an alternative set of operational ste ps for implementing the intended deferral to align the process with the state's existing deferral process, for example the structure of the state request for an extension, what quarter the deferral applies to, and how the deferral is released. 44. Contractor Reviews . The state will forward summaries of the financial and operational reviews that: a) The Arizona Department of Economic Security/Division of Developmental Disabilities (DES/DDD) performs on its subcontracting MCOs. b) The state will also forward summar ies of the financial and operational reviews that AHCCCS completes on the Children's Rehabilitative Services Program (CRS) contractor; and the Comprehensive Medical and Dental Program (CMDP) at the Arizona DCS. 45. Contractor Quality . AHCCCS will require the same level of quality reporting for DCS/DDD and DCS/CMDP as for Health Plans and Program Contractors, which include RBHAs, subject to the same time lines and penalties. 46. Contractor Disclosure of Ownership . Before contracting with any provider of service, the state will obtain from the provider full disclosure of ownership and control and related party transactions, as specified in sections 1124 and 1902(a)(38) of the Act. No FFP will be available for providers that fail to provide this information. IX. TARGETED INVESMENT S PROGRAM 47. Description. Arizona will include directed lump sum payments in its capitation rates paid to managed care entities pursuant to 42 CFR 438.6(c). The managed care entities will be directed to use the funding to make specific incentive payments to certain providers to improve performance and increas e physical and behavioral health care integration and coordination for individuals with behavioral health needs. The Targeted Investments Program will: a) Reduce fragmentation that occurs between acute care and behavioral health care, b) Create efficiencies in service delivery for members with behavioral health needs, Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 43 Amended: January 18, 2017 and c) Improve health outcomes for the affected populations. 48. Funding Limit . Pursuant to 42 CFR 438.6(c), AHCCCS may include in the actuarially sound capitation rates paid to managed care entities up to $300 million total for the period of January 18, 2017, through September 30, 2021, in directed incentive payments to physical and behavioral health care providers that provide integrated services and care to Medicaid beneficiaries and achieve AHCCCS defined targets for performance improvement. In accordance with paragraph 74(f), the actual payment to he managed care entities may occur after September 30, 2021. The l ump sum payment s for the Targeted Investments Program will be paid to the managed care entities after the close of the contract period based on provider performance. The final amounts of the targeted payment amounts paid for the contract period must retro spectively be cost allocated across rate cells in an actuarially sound and justified manner and in alignment with the described payment adjustment in the approved template for payments made under 438.6(c). Additionally, the total of all payments under the contract must be actuarially sound and in compliance with part 438. These capitation rates , including the directed incentive payments and any associated taxes and managed care entity administration costs , are eligible for federal financial participation at the state's FMAP for individual rate cells affected by the incentive payments . Of the total $300 million, the state may expend up to $15 million to support the administration, including state level reporting and evaluation of the T argeted Investments Program. These administrative expenses will be eligible for federal financial participation at the administrative match rate of 50 percent. Pursuant to 42 CFR 438.6(c), AHCCCS will direct payment of the incentive payments to be distributed annually to ph ysical and behavioral health providers based on demonstrated performance improvement and increased integration and coordination of physical and behavioral health across three focus populations: (i) adults, (ii) children, and (iii) adults who have transitio ned from a criminal justice facility. Payment of these directed incentive payments will be tied to performance improvement targets. Table 4 - Estimated Annual Funding Distribution for the Targeted Investment Program Programs Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Totals Targeted Investments $19 m. $66.5 m. $85.5 m. $66.5 m. $47.5 $90 m. $70 m. $50 m. $300 m. 49. Provider Payment Criteria . The state shall ensure that the contracts with managed care entities for provider performance payments adhere to the requirements in 42 CFR 438.6 (81 FR 27859- 61) and sub- regulatory guidance Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 44 Amended: January 18, 2017 unless otherwise explicitly modified by these STCs . 50. Designated State Health Programs (DSHP). Federal f unding of DSHPs is to ensure the continuation of vital health care and provider support programs while the state devotes increased state resources during the period of this demonstration for Targeted Investment s Program that will positive ly impact the Medicaid program, and result in savings to the federal government that will exceed the federal financial participation in DSHP funding. a) To the extent that the state increases its Medicaid expenditures through its Targeted Investment program, and achieves the measures that are a condition for DSHP payment, the state may claim federal matching funding for certain DSHP expenditures to support the initial investment costs of the Targeted Investment program. The expectation, which will be addre ssed in the demonstration evaluation, is that long -term savings achieved through the targeted investment will offset the amount of time -limited federal DSHP funding, and that the state will be able to continue the targeted investment program on a self -sustaining basis after the initial demonstration approval period. DSHP expenditures cannot exceed the amount spent on the Targeted Investment s Program and DSHP funding will also be subject to the annual and total DSHP spending limits in Table 5 and the reduct ions described in paragraph 56 and Table 6. DSHP funding is at -risk at the statewide level based on the state's ability to meet system transformation targets, as described in Table 7 . DSHP funding will be phased down over the demonstration period. No payments will be available for DSHP expenditures that are claimed under Medicaid or are reimbursed by third parties. DSHP expenditures may be claimed following procedures and subject to limits as described in the T able 5 below. b) FFP may be claimed for expend itures made for services provided by the following two state programs beginning January 18, 2017 through September 30, 2021: i. Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD), Arizona Early Intervention program (AzEIP) ii. Services to Individuals with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) under Arizona Revised Statute (A.R.S.) \u00a7\u00a7 11- 297. Table 5 - Total Computable Annual DSHP Limits Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 DSHP $6,274,400 $21,137,600 $27,177,000 $21,137,600 $15,098,300 51. DSHP Claiming Protocol. a) CMS must approve a DSHP claiming protocol for eligible DSHP expenditures, including identification of fund sources and types of expenditures. The DSHP protocol must be approved by CMS and will be attached to these STCs. The state Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 45 Amended: January 18, 2017 must comply with the protoc ol in order to draw down FFP and document expenditures in accordance with the protocol. b) In order to claim FFP for DSHP expenditures, the state will provide CMS a summary worksheet that identifies DSHP expenditures by program each quarter . c) For all eligible DSHP expenditures, the state will have available for CMS: i. Certification or attestation of expenditures. ii. Actual expenditure data from state financial information system or state client sub -system. d) The protocol will describe the procedures used that ensure that FFP is not claimed for the non- permissible expenditures listed in paragraph 52 below. e) The state will claim FFP for DSHP quarterly based on actual expenditures . 52. Prohibited DSHP Expenditures. The following types of expenditures are not permissible DSHP expenditures: a) Grant funding to test new models of care b) Construction costs (bricks and mortar) c) Room and board expenditures d) Animal shelters and animal vaccines e) School based programs for children f) Unspecified projects g) Debt relief and restructuring h) Costs to close facilities i) HIT/HIE expenditures j) Services provided to undocumented individuals k) Sheltered workshops l) Research expenditures m) Rent and/or Utility Subsidies that are normally funded by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or other state/local rental assistance programs n) Prisons, correctional facilities, services for incarcerat ed individuals and services provided to individuals who are civilly committed and unable to leave o) Revolving capital fund p) Expenditures made to meet a maintenance of effort requirement for any federal grant program q) Administrative costs r) Cost of services f or which payment was made by Medicaid or CHIP (including from managed care plans) s) Cost of services for which payment was made by Medicare or Medicare Advantage t) Funds from other federal grants u) Needle- exchange programs v) Abortions that would not be allowable if furnished under Medicaid or CHIP Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 46 Amended: January 18, 2017 w) Costs associated with funding federal matching requirements. 53. DSHP Claiming Process. a) The state will establish standard documentation of each DSHP's expenditures, to be specified in the DSHP Protocol. b) The state will report all expenditures for DSHP payments to eligible programs on the form CMS -64.9P Waiver under the waiver name \" TIP DSHP.\" Federal funds must be claimed within two years following the calendar quarter in which the state incurs DSHP expenditures for se rvices received during the performance period described above in paragraph 50(b). Claims cannot be submitted for state expenditures generated from services from programs identified in paragraph 50(b) above incurred after September 30, 2021. Sources of non -federal funding must be permitted by section 1903(w) of the Act and any applicable regulations. 54. Evaluation of the Targeted Investments Program . The state shall submit an update to its 1115 demonstration evaluation design no later than 120 days after the approval of the amendment to implement the T argeted Investments P rogram and in accordance with Section X , Evaluation of the Demonstration. 55. Sustainability of Physical and Behavioral Health Care Integration and Coordination. Because funding will decrease each year after year 3 and end after year 5, the state must submit a plan for ongoing support for the sustainability of increased behavioral health care integration and care coordination. The state must submit a draft sustainability plan for CMS comment by March 31, 2019. The sustainability plan should include, but is not limited to, the following elements : a) The scope of the behavioral health care integration activities that the state wants to maintain including analysis of alternative integratio n models like Integrated Care models or health homes under sections 1905(t)(1) or 1915(g) of the Act; and b) The strategy to secure resources to maintain the integration activities. 56. Reduction in DSHP Expenditures for Failure to Meet Statewide System Transformation Targets. The DSHP will be reduced in the prospective demonstration year if the state does not meet the targets for the previous year. Reductions in table 6 will be prorate d by focus population: 4 percent for criminal justice, 53 percent for adult and 43 percent for child, in which targets described in paragraph 57 are not met . Table 6 - Total Computable DSHP Reductions for Each Demonstration Year Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Percentage at Risk 0% 0% 10% Demonstration Approval: October 1, September 30, 2021 47 Amended: January 18, 2017 57. Statewide Focus Population Measures. The state will submit revised baselines in the 2017 annual report to CMS to update the baseline in Table 8 below. T able 8 below describes the performance measures and targets that the state i s required to meet in the previous year in order for the state to qualify for DSHP funding in Years 3 through 5.

Prior to the release of these reports, articles and other documents, CMS will be provide d with a copy, including press materials. CMS will be given 30 days to review and comment on journal articles to be published by AHCCCS or its evaluators before they are released. CMS will notify the state if it opts to not review and comment on journal articles. 70. Cooperation with Federal Evaluators. As required under 42 CFR 431.420(f), should CMS undertake a federal evaluation of the demonstration or any component of the demonstration, the state shall cooperate fully and timely with CMS and its contr actors' evaluation activities. This includes, but is not limited to, commenting on design and other federal evaluation documents and providing data and analytic files to CMS, including entering into a data use agreement that explains how the data and data files will be exchanged, and providing a technical point of contact to support specification of the data and files to be disclosed, as well as relevant data dictionaries and record layouts. 71. The state shall include in its contracts with entities who collect, produce or maintain data and files for the demonstration, that they shall make such data available for the federal evaluation as is required of the state under 42 CFR 431.420(f) to support federal evaluation. The state may claim administrative match for these activities. Failure to comply with this STC may result in a deferral being issued as outlined in STC 39. 72. Cooperating with Federal Learning Collaboration Efforts. The state will cooperate with improvement and learning collaboration efforts by CM S. XI. GENERAL FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER TITLE XIX 73. Quarterly Expenditure Reports. Effective with the quarter beginning October 1, 2011, the state shall provide quarterly expenditure reports using the Form CMS -64 to report total expenditures for services provided under the Medicaid program, including those provided through the demonstration under section 1115 authority. This project is approved for expenditures applicable to services rendered during the demonstration period. CMS shall provide FFP for allowable demonstration expenditures only as long as they do not exceed the pre -defined limits on the costs incurred as specified in this Agreement. 74. Reporting Expenditures in the Demonstration. The following describes the reporting of expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap: a) Tracking Expenditures. In order to track expenditures under this demonstration, Arizona shall report demonstration expenditures through the Medicaid and state Children's Health Insurance Program Budget and Expenditure System (MB ES/CBES), following routine CMS -64 reporting instructions outlined in section 2500 of the state Medicaid Manual. All expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap shall be reported on separate Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 53 Amended: January 18, 2017 and/or 64.9P Waiver, identified by th e demonstration project number assigned by CMS (including the project number extension, which indicates the DY in which services were rendered or for which capitation payments were made). For monitoring purposes, cost settlements must be recorded on Line 10.b, in lieu of Lines 9 or 10.C. For any other cost settlements (i.e., those not attributable to this demonstration), the adjustments should be reported on lines 9 or 10.C through 10.F, as instructed in the state Medicaid Manual. The term, \"expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap,\" is defined below. b) Use of Forms . For each DY, separate Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver shall be submitted reporting expenditures for individuals enrolled in the demonstration, subject to the budget neutralit y cap. The state must complete separate forms for the following categories: i. AFDC/SOBRA ii. SSI iii. Expansion State Adults iv. MED v. ALTCS -DD vi. ALTCS -EPD vii. Payments to IHS and 638 Facilities viii. SNCP ix. DSH and Critical Access Hospital Payments (CAHP)** x. New Adult Group xi. TIP - DSHP xii. TIP **Critical Access Hospital Payments as defined in Attachment D c) Expenditures Subject to the Budget Neutrality Cap. For purposes of section X, the term \"expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap\" shall include all Medicaid expenditures except th ose as described below, on behalf of the individuals who are enrolled in this demonstration. Expenditures excluded from this demonstration and the budget neutrality cap are Direct Services Claiming program expenditures for Medicaid in the public schools, Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment program expenditures, Freedom to Work program expenditures, and all administrative expenditures. d) Premium and Cost Sharing Adjustment . Premiums and other applicable cost sharing contributions from enrollees that are col lected by the state from enrollees under the demonstration shall be reported to CMS each quarter on Form CMS -64 Summary Sheet line 9.D, columns A and B. In order to assure that the demonstration is properly credited with premium collections, premium collections (both total computable and Federal share) should also be reported on the CMS -64 Narrative. The state should include these section 1115 premium collections as a manual adjustment (decrease) to the demonstration's actual expenditures on a quarterly basis. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 54 Amended: January 18, 2017 e) Administrative Costs. Administrative costs shall not be included in the budget neutrality limit. All administrative costs shall be identified on the Forms CMS - 64.10 Waiver and/or 64.10P Waiver. f) Claiming Period . All claims for expenditure s subject to the budget neutrality cap (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. Furthermore, all claims for services during the demonstration period (including any cos t settlements) must be made within 2 years after the conclusion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter 2- year period, the state must continue to identify separately net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the s ection 1115 demonstration on the CMS - 64 waiver forms in order to properly account for these expenditures in determining budget neutrality. g) Pharmacy Rebates. The state may propose a methodology for assigning a portion of pharmacy rebates to the demonstration. The proposed methodology must determine, in a way that reasonably reflects actual rebate- eligible pharmacy utilization, the amounts of rebate that are attributable to pharmacy utilization under the demonstration vs. outside the demonstration, and appropriate subtotals by EG and DY. The methodology (and any subsequent changes to the methodology) must be approved in advance by the CMS Regional Office prior to use. Rebate amounts assigned to the demonstration must be reported on the appropriate Forms CMS -64.9 or 64.9P Waiver, and not on any other CMS -64.9 form (to avoid double -counting). In the absence of an approved methodology, all pharmacy rebates must be reported on Forms CMS -64.9 or 64.9P Base. 75. Reporting of Member Months. The following des cribes the reporting of member months in the demonstration. Member months subject to the budget neutrality cap include: a) For the purpose of calculating the budget neutrality expenditure cap described in this Agreement, the state shall provide to CMS on a quarterly basis the actual number of eligible member months for: 1) Eligibility Group 1 :AFDC / SOBRA 2) Eligibility Group 2: SSI 3) Eligibility Group 3: Expansion State Adults 4) Eligibility Group 4 ALTCS -DD 5) Eligibility Group 5 : ALTCS -EPD 6) Eligibility Group 6 : New Adult Group b) This information shall be provided to CMS 30 days after the end of each quarter as part of the CMS -64 submission, either under the narrative section of the MBES/CBES or as a stand -alone report. c) The term \"eligible member months\" refers to the number of months in which Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 55 Amended: January 18, 2017 persons are eligible to receive services. For example, a person who is eligible for 3 months contributes three eligible member months to the total. Two individuals who are eligible for 2 months each contribute two eligible member months to the total, for a total of four eligible member months. d) For the purposes of this demonstration, the term \"demonstration eligibles\" refers to all individuals covered by Arizona Medicaid with the exception of individuals in the Freedom to Work and Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment programs 76. Standard Medicaid Funding Process. The standard Medicaid funding process must be used during the demonstration. The state must estimate matchable demonstration expenditures (total computable and Federal share) subject to the budget neutrality expenditure cap and separately report these expenditures by quarter for each Federal fiscal year on the Form CMS -37 for both the Medical Assistance Payments (MAP) and state and Local Administration Costs (ADM). CMS shall make Federal funds available based upon the state's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the state must submit the Form CMS -64 quarterly Medicaid expenditure report, showing Medicaid expenditures made in the qua rter just ended. CMS shall reconcile expenditures reported on the Form CMS -64 with Federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state. 77. Extent of Federal Financ ial Participation for the Demonstration. Subject to CMS approval of the source(s) of the non- Federal share of funding, CMS shall provide FFP at the applicable Federal matching rates for the following, subject to the limits described in this Agreement. a) Adm inistrative costs, including those associated with the administration of the demonstration; b) Net expenditures and prior period adjustments of the Medicaid program that are paid in accordance with the approved Medicaid state plan; and c) Net expenditures and pr ior period adjustments made with dates of service during the operation of the demonstration. 78. Medicare Part D Drugs. No FFP is available for this demonstration for Medicare Part D drugs. 79. Sources of Non -Federal Share. The state certifies that the source of the non- Federal share of funds for the demonstration is state/local monies. The state further certifies that such funds shall not be used as the non- Federal share for any other Federal grant or contract, except as permitted by law. All sources of non- Federal funding must be compliant with Title XIX of the Social Security Act and applicable regulations. In addition, all sources of the non -Federal share of funding are subject to CMS approval. a) CMS shall review the sources of the non- Federal share of funding for the Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 56 Amended: January 18, 2017 demonstration at any time. The state agrees that all funding sources deemed unacceptable by CMS shall be addressed within the time frames set by CMS. b) The state shall provide information to CMS regarding all sources of the non- Federal share of funding for any amendments that impact the financial status of the program. c) Under all circumstances, health care providers must retain 100 percent of the reimbursement amounts claimed by the state as demonstration expenditures. Moreover, no pre -arranged agreements (contractual or otherwise) may exist between the health care providers and the state and/or local government to return and/or redirect any portion of the Medicaid or demonstration payments. This confirmation of Medicaid and demonstr ation payment retention is made with the understanding that payments that are the normal operating expenses of conducting business (such as payments related to taxes (including health care provider -related taxes), fees, and business relationships with governments that are unrelated to Medicaid or the demonstration and in which there is no connection to Medicaid or demonstration payments) are not considered returning and/or redirecting a Medicaid or demonstration payment. 80. Certification of Public Expendi tures. The state must certify that the following conditions for non- Federal share of demonstration expenditures are met: a) Units of government, including governmentally operated health care providers, may certify that state or local tax dollars have been ex pended as the non- Federal share of funds under the demonstration. b) To the extent the state utilizes certified public expenditures (CPEs) as the funding mechanism for title XIX (or under section 1115 authority) payments, CMS must approve a cost reimbursement methodology. This methodology must include a detailed explanation of the process by which the state would identify those costs eligible under title XIX (or under section 1115 authority) for purposes of certifying public expenditures. i. To the extent that Arizona institutes the use of CPEs, the requirements of this term and condition fully apply. The state is subject to any policy guidance or regulation released by CMS regarding the use of CPEs. ii. The disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payment methodology for Arizona State Hospital (ASH) and the Maricopa Medical Center will be cost reimbursement and will utilize CPEs as the funding system. The methodology and the cost identification/reconciliation process, as approved by CMS, are included as an amendment to the DSH methodology in Attachment C. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 57 Amended: January 18, 2017 To the extent the state utilizes CPEs as the funding mechanism to claim Federal match for payments under the demonstration to non- governmental providers, the governmental entity appropriating funds to the provider m ust certify to the state the amount of such tax revenue (state or local) appropriated to the non- governmental provider used to satisfy demonstration expenditures. The non- governmental provider that incurred the cost must also provide cost documentation to support the state's claim for Federal match. c) The state may use intergovernmental transfers to the extent that such funds are derived from state or local tax revenues and are transferred by units of government within the state. Any transfers from governmentally operated health care providers must be made in an amount not to exceed the non- Federal share of title XIX payments. Under all circumstances, health care providers must retain 100 percent of the claimed expenditure. Moreover, no pre -arranged agreement s (contractual or otherwise) exist between health care providers and state and/or local government to return and/or redirect any portion of the Medicaid payments. This confirmation of Medicaid payment retention is made with the understanding that payments that are the normal operating expenses of conducting business, such as payments related to taxes, (including health care provider -related taxes), fees, business relationships with governments that are unrelated to Medicaid and in which there is no connecti on to Medicaid payments, are not considered returning and/or redirecting a Medicaid payment. 81. Applicability of Fee for Service Upper Payment Limits. If expenditures (excluding fee for service expenditures for American Indian beneficiaries) for inpatient hospital and long -term care facility services, other institutional and non - institutional services , and drugs provided to AHCCCS fee -for-service beneficiaries equal or exceed 5 percent of the state's total Medical Assistance expenditures, the expenditure au thority will be terminated and the state shall submit a demonstration amendment that includes a plan to comply with the administrative requirements of section 1902(a)(30)(A). The state shall submit documentation to CMS on an annual basis that shows the pe rcentage AHCCCS fee- for-service beneficiary expenditures as compared to total Medical Assistance expenditures. XII. GENERAL FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER TITLE XXI 82. Quarterly CHIP Expenditure Reports. The state shall provide quarterly expenditure reports using the Form CMS -21 to report total expenditures for services provided to all demonstration populations receiving title XXI funds under section 1115 authority. This project is approved for expenditures applicable to services rendered during the demonstra tion period. CMS will provide FFP only for allowable demonstration title XXI expenditures that do not exceed the state's available title XXI funding. 83. Tracking CHIP Expenditures. In order to track title XXI expenditures under this demonstration, the state will report demonstration expenditures, excluding KidsCare II, through the MBES/CBES, following routine CMS -21 reporting instructions. Title XXI demonstration expenditures will be reported on separate Forms CMS -21 Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 58 Amended: January 18, 2017 Waiver and/or CMS -21P Waiver identified by the demonstration project number assigned by CMS (including project number extension, which indicates the DY in which services were rendered or for which capitation payments were made). Expenditures for the KidsCare II program will be reported on the CMS -21 with the state plan population in the MBES/CBES. Separate KidsCare II reporting will be provided in the CMS -21 Narrative using a proportion of KidsCare II to the total KidsCare population based on date of payments. a) CHIP Claiming. All claims for expend itures related to the demonstration (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. Furthermore, all claims for services during the demonstration period (including cost settl ements) must be made within 2 years after the conclusion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter 2 -year period, the state must continue to identify separately net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the demonstration on the Form CMS -21. b) Standard CHIP Funding Process. The standard CHIP funding process will be used during the demonstration. Arizona must estimate matchable CHIP expenditures on the quarterly Form CMS -21B. On a separate CMS -21B, the state shall provide updated estimates of expenditures for the demonstration population. CMS will make Federal funds available based upon the state's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the state must submit the Form CMS -21 quarterly CHIP expenditure report. CMS will reconcile expenditures reported on the Form CMS -21 with Federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state. c) Sources o f CHIP Non -Federal Share. The state will certify state/local monies used as matching funds for the demonstration and will further certify that such funds will not be used as matching funds for any other Federal grant or contract, except as permitted by Fed eral law. All sources of non- Federal share of funding and distribution of monies involving Federal match are subject to CMS approval. Upon review of the sources of the non- Federal share of funding and distribution methodologies of funds under the demonstr ation, all funding sources and distribution methodologies deemed unacceptable by CMS shall be addressed within the timeframes set by CMS. Any amendments that impact the financial status of the program shall require the state to provide information to CMS regarding all sources of the non- Federal share of funding 84. Limit on Title XXI Funding . Arizona will be subject to a limit on the amount of Federal title XXI funding that the state may receive for demonstration expenditures during the demonstration period. Federal title XXI funding available for demonstration expenditures is limited to the state's available allotment, including currently available reallocated funds. Should the state expend its available title XXI Federal funds for the claiming period, no fur ther enhanced Federal matching funds will be available for costs of the demonstration until the next allotment becomes available. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 59 Amended: January 18, 2017 85. Compliance with Federal Rules. All Federal rules shall continue to apply during the period of the demonstration if title XXI Federal funds are not available and the state decides to continue the program. XIII. MONITORING BUDGET NEUTRALITY 86. Monitoring Demonstration Funding Flows. The state will provide CMS with information to effectively monitor the demonstration, upon request, in a r easonable time frame. These reports must follow the framework provided by CMS, which is subject to change as monitoring systems are developed/evolve, and be provided in a structured manner that supports federal tracking and analysis. a) Each year, AHCCCS wil l monitor and ensure that for each contract year, the DES/DDD have provided the appropriate state match necessary to draw down the FMAP for title XIX services provided, respectively, to ALTCS eligible persons. Specifically, AHCCCS and DES/DDD entered into an Intergovernmental Agreement, effective July 1, 1998, whereby DES/DDD transfers to AHCCCS the total amount appropriated for the state match for title XIX ALTCS expenditures. AHCCCS deposits the monies transferred into an Intergovernmental Fund from which AHCCCS has sole disbursement authority. b) AHCCCS will report on a comparison of revenues and costs associated with the DES Interagency Agreement, including how any excess revenues are spent. The report will be due by January 15 of each year for the state fiscal year ending the previous June 30. 87. Limit on Title XIX Funding. The state shall be subject to a limit on the amount of Federal title XIX funding that the state may receive on selected Medicaid expenditures during the period of approval of the demonst ration. The limit is determined by using a per capita cost method, and budget neutrality expenditure caps are set on a yearly basis with a cumulative budget neutrality expenditure limit for the length of the entire demonstration. The data supplied by the s tate to CMS to set the annual limits is subject to review and audit, and if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified budget neutrality expenditure limit. 88. Risk. The state shall be at risk for the per capita cost (as determined by the method described below) for demonstration eligibles under this budget neutrality agreement, but not for the number of demonstration eligibles in each of the groups. By providing FFP for all demonstration eligibles, the state shall not be at risk for changing economic conditions that impact enrollment levels. However, by placing the state at risk for the per capita costs for demonstration eligibles under this agreement, CMS assures that Federal demonstration expenditures do not exceed the level of expenditures tha t would have occurred had there been no demonstration. 89. Demonstration Populations and Programs Subject to the Budget Neutrality Cap. The following demonstration populations are subject to the budget neutrality cap and are incorporated into the following el igibility groups: Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 60 Amended: January 18, 2017 a) Eligibility Group 1: AFDC / SOBRA b) Eligibility Group 2: SSI c) Eligibility Group 3: Expansion State Adults d) Eligibility Group 4: ALTCS -DD e) Eligibility Group 5: ALTCS -EPD f) Eligibility Group 6 : New Adult Group g) Program Group 1: DSH h) Program Group 2: Payments to IHS and Tribal Facilities i) Program Group 3: SNCP j) Program Group 4: KidsCare II 90. Budget Neutrality Expenditure Cap: The following describes the method for calculating the budget neutrality expenditure cap for the demonstration: a) For each year of the budget neutrality agreement an annual budget neutrality expenditure cap is calculated for each eligibility group described in paragraph 89 as follows: i. An annual eligibility group expenditure cap must be calculated as a product of the number of eligible member months reported by the state under paragraph 75 for each eligibility group, times the appropriate estimated per member per month (PM/PM) costs from the table in subparagraph (iii) below. ii. The PM/PM costs in subparagraph (iii) below are net of premiums paid by demonstration eligibles. iii. The PM/PM costs for the calculation of the annual budget neutrality expenditure cap for the eligibility groups subject to the budget neutrality agreement under this demonstration are specified below. The Expansion State Adults population is structured as a \"pass -through\" or a \"hypothetical state plan population\" . Therefore, the state may not derive savings from these populations. Eligibility Group Trend Rate DY 6 DY 7 DY 8 DY 9 DY 10 Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 61 Amended: January 18, 2017 FFY 2017 FFY 2018 FFY 2019 iv. The annual budget neutrality expenditure cap for the demonstration as a whole is the sum of DSH allotment, the uncompensated care payments to IHS and tribal facilities, expenditures for the SNCP and KidsCare II program plus the annual expenditure caps for each eligibility group calculated in subparagraph (a)(i) above. b) The overall budget neutrality expenditure cap for the 5- year demonstration period is the sum of the annual budget neutrality expenditure caps calculated in subparagraph (a) (iv) above for each of the 5 years. The f ederal share of the overall budget neutrality expenditure cap represents the maximum amount of FFP that the state may receive for expenditures on behalf of demonstration populations and expenditures described in paragraph 90 during the demonstration period. c) Apply the effective FMAP, or enhanced 90 pe rcent match for family planning services, that is determined from the MBES/CBES Schedule C report. 91. Monitoring of New Adult Group Spending and Opportunity to Adjust Projections. For each DY, a separate annual budget limit for the new adult group will be ca lculated as the product of the trended monthly per person cost times the actual number of eligible/member months as reported to CMS by the State under the guidelines set forth in paragraph 46. The trend rates and per capita cost estimates for the new adult group are listed in the table below. Eligibility Group Trend Rate DY 6 DY 7 DY 8 DY 9 DY 10 FFY 2017 FFY 2018 FFY 2019 FFY 2020 FFY 2021 New Adult Group 3.30% $655.13 $676.75 $699.08 $722.15 $745.98 a) If the State's experience of the take up rate for the new adult group and other factors that affect the costs of this population indicates that the new adult group PMPM limit described above may underestimate the actual costs of medical assistance for the new adult group, the State has the opportunity to submit an adjustment to the PMPM limit, along with detailed expenditure data to justify this, for CMS review without submitting an amendment pursuant to paragraph 7. In order to ensure timely adjustments to the PMPM limit for a demonstration year, the revised projection must be submitted to CMS by no later than the end of the third quarter of the demonstration year for which the adjustment would take effect. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 62 Amended: January 18, 2017 b) The budget limit for the new adult group is calculated by taking the PM PM cost projection for the above group in each DY, times the number of eligible member months for that group and DY, and adding the products together across DYs. The federal share of the budget neutrality cap is obtained by multiplying total computable budget neutrality cap by the federal share. c) The State will not be allowed to obtain budget neutrality \"savings\" from this population. d) If total FFP reported by the state for the new adult group should exceed the federal share of FFP for the budget limit for the new adult group by more than 3 percent following each demonstration year, the state must submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. 92. Enforcement of Budget Neutrality. CMS shall enforce budget neutrality over the life of the demonstration rat her than on an annual basis. The budget neutrality test for the demonstration extension will incorporate net savings from the immediately prior demonstration period of October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2016, but not from any earlier approval period. 93. Budget Neutrality Savings Phase -Down. Beginning with the demonstration period that begins on October 1, 2016, the net variance between the without -waiver and actual with -waiver costs will be reduced. The reduced variance, calculated as a percentage o f the total variance, is used in place of the total variance to determine overall budget neutrality of the demonstration. The formula for calculating the reduced variance is, reduced variance equals total variance times applicable percentage. The percent ages are determined based on how long Medicaid populations have been enrolled in managed care subject to the demonstration. In the case of Arizona, the managed care program will retain 25 percent of the total variance as future savings for the demonstrati on. Should the state request an extension of its demonstration beyond September 30, 2021, the state must provide actual managed care capitation rate data for AHCCCS enrollees. Budget neutrality will be adjusted again to reflect revised PMPMs based on thi s data. 94. Exceeding Budget Neutrality. If, at the end of this demonstration period the overall budget neutrality expenditure cap has been exceeded, the excess Federal funds must be returned to CMS. If the demonstration is terminated prior to the end of the budget neutrality agreement, an evaluation of this provision shall be based on the time elapsed through the termination date. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 63 Amended: January 18, 2017 Attachment A - Quarterly Report Guidelines As written in STC paragraph 41, the state is required to submit quarterly progress reports to CMS. The purpose of the quarterly report is to inform CMS of significant demonstration activity from the time of approval through completion of the demonstration. The reports are due to CMS 30 days after the end of each quarter. The fo llowing report guidelines are intended as a framework and can be modified when agreed upon by CMS and the state. A complete quarterly progress report must include the budget neutrality monitoring workbook. An electronic copy of the report narrative and the Microsoft Excel budget neutrality monitoring workbook is provided.

Date Submitted to CMS: Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 65 Amended: January 18, 2017 Attachment B - Evaluation Guidelines Section 1115 demonstrations are valued for information on health services, health services delivery, health care delivery for uninsured populations, and other innovations that would not otherwise be part of Medicaid programs. CMS encourages states with dem onstration programs to conduct or arrange for evaluations of the design, implementation, and/or outcomes of their demonstrations. The CMS also conducts evaluation activities. The CMS believes that all parties to demonstrations; states, Federal Government, and individuals benefit from state conducted self -evaluations that include process and case -study evaluations \u2014 these would include, but are not limited to: 1) studies that document the design, development, implementation, and operational features of the demonstration, and 2) studies that document participant and applicant experiences that are gathered through surveys, quality assurance activities, grievances and appeals, and in -depth investigations of groups of participants and applicants and/or providers (focus groups, interviews, other). These are generally studies of short -term experiences and they provide value for quality assurance and quality improvements programs (QA/QI) that are part of quality assurance activities and/or demonstration refinements and enhancements. Benefit also derives from studies of intermediate and longer -term investigations of the impact of the demonstration on health outcomes, self -assessments of health status, and/or quality of life. Studies such as these contribute to state and Federal formation and refinements of policies, statutes, and regulations. States are encouraged to conduct short -term studies that are useful for QA/QI that contribute to operating quality demonstration programs. Should states have resources available after conducting these studies, they are encouraged to conduct outcome studies. The following are criteria and content areas to be considered for inclusion in Evaluation Design Reports. Evaluation Plan Development - Describe how plan was or will be developed and maintained: o Use of experts through technical contracts or advisory bodies; o Use of techniques for determining interest and concerns of stakeholders (funding entities, administrators, providers, clients); o Selection of existing indicators or dev elopment of innovative indicators; o Types of studies to be included, such as Process Evaluations, Case -Studies and Outcome investigations; o Types of data collection and tools that will be used - for instance, participant and provider surveys and focus groups; collection of health service utilization; employment data; or, participant purchases of other sources of health care coverage; and, whether the data collection instruments will be existing or newly developed tools; o Incorporation of results through QA/QI activities into improving health service delivery; and o Plans for implementation and consideration of ongoing refinement Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 66 Amended: January 18, 2017 to the evaluation plan.

Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 67 Amended: January 18, 2017 Attachment C AHCCCS Disproportionate Share Hospital Program DSH 102 Congress established the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program in 1981 to provide financial support to hospitals that serve a significant number of low -income patients with special needs. This document sets forth the criteria by which Arizona defines DSH hospitals and the methodology through which DSH payments are calculated and distributed. The document is divided into the following major topics: Hospital eligibility requirements Data on a State Plan Year Basis Timing of eligibility determination Medicaid Inpatient Utilization Rate (MIUR) calculation (Overall and Group 1 and 1A eligibility) Low Income Utilization Rate (LIUR) calculation (Group 2 and 2A eligibility) Governmentally -operated hospitals (Group 4 eligibility) Obstetrician Requirements Payment Group 5 Eligibility Determination Aggregate Limits Reconciliations Certified Public Expenditures (CPEs) Grievances and appeals Other provisions Hospital Eligibility Requirements In order to be considered a DSH hospital in Arizona, a hospital must be located in the state of Arizona, must submit the information required by AHCCCS by the specified due date, must satisfy one (1) of the conditions in Column A, AND must satisfy one (1) of the conditions in Column B, AND must satisfy the condition in Column C. COLUMN A COLUMN B COLUMN C 1. The hospital has a Medicaid Inpatient Utilization Rate (MIUR) which is at least one standard deviation above the mean MIUR for all hospitals 1. The hospital has at least two (2) obstetricians who have staff privileges at the hospital and who have agreed to provide obstetric services to Medicaid The hospital has an MIUR of at least 1 percent Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 68 Amended: January 18, 2017 receiving a Medicaid payment in the state and is an IHS facility, tribally owned and/or operated facility, or an other federally owned or operated facility (\"Group 1\") 1.A. The hospital has a MIUR which is at least one standard deviation above the mean MIUR for all hospitals receiving a Medicaid payment in the state and is a privately owned or privately operated hospital licensed by the state of Arizona (\"Group 1A\") 2. The hospital has a Low Income Utilization Rate (LIUR) that exceeds 25% and is an IHS facility, tribally owned and/or operated facility, or an other federally owned or operated facility (\"Group 2\") 2.A. The hospital has a LIUR that exceeds 25% and is a privately owned or privately operated hospital licensed by the state of Arizona (\"Group 2A\") 3. The hospital is a governmentally - operated hospital and is not an IHS facility, tribally owned and/or operated facility, or an other federally owned or operated facility. (\"Group 4\") patients 2. The hospital is located in a rural a rea, defined in accordance with Section 1923(d)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act, and has at least two (2) physicians with staff privileges to perform non-emergency obstetric procedures 3. The patients of the hospital are predominantly under 18 years of age 4. The hospital was in existence on December 22, 1987 but did not offer non-emergency obstetric services as of that date Medicare Certification Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 69 Amended: January 18, 2017 In addition to the eligibility requirements outlined above, in order to receive payment under Medicaid, hospi tals must meet the requirements for participation as a hospital in Medicare (except in the case of medical supervision of nurse -midwife services). Therefore, for purposes of DSH, the facility must be Medicare- certified during the state plan rate year for which the initial DSH payment is made. If a facility is Medicare- certified for the full state plan rate year for which the initial DSH payment is made, but subsequently loses that certification, the facility remains eligible to receive the payment (together with any payment adjustments). If a hospital is only Medicare- certified for part of the state plan rate year for which the initial DSH payment is made, the eligibility and the payment will be calculated based on the period for which the hospital was Medicare- certified. Data on a State Plan Year Basis DSH payments are made based on the State Plan Year. The State Plan Year (or State Plan Rate Year or SPY) is equivalent to the Federal Fiscal Year and runs from October 1 to September 30 of each year. The calculations to determine eligibility for, and the amount of, DSH payments, will be made on the basis of the State Plan Year. This requirement will impact the information collected and submitted by all hospitals that do not have a fiscal year and /or CMS 2552 Report year that runs from 10/1 to 9/30. In order to make the necessary calculations to determine eligibility and payments on a State Plan Year basis, hospitals that do not have a fiscal/CMS Report year that runs from 10/1 to 9/30 will have to submit cost reports and other data elements for each of the fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the State Plan Year. For example, for SPY 2008 (10/1/07 to 9/30/08), for a hospital that has a CMS 2552 Report year that runs from 7/1 to 6/30, the hospita l will have to submit the CMS 2552 Report and other data elements for the fiscal/CMS Report year that ends on 6/30/08 and the same information for the fiscal/CMS Report year that ends 6/30/09. 1 As discussed later in this Attac hment, AHCCCS will extract all Title XIX (Medicaid) claims and encounters from the PMMIS system on the basis of each hospital's CMS 2552 Report year and these data will serve as the basis for all Medicaid days, charges and payments. Similarly, AHCCCS will collect all Medicaid and Non -Title XIX payments (for the Comprehensive Medical and Dental Program, behavioral health services and payments for trauma and emergency departments) on the basis of each hospital's CMS 2552 Report year. 1 Note however that the use of the 2008 and 2009 reports and information referred to in this paragraph is for the determination of final DSH payments. For the initial 2008 DSH payments, reports and information for 2006 and 2007 will be submitted. For a discussion of initial payments, final payments and data sources, see the discussions that follow. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 70 Amended: January 18, 2017 All data compiled by the hospitals (e.g. total, uninsured and charity days; charges and payments; and state and local subsidy payment information not provided by AHCCCS) will be compiled on a CMS 2552 Report year basis. Except in the case where a hospital's fiscal year is identical to the State Plan Year - the calculations to determine eligibility for, and the amount of, DSH payments, will be performed separately for each hospital's fiscal year and these results will be prorated based on the distribution of months from each of the two years that encompass the SPY. For example, for SPY 2008 (10/1/07 to 9/30/08), for a hospital that has a CMS 2552 Report year that runs from 7 /1 to 6/30, the proration of the results of the calculations will be derived by summing: 1. 9/12th of the result of the calculations performed for the fiscal/CMS Report year ending 6/30/08, and 2. 3/12th of the result of the calculations performed for the fisca l/CMS Report year ending 6/30/09. Timing of Eligibility Determination The eligibility determination calculations will be performed annually for all hospitals located in the state of Arizona that are registered as providers with AHCCCS that have submitted the information required by this document and/or as otherwise requested by AHCCCS during the application process. In order to be considered \"submitted during the application process,\" the information must be received by AHCCCS by the due date specified in a request for information communicated to the Chief Financial Officer of the hospital. This does not preclude AHCCCS from using other information available to AHCCCS to verify or supplement the information submitted by the hospitals. The calculations will be performed with the information submitted by hospitals, or available to AHCCCS on the due date specified as the deadline for the submission of information. The eligibility determination will be made in at least two steps: 1. The first step of the eligib ility process will occur in the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. To determine initial eligibility, AHCCCS will: a. Extract from the PMMIS system all inpatient and outpatient hospital claims and encounters by date of service for each registered hospital for that hospital's fiscal years that encompass the state plan rate year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. b. Based on the extracted claims and encounters data and data provided by the hospitals, determine for each hospital whether or not that hospital has a Medicaid Inpatient Utilization Rate (MIUR) of at least 1%. For hospitals that qualify under this criteria, determine if the hospital: i. Meets the criteria for Group 1 ii. Meets the criteria for Group 1A iii. Meets the criteria for Group 2 iv. Meets the criteria for Group 2A v. Meets the criteria for Group 4 c. Based on certifications filed by each hospital, determine if the hospital Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 71 Amended: January 18, 2017 satisfies the criteria in Column B above. 2. The second step of the eligibility process will occur i n the state plan rate year two years after the state plan rate year of the initial DSH payment using the same steps above except that the data will be from the actual state plan year(s) for which the DSH payment is made. 3. AHCCCS may redetermine any hospital's eligibility for any DSH payment should the agency become aware of any information that may prove that the hospital was not eligible for a DSH payment. MIUR Calculation (Overall Eligibility Criteria and Group 1 and Group 1A Eligibility) A hospital's Medicaid Inpatient Utilization Rate (MIUR) will determine the hospital's overall eligibility for DSH (Column C above) as well as the hospital's eligibility for Group 1 and Group 1A. A hospital's MIUR is calculated using the following equation: MIUR = Total Medicaid Inpatient Days Total Number of Inpatient Days The calculation will be performed based on the state plan year. In order to find each hospital's MIUR for the state plan year, AHCCCS will calculate a MIUR separately for each hospital fiscal/CMS Report year that encompasses the relevant State Plan Year and then prorate the results from the two hospital fiscal/CMS Report years as described in the discussion above entitled \"Data on a State Plan Year Basis\". AHCCCS will perform this calcul ation twice. The first calculation will be performed using the state plan year two years prior to the year of the initial DSH payment. The second calculation will encompass the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. The CMS 2552 form(s) to be used is/ are the most recent available cost report(s) that encompass the relevant state plan year AHCCCS may apply trending factors for the initial calculation to account for changes in utilization and/or population (e.g., due to changes in Medicaid eligibility criteria). The adjustments will reflect increases and decreases resulting from changes in operations or circumstances that are not reflected in the information from the state plan year two years prior. If a hospital has a MIUR of at least 1%, and the obst etrical criteria of Column B above are satisfied, it will meet the overall eligibility criteria. If a hospital has a MIUR which is at least one standard deviation above the mean MIUR for all Arizona hospitals receiving a Medicaid payment in that State Pla n Year, it will meet the eligibility for Group 1 or 1A. Note that meeting overall eligibility criteria does not ensure that a hospital will meet the eligibility criteria for any Group. In performing the calculations: 1. \"Inpatient Days\" includes: a. Fee-for-service and managed care days, and Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 72 Amended: January 18, 2017 b. Each day in which an individual (including a newborn) is an inpatient in the hospital, whether or not the individual is in a specialized ward, and whether or not the individual remains in the hospital for lack of suitable pl acement elsewhere. 2. AHCCCS will extract claims and encounter data for \"Medicaid Inpatient Days\" \" from the PMMIS system. The data extraction will be performed using dates of service as specified in the earlier section titled \"Timing of Eligibility Determina tion,\" found in both step 1(a) step 2. \"Medicaid Inpatient Days\" includes all adjudicated inpatient days for Title XIX clients, including days paid by Medicare, except for Title XIX members between 21 and 65 years of age who is in an Institution for M ental Disease (IMD). 3. For \"Total number of inpatient days\" data should be taken from hospital cost reports. The specific figures to be used are found on Worksheet S -3, Lines 1 and 8 through 13, Column 8 plus Line 16 through 18, Column 8 for hospital subprovider days. Calculation of the mean MIUR and the Standard Deviation In calculating the mean MIUR, the MIUR calculated for the state plan year for all Arizona hospitals that have received a Medicaid payment will be used. The mean MIUR - the average of the individual MIURs - will be calculated based on all the individual state plan year MIURs greater than zero (i.e. including the MIURs that are less than 1%). The standard deviation will be calculated based on the same list of individual hospital MIU Rs. LIUR Calculation (Group 2 and 2 A Eligibility) A hospital's Low Income Utilization Rate (LIUR) will determine the hospital's eligibility for Group 2. A hospital's LIUR is calculated by summing the following two equations: Total Medicaid Patient Services Charges + Total State and Local Cash Subsidies for Patient Services Total Charges for Patient Services LIUR = + Total Inpatient Charges Attributable to Charity Care -Cash Subsidies Portion Attributable to Inpatient Total Inpatient Charges The calculation will be performed based on the state plan year. In order to find each hospital's LIUR for the state plan year, AHCCCS will calculate a LIUR separately for each hospital fiscal/CMS Report year that encompasses the relevant state plan year and th en prorate the results from the two hospital fiscal/CMS Report years as described in the discussion above entitled \"Data on a State Plan Year Basis\". If a hospital has a LIUR that exceeds 25% it will meet the eligibility for Group 2 or 2A. AHCCCS will perform this calculation twice. The first calculation will be performed using the state plan year two years prior to the year of the initial DSH payment. The Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 73 Amended: January 18, 2017 second calculation will encompass the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. The CMS 2552 form(s) to be used is/are the most recent available report(s) that encompass the relevant state plan year. AHCCCS may apply trending factors for the initial calculation to account for changes in utilization, population (e.g., due to changes in Medicaid eligibility criteria), supplemental payments, and/or Medicaid payments and rates. The adjustments may increase or decrease the days, costs, charges, or payments reflected on the cost reports, Medicaid data and/or uninsured information. The adjustments will reflect increases and decreases resulting from changes in operations or circumstances that are not reflected in the information from the state plan year two years prior. In performing the calculations: 1. \"Total Medicaid Patient Services Charges\" includes Title XIX charges for inpatient and outpatient services (both fee -for-service and managed care) extracted from PMMIS. 2. \"Total Medicaid Patient Services Charges\" does not include DSH payments or payments made for GME, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Hospit al Inpatient Payments or any other Title XIX supplemental payments authorized by the Legislature as these amounts are effectively included in charges. 3. \"Total State and Local Cash Subsidies for Patient Services\" includes payments made with state -only or lo cal-only funds. AHCCCS will account for the amounts of such payments made during the relevant fiscal years. These payments include, but are not limited to a. Payments made for: i. Non-Title XIX and Non- Title XXI enrollees in the Comprehensive Medical and Dental Program (CMDP), this information is provided to AHCCCS from CMDP ii. Non-Title XIX and Non- Title XXI enrollees in the Behavioral Health Services Program iii. The support of trauma centers and emergency departments b. Payments reported by hospitals to AHCCCS which are made by: i. An appropriation of state -only funds ii. The Arizona State Hospital iii. Local governments including (but not limited to): (1) Tax levies dedicated to support a governmentally -operated hospital (2) Tax levies from a hospital district organized pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 48- 1901 et seq. (3) Subsidies for the general support of a hospital 4. \"Total State and Local Cash Subsidies for Patient Services\" does not include payments for or by: a. Inpatient or outpatient services for employees of state or local governments Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 74 Amended: January 18, 2017 b. Governmentally -operated AHCCCS health plans or program contractors c. Tax reductions or abatements 5. \"Total Charges for Patient Services\" includes total gross patient revenue for hospital services (including hospital subprovider charges) from hospital cost report(s). The specific figures to be used are found on Worksheet C Part I, Column 8 Line 200 less Lines 44 to 46, less Lines 88 to 89, less Lines 94 to 101, less Lines 105 to 112, and less Lines 115 to 117. If charges for Rural Health Clinics or Federally Qualified Health Centers appear anywhere other than on Lines 88 to 89, these charge amounts should also be deducted from Line 200. 6. \"Total Inpatient Charges Attributable to Charity Care\" includes the amount of inpatient services - stated as charges - that is provided free to individuals who cannot afford health care due to inadequate resources as determined by the hospital's charity care policy and do not otherwise qualify for government subsidized insurance. In order to qualify as charity care, payment may n either be received nor expected. This data is taken from the hospital claims and financial records submitted with information requested by AHCCCS during the application process. 7. \"Total Inpatient Charges Attributable to Charity Care\" does not include bad debt expense or contract allowances and discounts offered to third party payors or self pay patients that do not qualify for charity care pursuant to the hospital's charity care policy. 8. \"Cash Subsidies Portion Attributable to Inpatient\" means that portion of \"Total state and Local Cash Subsidies for Patient Services\" that is attributable to inpatient services. Data should be taken from the hospital claims and financial records submitted with information requested by AHCCCS during the application process. If the hospital receives subsidies for the general operation of the hospital, allocation between outpatient and inpatient should be based on the percentage of total inpatient charges to total charges from patient services. 9. \"Total Inpatient Charges\" includes total inpatient and hospital subprovider charges without any deductions for contract allowances or discounts offered to third party payors or self pay patients. Data should be taken from hospital cost report(s). The specific figures to be used are found i n Worksheet C, Part I, Column 6 Line 200 less Lines 44 to 46, less Lines 88 to 89, less Lines 94 to 101, less Lines 105 to 112, and less Lines 115 to 117. If charges for Rural Health Clinics or Federally Qualified Health Clinics appear anywhere other than on Lines 88 to 89, these charge amounts should also be deducted from Line 200. Governmentally- Operated Hospitals (Group 4 Eligibility) Because the state has designated all governmentally -operated hospitals (represented in Group 4) as DSH hospitals, no eligibility calculations are required other than the minimum qualifications in columns B and C. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 75 Amended: January 18, 2017 Obstetrician Requirements In order to ensure that hospitals receiving DSH payments meet requirements related to obstetricians, all hospitals that are determin ed to have a MIUR of at least 1% must file a completed certification statement indicating their compliance with the requirements. Any hospital that fails to return the certification statement by the date specified by AHCCCS will not be eligible to receive DSH payments for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. For the determination of a hospital's compliance with the obstetrician requirement, the certification will be based on the state plan year of the initial DSH payment from the start of the st ate plan year to the date of certification. The certification statement shall incorporate the following language: I certify that the hospital indicated below currently has and has had since the beginning of the current state plan year at least two (2) obstetricians with staff privileges who have agreed to provide obstetric services to individuals eligible for Medicaid, OR I certify that the hospital indicated below is located in a rural area and currently has and has had since the beginning of the current state plan year at least two (2) qualified physicians with staff privileges who have agreed to provide non- emergency obstetric services to individuals eligible for Medicaid, OR I certify that the hospital indicated below did not offer non- emergency obstetric services to the general population as of December 22, 1987, or that the inpatients of the hospital are predominantly individuals under 18 years of age. Payment Pools and Changing Payment Levels The DSH program in Arizona is funded through a six pool system. With the exception of Group 5, each of the pools correlates to one of the hospital eligibility Groups. The amounts of funding for the pools for the current state plan year are contained in Exhibit 3. When determining the payment amounts, hospitals in Group 1 and 2 will be calculated concurrently, and if a hospital qualifies for more than one pool, the hospital will be categorized into the pool that maximizes its DSH payment. When determining the payment amounts, hospitals in Group 1A and 2A will be calculated concurrently, and if a hospital qualifies for more than one pool, the hospital will be categorized into the pool that maximizes its DSH payment. There are five instances where the initial DSH payment to one or more non-governmental hospitals may change: 1. A hospital is found on the second eligibility determination (or any subsequent eligibility check) to not be eligible for a DSH payment in the state plan year of the Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 76 Amended: January 18, 2017 initial DSH payment. In this instance, the amount of payment to the hospital will be recouped and the recouped amount will be distributed proportionately based on the initial DSH payments to the eligible hospitals remaining in the pool in which the ineligible hospital was placed in the state plan year of the initial DSH payment, up to each hospital's OBRA limit (see discussion below). 2. A hospital is found to have exceeded its finalized OBRA limit (see discussions below). In this instance, the amount of payment to the hospital in excess of its finalized OBRA limit will be recouped, and the recouped amount will be distributed proportionately based on the initial DSH payments to the eligible hospitals remaining in the pool in which the hospital was placed in the state plan year of the initial DSH payment, up to each hospital 's finalized OBRA limit. 3. In the event of a recoupment of an initial DSH payment and as a result of the process of distributing the recoupment to the pool to which the recouped payment was originally made, the distribution would result in all the hospitals in the pool receiving a total DSH payment in excess of their finalized OBRA limit, the amount of recoupment will be proportionately allocated among the remaining non- governmental hospital pools based on the initial DSH payments and distributed proportiona tely based on the initial DSH payments to the hospitals in the remaining non-governmental pools up to each hospital's finalized OBRA limit. 4. In the event that litigation (either by court order or settlement), or a CMS audit, financial review, or proposed disallowance requires AHCCCS to issue DSH payment amounts to one or more hospitals in a pool in excess of the initial DSH payment amount, AHCCCS will proportionately recoup funds based on the initial DSH payments from the remaining hospitals in the pool or pools effected to satisfy the requirement. This process will be followed to ensure that the annual federal DSH allotment is not exceeded. 5. In the event that a hospital qualifies for a DSH payment in the second (or any subsequent) eligibility determination that did not qualify in the initial eligibility determination, that hospital will receive the minimum payment under the DSH program which is $5,000. AHCCCS may set aside monies from the initial payment to make these minimum payments. AHCCCS may use monies which were set aside for hospitals which did not qualify for the initial determination but qualified in subsequent determinations. In the event that monies set aside are insufficient to provide the minimum payments, AHCCCS will proportionately recoup funds based on the initial DSH payments from the remaining hospitals in the pool or pools effected to satisfy the requirement. The payment amount to each governmentally -operated hospital will be determined during the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. The payment amount will only change if the total DSH payment to a hospital in the pool would be in excess of its finalized OBRA limit (see discussion below). To the extent that the excess amount recouped from a governmentally - operated hospital can be dis tributed to other hospitals in the pool without exceeding the interim or finalized OBRA limits of the remaining governmentally -operated hospitals, the excess amount will be distributed to the other governmentally -operated Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 77 Amended: January 18, 2017 hospitals. Determination of Paymen t Amounts The amount that each non- governmental hospital receives as an initial DSH payment from the pool for which it qualifies is determined by a weighting method that considers both the amounts/points over the Group threshold and the volume of services . The volume of services is either measured by Title XIX days or net inpatient revenue, depending upon the group being considered. Hospitals that qualify for Group 1, 1A, 2, or 2A There are ten steps to determining the DSH payment amount for hospitals that qualify for Group 1, 1A, 2, or 2A. After determining the initial DSH payment amount through the ten step process, there is a final adjustment that may be made depending on the result of the hospital's OBRA limit. These steps will need to be performed separately: once for Groups 1 and 2 and once for Groups 1A and 2A. 1. Determine Points Exceeding Threshold. Each of the Groups 1 and 2 has thresholds established for qualification of the hospital. For Group 1 it is one standard deviation above the mean MIUR; for Group 2 it is greater than 25% LIUR. Step 1 merely determines the difference between each hospital's \"score\" for the Group measure and that Group's threshold. 2. Convert Points Exceeding Threshold into a Value. Each of the Groups 1 and 2 are measuring a value: for Group 1 the value is Medicaid days; for Group 2 it is charges. Step 2 multiplies the Points Exceeding Threshold by the value of the associated Group. 3. Determine Relative Weight of Each Hospital in Each Group. The relative weight of each hospita l in each Group is determined by dividing each hospital's value for a Group determined in Step 2 by the total of all hospital values for that Group. 4. Initial Allocation of Dollars to Each Hospital in Each Group. The amount of funds available to each of the Groups 1 and 2 is determined by AHCCCS as authorized by the Legislature. The funding amount for the current state plan year is contained in Exhibit 3. The initial allocation to each hospital in each group is determined by multiplying each hospital's relative weight in a Group (determined in Step 3) by the amount of funds available for that Group. 5. Maximize Allocation of Dollars Between Group 1 and Group 2. This step selects the greater of the allocation to each hospital between Group 1 and Group 2. 6. Recalculating the Relative Weights of Each Hospital in Group 1 and Group 2. Since Step 5 eliminated hospitals from both Group 1 and Group 2, it is necessary to redetermine the weight for each remaining hospital. This is accomplished by dividing the value of each hospital remaining in Group 1 and Group 2 after Step 5 by Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 78 Amended: January 18, 2017 the total of the remaining hospitals. 7. Second Allocation of Dollars Within Group 1 and Group 2. The second allocation to each hospital remaining in Group 1 and Group 2 is determined by multiplying each hospital's recalculated relative weight pursuant to Step 6 by the amount of funds available for that Group. 8. Identifying Minimum Payment. It is policy that the minimum payment made to any hospital qualifying for DSH is $5,000. This step i dentifies any amount thus far determined for any hospital that is less than $5,000. 9. Ensuring Minimum Payment. This step replaces any amount thus far determined for any hospital that is less than $5,000 with a $5,000 amount. 10. Determining Penultimate Paymen t Amount. With the replacement of values with the $5,000 minimum amounts, it is necessary to recalculate and redistribute the values within any Group where the minimum payment amount was imposed in order to ensure that the total funding for a Group is not exceeded. Step 10 accomplishes this. After determining the penultimate initial DSH payment amount for each hospital that qualifies for Group 1, 1A, 2, or 2A a check of the determined amount is made against the hospital's initial OBRA limit. The description of that limit follows in a subsequent section. If the initial DSH payment amount exceeds the initial OBRA limit, the initial DSH amount is set to the OBRA limit and the excess amount is distributed to the remaining hospitals in the Group, with a recheck of the initial DSH amounts against the OBRA limit. This process is repeated until all amounts are distributed or all hospitals in the Group are at their OBRA limit. Hospitals that qualify for Group 4 To determine the initial DSH payment amount for each governmentally -operated hospital, the relative allocation percentage for each hospital is computed based on the lesser of the hospital's CPE and the amount of funding specified by the Legislature. The total funding amount for the current state pl an year for Group 4 is contained in Exhibit 3. The funding amount for the IMD hospital in Group 4 is the IMD DSH limit for Arizona. The funding amount for the other governmentally -operated hospital in Group 4 is the remainder of the Group 4 pool amount, including any amount unclaimed by the IMD hospital. OBRA Limits The DSH payment ultimately received by qualifying non- governmental hospitals is the lesser of the amount calculated pursuant to the above -described methodologies or the hospital's OBRA limit. The DSH payment ultimately received by governmentally -operated hospitals is the lesser of the amount funded and specified by the Legislature or the hospital's finalized OBRA limit. All DSH payments are subject to the federal DSH allotment. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 79 Amended: January 18, 2017 The OBRA limit is calculated using the following equation: Pursuant to the above equation, the OBRA limit is comprised of two components: 1. The amount of uncompensated care costs associated with providing inpatient and outpatient hospital services to Medicaid individuals (the Medicaid shortfall), and 2. The amount of uncompensated care costs associated with providing inpatient and outpatient hospital services to individuals with no source of third party coverage for the inpatient and outpatient hospital services they received (uninsured costs). The OBRA limit for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment will be computed for each hospital up to three times: 1. The OBRA limit will be calculated in the state plan year of the initial DSH payment for all eligible hospitals based on the cost report(s) and days and charges and other program data for the state plan rate year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial DSH payment 2. For governmentally -operated hospitals, the OBRA limit will be recalculated when the cost report for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment is filed 3. The final calculation of each hospital's OBRA limit will be performed when the cost report for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment is finalized The steps to computing the OBRA limit are2: 1. The hospital shall prepare its CMS 2552 Report (cost report(s)). Each hospi tal must complete the cost report to determine cost center -specific per diems (for inpatient routine services) and ratios of cost to charges (RCC) (for ancillary services). The cost reports must be completed based on Medicare cost principles and Medicare c ost allocation process as specified in the CMS 2552 instructions and the CMS Provider Reimbursement Manual, volumes 15- 1 and 15- 2, including updates. 2 Note: The following discussion applies to hospitals that do not have a per diem ancillary allocation methodology approved by Medicare. For the steps to calculate the OBRA limit for governmental hospitals that do have such approval, see Exhibit 2 to this Attachment C. Non -governmental hospitals that have such approval should contact AHCCCS for f urther information. Uncompensated Care Costs Incurred Serving Medicaid Recipients + Uncompensated Care Costs Incurred Servicing the Uninsur ed Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 80 Amended: January 18, 2017 2. Medicaid shortfall will be calculated based on information available from PMMIS, other AHCCCS financial systems, and the cost report. 3. Uninsured costs will be calculated based on uninsured days and charges and other program data colle cted by each hospital from its claims and financial records, other systems, and the cost report. The sum of each hospital's Medicaid shortfall (whether positive or negative) and uninsured costs (whether positive or negative) is that hospital's OBRA limit. The Medicaid Shortfall The data used to calculate the Medicaid shortfall is extracted from the cost report(s) as well as from the AHCCCS PMMIS system and other AHCCCS financial reporting systems. The Medicaid shortfall will be calculated for each hospital for each fiscal/CMS Report year that encompasses the state plan year. The resulting Medicaid shortfall for each fiscal/CMS Report year will be prorated to derive the state plan year Medicaid shortfall according to the above discussion entitled \"Da ta on a State Plan Year Basis\". The information from AHCCCS will include, but not be limited to: 1. The number of Medicaid fee for service (FFS) inpatient hospital days for each inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report 2. The number of Medicaid managed care inpatient hospital days for each inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report 3. The Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital FFS charges for each ancillary cost center on the cost report 4. The amounts of payments made by or on behal f of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital FFS services 5. The amounts of Medicaid payments made by AHCCCS for inpatient and outpatient hospital FFS services 6. The Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hos pital managed care charges for each ancillary cost center on the cost report 7. The amounts of payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital services for health plans and pro gram contractors 8. The amounts of Medicaid payments made by managed care organizations for inpatient and outpatient hospital services 9. Other amounts of Medicaid payments for Medicaid inpatient and outpatient services furnished during the Medicaid state plan year under review (e.g. GME, CAH, etc.) 10. AHCCCS may apply trending factors for the initial payment to account for changes in utilization (e.g., due to changes in Medicaid eligibility criteria), supplemental payments, and Medicaid payments and rates. The adj ustments may increase or decrease the days, costs, charges, or payments reflected on the cost reports, Medicaid and/or uninsured information. The adjustments will reflect increases and decreases resulting from changes in operations or circumstances that are not reflected in the information from the state plan year two years prior. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 81 Amended: January 18, 2017 For each hospital, the cost -center -specific per diems and ratios of cost to charges (RCC) from the cost report will be applied to the data extracted from PMMIS (days and charges) to determine the cost of providing inpatient and outpatient Medicaid services. Inpatient and outpatient Medicaid services will not include services reimbursed as Rural Health Clinic or Federally Qualified Health Clinic services. The per diem amounts wi ll be calculated by dividing: The individual amounts on Worksheet B, Part I Column 24 Lines (and where applicable Subscript Lines) 30 to 35 and Lines 40 to 43 By The corresponding day totals on Line 1, Lines (and where applicable Subscript Lines) 8 throug h 13 and Lines 16 to 18(for inpatient hospital subproviders) from Worksheet S-3, Part I Column 8. Note: when calculating the Adults and Pediatrics (General Routine Care) per diem, the amount on Worksheet B, Part I, Column 24, Line 30 should have deducted the amounts appearing on Worksheet D -1, Part I, Lines 26 and 36 and the amount on Worksheet S -3, Part I, Column 8, Line 1 should have added the amount appearing on Line 28 (observation bed days). The ancillary RCCs will be calculated by dividing: 1. The individual Line and Subscript amounts for each of the Lines 50 to 76 and Lines 90 to 93 taken from Worksheet B, Part I Column 24 2. By 3. The individual Line and Subscript amounts for each of the Lines 50 to 76 and Lines 90 to 93 taken from Worksheet C, Part I Column 8 Costs will be offset by the payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital services as well as payments made by AHCCCS including FFS payments and payments by managed care organizations, made during the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year. Supplemental payments (such as GME, Rural Hospital Inpatient Payment and CAH) will be based on the state plan year. During the initial calculation, AHCCCS may use actual data if available as opposed to two years prior payments. Uninsured Costs Each hospital will collect uninsured days and charges and program data for the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year fr om the hospital's claims and auditable financial records. Only hospital inpatient and outpatient days and charges and program data for medical services that would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid should be included in the DSH calculation. Inpatient and outpatient uninsured services will not include services that would be reimbursed as Rural Health Clinic or Federally Qualified Health Clinic services if the patient were eligible for Medicaid. The uninsured days, charges and program information provided to the state are subject to the same audit standards and Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 82 Amended: January 18, 2017 procedures as the data included in the cost report. When providing uninsured days, charges and program information hospitals should be guided by the following: The Uninsured are defined as: Self pay and self insured patients Individuals with no source of third party coverage for inpatient and outpatient hospital services Third party coverage does not include state and local government subsidized care (i.e. individuals covered by indigent programs without other forms of third party coverage are uninsured) Payments made by state or local government are not considered a source of third party payment It is permissible to include in the Uninsured individuals who do not possess health insurance which would apply to the service for which the individual sought treatment. Individuals with AHCCCS coverage (under either Title XIX or Title XXI) are not considered uninsured Individuals participating in a Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program that have no source of third part y coverage for the services provided other than the Ryan White program are considered uninsured. However, the funding provided under the program must be considered payments received from or on behalf of patients or payments received from third parties. When submitting uninsured days, charges and program information hospitals should accompany the submission with: A listing of all payor types that are included in the uninsured data compilation, and An electronic file that contains sufficient claims or other information (e.g. ICNs) to enable an auditor to tie the amounts submitted during the application process to the financial records of the hospital The uninsured costs will be calculated for each hospital for each fiscal/CMS Report year that encompasses th e state plan year. The resulting uninsured costs for each fiscal/CMS Report year will be prorated to derive the state plan year uninsured costs according to the above discussion entitled \"Data on a State Plan Year Basis\". The information to be collected w ill include, but not be limited to: 1. The number of uninsured inpatient hospital days (this will be accumulated for each inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report) 2. The uninsured inpatient and outpatient hospital ancillary charges (this will be accumulated for each ancillary cost center on the cost report) 3. The amounts of payments received during the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to uninsured inpatient and outpatient hospital Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 83 Amended: January 18, 2017 services. The information collected shall: a. Include payments received during the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year under Section 1011, Federal Reimbu rsement of Emergency Health Services Furnished to Undocumented Aliens, of the MMA, b. Not include payments, funding and subsidies made by the state or a unit of local governments (e.g., state- only, local -only or state -local health program) 4. AHCCCS may apply trending factors for the initial payment to account for changes in utilization (e.g., due to changes in Medicaid eligibility criteria), supplemental payments, and Medicaid payments and rates. The adjustments may increase or decrease the days, costs, charge s, or payments reflected on the cost reports, Medicaid and/or uninsured information. The adjustments will reflect increases and decreases resulting from changes in operations or circumstances that are not reflected in the information from the state plan year two years prior. For each hospital the cost center -specific per diems and ratios of cost to charges (RCC) from the cost report (as determined for Medicaid) will be applied to the data collected by the hospital to determine the uninsured costs. Costs will be offset by the payments received during the state plan year from or on behalf of patients and payments received during the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year from third parties related to all uninsured inpatient and outpatient hospital services. Payments made by state or local government are not considered a source of third party payment. The OBRA Limit The summation of the Medicaid shortfall (whether positive or negative) and the uninsured costs (whether positive or negative) is the hospital's OBRA limit. Group 5 Eligibility Determination Any Arizona hospital that qualifies for funding in Groups 1, 1A, 2, 2A, or 4 s eligible for funding through Group 5. Group 5 is created to enable DSH- eligible hospitals to get qualifying DSH payments matched via voluntary intergovernmental agreements (IGAs). Per State Medicaid Director Letter #10 -010, the state will require the appropriate documentation that the funding has been voluntarily provided. Group 5 DSH payments are on top of the Groups 1, 1A, 2, 2A, and 4 DSH payments, but no individual hospital will receive aggregate DSH payments that exceed its OBRA limit. Funding for any hospital in Group 5 must be arranged via a voluntary intergovernmental agreement with a political subdivision, tribal government or public university, through certified public expenditures (for governmental c hospitals) or an intergovernmental transfer of public funds not derived from impermissible sources, such as impermissible provider -related donations or impermissible health care -related taxes, as a match to draw down DSH payments. Political subdivisions, tribal governments and public universities will Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 84 Amended: January 18, 2017 notify AHCCCS of the hospitals designated to receive funds from Pool 5 and of the amount of matching funds that are available through their IGAs or through a certification of public expenditures. For hospitals that qualify for Group 5, a \"LOM\" score will be calculated by multiplying the hospital's LIUR times the hospital's full O BRA limit, times the hospital's MIUR. Example : Hospital A OBRA = $54,734,467, MIUR = 0.3542, LIUR = 0.2946 Group 5 LOM score for Hospital A = $54,734,467 x 0.3542 x 0.2946 = $5,711,394 For the first round of distributions, allocations will be provided to hospitals located outside of the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan statistical areas which have an agreement with a political subdivision, tribal government, or public university for intergovernmental transfer of the non- federal share funding. Each participating hospital's percentage of the total LOM score will be calculated using the hospital's LOM score as the numerator and the total of all participating hospitals' LOM scores as the denominator. The total amount of DSH available as a result of the IGAs (Group 5 DSH funds) will be multiplied by each hospital's LOM percentage of this first round. If any allocation from this round is higher than a hospital's OBRA limit (remaining after Group 1, 1A, 2, 2A, and 4 DSH distributions) or higher than the matching funds (in total computable) for that hospital, the lower of those two limits will be recorded as the allocation for round one. The second round of distributions will be open to any hospital that qualifies for funding in Groups 1, 1A, 2, 2A, or 4 which did not participate in round 1 and which has a certificate of public expenditures or an agreement with a political subdivision, tribal government, or public university for intergovernmental transfer of the non-federal share funding. The second round will use the same protocol as the distribution in round 1 with any money remaining in the pool. If any monies remain in Group 5 after monies have been distributed in rounds 1 and 2 (including monies made available after CMS finalizes the DSH allotment), AHCCCS may issue additional rounds of funding to hospitals which qualified for funding in Groups 1, 1A, 2, 2A, or 4 which have not exceeded their OBRA limit, and which has an agreement with a political subdivision, tribal government, or public university for intergovernmental transfer of the non- federal share funding or a certificate of public expenditure. Any Group 5 payment made to a hospital which qualifies for Group 4 will be accounted for as an offset in the CPE computation under Group 4. All excess IGA funds not used for Group 5 DSH distributions, due to application of the above limits, will be returned to the originating political subdivisions, tribal governments or public universities and will not be retained by AHCCCS for other uses. The Group 5 DSH distribution for any hospital will consist of that hospital's total of allocations from all rounds. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 85 Amended: January 18, 2017 Aggregate Limits IMD Limit Federal law provides that aggregate DSH payments to Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMDs) in Arizona is confined to the lesser of $28,474,900 or the amount equal to the product of Arizona's current year total computable DSH allotment and 23.27%. Therefore, DSH payment to IMDs will be reduced proportionately to the extent necessary to en sure that the aggregate IMD limit is not exceeded. \"Institutions for Mental Diseases\" includes hospitals that are primarily engaged in providing diagnosis, treatment, or care of persons with mental diseases, including medical attention, nursing care, and related services. Whether an institution is an IMD is determined by its overall character as that of a facility established and maintained primarily for the care and treatment of individuals with mental diseases, whether or not it is licensed as such. Overall Total Limit The federal government shares in the cost of Medicaid DSH expenditures based on the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for each state. However, for each fiscal year, the amount of federal funds available to states for DSH payment is fixed. As such, the total amount of DSH payments for a state plan rate year will not exceed the federal allotment divided by the FMAP. Reconciliations The initial DSH payment issued to a hospital by AHCCCS is considered \"interim\" and is subject to different reconciliation methodologies depending upon whether the hospital is non- governmental or governmentally -operated. The payments to hospitals are generally made as a single lump sum payment that is made once the calculations of the payment amounts are completed. The purpose of the interim DSH payment is to provide reimbursement that approximates the Medicaid and uninsured inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital uncompensated care costs eligible for Federal Financial Participation (FFP). The reasons for a change in the initial (or interim) DSH payment for both non-governmental and governmentally -operated hospitals are outlined above under \"Pools and Changing Payment Levels\". If it is determined that the total amount of payments made to non -governmental hospitals under the methodology outlined in the \"Pools and Changing Payment Levels\" exceeds the amount of all finalized non -governmental hospital OBRA limits, the amount in excess will be recouped by AHCCCS and any associated federal funding claimed will be properly credited to the federal government. If it is determined that the total amount of payments made to governmentally -operated hospitals under the methodology outlined in the \"Pools and Changing Payment Levels\" exceeds the amount of either: Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 86 Amended: January 18, 2017 1. All governmentally -operated hospital OBRA limits calculated based on the \"finalized\" cost report, or 2. The total amount of certified public expenditures of governmentally -operated hospitals, then 3. The amount in excess will be recouped by AHCCCS and any ass ociated federal funding claimed will be properly credited to the federal government. Certified Public Expenditures Expenditures by governmentally -operated hospitals shall be used by AHCCCS in claiming FFP for DSH payments to the extent that the amount of funds expended are certified by the appropriate officials at the governmentally -operated hospital. The method for determining a governmentally -operated hospital's allowable uncompensated care costs eligible for DSH reimbursement when such costs are funded through the certified public expenditure (CPE) process will be the same as the method for calculating and reconciling the OBRA limit for governmentally -operated hospitals set forth above. However, because governmentally -operated hospitals are certi fying expenditures for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment and final expenditures may not be known at the time of initial certification of public expenditures, governmentally owned hospitals may certify an amount of expenditures for the initial DSH payment based on an estimate of the OBRA limit for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. In certifying estimates of public expenditure for the initial DSH payment, the governmentally operated hospital will first calculate its expenditures ba sed on the methodology for calculating the OBRA limit for the state plan year two years before the state plan year of the initial payment (as specified in the protocols in Exhibit 1 or Exhibit 2) and then provide for adjustments to such OBRA limit. The adj ustments may increase or decrease the days, costs, charges or payments reflected on the cost reports, Medicaid and/or uninsured information used to calculate the OBRA limit. The adjustments will reflect increases and decreases resulting from changes in operations or circumstances that are not reflected in the information from the state plan year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial payment, but will be reflected in the final information for the state plan year of the initial payment. All ad justments must be supported by adequate explanation/justification and is subject to review by AHCCCS and CMS. In order to use CPE, the certifying governmentally -operated hospital must follow the protocol in Exhibit 1 or Exhibit 2 and provide a certificati on as to the amount of allowable uncompensated care costs eligible for DSH reimbursement. If CPE is used, the amount of expenditures used to determine the FFP will not exceed the amount of the CPE. The payment of FFP to governmentally -operated hospitals i s subject to legislative appropriation. Grievances and Appeals The state considers a hospital's DSH eligibility and DSH payment amount to be appealable Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 87 Amended: January 18, 2017 issues. A DSH eligibility list along with the initial DSH payment amounts that eligible hospitals have been calculated to receive will be distributed. Hospitals will be permitted thirty (30) days from distribution to appeal their DSH eligibility and payment amounts. Because the total amount of DSH funds is fixed, the successful appeal of one DSH hospital will reduce DSH payment amounts to all other providers. Once the final reconciliation process is completed, no additional DSH payment will be issued. Other Provisions Ownership DSH payment will only be issued to the entity which is currently registered with AHCCCS as a participating hospital provider. Therefore, it is expected that facilities will consider this information when negotiating ownership changes. AHCCCS Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Payments Exceptions An exception to the use of the Medicare Cost Report (Form CMS 2552 -10) as a data source shall apply to: I. Hospitals that: Serve patients that are predominantly under 18 years of age, and Are licensed for fewer than 50 beds, and Do not file a comprehensive Form CMS 2552- 10 (Medicare Cost Report), and Receive an acceptance letter from the CMS fiscal intermediary for the portion of the CMS 2552- 10 (Medicare Cost Report) that the hospital does file with the fiscal intermediary, and Receive written permission from AHCCCS to invoke the provisions of this exception. Such hospitals may extract data from their financial records in lieu of extracting data from the Form CMS 2552- 10 (Medicare Cost Report) as provided in this Attachment C. The method of extracting and compiling the data from the hospital's financial records shall conform to the instructions for the Form CMS 2552- 10. All other non- Medicare Cost Report data and documentation as described in this Attachment C shall be required from such hospitals. II. Indian Health Service (IHS) Hospi tals and tribally -operated 638 hospitals who do not file a full Form CMS 2552- 10 Medicare Cost Report but rather file an abbreviated Medicare cost report in accordance with Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual, Part I, Section 2208.1.E (Method E cost report). Such IHS Hospitals and tribally -operated 638 hospitals can submit a Private Facility Information Sheet (PFIS) to AHCCCS using data from the IHS Method E report that is filed Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 88 Amended: January 18, 2017 with CMS aswell as supporting hospital financial reports, as necessary. The method of extracting and compiling the data from the hospital's financial records shall conform to the instructions for the Form CMS 2552- 10. All other non- Medicare Cost Report data and documentation as described on the PFIS cover sheet will be require d by such hospitals.EXHIBIT 1 to ATTACHMENT C AHCCCS Disproportionate Share Hospital Payment Methodology Calculation of OBRA Limits for Governmentally- Operated Hospitals for the Purpose of Certified Public Expenditures Each governmentally -operated hospital certifying its expenditures for Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments shall compute and report its OBRA limit as prescribed by this Exhibit. The governmentally -operated hospital's OBRA limit is comprised of two components: 1. The amount of uncompensated care costs associated with providing inpatient and outpatient hospital services to Medicaid individuals (the Medicaid shortfall), and 2. The amount of uncompensated care costs associated with providing inpatient and outpatient hospital services to individuals with no source of third party coverage for the inpatient and outpatient hospital services they received (uninsured costs). The steps to computing the governmentally -operated hospital's OBRA limit are3: 1. The hospital shall prepare its CMS 2552 Report (cost report(s)). Each hospital must complete the cost report to determine per diems (for inpatient routine services) and ratios of cost to charges (RCC) (for ancillary services). The cost reports must be completed based on Medicare cost principles and Medicare cost allocation process as specified in the CMS 2552 instructions and the CMS Provider Reimbursement Manual, volumes 15-1 and 15- 2, including updates. 2. Medicaid shortfall will be calculated based on information available from PMMIS, other AHCCCS financial systems, and the cost report. 3. Uninsured costs will be calculated based on uninsured days and charges and other program data collected by the hospital from its claims and financial records, other systems, and the cost report. 4. Finally, the governmentally -operated hospital will compile and summarize the calculations on The OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. In compiling and summarizing the OBRA calculations, the governmentally -operated hospital may make adjustments to the calculated OBRA limit to estimate the OBRA limit for a future state plan year. The adjustments may increase or decrease the days, costs, charges or payments reflected on the cost reports, Medicaid and/or uninsured information used to calculate the OBRA l imit. The adjustments will reflect increases and decreases resulting from changes in operations or circumstances that are not reflected in the information from the state plan year two years prior to the state plan year of the Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 89 Amended: January 18, 2017 initial payment, but will be r eflected in 3 Note: The following discussion applies to hospitals that do not have a per diem ancillary allocation methodology approved by Medicare.

Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 90 Amended: January 18, 2017 the final information for the state plan year of the initial payment. All adjustments must be supported by adequate explanation/justification and is subject to review by AHCCCS and CMS. The Schedule will be submitted to AH CCCS during the application process, with backup documentation, for the cost reporting period(s) covered by the Medicaid state plan year(s) under review. The Medicaid Shortfall AHCCCS will provide each governmentally -operated hospital with a report from the PMMIS system and other agency financial reporting systems to assist each governmentally - operated hospital in completing required schedules. The information to be provided by AHCCCS will include, but not be limited to: 1. The number of Medicaid fee for service (FFS) inpatient hospital days for each inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report 2. The number of Medicaid managed care inpatient hospital days for each inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report 3. The Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital FFS charges for each ancillary cost center on the cost report. Inpatient and outpatient Medicaid charges will not include charges reimbursed as Rural Health Clinic or Federally Qualified Health Clinic services. 4. The amounts of payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital FFS services 5. The amounts of Medicaid payments made by AHCCCS for inpatient and outpatient hospital FFS services 6.

The OBRA limit will be calculated in the state plan year of the initial DSH payment based on the cost report(s) and days and charges and other program data for the state plan year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. This calculation may include an adjustment to the calculated OBRA limit of the state plan year two yearsprior to the state plan year of the initial DSH payment in order to estimate the OBRA limit of the state plan year of the initial Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 94 Amended: January 18, 2017 DSH payment. 2. The OBRA limit will be recalculated when the cost report(s) for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment are filed. In recalculating the OBRA limit the cost data from the as- filed cost report(s) and program data (days, charges, and payments) from the actual cost reporting period(s) will be used in the calculation. This calculation may not include any adjustment to the calculated OBRA limit of the state plan year of the initial DSH. 3. The final calculation of each governmentally -operated hospital's OBRA limit will be performed when the cost report(s) for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment are finalized. In finalizing the OBRA limit the cost data from the finalized cost report(s) and program data (days, charges, and payments) from the actual cost reporting period(s) will be used in the calculation. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 95 Amended: January 18, 2017 EXHIBIT 2 to ATTACHMENT C AHCCCS Disproportionate Share Hospital Payment Methodology Calculation of OBRA Limits for Arizona State Hospital A Hospital with a Per Diem Ancillary Cost Allocation Method Approved by Medicare Arizona State Hospital (ASH), a governmentally -operated hospital that is an all -inclusive rate provider under Medicare, shall compute, report and certify its OBRA limit as prescribed by this Exhibit. Because ASH only provides inpatient services, the OBRA limit will by calculated based only on inpatient information. ASH's OBRA limit is comprised of two components: 1. The amount of uncompensated care c osts associated with providing inpatient hospital services to Medicaid individuals (the Medicaid shortfall), and 2. The amount of uncompensated care costs associated with providing inpatient hospital services to individuals with no source of third party cover age for the inpatient hospital services they received (uninsured costs). The steps to computing ASH's OBRA limit are: 1. The hospital shall prepare its CMS 2552 Report (cost report(s)). The hospital must complete the cost report to determine per diems (for inpatient routine services and for ancillary services). The cost reports must be completed based on Medicare cost principles and Medicare cost allocation process as specified in the CMS 2552 instructions and the CMS Provider Reimbursement Manual, volumes 15- 1 and 15- 2, including updates. 2. Medicaid shortfall will be calculated based on information available from PMMIS, other AHCCCS financial systems, and the cost report. 3. Uninsured costs will be calculated based on uninsured days and other program data collected by the hospital from its claims and financial records, other systems, and the cost report. 4. Finally, ASH will compile and summarize the calculations on The OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. In compiling and summarizing the OBRA calculations, ASH may make adj ustments to the calculated OBRA limit to estimate the OBRA limit for a future state plan year. The adjustments may increase or decrease the days, costs, charges or payments reflected on the cost reports, Medicaid and/or uninsured information used to calcul ate the OBRA limit. The adjustments will reflect increases and decreases resulting from changes in operations or circumstances that are not reflected in the information from the state plan year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial payment, but will be reflected in the final information for the state plan year of the initial payment. All adjustments must be supported by adequate explanation/justification and is subject to review by AHCCCS and CMS. The Schedule will be submitted to AHCCCS during the application process, with Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 96 Amended: January 18, 2017 backup documentation, for the cost reporting period(s) covered by the Medicaid state plan year(s) under review. The Medicaid Shortfall AHCCCS will provide ASH with a report from the PMMIS system and other agency financial reporting systems to assist ASH in completing required schedules. The information to be provided by AHCCCS will include, but not be limited to: 1. The number of Medicaid fee for service (FFS) inpatient hospital days (for the single inpatient routin e service cost center on the cost report) 2. The number of Medicaid managed care inpatient hospital days (for the single inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report) 3. The amounts of payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medicaid inpatient hospital FFS services 4. The amounts of Medicaid payments made by AHCCCS for inpatient hospital FFS services 5. The amounts of payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medic aid inpatient hospital services for health plans and program contractors 6. The amounts of Medicaid payments made by health plans and program contractors for inpatient hospital services for health plans and program contractors 7. Other amounts of Medicaid payments for Medicaid inpatient services furnished during the Medicaid state plan year under review (e.g. GME, CAH, etc.) ASH will use a single total per diem calculated from the cost report and the inpatient days extracted from PMMIS to determine the cost of providing inpatient Medicaid services. The Medicaid shortfall will be calculated for ASH for each fiscal/CMS Report year that encompasses the state plan year. The resulting Medicaid shortfall for each fiscal/CMS Report year will be prorated to derive the s tate plan year Medicaid shortfall according to the discussion entitled \"Data on a State Plan Year Basis\". The single total per diem amount will be calculated by summing the inpatient per diem amount and the ancillary per diem amount. The inpatient per di em amount will be found by dividing the amounts from Worksheet B, Part I Column 24, Line 30 by the day total on Line 1 from Worksheet S -3, Part I Column 8. Note: when calculating the Adults and Pediatrics (General Routine Care) per diem, the amount on Worksheet B, Part I, Column 24, Line 30 should have deducted the amounts appearing on Worksheet D -1, Part I, Lines 26 and 36 and the amount on Worksheet S -3, Part I, Column 8, Line 1 should have added the amount appearing on Line 28 (observation bed days). The ancillary per diem amount will be calculated by: 1. Summing the Line and Subscript amounts for each of the Lines 50 to 76and Lines 90 to 93 (but excluding Subscript Lines 88 to 89) taken from Worksheet Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 97 Amended: January 18, 2017 B Part 1 Column 24ividing the amount determined in step 1 above by the amount determined in step 3 below 2. Summing Line 1 and 28 from Worksheet S -3, Part I, Column 8 ASH will use the single total per diem calculated from the cost report and the data supplied by AHCCCS to compile the Medicaid Schedule of Costs on the OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. The Medicaid Schedule of Costs depicts: 1. The governmentally -operated hospital specific Medicaid inpatient cost data (determined by multiplying the single total per diem by the number of inpatient Medicaid days), 2. The payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medicaid inpatient hospital services, 3. The Medicaid inpatient net cost data, 4. Payments made by AHCCCS including FFS and payments by health plans and program contractors 5. The amount of supplemental Medicaid payments (e.g., GME and CAH, etc.) 6. The Medicaid shortfall 7. Adjustments to the calculated Medicaid shortfall to estimate a Medicaid shortfall for a future state plan year. Uninsured Costs ASH will collect uninsured days and program data for the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year from the hospital's claims and auditable financial records. Only hospital inpatient days and program data for medical services that would otherwise be eligible f or Medicaid should be included in the calculation. Inpatient uninsured services will not include services that would be reimbursed as Rural Health Clinic or Federally Qualified Health Clinic services if the patient were eligible for Medicaid. The uninsured days and program information provided to the state is subject to the same audit standards and procedures as the data included in the cost report. When collecting uninsured days and program information ASH should be guided by the following: The Uninsured are defined as: Self pay and self insured patients Individuals with no source of third party coverage for inpatient hospital services Third party coverage does not include state and local government subsidized care (i.e. individuals covered by indigent pr ograms without other forms of third party coverage are uninsured) Payments made by state or local government are not considered a source of third party payment It is permissible to include in the Uninsured individuals who do not possess health insurance which would apply to the service for which the individual sought treatment. Individuals with AHCCCS coverage (under either Title XIX or Title XXI) Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 98 Amended: January 18, 2017 are not considered uninsured Individuals participating in a Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program that have no source of third party coverage for the services provided other than the Ryan White program are considered uninsured. However, the funding provided under the program must be considered payments received from or on behalf of patients or payments received from third parties. The uninsured costs will be calculated for ASH for each fiscal/CMS Report year that encompasses the state plan year. The resulting uninsured costs for each fiscal/CMS Report year will be prorated to derive the state plan year uninsured costs according to the discussion entitled \"Data on a state Plan Year Basis\". The information to be collected will include, but not be limited to: 1. The number of uninsured inpatient hospital days (for the single inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report) 2. The amounts of payments received during the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to uninsured inpatient hospital services. The information collected shall: a. Include payments received during the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year under Section 1011, Federal Reimbursement of Emergency Health Services Furnished to Undocumented Aliens, of the MMA, b. Not include pa yments, funding and subsidies made by the state or a unit of local governments (e.g., state- only, local -only or state -local health program) ASH will use the total inpatient per diem calculated from the cost report (as determined for Medicaid), the uninsur ed days, and other program data collected by ASH to compile the Uninsured Schedule of Costs on the OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. The Uninsured Schedule of Costs depicts: 1. The ASH specific uninsured inpatient cost data (determined by multiplying the single total per diem by the number of uninsured inpatient days), 2. The payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to uninsured inpatient hospital services, and 3. The uninsured inpatient cost. 4. Adjustments to the calculated un insured inpatient and outpatient cost to estimate the uninsured inpatient and outpatient cost for a future state plan year. The Governmentally -Operated Hospital OBRA Limit The summation of the Medicaid shortfall (whether positive or negative) and the uni nsured costs (whether positive or negative) is the hospital's OBRA limit and is depicted on the OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. The summation of the estimated Medicaid shortfall (whether positive or negative) and the Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 99 Amended: January 18, 2017 estimated uninsured costs (whether positive or negative) is the hospital's OBRA limit for a future state plan year and is depicted on the Calculation of OBRA Limit and CPE on the OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. Certification The appropriate official of ASH will sign the certification statement on the OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. A certification statement will be signed for each of the three times the OBRA limit for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment is calculated as described below under \"Reconciliation\". Reconciliation The OBRA limit for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment will be computed for ASH three times: 1. The OBRA limit will be calculated in the state plan year of the initial DSH payment based on the cost report(s) and days and other program data for the state plan year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. This calculation may include an adjustment to the calculated OBRA limit of the state plan year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial DSH payment in order to estimate the OBRA limit of the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. 2. The OBRA limit will be recalculated when the cost report(s) for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment are filed. In recalculating the OBRA limit the cost data from the as- filed cost report(s) and program data (days and payments) from the actual cost reporting period(s) will be used in the calculation. This calculation may not include any adjustment to the calculated OBRA limit of the state plan year of the initial DSH. 3. The final calculation of ASH's OBRA limit will be performed when the cost report(s) for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment are finalized. In finalizing the OBRA limit the cost data from the finalized cost report(s) and program data (days and payme nts) from the actual cost reporting period(s) will be used in the calculation. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 100 Amended: January 18, 2017 EXHIBIT 3 to ATTACHMENT C AHCCCS Disproportionate Share Hospital Payment Methodology Pool Funding Amount This Exhibit contains the amount of funding for six pools in the Arizona DSH pool methodology. For State Plan Year (SPY) 2008 and 2009, funding will be allocated among six pools (pools 1, 1A, 2, 2A, 3, and 4). For SPY 2010, funding will be allocated among seven pools (pools 1, 1A, 2, 2A, 3, 4, and 5). For SPY 2011, S PY 2012, SPY 2013, SPY 2014, and SPY 2015 the funding will be allocated among six pools (pools 1, 1A, 2, 2A, 4, and 5). Pools 1, 1A, 2, 2A, and 3 - Non -governmentally -operated hospitals The funding for pools 1 and 2 will be sufficient to provide an avera ge payment amount of $6,000 for all hospitals qualifying for both of the two pools. No hospital in pools 1 or 2 will receive less than $5,000. Therefore, the amount of funding for pools 1 and 2 will be determined by multiplying the number of hospitals qual ifying for pools 1 and 2 by $6,000. The funding for pools 1A, 2A and 3 (if applicable) will be derived by subtracting the total amount allocated for pools 1 and 2 from the amount of DSH authorized by the Legislature for non- governmentally operated hospitals. Beginning SPY 2011, these remaining funds will be split with 15% for Pool 1A and 85% for Pool 2A. For SPY 2008, the funding for pools 1, 2, 1A, and 2A and 3 will be $26,147,700.

These supplemental CAH payments shall be made in addition to the other payments described in Attachments 4.19- A (inpatient hospi tal) and 4.19- B (outpatient hospital). Supplemental payments shall be made based on each CAH designated hospital's percentage of total inpatient and outpatient Title XIX reimbursement paid relative to other CAH designated hospitals for the time period from July 1 through June 30 of the previous year. AHCCCS will allocate the amount available through legislative appropriation in the following manner: (1) Gather all adjudicated claims/encounters with dates of service from July 1 through June 30 of the prior yea r for each CAH -designated hospital. (2) Sum the AHCCCS payments for inpatient and outpatient services for the year to establish a hospital -specific hospital paid amount. (3) Total all AHCCCS payments for inpatient and outpatient services for the year to establis h a total paid amount. (4) Divide the hospital paid amount by the total paid amount to establish the hospital's utilization percentage. (5) Divide the annual CAH appropriation by twelve to get the monthly CAH allocation. (6) Multiply each hospital's monthly relative utilization by the monthly CAH allocation to establish each hospital's monthly payment. Funding will be distributed based on the number of CAH -designated hospitals in each month and their Medicaid utilization. Because there may be a different num ber of CAH -designated hospitals each month, the hospital -specific weightings and payments may fluctuate from month to month. The calculations will be computed monthly and the distribution of the CAH dollars to the CAH- designated hospitals will be made twice a year. Attachment E Safety Net Care Pool Claiming Protocol Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 107 Amended: January 18, 2017 In accordance with the special terms and conditions (STC) Section VI, this Attachment E serves as the claiming protocol for Arizona's Safety Net Care Pool (SNCP) for Phoenix Children's Hospital (PCH) only through December 31, 2017. The protocol provides for the computation of the uncompensated care cost limit for Phoenix Children's Hospital through December 31, 2017. For each demonstration Year (DY), aggregate uncompensated care payments will be a distribution of the SNCP pool established in Section VI for each DY, and payments to each individual provider cannot exceed the uncompensated care cost lim it as determined by this cost claiming protocol for each DY. Generally, the uncompensated care cost limit is determined based on each provider's uncompensated costs pertaining to Section 1905(a) medical services furnished to Medicaid eligible and uninsure d individuals. Allowable patient care costs, consistent with Medicare and Medicaid cost principles and OMB Circular A -87, A -121, and A -122 where applicable, are identified using a CMS -approved cost report. Such costs are apportioned to the eligible Medicaid and uninsured services and then offset by all applicable revenues. SNCP payments made based on interim computation of the uncompensated care cost limit (using prior period cost data) must be subsequently limited to a recomputation of the uncompensated c are costs using the provider's as -filed and audited cost reports for the actual service period covered by the DY. Under no circumstances will total SNCP payments to PCH (eligible up to December 31, 2017) exceed the provider's uncompensated costs, as descr ibed in paragraph 32 and in this Attachment E. Hospital Inpatient and Outpatient Uncompensated Care Costs To be eligible for Federal financial participation (FFP), SNCP uncompensated care payments to PCH (eligible up to December 31, 2017) cannot exceed the uncompensated care costs as computed by the following steps: Interim Computation of Uncompensated Care Costs SNCP uncompensated care payments must be made to PCH on or before December 31, 2017. Each DY's SNCP will be distributed based on the provider's projected uncompensated care subject to the PCH Limit described in STC paragraph 27(c), to the extent that sufficient local matching funds are available. This interim computation of uncompensated care costs will be used as the basis for SNCP dis tribution and will also serve as the uncompensated care cost limit for SNCP payments made to the provider in each demonstration year. 1. The process of determining the hospital's interim uncompensated care cost limit begins with the use of each hospital's CM S 2552(s) filed with its Medicare contractor. The most recent CMS 2552 filed with the hospital's Medicare contractor will be utilized. 2. Per diem amount for each hospital routine cost center is computed by dividing: - The individual amounts on Worksheet B, P art I, Column 25, Lines (and where applicable subscripted lines) 25 to 33 of CMS 2552- 96 or Worksheet B, Part I, Column 24, Lines (and where applicable subscripted lines) 30- 43 of CMS Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 108 Amended: January 18, 2017 2552- 10 by- - The corresponding day totals on Lines (and where applicable subscripted lines) 5 through 11 and Line 14 (for inpatient hospital subproviders) from Worksheet S -3, Part I, Column 6 of CMS 2552- 96 or Lines 7 through 13 and Lines 16- 18 (for inpatient hospital subproviders) from Worksheet S -3, Part I, Column 8 of CMS 2552- 10 consistent with the instructions below regarding observation bed days. Note when computing the Adults and Pediatrics (General Routine Care) per diem, the amount on Worksheet B, Part I, Column 24, Line 25 of CMS 2552- 96 (Worksheet B, Part I, Column 25, Line 30 of CMS 2552- 10) should have deducted the amounts appearing on Worksheet D -1, Part I, Lines 26 and 36 (for swing bed and private room differential adjustments, respectively) of CMS 2552- 96 and CMS 2552- 10, and the amount on Worksheet S -3, Part I, Column 6, Line 5 of CMS 2552- 96 (Worksheet S -3, Part I, Column 8, Line 7 of CMS 2552- 10) should have added the amount appearing on Line 26 (observation bed days) of CMS 2552- 96 (Line 28 of CMS 2552- 10). Ancillary ratio of cost- to-charges (RCC) for each hospital ancillary cost center is computed by dividing: - The individual line and subscript amounts for each of the Lines 37 to 63, taken from Worksheet B, Part I, Column 25 of CMS 2552- 96 or the individual line and subscript amounts for each of t he Lines 50 to 93, taken from Worksheet B, Part I, Column 24 of CMS 2552- 10. - by - The individual line and subscript amounts for each of the Lines 37 to 63, taken from Worksheet C, Part I, Column 8 of CMS 2552- 96 or the individual line and subscript amounts for each of the Lines 50 to 93, taken from Worksheet C, Part I, Column 8 of CMS 2552- 10. (Note that the above cost report references are based on the CMS -2552- 96 and CMS 2552- 10. For later versions of the CMS -2552, the equivalent workshe ets, columns and lines should be identified.) 3. For each hospital routine cost center, the per diem amount computed in Step #2 is applied to the number of Medicaid and uninsured hospital inpatient days for the service period as defined in Step #1. Only hospital inpatient days are to be included; all days pertaining to long term care units or any other non- hospital units must be excluded. The number of Medicaid and uninsured hospital inpatient days must be derived from auditable sources, including the state's PMMIS, managed care encounter data, and provider patient accounting records. Hospital Medicaid and uninsured days are identified for each hospital routine cost center. The result is the facility's Medicaid and uninsured hospital routine cost. For each hospital ancillary cost center, the RCC computed in Step #2 is applied to the Medicaid and uninsured hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient ancillary charges for the Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 109 Amended: January 18, 2017 service period as defined in Step #1. Only hospital ancillary charges are to be included; all charges pertaining to non -hospital units, including Rural Health Clinics, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and clinics that are not recognized as hospital outpatient departments, must be excluded. The Medicaid and uninsured hospital ancillary char ges must be derived from auditable sources, including the state's PMMIS, managed care encounter data, and provider patient accounting records. Hospital Medicaid and uninsured ancillary charges are identified for each hospital ancillary cost center. The res ult is the facility's Medicaid and uninsured hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient ancillary cost. 4. The Medicaid and uninsured costs computed in Step #3 will be offset by all revenues received by the hospital for the Medicaid and uninsured hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient services, including but not limited to Medicaid FFS and supplemental payments made by AHCCCS; Medicaid payments made by health plans and program contractors; payments made by or on behalf of patients; payments made by thir d parties; and any other payments received by for uninsured services that are not excluded from offset under Section 1923(g)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act as state- only or local -only indigent care program payments. 5. The computed Medicaid and uninsured uncompensated care costs based on a prior period may be inflated to the current period using CMS market basket. Furthermore, the state may apply trending factors to account for changes in utilization (e.g., due to changes in Medicaid eligibility criteria) and Medicaid payment rates to ensure that interim uncompensated care costs approximate final uncompensated care costs for the current service period as closely as possible. Such trending factors must account for both increases and decreases affecting a provider's uncompensated care costs. 6. The hospital's Medicaid and uninsured costs must be further adjusted to remove costs related to non -emergency services furnished to unqualified aliens. For this purpose, the hospital's uncompensated care costs will be reduced by 12.88% to the extent that such unqualified alien non- emergency service costs are not fully reimbursed by DSH dollars. 7. For SNCP uncompensated care payments, the state must ensure that the payments made to hospitals are accounted for in the facility 's disproportionate share hospital (DSH) OBRA 93 hospital -specific limit. There cannot be any duplication of payments for the same hospital uncompensated care costs under the SNCP and under DSH. 8. The interim computation of hospital uncompensated care cost limit as described above uses the same prior period cost report and other relevant data as that used by the state in its initial OBRA 93 hospital- specific limit computation for DSH payments for the current DSH state Plan Rate Year. Interim Reconciliation Each hospital's uncompensated care costs must be recomputed based on the hospital's as-Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 110 Amended: January 18, 2017 filed cost report for the actual service period. The cost report is filed with the Medicare contractor five months after the close of the cost reporting period. SNCP uncompensated care payments made to the hospital for a DY cannot exceed the recomputed uncompensated care cost limit. If, at the end of the interim reconciliation process, it is determined that expenditures claimed exceeded the individual hospital's uncompensated care cost limit, the overpayment will be recouped from the hospital, and the federal share will be properly credited to the federal government. The interim reconciliation follows the same computation as outlined above in the Interim Computation of Uncompensated Care Costs steps, except that the per diems and RCCs, Medicaid and uninsured days and charges, and payment offset amounts used will pertain to the actual service period (rather than the prior period). Per diems and RCCs will be derived from the as- filed cost report; and Medicaid and uninsured days, charges and payments will be derived from the latest available auditable data for the service period. No trending factor will be applied. The uncompensated care costs must again be adjusted to rem ove costs related to non-emergency services furnished to unqualified aliens. The state must ensure that there is no duplication of payments for the same hospital uncompensated care costs under the SNCP and under DSH; SNCP payments must be accounted for in the hospital's OBRA 93 hospital -specific limit. A hospital's uncompensated care cost limit is determined for the twelve month period in each DY. Where a hospital's cost reporting period does not coincide with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year if the limits in paragraph 32(c) are stated for a partial DY or a calendar year), the uncompensated care costs computed for a cost reporting period can be allocated to the DY (or partial DY) based on the number of cost reporting months that overlap with the DY (o r partial DY). This is consistent with the methodology for the computation of the OBRA 93 hospital -specific limit for a given DSH State plan rate year. The interim reconciliation described above will be performed and completed within six months after the filing of the hospital Medicare cost report(s). Final Reconciliation Each hospital's uncompensated care costs must be recomputed based on the hospital's audited cost report for the actual service period. The cost report is audited and settled by the Medicare contractor to determine final allowable costs and reimbursement amounts as recognized by Medicare. SNCP uncompensated care payments made to the hospital for a DY cannot exceed the recomputed uncompensated care cost limit. If, at the end of the f inal reconciliation process, it is determined that expenditures claimed exceeded the individual hospital's uncompensated care cost limit, the overpayment will be recouped from the hospital, and the federal share will be properly credited to the federal government. The final reconciliation follows the same computation as outlined above in the Interim Computation of Uncompensated Care Costs steps, except that the per diems and RCCs, Medicaid and uninsured days and charges, and payment offset amounts used wil l pertain to the actual service period (rather than the prior period). Per diems and RCCS will be derived from the audited cost report, and Medicaid and uninsured days, charges and payments will be updated with the latest available auditable data for the s ervice period. No trending factor will Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 111 Amended: January 18, 2017 be applied. The uncompensated care costs must again be adjusted to remove costs related to non-emergency services furnished to unqualified aliens. The state must ensure that there is no duplication of payments for the same hospital uncompensated care costs under the SNCP and under DSH; SNCP payments must be accounted for in the hospital's OBRA 93 hospital - specific limit. A hospital's uncompensated care cost limit is determined for the twelve month period in each DY. Where a hospital's cost reporting period does not coincide with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year if the limits in paragraph 27(c) are stated for a partial DY or a calendar year), the uncompensated care costs computed for a cost reporting period can be allocated to the DY (or partial DY or calendar year ) based on the number of cost reporting months that overlap with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year ). This is consistent with the methodology for the computation of the OBRA 93 hospital -specific limit for a given DSH State Plan Rate Year. The final reconciliation described above will be performed and completed within six months after the audited hospital Medicare cost report(s) are made available. The final computation of hospital uncompensated care cost limit as described above uses the same final cost report and other relevant data as that used by the state in its final OBRA 93 hospital -specific limit computation for DSH payments for the given DSH State Plan Rate Year. Physician Professional S ervice Uncompensated Care Costs To be eligible for Federal financial participation (FFP), SNCP uncompensated care payments to each provider cannot exceed the uncompensated care costs as computed by the following steps. The eligible provider is Phoenix Chi ldren Hospital, which employ s and contract s for physician services and incur physician professional service costs (whether the professional services are billed by the hospital or by the physicians). Interim Computation of Uncompensated Care Costs SNCP uncompensated care payments will be made to PCH on or before December 31, 2017. Each DY's SNCP will be distributed based on the provider's projected uncompensated care subject to the PCH limit as described in STC paragraph 32(c), to the extent that su fficient local matching funds are available. This interim computation of uncompensated care costs will be used as the basis for SNCP distribution and will also serve as the uncompensated care cost limit for SNCP payments made to the provider in each demonstration year. 1. Steps for PCH incurring physician professional service costs a. The professional component of physician costs are identified from the hospital's CMS 2552 cost report Worksheet A -8-2, Column 4. The most recent CMS 2552 filed with the hospital's Medicare contractor will be utilized. These professional costs are: Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 112 Amended: January 18, 2017 1. Limited to allowable and auditable physician compensations that have been incurred by the hospital; 2. For the professional, direct patient care furnished by the hospital's physicians ; 3. Identified as professional costs on Worksheet A -8-2, Column 4 of the cost report of the hospital claiming payment (or, for registry physicians only, Worksheet A -8, if the physician professional compensation cost is not reported by the hospital on Workshe et A- 8-2 because the registry physicians are contracted solely for direct patient care activities (i.e., no administrative, teaching, research, or any other provider component or non- patient care activities); 4. Supported by a time study, accepted by Medicare for Worksheet A -8-2 reporting purposes, that identified the professional, direct patient care activities of the physicians (not applicable to registry physicians discussed above); and 5. Removed from hospital costs on Worksheet A-8. b. The professional costs on Worksheet A -8-2, Column 4 (or Worksheet A -8 for registry physicians) are subject to further adjustments and offsets, including any necessary adjustment to bring the costs in line with Medicare and Medicaid cost principles and applicable OMB Circulars. H owever, Medicare physician reasonable compensation equivalents are not applied for physician professional cost determination purposes. The professional costs are further subject to offsets to account for any applicable non- patient care revenues that were n ot previously offset or accounted for by the application of time study. The resulting costs represent the net allowable professional service costs incurred by the hospitals. c. Reimbursement for other professional practitioner service costs that have also been identified and removed from hospital costs on the Medicare cost report. The practitioner types to be included are: Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists Nurse Practitioners Physician Assistants Dentists Certified Nurse Midwives Clinical Social Work ers Clinical Psychologists Optometrists d. To the extent these practitioners' professional compensation costs are not included in Worksheet A -8-2, Column 4, but are removed from PCH costs through an A -8 adjustment on the Medi -Cal cost report, these costs may be recognized if they meet the following criteria: the practitioners must engage in the direct provision of care in addition to being Medicaid - qualified practitioners for whom the services are billable under Medicaid separate from PCH services; for all non physician practitioners there must be an identifiable and auditable data source by practitioner type; a CMS -approved time study must be employed to allocate practitioner Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 113 Amended: January 18, 2017 compensation between clinical and non- clinical costs; and the clinical costs resul ting from the CMS -approved time study are subject to further adjustments and offsets, including adjustments to bring the costs in line with Medicare cost principles and offset of applicable non -patient care revenues that were not previously offset or accou nted for by the application of CMS -approved time study. The resulting net clinical non -physician practitioner compensation costs are allowable costs. The compensation costs for each non -physician practitioner type are identified separately. e. Professional costs incurred for freestanding clinics (clinics that are not recognized as hospital outpatient departments on the 2552) are not included in this protocol. f. The hospital may additionally include physician support staff compensation, data processing, and patient accounting costs as physician -related costs to the extent that: 1. These costs are removed from hospital inpatient and outpatient costs because they have been specifically identified as costs related to physician professional services; 2. They are directly identified on ws A -8 as adjustments to hospital costs; 3. They are otherwise allowable and auditable provider costs; and 4. They are further adjusted for any non- patient -care activities such as research based on physician time studies. If these are rem oved as A -8 adjustments to the hospital's general service cost centers, these costs should be stepped down to the physician cost centers based on the accumulated physician professional compensation costs. Other than the physician and non- physician practitioner compensation costs and the A -8 physician -related adjustments discussed above, no other costs are allowed. g. Total billed professional charges by cost center related to physician services are identified from auditable provider records. Similarly, for ea ch non- physician practitioner type, the total billed professional charges are identified from provider records. Charges must be identified for all professional services for which PCH incurred its cost (whether salaried or contracted). Where the professional services are not billed by PCH directly, PCH must obtain those professional charges from the billing party. h. A physician cost to charge ratio for each cost center is calculated by dividing the total costs for each cost center as established in paragraphs a-f of subsection 1 by the total billed professional charges for each cost center as established in paragraph g of subsection 1. For each non -physician practitioner type, a cost to charge ratio is calculated by dividing the total costs for each practition er type as established in paragraphs a -f of subsection 1 by the total billed professional charges for each practitioner type as established in paragraph g of subsection 1. i. The total professional charges for each cost center related to eligible Medicaid and uninsured physician services are identified using auditable records. PCH must map the charges to their cost centers. Each charge may only be mapped to one cost center to prevent duplicate mapping and claiming. These charges must be associated with services Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 114 Amended: January 18, 2017 furnished during the period defined by paragraph a of subsection 1. For each non- physician practitioner type, the eligible Medicaid and uninsured professional charges are identified using auditable records. The hospital must map the charges to non- phys ician practitioner type. Each charge may only be mapped to one practitioner type to prevent duplicate mapping and claiming. These charges must be associated with services furnished during the period covered by the latest as -filed cost report. Auditable re cords include the state's PMMIS, managed care encounter data, and hospital records. j. The total Medicaid and uninsured costs related to physician practitioner professional services are determined for each cost center by multiplying total Medicaid and uninsu red charges as established in paragraph i of subsection 1 by the respective cost to charge ratio for the cost center as established in paragraph h of subsection 1. For each non- physician practitioner type, the total Medicaid and uninsured costs related to non- physician practitioner professional services are determined by multiplying total Medicaid and uninsured charges as established in paragraph i of subsection 1 by the respective cost to charge ratios as established in paragraph h of subsection 1. k. The t otal Medicaid and uninsured uncompensated care costs are determined by subtracting all revenues received for the Medicaid and uninsured physician/practitioner services from the Medicaid and uninsured costs as established in paragraph j of subsection 1. The revenues are derived from auditable records. All revenues received for the Medicaid and uninsured professional services will be offset against the computed cost; these revenues include but are not limited to all Medicaid payments from the state or its pro gram contractors, payments from or on behalf of patients, and payments from any other third party payer. The total professional service uncompensated care costs as computed above should be reduced by 12.88% to account for non- emergency care furnished to unqualified aliens. l. The Medicaid and uninsured physician/practitioner amount computed in paragraph k of subsection 1 above can be trended to current period to account for cost inflation based on CMS market basket update factor. Furthermore, the state may ap ply trending factors to account for changes in utilization (e.g., due to changes in Medicaid eligibility criteria) and Medicaid payment rates to ensure that interim uncompensated care costs approximate final uncompensated care costs for the current service period as closely as possible. Such trending factors must account for both increases and decreases affecting a provider's uncompensated care costs. (Note that the above cost report references are based on the CMS -2552- 96 and CMS 2552- 10. For later versions of the CMS -2552, the equivalent worksheets and columns should be identified.) Interim Reconciliation Each hospital's uncompensated care costs must be recomputed based on the as -filed cost report for the actual service period. The hospital cost re port is filed with the Medicare Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 115 Amended: January 18, 2017 contractor five months after the close of the cost reporting period. SNCP uncompensated care payments made to the hospital for a DY cannot exceed the recomputed uncompensated care cost limit. If, at the end of the interim r econciliation process, it is determined that expenditures claimed exceeded the individual hospital's uncompensated care cost limit, the overpayment will be recouped, and the federal share will be properly credited to the federal government. The interim re conciliation follows the same computation as outlined above in the Interim Computation of Uncompensated Care Costs steps, except that the RCCs, Medicaid and uninsured charges, payment offset amounts and any other relevant statistics such as time study or time study proxy data used will pertain to the actual service period (rather than the prior period). RCCs will be derived from the as -filed cost report; and Medicaid and uninsured charges and payments will be derived from the latest available auditable dat a for the service period. No trending factor will be applied. The uncompensated care costs must again be adjusted to remove costs related to non -emergency services furnished to unqualified aliens. A hospital's uncompensated care cost limit is determined f or the twelve month period in each DY. Where a hospital's cost reporting period does not coincide with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year if the limits in paragraph 32(c) are stated for a partial DY or a calendar year), the uncompensated care costs com puted for a cost reporting period can be allocated to the DY (or partial DY or calendar year ) based on the number of cost reporting months that overlap with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year ). The interim reconciliation described above will be performed and completed within six months after the filing of the cost report(s). Final Reconciliation Each hospital's uncompensated care costs must be recomputed based on the audited cost report for the actual service period. The hospital cost report is audited and settled by the Medicare contractor to determine final allowable costs and reimbursement amounts as recognized by Medicare. SNCP uncompensated care payments made to the hospital for a DY cannot exceed the recomputed uncompensated care cost limit . If, at the end of the final reconciliation process, it is determined that expenditures claimed exceeded the individual hospital's uncompensated care cost limit, the overpayment will be recouped, and the federal share will be properly credited to the federal government. The final reconciliation follows the same computation as outlined above in the Interim Computation of Uncompensated Care Costs steps, except that the RCCs, Medicaid and uninsured charges, payment offset amounts, and other relevant stat istics such as time study or time study proxy data used will pertain to the actual service period (rather than the prior period). RCCs will be derived from the audited cost report, and Medicaid and uninsured charges and payments will be updated with the la test available auditable data for the service period. No trending factor will be applied. The uncompensated care costs must again be adjusted to remove costs related to non-emergency services furnished to unqualified aliens. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 116 Amended: January 18, 2017 A hospital's uncompensated ca re cost limit is determined for the twelve month period in each DY. Where a hospital's cost reporting period does not coincide with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year if the limits in paragraph 27(c) are stated for a partial DY or calendar year), the u ncompensated care costs computed for a cost reporting period can be allocated to the DY (or partial DY or calendar year ) based on the number of cost reporting months that overlap with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year ). For hospital -incurred professi onal service uncompensated care costs, the final reconciliation described above will be performed and completed within six months after the audited hospital Medicare cost report(s) are made available. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 117 Amended: January 18, 2017 Attachment F IHS and 638 Facilities Uncompensated Care Payment Methodology The methodology outlined below has been approved for structuring a payment that will be made to IHS and 638 facilities that take in to account their uncompensated costs in furnishing specified types of care furnished by IHS and tribal 638 facilities to Medicaid - eligible individuals. Participating facilities must utilize the methodology described below in determining these payments to the facilities: Historical Data Methodology This methodology is comprised of the following that will be used to calculate the total dollar amount of uncompensated care that will be paid to IHS and 638 facilities on a prospective basis. The state will calculate a per member per month (PMPM) rate, using historical data, to reflect the se rvices that it removed from the Medicaid state plan effective October 1, 2010, that were furnished in or by IHS/tribal 638 facilities to AHCCCS -enrolled individuals, and would multiply this rate by the total number of adult AI/ANs currently enrolled in the AHCCCS program. This PMPM will be adjusted on an annual basis to mirror the medical inflation adjustment applied to the all -inclusive rate. Once this aggregate dollar amount has been computed, the state will disburse payments to the IHS and 638 facilitie s based on payments made to each facility for care provided to AI/AN adults from July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011. In addition, the state will annually review whether the PMPMs calculated above were accurate within a reasonable margin of error by reviewing actual records of services furnished by one or more facilities. If the PMPM is not validated, the state will apply an adjustment factor for the following year. As part of this methodology, the non -Federal share for services provided to non- nativ es would be calculated based on the following. 1. After analyzing claims data from 2009 -10, the state calculated a ratio of claims paid for currently covered Arizona Medicaid state plan services that were provided at IHS and 638 facilities to non- natives to t he total number of paid claims to IHS and 638 facilities. Using this ratio, the state calculated that approximately $2 million out of total claims paid to IHS facilities was for services provided to non- natives. As such, the state will pay the non -Federal share of the $2 million. The state will review the claims data on an annual basis and will adjust the non- Federal share amount accordingly. 2. The state will apply the ratio that was calculated of non -native costs to total IHS costs as described above to calculate the non -Federal portion of the service PMPM payments as described above. Monthly Payment Calculation - Services Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 118 Amended: January 18, 2017 Adult Per Member Per Month Service Funding $15.11 Total Number of AI/AN Adults Enrolled with AHCCCS 56,851 May Services Payment $859,018.61 Total May Payment to I.H.S and 638 Facilities (Eligibility + Services) $3,920,484.61 Facility A - Allocation - 1% $39,204.85 Facility B - Allocation - 5% $196,024.23 Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 119 Amended: January 18, 2017 Attachment G AHCCCS CARE Operational Protocol Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2021 120 Amended January 18, 2017 Attachment H TARGETED INVESTMENTS PROGRAM DSHP CLAIMING PROTOCOL DSHP Claiming Protocol 1. State Documentation of DSHP Expenditures. Documentation made available by the State for CMS review for quarterly DSHP expenditures will include the agency, program, provider(s), payment amount(s), and relevant provider costs as described below. 2. Offsets. In accordance with the STC, DSHP expenditures submitted to CMS will not include: a. Grant funding to test new models of care b. Construction costs (bricks and mortar) c. Room and board expenditures d. Animal shelters and animal vaccines e. School based programs for children f. Unspecified projects g. Debt relief and restructuring h. Costs to close facilities i. HIT/HIE expenditures j. Services provided to undocumented individuals k. Sheltered workshops l. Research expenditures m. Rent and/or Utility Subsidies that are normally funded by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or other state/local rental assistance programs n. Prisons, correctional facilities, services for incarcerated individuals and services provided to individuals who are civilly committed and unable to leave o. Revolving capital fund p. Expenditures made to meet a maintenance of effort requirement for any federal gran t program q. Administrative costs r. Cost of services for which payment was made by Medicaid or CHIP (including from managed care plans) s. Cost of services for which payment was made by Medicare or Medicare Advantage t. Funds from other federal grants u. Needle- exchange programs v. Abortions that would not be allowable if furnished under Medicaid or CHIP w. Costs associated with funding federal matching requirements. To ensure DSHP expenditures do not include costs associated with providing coverage of non-emergency services to undocumented immigrants, the State will reduce actual Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2021 121 Amended January 18, 2017 expenditures by the proportion of the AHCCCS population enrolled in the Emergency Services Program (ESP), which is 6.3%. This adjustment is the undocumented immigrant offset. 3. Financial Data Reporti ng. The Arizona Financial Information System (AFIS) is the accounting system of record for the state of Arizona. Payment voucher information is entered into AFIS by AHCCCS and ADES. All payments made by the state are processed in AFIS. AFIS expenditure data is the basis for identifying the total DSHP expenditure, prior to applying offsets. For DSHP services to individuals with Serious Mental Illness, AHCCCS' total reportable DSHP expenditures start with the amounts AHCCCS paid the Regional Behavioral H ealth Authorities (RBHAs) as reported in AFIS. RBHAs provide quarterly financial reports to AHCCCS that identify specific, actual expenditures. These reports are the basis for identifying and calculating offsets as discussed below to reduce the total rep ortable DSHP expenditures. For early intervention developmentally disabled DSHP services, ADES' total reportable DSHP expenditures tart with the amount of ADES paid to its contracted providers as reported in AFIS. ADES will identify and calculate offsets as discussed below to reduce the total reportable DSHP expenditures. 4. Designated State Health Programs Detail Services to Individuals with Serious Mental Illness State Agency: AHCCCS Program: Services to Individuals with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) Funding Source: Intergovernm ental Agreement (IGA) Funds provided by Maricopa County and Pima County. Brief Description: Two counties in Arizona provide funds to AHCCCS via Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) to provide services to non- Medicaid individuals with Serious Mental Illnes s (SMI). AHCCCS contracts with managed care organizations called Regional Behavioral Health Authorities (RBHAs), who contract with providers for case management, peer support and planning, community based supports, medication management services, and othe r medical services. Funding flows from the counties, to AHCCCS, to RBHAs, and then to providers. Eligible Population: Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2021 122 Amended January 18, 2017 The program serves individuals who request behavioral health services, are determined eligible to receive SMI services, and are determ ined not eligible for Medicaid/CHIP. An individual is determined eligible to receive SMI services if they have a qualifying SMI diagnosis and functional impairment caused by the diagnosis. Qualifying diagnoses include anxiety, bipolar, major depressi on, obsessive -compulsive, dissociative, personality, psychotic, and post -traumatic stress disorders. Functional impairment means long -term dysfunction in one of the following domains: (1) inability to live in an independent or family setting without super vision, (2) risk of serious harm to self or others, (3) dysfunction in role performance, or (4) risk of deterioration. Individuals are evaluated for SMI eligibility by a clinician and receive an initial SMI evaluation and a final SMI eligibility determina tion. When an individual requests to receive behavioral health services they are also required to participate in a preliminary financial screening and eligibility process to identify third party payers and determine if they are eligible for Medicaid/CHI P, including submission of an application and completion of the eligibility determination process. If an individual receives an SMI determination, but does not qualify for Medicaid/CHIP, they are eligible to receive services under this program. An indivi dual does not qualify for Medicaid/CHIP if they have household income or assets in excess of the following thresholds, do not meet residency requirements, and/or do not otherwise qualify for categorical eligibility: Eligibility Criteria: Income < Assets > Children 200% FPL - Adults 133% FPL - Pregnant Women 156% FPL - Long -Term Care 300% FBR $2,000 SSI 100% FBR $2,000 SSI - Funding: Services provided to non -Title XIX individuals with SMI may be funded by the County IGAs, Mental Health Block Grant, Substance Abuse Block Grant, or State General Fund. This DSHP reflects only the County IGAs, and so excludes other federal and state sou rces of funding. Two Arizona counties (Maricopa and Pima) provide approximately $60 million annually for this state -only program. Funding and associated expenditures are contained within AHCCCS. The counties provide funding to AHCCCS on a monthly basis in accordance with IGAs. These County IGA funds do not serve to meet any maintenance of effort requirement or federal matching requirement for any federal program. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2021 123 Amended January 18, 2017 No copayments or fees are charged to this population and so patient payments do not offset the cost of providing services or provide revenue for the program. In some cases, individuals not eligible for Medicaid/CHIP may have third- party coverage that covers all or a portion of behavioral health services. RBHAs and behavioral health providers are required to determine third party health insurance coverage prior to providing services under this program and are responsible for cost avoiding by coordinating benefits. If third -party liability is identified after services have been provided, RBHAs and providers are responsible for post -payment recovery. All expenditures reported for this program are net of any TPL revenue that is collected. Eligible Providers: The State makes monthly installment payments based on the annual contract amount to RBH As under existing non- Medicaid services contracts. RBHAs contract with behavioral health providers, who provide direct services. On a quarterly basis, RBHAs report back to AHCCCS on the actual services provided in the form of RBHA financial statements. AHCCCS' monthly payments to the RBHAs are reconciled to actual RBHA expenditures. Documentation and Claiming Process: Step 1 AHCCCS Division of Business and Finance (DBF) identifies actual expenditures of County IGA funds to RBHAs based on appropriation, fund, and sub- fund account codes as recorded in AFIS. This methodology excludes all federal funds and State General Fund expenditures. The identified amount is the initial, unadjusted DSHP expenditure, which reflects costs incurred by AHCCCS in making p ayments to the RBHAs specifically for the County IGA program. Step 2 On a quarterly basis, each RBHA submits a Statement of Activities that reports expenses by funding source, including the County IGA program. AHCCCS Division of Health Care Management (D HCM) reviews the quarterly RBHA financial statements for the period and identifies IGA funds paid to the RBHAs that were not used to provide SMI services and/or were used to provide services that are not permissible as DSHP expenditures, per Section 2. The DSHP expenditure is reduced by these amounts. The following expenditures are excluded because they are not for SMI services: Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2021 124 Amended January 18, 2017 General Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services to non -SMI Adults Children's Services to Remanded Juveniles Central City A ddiction Recovery Center (CCARC) Services The following expenditures are excluded because they are not DSHP eligible: Room and Board Services Services provided to residents of an Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD) Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Costs RBHA Administrative Costs Step 3 AHCCCS DBF applies the 6.3% undocumented immigrant offset on the DSHP expenditure adjusted by Step 2. The DSHP expenditure is reduced by this amount. Step 4 AHCCCS prepares a summary schedule that identifies the in itial, unadjusted DSHP expenditure in AFIS (Step 1), shows the reductions for funds paid to RBHAs that were not used to provide SMI services and/or were used to provide services that are not permissible as DSHP expenditures (Step 2), and shows the 6.3% undocumented immigrant offset (Step 3). The final amount is the adjusted, eligible DSHP payment. An example summary schedule is attached. Step 5 The State submits a claim to CMS for FFP based on the total computable expenditure incurred by the State in making the eligible DSHP payment. Step 6 The State attests expenditures used are correct and verifiable as DSHP allowable. Process occurs quarterly based on quarterly financial reporting. Reductions/Offsets for Non -Matchable Expenditure List: The reporta ble DSHP expenditures incurred by AHCCCS as reported in AFIS are evaluated for the non- matchable expenditures listed in Section 2 and in the AHCCCS STCs. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2021 125 Amended January 18, 2017 Any DSHP expenditures reported from AFIS already exclude expenditures that are funded by federal gr ants or federal financial participation and other non- state, non- local government funding or revenue sources. Expenditures for this program are not utilized to meet the state maintenance of effort requirements for the Mental Health Block Grant and Subst ance Abuse Block Grant, and so do not need to be reduced or offset for this purpose. The following DSHP ineligible expenditures are offsets/reductions that apply to this program. Room and Board Services Services provided to residents of an Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD) Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Costs RBHA Administrative Costs These are expenditures for services that are not Medicaid -like or for non- medical services. Finally, actual expenditures are reduced by the undocumented immigrant offset amount to exclude costs associated with non -emergency services provided to undocumented immigrants. Developmentally Disabled Services State Agency: Arizona Department of Economic Security (ADES) Program: Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) Funding Source: State General Fund Appropriation Brief Description: The Arizona Department of Economic Security (ADES) Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) provides state -only early intervention and home and community based services to individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid. Annual funding of approximately $16.8 million is provided by a state general fund appropriation. DDD directly contracts with independent providers for early intervention services, day treatment, habilitation, residential group homes, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy. Eligible Population: The target population is primarily children, specifically the early intervention population aged 0 to 3 with, or at risk of, developmental delays. Developmental delays are based on diagnostic criteria in the areas of physical, cognitive, language/communication, social/emotional, and adaptive self -help childhood development. Individuals must be Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2021 126 Amended January 18, 2017 ineligible for Medicaid in order to receive state -only services. Children are ineligible for Medicaid primarily due to household income or assets in excess of established limits. Some individuals may have other insurance, in which cases state -only funding may function as the payer of last resort. Funding: The source of non- federal revenue is an annual state general fund appropria tion. DDD exchanges a file with AHCCCS to identify individuals who are Medicaid- eligible and for whom Medicaid should pay for services, and providers must bill Medicaid first. For individuals with third party coverage, providers must bill insurance firs t and DDD requires documentation of the denial of those claims in order to process a state -only payment. All expenditures for this program are net of costs that were avoided or revenues recovered. IDEA Part C is not a funding source for this program. However, ADES DDD reports these state- only expenditures to the Arizona Department of Education in order to demonstrate compliance with state Maintenance of Effort requirements for IDEA Part C. Eligible Providers: ADES DDD contracts with independent providers for early intervention services, day treatment, habilitation, residential group homes, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy. Documentation and Claiming Process: Step 1 ADES submits data summary table to AHCCCS that iden tifies actual expenditures based on appropriation, fund, and sub- fund account codes as recorded in AFIS. This amount is the initial, unadjusted DSHP expenditure. These identified expenditures are expenditures incurred by ADES in making medical service payments to contracted providers for the DDD program. Step 2 ADES submits data summary table to AHCCCS that identifies actual expenditures based on service category to AHCCCS, including identification of the amount of expenditures for Room and Board services. The DSHP expenditure is reduced by this amount. Step 3 ADES submits data summary table to AHCCCS that identifies state expenditures reported as Maintenance of Effort (MOE) for the IDEA Part C federal grant. The DSHP expenditure is reduced by this amount. MOE is calculated once annually and offset is applied in a single quarter. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2021 127 Amended January 18, 2017 Step 4 AHCCCS applies the 6.3% undocumented immigrant offset on the DSHP expenditure as adjusted by Step 2 and Step 3. The DSHP expenditure is reduced by this amount. Step 5 AHCCCS prepares a summary schedule that identifies the initial, unadjusted DSHP expenditure in AFIS (Step 1), shows the reduction for Room and Board expenditures (Step 2), shows the reduction for IDEA Part C MOE (Step 3), and shows the 6.3% undocumented immigrant offset (Step 4). The final amount is the adjusted, eligible DSHP payment. Step 6 The State submits a claim to CMS for FFP based on the total computable expenditure incurred by the State in making the eligible DSHP payment. Step 7 The State attests expenditures used are correct and verifiable as DSHP allowable. Reductions/Offsets for Non -Matchable Expenditure List: Any DSHP expenditures reported from AFIS already exclude expenditures that are funded by federal grants or federal financial participation and other non- state, non- local government funding or revenue sources. Actual expenditures are reduced by Room and Board expenditures. These are the only expenditures for services that are not Medicaid -like. The expenditures re ported in AFIS do not include any payments made by ADES for non- medical services. Actual expenditures are reduced by the expenditures reported as MOE for the IDEA Part C grant program. Process occurs quarterly and IDEA Part C MOE offset is calculated annually and applied to a single quarter. Finally, actual expenditures are reduced by the undocumented immigrant offset amount to exclude costs associated with services provided to undocumented immigrants. "}
