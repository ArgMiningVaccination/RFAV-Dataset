She is also an affiliate of the Center for Infectious Disease Modeling and Analysis (CIDMA) at the Yale School of Public Health. Dr. Fitzpatrick is an infectious disease transmission modeler. She applies these models to assess infectious disease control strategies, with particular focus on evaluating the cost-effectiveness of vaccines. Her research combines methods from economics and decision sciences with these epidemiological models, to provide policy recommendations and support evidence-based decision-making. Her research priorities include evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics against RSV, rotavirus, and pertussis, as well as strategies to reduce maternal and infant mortality in low-income settings. Additional pathogens of interest have included rabies, influenza, HIV, Zika, and Ebola. Currently, Dr. Fitzpatrick is also supporting the response to the SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 pandemic. Her work has projected the impact of unmitigated transmission on healthcare systems, highlighted the importance of measures that prevent infectious spread during the presymptomatic phase, estimated vaccine impact, and evaluated strategies to make K-12 educational environments safer.
