This includes people with prolonged post -COVID -19 symptoms and applies to primary series, additional primary doses, and booster doses . People with known current SARS -CoV-2 infection should defer vaccination at lastuntil recovery from the acute illness (if symptoms were present) has been achieved and criteria to discontinue isolation have been met. Current evidence about the optimal timing between SARS -CoV-2 infection and vaccination is insufficient to inform guidance.CDC Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines: Appendix A.
