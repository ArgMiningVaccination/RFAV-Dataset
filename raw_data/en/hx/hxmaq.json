About Colleen Published Works ARTICLES Awards/Nominations POETRY Well, I was going to write on something completely different today and really, I'm in perfect turmoil about actually giving more air time to this guy named Roissy http://roissy.wordpress.com/2008/08/11/i-hate-bachelorette-parties/. However, I happened to read his blog and had several thoughts of my own. The guy knows how to use his words to incite, inflame and I suppose invigorate his readers (imagine manly men here). He has some points about bachelorette parties where women do stupid games and become sexually suggestive/aggressive. But yikesorama, how oh how, does this paint these particular guys who cheer Roissy, bed a different woman every night, and eschew marriage as being in a better light? Here are a few examples of the male superiority exhibited in this blog: All I want to do when I see the girl wearing the white veil is shoot a load of my hot spunk in her hair until she's crying that I've ruined her $300 wedding coif. Wow... Your hot spunk. Well that's obviously the more highbrow response that in no way whatsoever is as immature and animalistic as what these women do. He goes on to say that bachelorette parties come in two types: the bride is the hottest in the bunch or the ugliest. Maybe he should stop looking at everything through his Roissy colored beer glasses. Don't get me wrong; I have never been out on such a low grade, cheesy bachelorette party (a lot seem to take place in Texas?) and they're tacky but when he says, In my experience, bachelorette parties are dead-ends for pickup, it sounds an awful lot like, wah wah, sour grapes that I can't find a bride to be to screw right now and add another notch to my studly belt. I've written erotica and edited for erotic publishers but I learned a new word today: cockblocking; when a woman's friend stops her drunken buddy from going off to screw with any dog boy looking for a place to put his bone. I guess I just don't frequent those high class joints with women rubbing crotch to crotch with guys, or where guys are down on the ground with their noses up everyone's skirts. (Thank god!) Here is where I think Roissy is actually trying on purpose and fairly obviously to incite his readers. He's probably married with children but likes to stir the pot from his armchair: There is no good reason for a girl who is about to vow sexual fidelity to the man she loves for the rest of her life to suck from a veiny penis-shaped straw and dare horny drunk men to bite candies from the necklace nestled in her cleavage. (The bachelor party is perfectly acceptable because men sacrifice a lot more when they get married.) Excuse me while I laugh at this ludicrous image. Women should of course be chaste and sweet and at home cooking and warming the man's slippers/bed and never have a wild moment, but men...well men are supposed to thump their chests, scratch their large and pendulous balls and swing from the trees picking up every Jane and giving her a good fuck to confirm their manly virility even if they are going to be shackled to one woman for the rest of their lives. Because they lose soooo much more. Personally, low class girls and low class guys (as exhibited in Roissy's tales) deserve each other. Roissy does wisely say: Word to the wise: $20K on an engagement ring won't banish the inner whore from your dearly beloved. Save your money. And likewise, the guy who does or doesn't have his engagement/wedding ring on is also playing with his inner whore. Somehow it's always a woman who is a slut, whore, skank if she sleeps around, but a man...oh he's just being manly and sewing his oats. It's too bad Roissy's most riled up because these types of women act exactly like the men he likes to hang out with. Looking in the mirror is sometimes a bit of an eye opener, isn't it? In my book, skanky bachelor and bachelorette parties that have the soon to be married trawling bars for cheap sex thrills tells me these people have too many doubts to be getting married. And friends that egg them on...aren't really friends. But there is one big saving grace in Roissy's blog and many of the commenters; they hate marriage. Hopefully this will keep them from breeding and making more egotistical men and women who think their world is a better place of crotch cruising. Me, I guess I'll just keep going to the places that actually seem to have people in them, that have neither bachelor nor bachelorette parties. Sure there are always the guys out to get laid (and women too) but anyone with any sense can usually figure that out and decide if it's a good venture. There are classier ways to do it than fingering someone at the bar too. And yeah, I now feel superior about my attitude but only because I like to think that I have taste. 2 Comments Posted in culture, entertainment, humor, relationships, sex | Tags: bachelor party, bachelorette, bars, cockblocking, cockteasing, crotch cruising, culture, manly men, Roissy, sex, skank, weddings, whore, woman's place Posted by: colleenanderson | August 11, 2008 Conservation: Working on a Way of Life I have been working on lessening my carbon footprint since I was a teenager, long before there were all the fancy catchwords that included \"go green,\" \"eco\" this and that, and \"carbon footprint.\" Recycling was the biggest, newest buzz word. As a teenager I had already read about the Gaia Hypothesis so I had a concern for the planet and pollution. About all I was doing at that stage was trying not to litter. It was a small start, but a start. Over the years I never threw anything out that could be re-used. It makes me a bit of a pack-rat and I have sometimes had old computer monitors or printers on my floor for a year before I could find a home for them. I can't bear to put working or perfectly good items into the landfill. I also stopped cleaning with abrasive, chemically enhanced cleansers. I clean with baking soda, almost exclusively, using low phosphate detergent and soaps and rags and cloth napkins instead of paper towels and napkins. I started using cosmetics not tested on animals but I'm probably still eating/wearing my fair share of lead and other toxic chemicals, which are not yet regulated for cosmetics. That's something I hope to work on soon. Unfortuanately I still drive, but my attempts to change that to something more fuel and energy efficient are being thwarted at the moment. (Previous blog entries cover public transportation, carbon tax and cars.) I also try to avoid the overpackaging that supermarkets give. This includes bringing a cloth bag, or if I have just a few items, carrying them out in my hands or my purse. Also, the \"buy this 24-pack of cookies/chips\" prepackaging is something I studiously avoid. Instead of paying more for all that extra bagging of chips, which are then placed in a cardboard tray and shrink wrapped, I'll buy a large bag of salad greens, or nuts or whatever, and then re-use plastic containers and bags that I do have at home. I haven't bought a container in years, nor prepakaged thingamagooeys. I rewash plastic cups from parties and put out bags to recycle bottles and plastic. I don't wash my clothes or dishes until I have a full load. I don't wear animal furs but I do wear leather. Shoes just don't work well made of plastic or as long if made of cloth. But I do wear my shoes until they wear out, and try to fix them as long as I can. I could compost more, but my garbage during the garbage strike was only one small grocery bag every three weeks. I don't buy wrapping paper anymore and do re-use what people give me. But I also keep old calendars and use the pictures on those as wrapping. I also make re-usable cloth bags. I save buttons off of shirts and turn clothes into rags if they can't be sent off to a goodwill store. Am I perfect? Hell no. There are many ways I could improve especially when it comes to the car, though I do walk if I'm in my neighborhood. I try to keep an eye on what I do and improve it. For my own health and for my environment, I'll look further into safe cleaners, nontoxic cosmetics and rechargeable batteries. Right now, I save batteries and take them to recycling facilities. If we all try a little bit, it can make the environment a lot better for everyone and everything. It still saddens me when people toss things because they \"can't be bothered\" or are too lazy. That's fine if you're living on your own world, but not when you're sharing with everyone else. In BC, you can contact the Recycling Council of BC's recycling hotline on what to do with various items. http://www.rcbc.bc.ca/index.htm No Comments yet...

My brain is half empty from drinking at a BBQ last night. I could write about the opening of the Olympics but I've already done one rant, and I just don't care. I could write about the really bad drivers I had to deal with this morning but I can't work up my vim. I could write about life but I'm kinda tired. So... I'll just do a wee catchup on writing. For Aberrant Dreams http://www.hd-image.com/fiction.htm I have accepted two new stories: \"Exposure at Dejima\" by K. Bird Lincoln, which takes place in medieval Japan and is a touching tale of love, kamis and presenting a particular face to society. The other is \"Rhindor's Remission\" by William Argyle, a wonderful, humanist tale about an old wizard who just doesn't care anymore. Unfortunately I'm not sure when they'll go up on the site. We're a bit behind but catching up on the backlog and should be caught up by the end of September. That's for fantasy. Joe Dickerson has finished with the anthologies so he'll be devoting more time to the site. I'll soon be helping out at Chizine http://www.chizine.com/ as one of the two assistant poetry editors to Sandra Kasturi. That should start in the next month. I finally sent my bio in to Sandra. And I finally, finallyfinished a story I started fifteen years ago. My gods. It's a novelette called \"Awaking Pandora,\" and it is the grist for the mill. I'm going to be tossing it to the wolves, or two (hopefully) writerly friends who can give me feedback. I've been looking at bits and pieces for so long that I need other perspectives on the story. I have a fair number of stories that I start and then they languish. Usually, it's because I have a germ of an idea, a setting, a world, even a what-if. But often I have no solution to the conflict, no way to resolve the story. My bane; getting my conflicts down. It's for this reason that I don't think I could ever write a mystery and I quite admire the minds that do. To resolve all those puzzle pieces is like a finely woven tapestry. My Kama Sutra story will finally be out at the end of the month in The Mammoth Book of the Kama Sutra. I'm looking forward to seeing it and barely remember the story right now. I've also still been managing to write 200 words of fiction a day, though yesterday was more bits of rewrite so I may have to write extra today. And this weekend I'll be starting on the antagonist for my novel, writing his first chapter and seeing how that goes. I've been ruminating for weeks and I'm still trying to come up with a good name for him. But that can change anywhere along the way. Oh yeah, and I wrote a new poem this week, titled \"A Good Catch.\" Rhea Rose and I sometimes work on a poem by picking a word/object/phrase and then we put both of them into a poem. So I gave \"fish scales\" and Rhea gave \"spoons.\" We have each written a poem that has those images in some way. The poem in Chizine, \"The Trials of Lemons\" was conceived this way with the images of lemons and of dragonflies. It's fun to mesh them and think along new paths. Now, I'm going to work on another half-finished story. No Comments yet...

Bird Lincoln, Mammoth Book of the Kama Sutra, story conflict Posted by: colleenanderson | August 7, 2008 Piercing Situations Somehow yesterday I got thinking about my piercings. When I was sixteen I had my ears pierced. What might have been unusual about this was that my family doctor did it. I doubt anyone would think of going to their GP these days or even that one might consider piercing someone's ears, but when I had mine done it was only the nasty piercing guns that blasted away some of the flesh on the way through. I went in and my doctor put a bit of freezing on my lobes, then poked a needle through. I walked around with loops of surgical thread (thick surgical thread) through my ears for weeks. When I finally put earrings in I had these little diamond (quartz/rhinestone really) studs. And then I suffered as the cheap earrings flaked off into my ears and if I didn't already have it I developed a nickel allergy. My ears puffed up and turned red and crusty. Pretty icky. I eventually bought some silver rings and put those in. This first piercing experience and the loops of thread reminded me of being in Nepal, seeing the young girls (as early as four) walking around with small pieces of wood keeping their earholes open. Since many people are poor I presumed that they couldn't yet afford rings for their girl's ears but pierced ears were so much part of Nepalese culture. And that's just it. Poking things into or through our skin, or decorating it has been something we've been doing since humanity first grabbed that shiny or bright object and started designing. Other cultures have laced things through their noses and lips and chests and genitalia. North American counter culture picked up the piercing traditions of many tribal and African countries. So no matter how trendy, on the edge, neo-goth, punk, burlesque, tribal we've made ourselves here, there was someone else who did it first, probably centuries earlier. The second time I had one ear pierced, I was not the first, not even in Calgary. I was one of the very few though, especially in Calgary. And that piercing was done with a gun. Ouch. Took a year to heal. Then I went to India where I entertained having my nose pierced, not with the stud through the nostril flesh, but a ring through the septum. I didn't get that done but when I came back I ended up having my other ear pierced again. So I have two holes, close together on the left ear. The right ear has two holes but the second is right before the upper curve. About three or four years ago I saw a friend in the States who I hadn't seen in a while. She had this really cute diamond stud above her lip, like a beauty mark. It looked great on her and on a spur of the moment kind of thing (with a bit of research on studios) I went in and had a Monroe piercing done. Of all the piercings this one was the most irritating and if I had known the nuisance it would be, I probably wouldn't have had it done. It's also a bad one for wearing at teeth though I haven't had that problem yet. The piercing itself did not hurt but I kept catching the back on my teeth and pulling it through the flesh. It seems I have an especially thin lip and went in for downsizing three times while it healed. Again the piercing didn't hurt but my gums were so sore for the first week or two, from the stud back (a flat piece) rubbing up and down any time I talked or moved my mouth. Before I finally had the final size (and mine is shorter than most other people's) I would still catch the stud on my teeth. A very disconcerting feeling. The other annoyance was that any time you have a piercing right on the front of your face, your fingers get in the way and you can't see what you're doing if you have to put in a new piercing. The stud goes through the flesh and the screw is the head/jewel of the piercing and it is incredibly tiny and hard to hold with the wee screw part sticking out. Couple that with trying to get something through the inside of your lip that isn't made for turning inside out to the mirror and you have frustration city. This might not be a big deal but a lot of talking or kissing seems to unscrew the thing. The first nine months of having the Monroe it seemed to unscrew itself a lot. And where did it do this? In restaurants in the dark about 90% of the time. Amazingly, I've found the head every single time. I carry a spare for the time that I don't find it. I need a few more though. The worst was when it dropped out in a restaurant at lunch and I couldn't get the head back on. A half hour later I tried to get a friend to do it but I couldn't get the stud through the flesh. The hole had already started to close up and I had to go down to the studio three hours later. That hurt like a damn when they had to thread the stud through again, and that was nine months after the piercing. So yes, it was a pain in the ass. I could go to the flatter nose screw that my friend used in hers, but once I downsize I can't use the bigger pieces again. I need to decide that before I spend more money. Since I went through all the effort to heal, there was no way I was going to get the thing taken out...not until it starts damaging my teeth. I have friends who have had all sorts of body parts pierced: brows, tongues, lips, septums, bridges, backs, necks, nipples, navels, labia, hoods, scrotum, penis...you name it. I think I'm done. But then I thought that before the Monroe. No Comments yet...

The first month I spent in a tribal state with a friend and the second I travelled through northern India and Nepal. There are many tales from that trip but this one takes place in the last two weeks. I was in Delhi and sick as a dog with dysentery. I was puking, had diarrhea and generally could not eat. But I tried to see a couple of things and finally dragged myself out one day. I can't remember but I think I went to the Red Fort. I bargained with a rickshaw driver for a price. This was one of the motorized rickshaws and when we finally agreed on a price, I said to the driver, that's for both directions, there and back? And he agreed. So off we went. When we arrived, he asked how long I would be, and I said an hour or two. I had no idea because it was a large site and I was still pretty sick and lethargic. So I wandered around and took pictures and then came out about an hour and a half later. The driver started berating me, standing with about eight other drivers, saying I'd taken too long and that it would cost more, etc. After some arguing, with the other drivers giving their opinions in his support, I couldn't take it and felt ganged up on so I took out half the money for half the trip and gave it to him and then went and got a bicycle rickshaw. By this point I was completely distraught and depressed and didn't even pay attention to anything. I just let the driver take me back to the hostel. Except the hostel was off of Connaught Circle (can you see British influence in that name?), a gigantic traffic circle with radial roads. Far too much traffic zooms through there so bicycle rickshaws must stop at stands at the edge of the circle so as not to interrupt traffic flow. We arrived at the stop, I paid the rickshaw driver and started to walk when I heard \"memseeb, memseeb.\" I turned and there was the motorized rickshaw driver with two cops. At that point I completely freaked out. I started crying and shouting at them, holding my wrists together to them saying things like, \"Just lock me up. Your country is trying to destroy me. Go ahead and take me away.\" The cops were so flabbergasted I don't think they said two words to me and in truth I never even tried to argue reasonably. I'd already seen how the baksheesh (bribe) system worked. I continued crying and took all the money from my wallet and threw it at them. Then I went and sat on a wall and bawled my eyes out. I don't know how long I was there crying but the police made the rickshaw driver give me back any money above what he'd asked (I presume-I never counted it.) He gingerly placed it at my feet when I yelled at him and asked why he didn't just take everything. Then they went away. I stayed and cried and cried. I had been ill for three weeks at this point and was in fact my sickest in Delhi and Varanasi. Eventually I noticed about six men standing around me in concern as I cried, asking, \"Memsahib, what is wrong?\" To which I wailed, \"Nothing. Your country is just trying to keep me here.\" I wasn't exactly in my right mind. I eventually got up and walked disconsolately back to my hostel. At one point a beggar came up to me and touched me. I already knew that in India people don't touch each other unless they think you don't know the culture. It's a sign of disrespect. The beggar touching me was just another injurious straw. At that point I was so distressed with the day that I said, \"Oh just go die. It's easier.\" To a beggar. A child. Because I wanted to. It was not one of my more stellar moments. India was the hardest place I ever travelled to, where nothing ran on time, bribes were expected, and no one would say they didn't know something so you could end up with six directions to get somewhere and none of them would be right. The culture was different enough and the concept of time was hard to grasp. With trying to fathom these things, on top of trying to find signs, which were few, and if they were there they were in Urdu or Hindu, as well as being severely sick and carrying an overburdened pack, it was too much. I learned something about myself in India. I found my melting point and my darker side. But I came back from my trip and was forever changed. This of course wasn't my only adventure in India but it was my hardest. We wear a lot of masks in our society. There are ones for work, for friends, for dates, for family. Sometimes there are layers and layers of masks. I had them when I went to India but I had way fewer when I came back. India stripped me down to an essential aspect of myself. I truly was just surviving the experience by the end of the trip and was sick for another month after I returned. To this day, I have fewer masks. India made me integrate myself and my different aspects. Everyone gets much more a blend of me these days. I remember one friend telling me I was more accessible after going to India.The barriers had been stripped away and I built new ones, but not as high nor as thick. No Comments yet...

If they don't, they run the chance of embarrassment; sending a story to the publication twice, sending the same story to more than one publication when simultaneous submissions are not allowed. In the past, I know there have been software programs for tracking submissions. Places like www.duotrope.com track submissions to a particular publisher, though it's not yet easy to use and many market listings still don't show the average number of days to an acceptance or a rejection. For tracking where I send my own submissions I use a double card system. My publisher markets go on a 3X5 index card, where I write the name of the publisher, editor, address, types of subs/genres, pay and whether they take email submission/replies or not. On each card, I'll write the story name and date: The Trials of Lemons 7/08. I never get as specific as putting the actual day. Each story and poem is on a smaller index card. I started color coding them: blue=dark fantasy/horror, yellow=SF, green=fantasy, pink=erotica/mainstream, white=poems (except the spec poems are now on green). On these cards I'll write where I sent them to. So for \"The Trials of Lemons\" (a poem), I'll write: Chizine 7/08. the story/poem is returned I mark the month: 9/08. If it's an acceptance I put a \"P\" and circle it, meaning published. Actual date of publication isn't put on the cards but on my vitae. Ungainly? Perhaps. I could put this all on an Excel sheet, and once did try a computer generated card system, but I'm a fairly visual person and I find that I need to have the cards in my hand when I'm matching markets and submissions. Once I've matched things and submitted, I put my \"sent\" cards at the back of the box, with a paperclip separating sent and unsent material. I have a box for markets, one for fiction and one for poetry. In recent years, I find I'm not using the market cards as much. Now that there are good and reliable sites like Duotrope and www.ralan.com, which keep information very up to date, I tend to always go to Ralan's to check what the status of the publisher is. They sometimes close to submissions and may not always mark it on their own website (annoying) but it will be on Ralan's, so in fact, his site is more up to date than the publisher website. If a market is a one-off anthology I don't make a market card. If I'm also trying them for the first time, I wait. But now there are markets where I don't bother making a card right away and then I run into trouble if I don't read the story card close enough. This happened last week when I had already sent a story to a publisher and then sent a second a week later. I realized it right away and sent a withdrawal notice. Some day there may be a computer program that's visual enough for me, but for now I shuffle cards and can see at a glance where I've sent a story or poem and how long it's been with a publisher. I can also count in a moment, how many submissions I have out but I'm not that anal. Really. No Comments yet...

I'm not sure when it will be out but I imagine in the next year. I've also been asked to write a skewered fairy tale for an erotic anthology, I believe. I'm waiting for more details at this point and nothing is for sure. I finally received my study assistance grant from the BC Arts Council. I had applied for this to help defray costs of the Kansas CSSF workshop. It wasn't as much as I asked for but talking to writer friend Linda DeMeulemeester, she received one on the same day and less than what she'd asked for. I believe with first time appliers they probably do give a smaller amount, testing the waters, you could say. The caveat is to turn in a report on the workshop for which they gave the grant, as well as receipts. It's much better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick to have received this (makes me feel like a real writer) and it opens up the possibility of applying for larger grants to take time to write, most likely working part time. I'll be looking into that in the near future so see if I can get going on the novel. I also finished a story that came out of being in Kansas. The words \"exegesis\" and \"apocryphal\" stuck in my head while there. You have no idea how often writers can use these words. So I have sent a story out on its fledgling flight, titled \"Exegesis of the Insecta Apocrypha.\" It is indeed a mouthful. \"A Kind Hand,\" Which took ten years to finish, was completed in Kansas (I was there for novel writing but some short fiction was written as well.) I'm now trying very hard to get the first draft done of \"Awaking Pandora,\" even longer in the making and will be a novelette when it's done. The first was fantasy and the latter will be SF. I've also been ruminating on the novel and think I can now start writing through the chapters on my antagonist. I plan to write his through story first, then go back and write the second antagonist's through story. Then I'll go back and write my major viewpoint character and slot them all together. I'm sure there will be enough to iron out. But breaking it down into smaller chunks will make this more doable for me and now that I have a better idea of all the story arcs I think it will be fairly smooth sailing. Since returning from Kansas I've also been writing at least 200 words a day in fiction. A couple of days were major rewrites and I counted those. I hope to keep up writing at least that amount every day. 1 Comment Posted in Fantasy, Publishing, Writing, entertainment, fairy tales, science fiction, sex | Tags: Writing, Publishing, fantasy, science fiction, CSSF, BC Arts Council, story arc, grants, ON Spec, The Drowing Ones, speculative writing, protagonist, antagonisht, through story, novelette, Linda DeMeulemeester, viewpoint character Posted by: colleenanderson | August 1, 2008 Genre vs Literary Works Now that movie technology has advanced, movie makers create worlds with all manner of special effects. There are a great number of fantastical, science fictional works. There is the whole gamut of superhero movies from the various comic books. And then there are movies based on books. Back in the sixties, science fiction movies went way out on a limb when 2001: A Space Odyssey was filmed. And then there was Bladerunner, based off of P.K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (an awesome title by the way). There were many others, which ran the range of B and lower-the Godzillas and Blob and other somewhat campy horror flicks. And then came Star Wars, an epic story with star spanning special effects. Full steam ahead and there are many movies now out at the same time. For example, right now we have Hell Boy II, Dark Knight, Journey to the Center of the Earth and the Mummy III, to name a few. So, a lot of these are good fun and not particularly deep. Hollywood does love to turn speculative fiction into only eye and mind candy. When you look at the evolution of speculative (SF, fantasy, horror) novels, we've gone from bug-eyed aliens to very complex stories and worlds that look at the human condition, ethical and moral tales and what-ifs of future technologies. On top of covering a host of possibilities with humanity, an author has to often create a viable, believable world that works. It must still follow rules and must be shown enough to paint dimensions so the reader can see it. This is of course, much easier in a movie, and yes a picture is worth a thousand words, maybe even five thousand. Good speculative writing is not for the faint of heart, nor for the undisciplined and uneducated. All of these skills that one must learn for speculative writing apply for any type of writing. Know your market, which means read, read, read. Then write, write, write and learn and perfect. This never stops, ever. I tend to lump all the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror and even the myths of long ago under the umbrella term of speculative. In reality, anything that is not considered a history or telling of true life events, is in fact speculative. Now the truly interesting thing is that a speculative writer can write science fiction and it will be looked down the long narrow noses of literary academics and called \"genre\" (said with nose in the air, as if smelling bad, and with an English accent). But a literary writer can write something that is speculative fiction and it will be praised and lauded and given awards. Case in point; Margaret Atwood has written two speculative novels (at least that I've read): Oryx and Crake and The Handmaid's Tale. They are sometimes claimed to not be speculative, or speculative but not science fiction, getting to the fine hair splitting of genre names. But she takes those technologies and does a what-if into the future. That is indeed speculative and even science fiction. When I was slowly progressing toward a degree in Creative Writing at UBC, one had to specialize in three areas: I chose short fiction, children's fiction and poetry. In my kiddy lit class, the instructor didn't like it when we wrote anything to do with fantastical worlds. She said they didn't sell that well. Well, Ms Alderson, are you eating your hat after the fame of Harry Potter? This attitude was reflected throughout the department. However, George McWhirter who was the department head, and the only person worth his weight in gold, understood that writing well came first and what you wrote came second. He was not of the opinion expressed in The Boston Globe: \"[T]he genre of the comic book is an anemic vein for novelists to mine, lest they squander their brilliance.\" Ow. A champion for blending or removing the snobbery borders between genres (or lowbrow and highbrow as some put it) is Michael Chabon. He won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Klay. For his most recent book The Yiddish Policemen's Union he was award the Nebula and the Campbell Awards. He was purported as saying the SF related Nebula meant more to him than getting the Pulitzer. Perhaps with such writers as champions, we'll see \"genre\" fiction being treated as writing and not drivel, where the best of all writing will rise to the top and more \"genre\" works will be nominated for awards. I'm not holding my breath...yet. No Comments yet...

I have only managed to go once and it was a so-so parade. I was expecting big Kermit floats and others covered in flowers. Mostly it came across as ways for different businesses to advertise while showing support. Though you do get some colorful individuals and the bare-breasted dykes on bikes. We probably have the second largest population of gay and lesbians after San Francisco. Why the west coast? I'm not sure. Probably because it's warmer but also port cities tend to always be a blend of tradition and new ideas brought in by different ships and crews. Port cities are usually more liberal. One of the news items associated with this year's gay pride parade was about a Sikh man who has been trying to put a Bollywood style float together and running into some opposition: people don't want the Sikh religion associated with homosexuality. It's kind of odd because it's not the religion that should be associated with homosexuality but homosexuals who are associated with the Sikh religion. Homosexuality isn't drawn to a particular religion. No matter what right wing fundamentalist may think, homosexuality isn't a choice. People are born with a particular preponderance. A very good friend of mine, Greg, told me that by the age of six he knew he was gay and wanted to play \"rubbing dinkies\" with the boys. Most of the gay men I know tried sex with the other gender but it just didn't work for them. Someone posted on wordpress a while back (I wished I'd gone and responded) that their theory was that women who had a \"best friend evah\" who was gay were women who were dumb, vapid and not too deep (is that the same thing?). I believe the person went on to say that gay men only want these Barbie doll types of women as friends. (I didn't read all of the article) I've heard some ludicrous things over the years and this rates as one of them. Example: one of my best friends evah is gay. My other best friends are not. I have two degrees and have never been called stupid by anyone. My neighbors are gay and we're all friends. My landlady is an architect. I certainly see no correlation with one type of person being the preferred friend type to a gay person (and I use gay here to mean men or women). Like all people, gay people have a range of personalities and religious beliefs. They are of all religions and none, varying tastes and desires and life goals. The only difference; they prefer to have sex with the same gender. Of course, these odd prejudices of only one type for one type can also happen amongst certain gay people. I've been accused by gay men of being a fag hag. I hate this term and to me it means a woman who exclusively hangs around with gay men, hoping to eventually have sex with/sway one over to the other side. Even if it only means a woman who only hangs with gay men, I still take offense. If I want to go out with my gay friend, what's wrong with that and why should it be assumed that's all I do? Do people presume such things if you're out with a straight male or a woman? My biggest problem with people being against homosexuals is-what business is it of yours what they do in their bedrooms? They're not warping your children's minds. You can't sway someone to the \"gay side\" unless they're already gay. And as far as I'm concerned any religion that would ban someone just for being born the way they are, is a religion I want nothing to do with. Of course, mostly what happens is religious interpretation by individuals, which can get skewed. Love thy neighbor, but not if he's gay? Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, but not if they're gay? I haven't studied all religions but if compassion means it's only for someone who is like you, then that's a pretty narrow definition. Those who protest the most against being gay are probably those who have questioned their own sexuality and repressed it. Live and let live and stop repressing the homosexuals. If they were accepted in most cases as part of society, the need to flaunt or protest goes waaay down. Hooray for Canada, which legalized same sex marriages. And here's to the gay pride parade which will be needed until everyone accepts that homosexuals are part of the overall population; 10%. No Comments yet...

Flying to the US took far more rigmarole, extra gates and scrutiny of bags and clothing than going through Scotland and on to Ireland. For US flights, you have to cart your luggage along, to then eventually toss it on a conveyor belt. Why? God only knows. To humiliate I guess. And Canada and the US share a border, but you never know what we might infest the US with either: politeness? As everyone who has flown since 9/11 knows, you must take off your shoes when you're going through, because some idiot decided to try and bomb with his shoe. Even if you're wearing flip flops, some airports are supper anally retentive on all shoes. And of course, you can't take a sharp metal object: no knives and no metal utensils on the plane. Then there were the guys trying to splash about some liquids to make bombs. Now you have to put everything in a separate bag, and have no more than a few ounces of any particular liquid. And even if you use the airport approved bag, you may still not be able to carry it on the plane as my sister found out, because the rules change from airport to airport. So, what's next? Someone who puts some form of bomb material into a tube of lipstick, a suppository or a fake tooth? We have to take off all metal bits going through a metal detector but as I found, a bra can now set off the super sensitized detectors. Watch out, everyone who has piercings. Soon you may have to take every piece out. There has already been one case of overzealous customs guards making a woman take out her nipple piercings. How ridiculous and useful is this? Well sure they scan for certain chemicals on laptops, but what about PDAs and phones? If someone wanted to kill or hold someone hostage on a plane, there are a million ways. What about someone who holds a black belt? They can kill someone with their hands. \"Excuse me, sir. We're going to need you to check your hands.\" \"I can't check my hands. They're part of me.\" \"Well then we'll have to tie them behind your back.\" \"But what if I have to go?\" \"The attendant will assist you.\" \"What! One person can't fit in those bathrooms, let alone two!\" \"We'll give you a cup, no charge.\" Oh and hmmm, let's see. Many of us wear shoes with laces, or belts. They all can be used to tie or strangle someone. \"I\"m sorry, ma'am, you're going to have to check those laces. Oh and the strap to your shoulder bag. You're not wearing thongs, are you?\" Remember, just after 9/11 when they were taking people's tweezers and knitting needles? They must have been afraid of bad eyebrow pluckings. Be prepared to arrive a day earlier than your flight, where you will strip down and be given orange scrubs and cloth booties to go through on the flight. Your checked clothing will be returned to you on the other side. Oh and bring lube, but in less than 2 ounces, for your cavity search. You don't mind a probe do you? All this supposed airport security is really one giant smoke and mirrors game. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain because he's not doing anything. The attitude of the US, which Canada and other nations have followed is to fake us out with this \"great\" measure being taken to \"keep us safe.\" Really. Yes, safe. Don't you feel it? I don't. I keep thinking that mass stupidity and paranoia is all that I'm seeing. I think this sentiment was best echoed by other Americans when we were in the line-up to get to our planes. All I heard them say was, \"This is ridiculous. What a farce.\" Yep but if those governments think we think we're being protected, well then, spending money on half-assed measures always works better. No Comments yet...

Taiwan was not affected much by the loss of infielder Tai-shan Chang, who failed a pre-tournament drug test. The host team China lost to Canada 10-0 in a game shortened to 8 innings by the mercy rule. The USA rallied for three runs in the top of the ninth on a Mike Hessman homer and a Matt Brown 2-run single, but South Korea answered with a 2-run rally of its own to win 8-7. Jong-wook Lee had the game-winning sacrifice fly. And the final game of the day matched up co-favorites Cuba and Japan, a rematch of the 2006 World Baseball Classic Final. Cuba won this one, 4-2. Cuba scored all of its runs against Japanese Yu Darvish in the first five innings. Norge Luis Vera and Pedro Luis Lazo combined for the win and save for Cuba. Coming up next: USA vs Netherlands, China vs South Korea, Canada vs Cuba, Taiwan vs Japan. All eight teams play each other in a round robin format. The top four play knockout games to determine the medalists.

Frank Falzarano, 54, of Long Island, pleaded guilty in April to felony enterprise corruption and gambling charges and is to appear Sept. 24 in Queens County, N.Y., Supreme Court. Falzarano, who is presently free on $200,000 bail, faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. Sources close to the bookmaking probe identified one of the alleged bettors as Alan Marr, a respected high-ranking scout fired by the Baltimore Orioles last month. Marr acknowledged knowing Falzarano, but declined further comment when reached by ESPN.com at his home in Sarasota, Fla. The investigation has identified \"seven or eight\" other scouts who bet through Falzarano, though it's possible that number could grow as New York City police continue to pursue the case. Major League Baseball's newly formed investigative unit is also assisting law enforcement.

That is the longest such streak for a pitcher joining the Pirates since Jeff Robinson tossed 15 2/3 scoreless innings for the Bucs when he joined them from Texas back from June 13 through June 27, 1992. There were two Jeff Robinsons in the majors in 1992. And both were pitchers and both were from California. To prevent further confusion, neither of them pitched in the majors after 1992.

He was tagged for five runs in two innings of a 5-2 loss to Washington on Friday. \"I was damn near putting it on a tee for them,\" Bailey said. \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, as long as they don't cut your arms off - and they're still attached.\" Permalink | Comments (3) Waters hope quick start doesn't lead to bad finish 2008-08-05 21:29 by Bob Timmermann 28-year old rookie Chris Waters of the Baltimore Orioles made his major league debut Tuesday night in Anaheim against the Angels. Waters gave up just one hit in eight innings of work, a second inning single by Vladimir Guerrero. He struck out three and walked three. George Sherrill pitched the ninth to save the 3-0 win for the Orioles. Since 1956, just six pitchers have made their major league debut by pitching at least 8 innings and giving up only one hit. Starting with the oldest: A young Dominican named Juan Marichal gave up an 8th inning single to Clay Dalrymple of the Phillies and nothing else. Marichal went the distance in a 2-0 shutout on July 19, 1960. Marichal would toss 52 shutouts in his Hall of Fame career. California Angels lefty Rudy May pitched 9 innings and gave up just one hit to the Detroit Tigers on April 18, 1965. Pinch hitter Jake Wood doubled in the 8th and would score the tying run on an error by Bobby Knoop. The Tigers won in 13 innings at Anaheim by a 4-1 margin. On April 14, 1967, Billy Rohr of the Red Sox came within one out of a no-hitter before Elston Howard singled to right. The Red Sox won the game 3-0. Rohr would win only three games in his major league career. Jimmy Jones was the third pick in the 1982 Amateur Draft (Shawon Dunston was #1 and Augie Schmidt was #2) by the San Diego Padres. Jones made his major league debut on September 21, 1986 against the Astros in Houston. The only hit Jones gave up was a third inning triple by Astros pitcher Bob Knepper (he actually hit two in his career.) Jones pitched in parts of eight seasons for the Padres, Yankees, and Astros and was 43-39 with a 4.46 ERA. On September 18, 1988, Bob Milacki of the Orioles pitched eight shutout innings at Tiger Stadium and gave up only a third inning double to Tom Brookens. Tom Niedenfuer pitched the ninth inning to get the save as Baltimore won 2-0. Finally, on July 28, 1997, Steve Woodard of the Brewers bested Toronto and Roger Clemens 1-0 in the first game of a doubleheader at County Stadium. Otis Nixon led off with a double for the only game. Mike Fetters pitched the ninth to save a 1-0 win. Woodard pitched until 2003 with a 32-36 record and a 4.94 ERA.

The Mets are putting Billy Wagner on the DL and Aaron Heilman will get first shot at being the closer.' The Rays optioned Jonny Gomes and called up Ben Zobrist. I mention this because Tampa Bay personnel moves are now important. Zack Greinke and Miguel Olivo were given five-game suspensions for their parts in a brawl Sunday. Royals manager Trey Hillman and White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen were suspended as well. Guillen for two games and Hillman for one. Seattle is going to make Brandon Morrow a starter and sent him down to Tacoma to work on it. Today marks the 7th anniversary of the greatest comeback (in terms of runs made up) in major league history. Back on this day in 2001, the Cleveland Indians overcame a 14-2 deficit in the bottom of the 5th inning to defeat Seattle 15-14 at Jacobs Field. The game was nationally televised and was the ESPN Sunday Night game. The Mariners were on their way to winning 116 games, but this was one game that eluded them. Seattle hit Cleveland starter Dave Burba hard, scoring seven runs in two innings. Reliever Mike Bacsik gave up another seven runs in six innings of work in his major league debut. Cleveland started its comeback in the 7th. Russell Branyan hit a leadoff homer against Mariners starter Aaron Sele. With two outs, the Indians loaded the bases and John Halama came out of the pen to relieve. Jolbert Cabrera, who had come in to give Roberto Alomar a rest, singled in two to make it 14-5 after 7 innings. Jim Thome led off the 8th with a home run and it was 14-6. Branyan was hit by a pitch and Marty Cordova homered and it was now 14-8. Singles by Einar Diaz and Kenny Lofton drove Halama out of the game and Norm Charlton relieved. Omar Vizquel doubled off of Charlton to make it 14-9, but the Indians threat died when Lofton was out at the plate trying to score on a pitch in the dirt and Cabrera struck out. All Cleveland needed to do now was make up five runs in one inning. No problem. Ed Taubensee, who had replaced Juan Gonzalez at DH, led off with a single. Thome flied out and Branyan struck out and the Mariners were one out away. But Cordova kept the game alive with a double, sending Taubensee to third. Seattle manager Lou Piniella opted now for Jeff Nelson to face the loveable Wil Cordero. Cordero walked to load the bases. Diaz followed with a single to drive in two to make it 14-11. Piniella was now in a thoroughly foul mood and he called on his closer Kazuhiro Sasaki. Sasaki was a closer who needed a lot of time to warm up and it's quite possible that Sasaki just wasn't ready because he was generally awful. Lofton greeted Sasaki with a single to load the bases. And then Vizquel cleared the bases and tied the game with a triple. Cabrera grounded out to end the inning. In the bottom of the 10th, the Indians got two runners on with two outs against Arthur Rhodes and Piniella then made another change, switching right fielder Charles Gipson to left to trade places with Al Martin. I think Piniella had heard from Martin that he could throw a baseball 550 feet on the fly at a speed of 87 mph. Rhodes got Cordero to strike out. The Mariners didn't score in the top of the 11th (Seattle had just three hits after the fifth inning) and Jose Paniagua was the next man out of the Seattle pen. Paniagua retired Diaz to start the inning, but quickly got into trouble as Lofton and Vizquel singled to put runners at first and third with one out. Cabrera put an end to the game with a single to score Lofton and send what was left of an announced crowd of 42,494 home seeing something that happened since 1925. The game ended about 15 minutes past midnight, just in time for the fans to enjoy all the famous late night dining that Cleveland has to offer. The last team that had blown a 12-run lead had been the 1925 Indians who led the A's 15-3 in the seventh inning before giving up a run in the bottom of the seventh and then 13 in the eighth. That was on June 15, 1925. The Detroit Tigers are the other team that has come back from 12 down and they did so at home against the White Sox on June 18, 1911, who overcame a 13-1 deficit in the fifth to pull out a 16-15 win. The NL record for biggest deficit overcome is 11 and it's been done three times, most recently on July 18, 1994 by the Astros against the Cardinals. Permalink | Comments (2) Raul Ibanez almost becomes as famous as Fernando Tatis 2008-08-04 21:53 by Bob Timmermann Seattle's Raul Ibanez hit a grand slam home run in the bottom of the seventh inning at Safeco Field off of Minnesota's Glenn Perkins. That made the score 6-5. The Mariners then kept scoring. And getting on base. And with two outs, Willie Bloomquist drew a walk off of Matt Guerrier to load the bases. And who was coming up, none other than Ibanez. But Fernando Tatis' place in history remained secure as Ibanez could manage nothing more than a 2-RBI single. Ibanez's 6 RBI inning tied an AL record held by 10 others and most recently done by Bobby Abreu of the Yankees on September 12, 2006 against Tampa Bay. Abreu had a 3-run homer and 3-run double in the first inning. Permalink | Comments (4) Serving up slams daily 2008-08-04 21:25 by Bob Timmermann On Sunday, Edwar Ramirez of the Yankees gave up a grand slam homer to Mark Teixeira of the Angels, although the Yankees would win the game 14-9. Tonight, Damaso Marte of the Yankees gave up a game-ending grand slam homer to Marlon Byrd of the Rangers that gave Texas a 9-5 win. That was the first time since August 31 and September 1, 1990 when Yankee pitchers gave up slams in consecutive games. On August 31, 1990, Luis Rivera of Boston hit a slam against Jeff Robinson. The next day, Mike Greenwell hit an inside-the-park grand slam against Greg Cadaret. I warn Yankee fans that the boxscore for the September 1 game is not for the squeamish.

Permalink | Comments (16) Dave Anderson has seen the NL West and he's afraid 2008-08-03 23:21 by Bob Timmermann Dave Anderson of the New York Times has seen a horrific vision of the Division Series and he thinks that there could be a team with a losing record making the playoffs. This horrific possiblity must not stand! With the Diamondbacks and the Dodgers each struggling to stay around the .500 mark, if not falling below it, it's possible that, as a division winner, a team with an under-.500 record (in other words, a losing team), would automatically qualify for the postseason. Should that happen, it would make a mockery of the playoff structure. A team with a losing record does not deserve to be in the playoffs, much less deserve to be considered a champion of any division or anything. It may not happen. The Diamondbacks, now three games over .500, and the Dodgers, at .505 but presumably reinforced by Manny Ram\u00edrez's bat, each may rise well above .500 over the last two months of the schedule. Anderson proposes that if a division winner not have a winning record, then a second wild card team be accepted. I can think of a lot of horrible things that could happen in baseball. I think a team winning a division with a record below .500 is not one of them. For starters, what if it's your favorite team that has the losing record and wins the division? What are you rooting for down the stretch? Is there something so much more magical about team winning 81 games than 80? In 1973, the Mets won the NL East with an 82-79 record? There were no calls in the New York Times to ask for the NL East champ to be removed from the playoffs if no team in the division had a winning record (which was the case as late as September 21, 1973). I still think the chances of the NL West champ having a losing record are pretty slim mainly because Arizona and Los Angeles get to play lots of games down the stretch against the likes of San Francisco and San Diego (and Colorado to a lesser extent). Anderson brings up the example of the 1994 season ending with the Rangers atop the AL West at 52-62. The Rangers poor record that year wasn't helped by the team losing 9 of 11 games before the Great Unpleasantness began. The 2005 Padres had to win the final game of the season at home against the Dodgers to avoid finishing at .500. But remember the hard and fast rule of writers like Anderson: New York teams with bad records winning pennants (1973 Mets and 2000 Yankees) are gutty underdogs, but teams like the 2006 Cardinals or the 1988 Dodgers are just flukes and not worthy of mention. And Anderson does like to point out that when there were no divisions, there was no danger of the pennant winner not having a losing record. Amazing things those kids do with math today.

Caray had suffered from numerous ailments in the past several years, many of them related to diabetes and he had to curtail his schedule to just covering home games.

One of the articles shown on one of the subsequent pages has the headline: Major Managers Blast Proposed Rule Change I couldn't read it off the image on the Times website, so I pulled it up on my computer using my magical librarian tricks. The rule change, proposed by AL President Will Harridge upon the advice of Lew Fonseca, would have allowed a team to have a player re-enter a game (unless he was ejected or removed for some other rules infraction) after sitting out one complete inning. Casey Stengel's quote: \"There's nothing wrong with the way the game is played. All baseball needs is more good ballplayers. If they want to make a change, why don't they outlaw the curve ball. That would make everyone happier.\" The mind reels at the length of a Cardinals game if Tony La Russa were allowed to take out and bring back players like it was a Little League game.

It's the name that Swiss pianist Nik B\u00e4rtsch chose for his quintet, a one-of-a-kind unit that performs what B\u00e4rtsch calls Zen-funk - a cerebral music influenced by minimalism, yet blessed with head-nodding, foot-tapping rhythmic tendencies, and an exhilarating sense of pacing that makes each composition a fascinating adventure.

The shortage of prominent male singers is especially pronounced when it comes to African-American voices.

From the Harlem Renaissance through the bop era, Paris offered shelter and a creative setting to African-American musicians. Although the days of Bud Powell or Dexter Gordon playing in the Latin Quarter are long gone, the City of Light remains home to more recent expatriates such as saxophonist David Murray, as well as feeding ground for a busy homegrown scene.

But there's nothing conventional about the career of composer Maria Schneider, whose one-of-a-kind reimagining of a big band, the Maria Schneider Orchestra, has blazed daring new trails in the jazz landscape, expressing its leader's highly personal vision with empathetic and exhilarating group interplay.

Boston Globe, November 7, 2007 From rock to electronica to regional traditional rhythms, musical exports of Brazil are as varied as befits that country's size and diversity. Still, one style above all has come to symbolize the Brazilian sensibility. There's no sound more quintessentially cool than bossa nova, the quietly seductive distillation of samba and jazz that first took form in the late 1950s. And in Rosa Passos, who visits the Berklee Performance Center tomorrow for a rare North American concert, bossa nova has one of its purest interpreters, a scholar of the genre's classic songbook and an acclaimed composer in her own right.

At 65, the great Brazilian singer, who plays the Orpheum Theatre tonight, still shows the restlessness that first earned him fame in the late 1960s, when, together with fellow Bahian Gilberto Gil, he helped forge the ebullient, edgy, multi-arts movement called Tropicalismo. Their music at the time associated the rhythmic energy of Afro-Brazilian culture and the poetic sophistication of bossa nova with the angularity and dissonances of European modernism.

Five years ago composer Gill Aharon busted the bank to buy a 7-foot Kawai grand that ate up most of the space in his basement apartment. Now Aharon owns the Lily Pad, a gallery and performance space in Cambridge, and the Kawai is the house instrument.

A paranoid regime in the grip of an aging president and his cronies, and hunger and shortages in an agrarian country once seen as a regional breadbasket, are just two symptoms of a crisis whose human cost is exacerbated by rampaging HIV. The latest disaster is the onset of hyperinflation, with prices rising at a nearly unimaginable annual rate of 5,000 percent or more.

But for some presidents and prime ministers, the trip to New York has a local dimension too. It's a way to connect with immigrants from their country who live here and send money home.

From Skeptical Brotha's Blog: The woman was very upset and had swelling over her left eye,\" Kearns said, adding she and a friend \"were dancing at a party at the Manoogian Mansion and that the Mayor's wife, Carlita Kilpatrick, threw a fit, hit her and the other dancer, then kicked them out of the house.\" Yatooma filed the disclosures today in U.S. District Court in connection with a lawsuit that accuses the city of thwarting an investigation into Greene's April 30, 2003, killing. In his affidavit, Kearns said Greene was also talking with Detroit Police officers and an EMS unit arrived and subsequently transported her to a hospital. The affidavit does not name any of the EMS workers or police officers. Kearns said the incident occurred on a Friday or Saturday night, but he did not remember the date. He said he never came forward: \"out of fear for my career and my safety.\" Kearns said in his affidavit that he told his story to Lt. John Morrell in the Detroit Police Department homicide section in June of this year. Morrell asked Kearns to submit to an interview with another homicide detective, Mike Carlisle, Kearns said. He said he ran into Carlisle on a police run about two weeks ago, but still has not been interviewed. Now this is some straight-up gangsta-shyt right here.

First they finished third in Iowa. Then they were out-organized by Barack Obama's campaign in the caucuses after Super Tuesday. Finally, they lost the showdown at the rules committee over how to reinstate delegates from the banned Michigan and Florida primaries. According to one well-placed source, President Clinton himself is still raw over reports of caucus tampering in Iowa that he believes could have tilted the race in Barack Obama's favor, and has mentioned that possibility several times in conversation. A separate source who is also close to Clinton says the idea that people were \"bused in\" from Illinois to caucus is still a concern, as well. (The Iowa Democratic Party is not required by law to release its caucus rolls, and has not done so.) In part, this fits with the pattern of retrospective analysis and persistent \"what-if\" thinking on the part of some Clinton officials, such as when communications director Howard Wolfson remarked on Fox News that John Edwards cost Sen. Clinton the nomination \u2014 a claim that was later partially debunked. So while a debate about the use of caucuses might seem moot to some, it remains terribly important to Clinton loyalists. And thus the battle over their use rages on \u2014 sometimes in private, and sometimes in quasi-public forums. The most recent flash point was last weekend's DNC platform committee meeting in Pittsburgh. Included among over 100 proposed amendments to the party's platform was Amendment 93, which would have banned caucuses from future nominating contests. The Caucus system was just part of the Democratic Party Nominating Process. UNTIL Barack Obama maximized them on his way to winning the Democratic Party Nomination. In my post How Obama Won - The 50 State Strategy, I pointed out this not-so-small fact: There were caucuses in the following places: Iowa Nevada Alaska American Samoa Colorado Idaho Kansas Minnesota North Dakota Nebraska Washington Maine Hawaii Texas Wyoming Guam Out of this list, Barack Obama LOST the DELEGATE COUNT in ONE Caucus - American Samoa. Even though he 'lost' the Nevada Caucus, he received MORE DELEGATES than Hillary Clinton because of his success in RURAL Nevada. He only tied her in one place, delegate wise - in Guam, which he won by 7 votes. Everywhere else, he BEAT HER in the caucus states. His final Pledged Delegate Tally from the Caucuses: 326 Hillary Clintons? : 176 Who is the usual participant of the Caucus system? High-information voters; party activists. I remember something Chuck Todd said on Tim Russert's weekend show: that the problems for Hillary Clinton should have been obvious to the media because of two factors: a) she could ONLY get 200 SuperDelegates to commit to her beforehand b) the strong resistance of the party activists towards her, as evident through the caucus system. So, this Caucus System was ok. Sure, there was grumbling every once in awhile, but NOW it's a complete affront to democracy. CAUSE THE BLACK MAN WON. PERIOD. This is the Black story in America. You can call it 'moving the bar', 'changing the goalposts', however you want to tag it, but the story is still the same: When Black folk figure out a way to win by the rules, suddenly the rules need to be changed. For all the talk about Barack Obama opening doors for future Black candidates, I'll never forget a comment I read over at Field Negro - I'm paraphrasing: They are studying Obama with precision, cause they're going to close everyway possible for any Negro coming down the pike. They ain't NEVAH gonna give another Negro the chance to explode the way that Obama did. Earlier in the week, Jill Tubman posted, highlighting a great piece done by dnA. In Obama's Racial-Catch 22, in the comments section, we discussed Tiger Woods, and how, Augusta had been FINE. It had been FINE through the years of Hogan...the domination of Palmer, then Nicklaus. But, Tiger Woods wins TWO Masters, and suddenly, Augusta and other major course around the country, had to be ' re-designed.' Same song, over and over again. Doesn't matter the arena- Sports, Politics, Business... The moment we learn the rules enough to master them....either.. a) the rules are changed b) a new rule book, that's NEVER been there before, appears. We know the drill. Why Impeachment is \"Off The Table\" 13 Aug 2008 Author: The Christian Progressive Liberal View comments Tags: 2008 Democratic Primary Race, Barack Obama, Caucus System, Hillary Clinton I'm currently listening to talk radio out in my home state of Cali, and there's an interview between the host and an author of a very interesting book, \"The Case for Impeachment\" by David Lindorff and Barbara Olshansky. I had a chance to read a blurb, but I'm going to buy the book and read the whole thing. We get an idea why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took impeachment off the table. Lindorff just stated in his interview on station KGO in San Francisco, that Pelosi probably took impeachment off the table because the actual hearings might force her to admit Congress' complicity in allowing the torture techniques used on prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Additionally, LA Congresswoman Jane Harman, who sat on the Congressional Committee dealing with torture, also admits she was briefed on the torture techniques and essentially, Congress signed off on them, anyway. \"Their fingerprints are all over this (the legislation allowing torture)\", said Lindorff. What I remember from the Harman-Pelosi tiff is that once it became known that members of Congress knew that the Bush Administration was engaging in torture tactics on war prisoners, in direct violation of the Geneva Convention, Pelosi moved to kick Harman off the Armed Services Committee for that dereliction. At the same time, Pelosi was equally busy denying Georgia Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney her seniority when she returned to the Hill in 2004, even though other white, male members of the House who left and returned, had their seniority reinstated. Essentially, the foot-dragging on impeachment is because Pelosi's paw-prints are all over legislation that virtually allowed Bush to ignore Congress and do whatever the hell he wanted, while Congress abdicated its oversight responsibility and broke the system of Checks and Balances by failing to check the Executive Branch in its grab for power. Here's some good news - Ms. Nancy has an opponent, and her name is Cindy Sheehan. Ms. Sheehan got enough signatures to get her name on the California ballot in the Fall and there's enough pissed-off San Franciscans that, while not exactly delivering the vote to Cindy, they can do enough damage to send the message to Pelosi that you don't ignore those who brought you to the dance. Now we have an idea why Impeachment got taken off the table. It's kinda hard to corral a horse when you deliberatly left the barn doors open and the horse took off to do whatever it wanted, with your (Congress) blessing. I guess we can understand John Conyers' foot-dragging on this issue - even though it would raise hell, he was threatened with the loss of his Chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee if he moves on those articles of Impeachment first introduced by McKinney, and now being introduced by Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich. At least Kucinich got to read his articles of Impeachment (all 35 of them). Can we force impeachment \"back on the table\" now?

Barack Obama always was a larger-than-life candidate with a healthy ego. Now he's turning into the A-Rod of politics. It's all about him ... A convention hall isn't good enough for the presumptive Democratic nominee. He plans to deliver his acceptance speech in the 75,000 seat stadium where the Denver Broncos play. Before a vote is cast, he's embarking on a foreign policy tour that will use cheering Europeans - and America's top news anchors - as extras in his campaign.

Republican Lawyers Prepare to Purge New Voters 12 Aug 2008 Author: B-Serious View comments Tags: 2008 Presidential Race, Barack Obama, Racial Smear, Uppity Negroes cross-posted at my blog The Wall Street Journal reports on the ensuing legal battle for ballots between Democrats and Republicans. Many have lauded Democratic Nominee, Barack Obama's, massive voter registration drive. Building off of historic turnout in this year's Democratic Primary, Obama's registration drive could swing a few Republican-leaning states to the Democratic column by election day. However, the power of this phenomenon has not been lost on the Republican Party. The Wall Street Journal (via TPM): Republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states. A Republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for Sen. John McCain and other Republican leaders. One session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud. So continues the disturbing, but predictable, pattern wherein Republicans respond to high registration and turnout with legal tactics to disqualify Democratic voters. Lawyers have played a major role in the past two elections. This year promises to be no different.

Obama/Reed? Obama/Clark??? 11 Aug 2008 Author: B-Serious View comments Tags: Open Thread Speculation reached a new level after Senator Obama sent an email to supporters saying he'd pick his vice presidential running mate in the near future. That speculation got a little more interesting Monday morning when a conference call with the Obama camp revealed that the vice presidential candidate will speak on a night dedicated to veterans' issues: via The Huffington Post: On a conference call on Monday morning, Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and top ranking aide Anita Dunn announced that the theme for Wednesday \u2014 the night on which the vice presidential candidate is scheduled to speak \u2014 will be national security and honoring veterans. The choice, a reporter noted, lent itself to the interpretation that Obama would choose a running mate with background in military affairs \u2014 like, say, Sen. Chuck Hagel or John Kerry. When considering military experience, the names Wesley Clark and Jack Reed also come to mind. Was this a slip of the tongue or is The Huffington Post making something out of nothing? After all, just last week many in the media had Democrats prepared to slap an Obama/Bayh bumper sticker on the back of their cars. The week before, Tim Kaine got all the press. This could be a wild goose chase . . . or maybe not.

He went back home to Hawaii to visit his elderly grandmother (this means you, Cokie Roberts).... McCain's latest ad is a nanosecond away from 'CALL ME'... You have Bob Kerrey casting doubt about Obama's electability(put Kerrey into the JJP search engine if you want the know the REAL DEAL about him).... Russell Feingold praising McSame... and Wolfson talking about Edwards cost Hillpatine the Iowa Caucus(see CPL's post below), I will remind you: See the Forest. NONE of this is accidental. Craig Hickman sees it clearly: Monday, August 11, 2008 Those Fighting The War Against Barack THOSE FIGHTING the war against Barack are making their voices louder, all at the same time. Such a fever pitch. Their intent is clear. Barack must be stopped at all costs. The confluence of recent events on the campaign trail is no coincidence. I don't need to cite any examples. If you're paying attention, you know exactly what I'm talking about. If you aren't, then ignorance is bliss. Those fighting the war against Barack are targeting delegates to the national convention and they're dog whistling to nutcases. The next five months is going to be a turning point in American history. That's where we are. You can say I'm positing a \"sky is falling\" overreaction, but history provides plenty of evidence that the mood and atmosphere that exists right now is just the kind that precipitates stopping insurgent leaders from claiming power. Doesn't matter the political system. The tools of propaganda, at once blatant and insidious, work anywhere. John McCain is the most dangerous presidential candidate I've witnessed in my lifetime. Those fighting the war against Barack would make you think Barack deserves that description. Those fighting the war against Barack are flat-out making stuff up in order to inflame folks. You better believe this is the most important election in 100 years. Pray for Barack and his family if you are inclined to do so. Pray. Indeed I will, Brother Craig. Indeed I will. See the forest.

As we move from an industrial to a more knowledge based world, the old ways of governance and management are no longer working. Friday, August 8, 2008 Academy of Management Meeting I'm off this week to the Academy of Management meeting in Anaheim. I'm not sure if locating an academic management conference next to Disneyland is sending any sort of message, but my expectations are that with 6,000 + management academics and professionals its going to be a full on week. I'll be presenting my research work on corporate social capital and its link to firm performance. The program is enormous. Its definitely the place to be if you work in a business school. For me I'm looking for a mix of academia and practice. I expect to see a lot on networks and governance, so watch this space for my reviews. On another note I was contacted by an organisation called insightory to become their featured expert this week. I don't know much about them but their site looked interesting and has the potential to connect people interested in management studies and practice. Posted by Dr. Laurence Lock Lee at 4:38 AM 0 comments Thursday, July 31, 2008 Is the subprime mortgage crisis an example of failed governance? I have just been perusing the research on the propagation or contagion effects of the US Subprime mortgage crisis. The fact that there is a growing amount of research on this topic e.g. here and here identifies the size of the global impact. Here in Australia all for the big 4 banks have been significantly impacted. So is this a governance issue? I'm sure if one went in to each of these organisations to review their governance procedures, they would appear comprehensive and up to date with \"industry best practice\". Their lending practices do not (at least visibly) mimic USA subprime lending practices. So why are they suffering so much? Maybe the answer lies in the fact that the governance procedures have not kept pace with the growing complexity of the business environment. Virtually all governance procedures start at the top of an organisation (boards and directors) and work downward. Governance procedures are formulated and approved by the top executive and are then promulgated as compliance rules throughout the organisation. Now lets lift our sights a unit level of analysis higher, from the firm or organisation to the market level. Now we are exposed to the full complexity of the interconnections between firms aided by the increasingly powerful tools of electronic communications. Where is the board of directors for a mortgage market? Who writes the governance rules? Who enforces compliance even if they did exist? Now using one of my favorite thinking frameworks cynefin to explain what I believe is going on. Virtually all governance schemes are developed at the firm or organisation level. In cynefin terms they are developed with an expectation that the business environment can be analysed and cause and effect determined (simple and complicated regimes). In reality financial institutions are becoming increasingly interdependent in the way they share the world's liquidity pools. When perturbed the effects are not not just simple or complicated, but complex and even chaotic! The traditional forms of governance may just have to be turned on its head, or at least reformed substantially to cater for the subprime mortgage like puturbations in an increasingly networked business environment. Perhaps a little probe, sense and respond? One suspects however that this may not happen too quickly though. At least not until an extra few volumes are added to Sarbanes-Oxley and the next few subprime mortgage like 'mishaps' still occur :) Posted by Dr. Laurence Lock Lee at 6:28 PM 0 comments Tuesday, July 29, 2008 Brokering can prevent Alzheimers? Following on from the post on Rob Burt's talk about the characteristics of brokers and their 'tolerance' of ambiguity and their willingness to explore new areas, I recently saw a piece on a breakfast show recently on how one might avoid getting Alzheimers. While many commentators talk about keeping the mind active by undertaking mentally difficult tasks like puzzles, the presenters claimed it is not so much the complexity of the task but how different the task is to what you are used to. In other words if you always do cryptic crossword puzzles and have become quite good at them, then doing one more would exercise the brain less than say, brushing your teeth with your non normal hand. So I guess Ron can add one more benefit to the list of why one should become a broker bridging structural holes .... it prevents Alzheimers! Posted by Dr. Laurence Lock Lee at 4:05 AM 0 comments Wednesday, July 23, 2008 UK SNA Conference I'm now back in Australia after a brief stop in Singapore and a presentation to the local KM society on value networks and partnerships for KM adoption. I attended and presented at the UK SNA conference at Greenwich university. It was great to be able to have personal contact with keynote speakers like Ron Burt (Structural Holes), Mark Everett (UCINET) and Tom Snijders at a smaller event than Sunbelt....where you would have no chance. To their credit they were all generous with their time for people attending the conference. Mark was kind enough to help me out with some analysis I am doing on the Wikipatterns site, looking at social patterns of wiki editors. Ron Burt was his usually entertaining self and we were all keen to hear his latest musings on the balance between brokerage and closure. Of course this tension is no different to the topic of the blog and the topic of my talk at the conference on the tension between top down (closed/compliance) and bottom up (open/brokered/co-operative) governance. Ron has long aurgued the value of being a broker and sustaining brokerage behaviours, which he strongly supports with his empirical research. One new insight for me was that Ron mentioned that those people who demonstrated good brokerage skills were also able to demonsrate excellent closure skills. This sounds confusing to one who saw them coming from different planets i.e. explorers vs six sigma. But it probably also reinforces a view that particularly talented individuals are needed to achieve the appropriate balance between brokerage and closure as it would also be for open vs closed governance mechanisms. It also helps with some other crticisms that Ron mentioned were surfacing in the academic literature around \"what is the impact of having a world full of brokers?\". My presentation can be found here. Posted by Dr. Laurence Lock Lee at 10:28 PM 0 comments Thursday, July 17, 2008 Tetbury in Bloom Have spent the last few days exploring the Cotswolds in the UK and staying at a lovely market town called Tetbury. Yesterday was judgement day for the \"best town\" competition. Tetbury had won last year and the community was out in force looking to repeat their success. The town was in great shape. It is sometimes worth reflecting on where some of our modern 'network' terms arise from....and 'community of practice' is the one that comes to mind. In the netwrok world much is achieved through the pride and passion of those working and living in local communities, working to make their community just that little bit more distinctive than others. Success breeds success. Yes it is sometimes competition as is the case for Tetbury, but it is friendly competition and the end result, despite who the overalll winner is, is a lift in standard for the whole. For those in high governance roles it is worth looking at the \"better towns\" programs and ask is there no better way to raise community standards than look to ignighting local community passion and pride. Posted by Dr. Laurence Lock Lee at 11:09 PM 0 comments Monday, July 14, 2008 Paris city planners I'm currently in Paris and today is Bastille day....so a good time to be in this wonderful city. This is only my 3rd visit to the city, the last time being some 16 years ago, but the image that has hit me each time is the foresight of the city planners. The wide boulevards, major green areas and spectacular public buildings are testimony to \"top down\" governance planning. However one is not enchanted only by these major public artefacts. What also gives the city a unique character is the way that these major 'planned' artefacts are blended with the mess of narrow,somewhat haphazard neighborhoods of the left and right banks, the Latin quarter,Montmartre etc. which give the city its real character. My point here is that Paris is a good example of the balance of governance from the 'planned' to the 'emergent'. When I think of other major cities in the world like London, New York, Rome, Sydney, Washington, Tokyo etc..there is elements of this blend but in my opinion, none have done it quite as well as Paris. Posted by Dr. Laurence Lock Lee at 12:20 AM 0 comments Friday, July 4, 2008 Evangelists and Connectors? common attributes... During by recent trip to Varese, Italy to present at the International Forum on Enterprise 2.0 our hosts were kind enough to host a dinner for the speakers to meet physically...many for the first time. The wife of our dinner host commented on the program that three of the speakers had 'titles' of \"evangelist\"... in my view a somewhat new age funky title that creates an image of passionate promoter who travel broadly preaching the message of their chosen mission. It has both positive connotations in terms of the passion and commitment that it engenders. It also has negative connotations perhaps related to parochialisms and the ability to see alternative perspectives. The 3 \"titled\" evangelists, with their comments on the forum are: Social Computing Evangelist Luis Suarez http://www.elsua.net/2008/06/23/trip-to-varese-to-present-at-international-enterprise-20-forum/ Wiki Evangelist Stewart Mader http://www.ikiw.org/2008/07/02/europe-conference-coverage-wiki-intranetblogru-interview/ and Telco 2.0 Evangelist Norman Lewis In my conversations with the said evangelists, they certainly fitted the image and while parochial to their mission I certainly didn't find that they were ignorant of other perspectives, in fact quite the opposite. Which brings me to the link to 'connectors'. The day after the forum I was in Matera in the south of Italy to present at the International Forum for Knowledge Asset Dynamics. My presentation was linking social capital to innovation and introducing our 3Es model of innovation. The 3 Es are Exploration, Engagement and Exploitation, with the engagement role seen as the critical 'connector' role connecting exploration networks with exploitation networks. The model resonated well with the audience as I argued that it was not a question of balancing exploration with exploitation, but a matter of managing the process of innovation through engaging, rather than trading off between them. This was totally aligned with the keynote speech of Goran Roos who also argued for innovation as a managed process and not one of serendipity. So can evangelists play the \"engager\" role in innovation? One thing is for sure the 'engager' requires the passion and focus of the evangelist. But they also need the respect of the exploitation networks....and perhaps the image of the evangelist might unfortunatley work against this, despite the personal attributes that I have recently observed in Varese.

And I quote, \"I think it's time to restore fairness and responsibility to our tax code. We need to reward work - not just wealth.\" So based on the above statement, Obama is assuming that affluent individuals don't work for their wealth. With that being said, isn't Obama wealthy? Why would we then want to elect a President who doesn't know how to work? 1 Comment \u00bb 28 06 2008 The Toyota Pious and Substitution Effects Posted by: IM, in Economics Living out here on the \"left coast\" I can't but help notice all of the new and improved hybrid vehicles traversing the roadways. The technology is way cool and the underlying concept should be applauded. But are these new contraptions really helping solve the problems that they were designed to address...i.e. the transition from petroleum based energy sources to other, more eco-friendly renewable energy sources? I'm not so sure. As humans we have a tendency to make changes only as a matter of dire necessity. It is probably one of mans greatest flaws, but it is hard wired into our being. Now don't get me wrong. I don't have a problem taking pre-emptive measures to perceived problems; however, often externalities exist that are diametrically opposed to the problems at hand. Let me explain with a well known example involving mandatory seat belt laws. Around 1985 the government felt that too many people were unnecessarily dying in automobile accidents. As such, the birth of mandatory seat belt laws became widespread in this country. The idea sounds great. The results, not so great. Because more people were now wearing seatbelts, incentives were created that enticed people to drive more recklessly (this is sometimes referred to as risk compensation). As a result there have been more automobile related deaths, not less. The interesting thing, however, is that the group that felt the impact the most were those not even in a vehicle. It was pedestrians getting clipped in crosswalks that bore most of the brunt. On a side note, one economist said that if you really want to decrease the number of car related deaths then we should mount daggers on the steering wheels of all cars pointed directly at the driver's heart. There is no doubt that drivers will then drive carefully. This example is extreme, but the point clear. Unless the incentives are strong enough, most behavioral modifying solutions don't work. In fact, they often make things worse. Well, having said all that, the question that I have is whether or not these new vehicles are speeding up or slowing down the transition to alternative energy sources. I dare say these cars may be \"slow bleeding\" the evolutionary process. If we are really going to make an adjustment away from oil, then we are going to have to run out of it, plain and simple. As supplies become even more scarce and as demand globally ever increases, prices will further rise (they can still go higher) and that is when real substitution effects will take place. Then, and only then, will the incentives be strong enough to guide us towards the use of alternative energy sources. When the price of oil comes down, and it will as soon as we fix the broken dollar and drill, the green movement amongst the every day Joe will become a thing of the past because it will no longer be trendy. In other words, I'm sure the price of oil and the price of granola is highly correlated. So in the name of energy independence and environmental protectionism, I am going to continue driving my truck with the pedal to the metal, using the A/C to cool the neighborhood and may even leave a couple lights on to boot. No Comments \u00bb 20 06 2008 Questions for Barack Obama Posted by: IM, in Economics In conversations with friends, I've made the assertion, sometime last year, that Barack Obama will be our next President. This is not what I consider to be optimal by any means, but Obama has a messianic following while at the same time having very little substance or any real accomplishments associated with his candidacy. It is quite amazing and frightening at the same time. As I was sitting listening to one of his campaign speeches, I compiled a list of questions that I would honestly want to address him if given a chance. Here they are: 1. Are you aware that Exxon Mobil's tax liability for 2007 is $30 billion (a tax rate of roughly 41%)? Given that Exxon Mobil pays as much in taxes annually as the entire bottom 50% of all individual taxpayers and that the tax rate for the bottom 50% is only 3% of adjusted gross income, can you really take more money from these guys on the basis of \"fairness?\" 2. Can you run through the logic on how you are going to keep jobs here in the U.S., while concomitantly raising the corporate income tax rate on domestic businesses and campaigning against free trade? And, do you really think it is wise to raise taxes on capital gains and dividends? 3. Are you worried about how small business owners will be impacted if you rollback the tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% given that some small business owner's revenues are passed through and taxed on the personal income level? In your view, is a small business owner who earns $250,000 a year the same as an individual who earns $250,000 a year? 4. Since you are so ethusiastic about raising taxes on the wealthy, have you ever paid more to the IRS than required by law? There is an option to pay more to the IRS if an individual feels the need to do so. 5. How do you plan on paying for all of the entitlement programs that you've outlined given that the only source of revenues you've mentioned would come from letting the Bush tax cuts expire on the wealthy? And, are you aware that the supply of taxable funds supplied by the upper 1% echelon of income earners is extremely elastic, meaning you can't raise taxes on this group and expect to raise revenues. The opposite is true for middle income tax payers. If you cut taxes for the middle class you will lose revenues. So, raising taxes on the wealthy while at the same time cutting taxes on the middle class will surely lead to a fall in revenues accruing to the federal government. 6. How can you be certain that the creation of an industry focusing on green technologies will lead to the creation of millions of jobs? How would you address the real phenomenon of creative destruction? Meaning, it may be true that the creation of a new, green based industry will lead to job creation, but what about the jobs in the \"old' industries that are rendered non-existent. For example, what is the net effect on jobs if oil refinery workers lose their jobs while others are hired to harness the green energy from jelly bean fields? Have you conducted any dynamic analysis? 7. Do you agree with the following quote, \"from each, according to his ability; to each, according to his need?\" If so, do you know who said it? (Karl Marx) If anyone can provide an answer to the above as a proxy for Obama, I'm all ears. I may just be ignorant to the issues and am always looking to be enlightened. 1 Comment \u00bb 18 06 2008 Recycling Bacon and Hunting for Polar Bears Posted by: IM, in Economics I've recently decided that though I love planet Earth, I will never become an environmentalist. The reason is simple...it is no longer a way of doing things, rather it has become a theological bureaucracy. There is no such thing as two way dialogue with an environmentalist because if you somewhat disagree with the movement, especially with the global warming alarmist, then you must hate the planet, not care for future generations and want to kill puppies. I'm being sarcastic (somewhat), so let me keep it going to illustrate a simple concept: incentives matter. As humans were are innately programmed to do things that are in our own self-interest. For individuals we are driven to maximize our consumption at the lowest cost, and for businesses it's to maximize profits given certain constraints. By doing such, as individuals and businesses, we maximize the greater good. Not a new concept, just read the \"Wealth of Nations\" by Adam Smith. The reason is simple; no two parties will engage in a transaction unless both parties benefit. There are certain situations where this is not the case, when there is an asymmetry of information for example, but for most of the time it is. Let's apply this to the environment, more specifically, recycling paper and protecting polar bears. There are numerous facilities and individuals who are huge advocates of recycling paper. Why? Duh, it's obvious isn't it? To reduce the number of trees harvested in order to make paper based products, hence saving the planet's forests. On the surface this logic seems correct, but let's drill down a bit further. Paper companies have an incentive to make sure that there are always an abundance of trees because trees are the primary input in the production function for paper products. Given a specific quantity demanded, paper companies will harvest trees and convert those trees to the various paper products to sell for a profit. They will then replant knowing that they will need trees in the future to keep up with demand. If demand falls, due to all of us recycling, then the incentive to replant is somewhat diminished given the fall in demand for their products, hence, a fall in the total number of trees on the planet. Let's apply the same logic above to bacon. What if we could recycle bacon (I know it sounds gross, but bear with me)? Well, the demand for pigs would surely fall. The farmer, trying to keep costs in line with the new demand function for bacon, would reduce the number of pigs raised and maintained. The farmer's incentive to raise pigs is diminished due to the fall in demand for bacon leading to an overall fall in the quantity of living, breathing swine. Why would the same not be true for trees when there is a fall in demand for paper? A major, heart-tugging example of the consequences of global warming is the claim that polar bears are going extinct (I don't know if this claim is true). The solution for this is simple. Privatize the existence of polar bears and sell hunting permits, with seasonal limits of course. The entity turning a profit by selling the hunting licenses will always make sure that polar bears exist. I know someone is thinking, what about the free rider problem i.e. poaching? First, the existence of polar bears would be privatized meaning they are no longer a public good and second, poaching would exist with or without a market for polar bears, so it's a bad argument. Giving property rights over the world's supply of polar bears would ensure that they thrive in numbers. If you don't believe me, let me know when deer go extinct. Now I'm obviously being cynical with this example, but the point should be clear...incentives matter. Plus, I subscribe to the belief that anything cute and furry shouldn't be hunted yet alone eaten. Simply to conclude, I think we would all agree that a cleaner planet is better than a dirtier one. The question is how do we get there while minimizing the unintended consequences? And, by the way, it's not via Crap, I mean Cap, and Trade. I'll post on that later. 2 Comments \u00bb 17 06 2008 GoodFellas and the Laffer Curve Posted by: IM, in Economics The Laffer Curve has been around for quite some time and graphically displays the interactions between tax rates and tax revenues. The renowned curve visually demonstrates the straight forward idea that between 0 and 100 percent there are two tax rates that will generate the same amount of tax revenue to the government - a low rate on a broad base or a high rate on a small base. Understanding that people respond to incentives is key to understanding the Laffer Curve. When tax rates are high people's incentives to work, produce and otherwise generate taxable income is low. While government may collect a huge share of each dollar of income generated, the volume of income is low. And following the same logic, when tax rates are low, taxable income is high. Yet somehow these fundamental economic certainties have eluded and been misunderstood by many. Sicily is known for being the citadel of organized crime dating back hundreds of years where incentives are dictated by the Mafia to generate revenues for the Mafia. Incentives such as baseball bats applied to kneecaps were the methods of choice to encourage customers to pay. Now the weapon of choice appear to be lower \"protection fees.\" As a result the Mafia has created a pro-growth environment where they have expanded their \"client\" base, convinced existing \"clients\" to work more and increased revenues stemming from extortion based activities. First it's the collapse of Communist Russia turning into a flat-tax phoenix and now the Mafia itself. When will the neo-conservative trend end? Modern day mobsters have realized that offering carrots will get the carriage moving a lot faster than pulling out the whip. They have decided to use supply-side economics as their newest method of persuasion. The results have been positive in a perverse sense and have brought a tear to the eye of the Capo de tutti Capi. Laffer Curve Fundamentals The basic idea behind the Laffer Curve is that there is a relationship between tax rates and government revenues and that a change in tax rates can affect the level of revenues accruing to the government. When tax rates are cut, or raised for that matter, there are two effects that a tax rate change will have on total revenues. The first effect is the arithmetic effect and is simply the change in tax revenues per dollar of tax base given a change in tax rates. If tax rates are lowered, tax revenues per dollar of tax base will be lowered by the amount of the decrease in the rate. The second effect is called the economic effect, which demonstrates that individuals respond to incentives. The higher the tax rates are, the less will be the incentive for people to engage in the taxed activity. Therefore, when tax rates are cut people will be more inclined to engage in the taxed activity triggering a pro-growth environment where workers are more inclined to work, employers to employ and producers to produce. Thus, a tax rate cut will result in a broader tax base which in and of itself would lead to more tax revenue. Now the arithmetic and economic effects always work in opposite directions and, a priori, it is not quite clear whether total revenues will increase or decrease in conjunction with a tax cut. But in an environment with excessively high tax rates it is more likely that a reduction in tax rates will cause the economic effect to dominate the arithmetic effect, leading to an absolute rise in total revenues. The arithmetic effect is more likely to dominate when tax rates are low. The same underlying concept can be applied to other aspects of the economy, or even organized crime in this case. Instead of viewing the concept of the Laffer Curve within the construct of tax rates and government revenues, it can be used to understand how lower extortion rates can lead to an increase in the Sicilian Mafia's \"client\" base and in turn an increase in revenues from illegal activities. The diagram [HERE] is a graphic illustration of the concept of the Laffer Curve - Mafia style. At an extortion rate of 0% the Mafia will obviously collect nothing in terms of extortion-based revenues. Likewise, at an extortion rate of 100%, the Mafia would also collect zero in revenues because no one would be willing to work for an after-extortion paid wage of zero - there would be no \"client\" base. Between these two extremes there are two extortion rates that will generate the same amount of revenue: A high extortion rate on a small \"client\" base and a low extortion rate on a large \"client\" base. Everybody Pays, Everybody Pays Less \"Pagare tutti, pagare meno\" seems to be the motto of modern day organized crime and loosely translated it means, \"everybody pays, everybody pays less.\" This is supply-side inventiveness. Apparently the Mafia has been setting rates in the prohibitive, or \"Nice Guy\", range of the Laffer Curve because they have in fact widened their client base and increased their revenues by reducing their extortion fees, or \"pizzo\" as the Sicilians call it. The Mafia can be thought of as a miniature government, and the extortion fees charged can be thought of as a tax. The only real difference between the federal government and the Mafia is that the federal government doesn't send Vito after you with a tire iron if you avoid paying your taxes. Rather, the government sends lawyers, prosecutors and bureaucrats. Which is worse, I am not sure. The fundamentals of the Laffer Curve can be applied directly to the confined economy that exists within organized crime and, not to our surprise, the effects of lowering extortion rates on neighborhood \"clients\" are exactly the same as when tax rates are reduced on the citizens of a nation. In the past the Sicilian Mafia ran a tight ship, as in if you don't pay you will end up becoming best friends with a cinder block and a large body of water. As of late it seems that the Mafia has had either a change of heart or mass doses of sensitivity training. When Mafia bosses catch wind that a \"client\" is not happy and is considering flipping state's evidence, they no longer have that person and/or his gene pool eliminated but rather send \"diplomats\" to listen to the disgruntled individual in order to keep them within the customer base. The Mafia's \"customer service representative\" will assuage the unhappy individual by lowering the extortion rates that the person has to pay. At the lower rate the individual no longer feels asphyxiated by the excessive extortion fees and finds it more opportune to work more and deal with the Mafia as oppose to avoiding them. Hmm...does this sound familiar? But have the \"tough guys\" really become soft around the edges? The answer is probably not. In fact the Mafia is not lowering the rates charged to be philanthropic or to all of a sudden be nice, but rather to generate more income. The leaders of organized crime have obviously been brushing up on their economics because they figured out the basics of the Laffer Curve - if extortion rates are lowered then \"clients\" will work harder, there will be a broader base to extort and in turn there will be equal if not increased extortion based income. The new strategy is simply to lower rates and cast the net of protection across a wider area, even to include the smallest of shopkeepers. Surprisingly a lot can be learned from the Mafia's example. Incentives are a very powerful tool and people definitely do respond differently to positive versus negative incentives. When negative incentives are created because of poor policy, individuals avoid the situations that are creating those incentives. The exact and extreme opposite is true when positive incentives are the result of pro-growth policy. No Comments \u00bb 17 06 2008 The Role of Speculators: They're not the Bad Guys Posted by: IM, in Economics Recently in the media there has been an over abundance of talking heads who want to run speculators out of the futures market in order to stem the rising price of oil. It is apparent that these folks skipped Econ 101, but took Econ Dumb-01 and truly don't understand the role that speculators play. I'm not going to get too deep into how a futures market operates, so keep your eyes open and try not to fall a sleep. A futures market is a highly regulated auction style market where market players buy and sell commodity, and soon to be service (click here for details), based futures contracts for the delivery of an underlying good on a specified future date. Futures contracts are not the same as forward contracts and differ in a few ways. While both futures and forward contracts are contracts that promise to deliver an underlying commodity at a future date, forward contracts are traded over-the-counter while futures contracts are always traded on an organized exchange. Futures contracts are highly standardized and are rebalanced mark-to-market while forward contracts are not. With futures contracts being marked-to-market daily, they are less suceptible to the credit risk associated with forward contracts as the spot price deviates from the contract price. Also, in terms of delivery, the short position on a forward contract makes delivery to an entity specified in the contract, while in a futures market there is a clearinghouse that facilitates the exchange (most futures contracts are settled with cash). Inherent in any business environment there is risk associated with the supply and demand for goods and services. These businesses use the futures market to hedge against this risk. For example, a portfolio manager may hedge against future losses in the stock market by shorting stock index futures. Farmers, not knowing what the future prices will be for their crop at the time of planting, can sell off their inventory for a guaranteed price today and then deliver it at the time of harvesting. They are willing to potentially take losses, if there is a drastic fall in supply at the time of delivery, in order to remove the volatility in prices for their crop. On the other hand they are protecting themselves from a drop in prices if there happens to be an overabundance of crop supply at the time of delivery. Now, an important fact about futures markets is that they are a zero sum game, i.e. the gains to the winners accrue from the losses from the losers. What this means is that a futures market wouldn't function if the only market players involved wanted to simply unload risk. There has to be players that are willing to take on risk, i.e. provide liquidity. This is where speculators come in. Speculators are willing to put their capital at risk, for a price, hence providing liquidity to the market. To boot, the more competition among these speculators decreases the cost of hedging for those trying to protect themselves from downside risk. Also, the presence of many speculators allows events to be priced into the market for the underlying commodity virtually in real-time. The more transparency a market has, the more efficiently it will operate. Rational speculators, those who don't continually buy high and sell low, actually provide an equalizing force in the market place by providing liquidity and contributing to price discovery, and are critically essential for free markets. They are not a destabilizing force as argued by many, and running speculators out of the market is not the answer to sky rocketing oil prices. If we want to bring oil prices down, then we should explore for oil domestically and increase domestic refining capacity, thereby, increasing the supply while concomitantly removing the intrinsic political risk associated with doing business in the Middle East. If we want to transition to alternative energy sources, then nothing should be done about the price of oil. It should be allowed to climb as high as we are willing to pay. At some maximum substitution effects will dominate consumptive behavior and the evolution away from oil will take hold. 1 Comment \u00bb Entries (RSS) and Comments (RSS).

Afraid you might have to actually learn something about reality that contradicts your Bible? No worries, just make a fake campus in your megachurch and get your multi-million dollar salaried pastor on the board of trustees of a small but reputable institution in some other state. From the Raleigh News and Observer: DURHAM - For four years, N.C. Central University operated a small satellite campus at a suburban Atlanta megachurch run by a university trustee, offering a series of programs that were never properly approved by university system officials. Paperwork oversight? Unlikely. \"I can think of no justifiable reason why the former NCCU leadership would have completely ignored and failed to abide by the appropriate approval process in creating this program,\" UNC system President Erskine Bowles said late last week in a statement e-mailed to The News & Observer. \"Such action is contrary to all university policy. To say the least, it is very disappointing. We are working closely with Chancellor [Charlie] Nelms and his new leadership team to examine the various academic, legal, and financial questions associated with this Georgia-based program.\" But what if you get busted, you ask?

August 7, 2008 \u2014 Lou FCD Schoolhouse by Nicholas_T @ Flickr From the Letters to the Editor section of the Jacksonville Daily News (bold in the original): BOE's attorney fees need more scrutiny To the editor: If the recent action by the Onslow County Board of Education in regard to the board attorney's contract isn't sufficient evidence that the citizens of this county are being fleeced, read on. Until July, Alex Erwin was employed by the board under a self-renewing contract guaranteeing him an $11,250 per month retainer for a minimum of 75 hours of legal services with a maximum of 100 billable hours in any one month. For the past several years, Erwin has never failed to maximize the total billable amount and has in fact constantly carried forward hours he indicated were in excess of his billable amount. This has landed him checks totaling $180,000 each year. During the July meeting, the board voted to increase Erwin's monthly billable threshold to 125 hours, giving him a $45,000 per year raise and extending his contract until 2012. This is more than many teachers in our county are paid annually. (Continued below the fold.) Read the rest of this entry \u00bb Posted in Education.

Though I had other plans lined up for today, I took the time to go down to Coastal and meet with a counselor, since that's the only way I could get the scores. I showed up after having picked up the boys from weight training, and having dropped off Kay at Jane's work so she could use her car. The waiting room was packed, and the lady told me it would be about a two hour wait. Well, I had time, so I put my name in and took a seat. Right off the bat, sitting on the couch, it occurs to me that I am the sole man in the room. Yeah, it's so gonna suck being a college student. (Just kidding, honey!) I read through an old copy of Our State magazine, watched people come and go, saw the others ahead of me go back, saw people come in behind me, flipped through the course catalogue, and eventually, just about two hours after I walked in, one of the councelors came out and called my name. We walked back to her office while she flipped through my little folder. \"Did you take the placement exam?\" \"Yeah, a couple days ago. Tuesday.\" \"Huh. It should be in here then.\" She showed me a seat in her office, sat down, and looked on her computer for my scores while telling me not to worry, they'd be in there. They weren't. She left to go find them. She came back a while later, and was looking at the paper in a strange sort of way... I was suddenly very nervous. \"uh...

The English part was pretty easy, though some of the answers were a matter of choosing \"which one of these choices sucks least?\" in the part where I had to correct an essay. At least two of them were \"which one of these is correct, but the most uninteresting way you could possibly write this sentence?\" The math part gave me an issue or two, mostly stuff I knew but couldn't pull the methodology out of my butt. A little creative tinkering with the calculator got me to the answer via work-around, I think. \"What would happen if I performed this operation?\" and \"Well, that answer can't be right because it would work out to something not even vaguely in the ballpark\" types of things. I took my time, was the second from the last to finish the exams. Clocked in right under two hours, and the test was un-timed anyway. I was more concerned with getting as many right as I could than finishing quickly. I'll know on Thursday how I did.

I'm always grateful that there are some people in the county who obey the leash laws, and don't allow their dogs to run free. I always worry about dogs that aren't on leashes. Oh, not worry that they'll bite me or anything, I worry about the dogs themselves. I worry that they'll run out in front of a car, or get lost, or picked up by the dog catcher. I'm so glad you are enough of a concientious dog owner that you and your son keep all four of your dogs leashed while you walk them. Kudos to you. I'm also eternally grateful that you don't bring them down my street and allow them to crap on my lawn instead of your own. That's so very considerate of you, and more considerate than a few people in my neighborhood. However, if I may, please allow me to make one small observation.

Trying at times, but definitely interesting. Especially when he is such an extrovert. There is nothing outside the limits of his curiosity, or his humor. Nothing. I like that about him (usually). Put two of them under one roof, add the cover of darkness and sparklers, insanity is inevitable. It just is. We went and watched the fireworks at Camp Lejeune last night, as we do every year. Nice display, though a little shorter, smaller, and less dramatic than usual. Parking was a little better handled this year, and leaving the base not the usual pain in the ass. Of course we had D with us this year, and it was his first time that he could remember going. He and J.P. hung out and kept each other occupied and out of trouble, so it worked out pretty well all the way around. The fun really started after we got home. Fireworks are mostly illegal in North Carolina. Well, illegal to possess. Apparently, not illegal to sell, as they sell all sorts of things in Wal-Mart, Sam's Club, at road-side stands, etc. that I would think fall outside the law. It's one of those things that come the approach of Independence Day, everybody just sort of ignores, I guess. I don't mess with them, just because they're illegal. It's just not worth the potential hassle to me, and I try to set a good example for the kids. But somebody gave Jane a few boxes of sparklers for the kids, and I don't have any problem with that (they're legal), so once we got home (10:30/11ish), I sat out on the porch and lit sparklers for the kids. They were tough to get going, so I lit them and handed them off. Remember the two teenage boys? Yeah, that wasn't going to be interesting enough, by any stretch.

(Still hard to get over her working and driving and all that!) She'd gotten a block down the street. A friend of my son, we'll call him D, lives down there. He's kind of one of my adopted children. D was home alone, and his house had caught fire. I grabbed both house extinguishers and started to run down the street, hoping it was maybe a pot on the stove or something. No. When she said \"on fire\", she meant \"on fire\". D was out and unhurt, spraying the garden hose in one of the front bedroom windows, but it was a battle he had no chance of winning. At the very most he might have slowed the fire a little until the fire companies got there - except it was already in the ceiling and attic. It was brave, if hopeless.

On the way over, I pull up to a red light, and the car does something it's never done before, something not good. The RPMs drop, it starts to sputter and choke. I've seen this behavior before, when I drove old beaters, so without thinking I react, slap it in park. I can't remember what the cause of it is, though. The RPMs come back up and smooth out, but then climb to about 2500. Yeah, that's what I expected, but I still can't remember what horrible thing is going on under the hood. I kick the accelerator down, thinking \"sticky throttle?\", but knowing as soon as the thought comes that this isn't the problem. The RPMs come back to where they should be, and the engine settles down, back to its normal hum. I'm talking to my car, my baby. \"Please, not today. I love you. I love you more than my wife.

The lady at the admissions desk was very kind, I was my usual charming self (not flirtatious, but charming in that Southern Way I've picked up over my adult life), exchanging pleasantries, blah blah, she gets the packets, writes a note at the top of the math packet, highlights some stuff up there, gives me the English packet, explains that I don't need an appointment, take the exams by the 27th, blah blah, transcripts, blah. Lesson 2: Read the Instructions I bring the pile of papers home, set them on my desk, fetch all my old math texts, fold the cover page and the introductions over to open the math packet to the first problems and start diving in. First five pages is elementary school/ middle school math, no problems, then some very basic algebra, some geometry, nothing I don't still master, 'bout page 20 I start seeing secants and quadratics and irrational numbers and radicals, and I start working and referencing, and looking up and trying to remember, and working sample problems. I've been working at getting enough of a handle on enough of the material that even if parts of it escape me, I can come back to it over the summer and give it my full attention, and in the meantime still get enough questions right to pass the test.

I drink a couple pots a day, which probably isn't terribly healthy. With that kind of (over)usage, I tend to go through coffee pots fairly quickly. Usually, I'm happy to get a year or two out of them, so I don't bother spending a great deal of money on them. Last year, on Mother's Day, my $10 Sunbeam decided it had had enough, and just stared angrily at me, rather than make my damned coffee. Recalcitrant jerk. It was Sunday, it was Mother's Day, it was 6 A Fracking M. How terribly rude and inconvenient. Fortunately, Wal-Mart is open, even on Sunday, even on Mother's Day, even at 6 A Fracking M. It took some time, and was somewhat later in the morning before I actually got out the door, but I came home with my very first Mother's Day present (from myself). I decided I'd splurge, and see if I could get more life out of something more expensive. It was sleek, black, and had a cappuccino / espresso maker attached. It was awesome, and I looked forward to the occasional chokalokacappuccino mocha latte ramalamadingdong. Sadly, by Father's Day, the thing would take like an hour to brew a pot of coffee, and gurgled and wheezed and caused the windows to rattle and I got the occasional complaint from the neighbors. I could always tell when they had planned on sleeping late in the morning by the evil stares across the yard in the afternoon. I had brewed too early. Still, I was determined to get my fifty bucks worth, and I've put up with the rattling, groaning, overpriced piece of garbage for over a year now. This morning, the neighbors are happy. They are asleep in their beds, contentedly dreaming of JanieBelle and Kate and Lilith and Lucifer, whilst I sit here writing nonsense, enjoying freshly and quietly brewed joe. Little John, his own father now a permanent resident of California, surprised me with a beautiful white cheapo coffee pot for Father's Day, and I love it dearly already. But this Father's Day brings me strange and sad news already as well.

Goals for which we strive, and rightly so, I think. I tend to see things in black and white. Sometimes I forget we are just humans, and humans are messy creatures. There is always the constant struggle between what we want and desire for ourselves and what is right for us and those around us. Life is not always right and wrong, but sometimes a sliding scale of amorphous choices, in which nobility and honor and honesty and integrity are a subjective judgement of actions or character, imposed by history in retrospect. Who is more noble, Ashley Wilkes or Lancelot? Who had more honor, in the end? Which was more honest, and which had integrity? Can we fairly judge, not having been in either of their shoes exactly? Are we hypocrites all? Are these questions just philosophical masturbation? Perhaps, just perhaps, they were both just human after all.

Not a cloud in the sky. Brutal to be at my son's block party at school, but sometimes, a Dad's job is never done... My wife and I went and volunteered to chaperon. We lasted about an hour and a half, and fortunately, they were sending the kids back inside early because of the heat. I don't think I could have taken much more. I like it hot, but this was withering, without a sea breeze. Got home and Shakespeare needed to go out. I took him out, he did his thing, he said out loud, \"Dude. Fuck this.\" He's lying on the cool carpet under my desk. I'm just going to cool off with Shakespeare under the desk for the rest of the day. The lawn needs mowing, but I just don't care right now.

New window Monday, July 14, 2008 The AAP, Seafood, Open Access, and More It's been a bit quiet around here cuz things have been quite hectic around here, that is, here at Lemmings and here down under. Ya know, conferences, visitors, the Wig, dinners, and deadlines. Will be back with more frequent postings and updates after things quiet down at the end of August. In the meantime some announcements: New window Monday, May 19, 2008 34th annual meeting of the Society for Philosophy and Psychology Just returned from the AAP -- the Australian version of the APA -- highly recommendable. Much like Pacific APAs, just better. David Chalmers has uploaded some pics from the conference. The seafood was just fabulous (hate that word but it's true), the talks were very high quality (blind refereeing is highly overrated!), and our very own Jonathan Schaffer won the prize for the best AJP paper in the last couple of years. That's impressive, especially given that he just won the APA prize for the best journal article in the last couple of years. Good going, Jonathan! Later this week there is a fantastic-looking conference on the relational and representational character of perception, organized by Susanna Schellenberg. So, if you're in the neighborhood, you probably would do well to check it out. Episteme, Issue 4.3 - a themed issue on Testimony will be freely available for download for 14 days (July 7 - July 21). I am a big fan of open access! The latest issue of The Reasoner is now freely available for download in pdf format. I am a big fan of open access! There is an upcoming graduate philosophy conference in the Nothern spring 09 at the University at Buffalo on the work of Lynne Rudder Baker, followed by a grown-ups conference, also on the work of LRB. Attendees include: Lynne Rudder Baker (MIT), Amie Thomasson (U of Miami), Derek Pereboom (U Conn), Crawford Elder (Cornell), and Brian Garrett (McMaster). Check it out. I think this X-PHI survey is still running. If it is, go take it. It's good fun and actually makes you re-evaluate your own beliefs, desires and intentions -- probably not what they intended but a nice side effect. And, according to Jonathan, I am now officially a supporter of X-PHI (having run a couple of highly irregular linguistics surveys) -- so go take that survey, would you!

Living Room has called its quits. It is always good to see a label go when the people behind it thinks it's time for something else: it reminds us of the fact that in indie (which should not be confused with indie) it is love and enthusiasm and nothing else that matters. The label, which had been going since 1994, was one of the few that mattered in the country and has certainly left its mark on the local music scene. Not everything they released is my cup of tea, but they did release records by The Cuties and Damer, for which I will be eternally grateful. Meeting Jan and Andr\u00e9 to see a band or have a drink (or preferably both at the same time) has always been good fun and it's a shame geographical complications will make me unable to attend their farewell party, 23 November in Ekko.

It was always going to be a reading holiday: I really like Thessaloniki, but I've spent enough time there to feel a resident rather than a visitor with an urgent need to see the town. Also, more than anything, I needed some time to relax and empty the brain. Still, before I took the plane back home on Monday, I had read all the books I had bought for the purpose as well as the two spare ones I had borrowed from the library. That was when I picked up Andrew Sean Greer's The Story of a Marriage from Dimitra's pile. It turned out to be the best book I read this summer. There are a few authors whose prose is so beautiful that after finishing a book you want to start again right away just to experience their choice of language some more. This happened to me earlier this year with Marilynne Robinson and then with Jon McGregor. Now I felt the same about Andrew Sean Greer. Apart from the subtle, almost poetic language, he shares both mentioned authors' capacity to really and deeply understand someone's life. It is hard to say what the book is really about without spoiling part of the story, but Greer (born in 1970) portrays an interesting and touching picture of things people didn't talk about in the early 1950s in the USA (or anywhere else, for that matter). Added to that, the plot is as surprising as brilliant, and takes the book to even greater heights. I almost cried when I finished it on the plane. posted by martijn at 10:29 pm | 0 comments0 comments close 0 comments Loading comments...

The days are covered with a thin layer of melancholy, for in the past 22 months, I have grown quite fond of Exmouth; if not of the town itself, then at least of its many small shops. But more importantly right now are the questions of how are we going to fit everything in boxes and where will we find enough of those boxes in the first place. But then, as of tomorrow, everything will be New. New flat, New neighbourhood, New shops, New city and, of course, New address. Do not hesitate to ask for that if you need it; mail sent to Exmouth is unlikely to reach us after next week. We will be without broadband for one or two weeks and it might be a bit (more) quiet here. Not that you will notice the difference of course, but it also explains why I'm taking even longer to reply to that email you sent me such a long time ago. And I might not find the time to announce the next Exeter Goes Pop!: on the 17th of July at the Phoenix in Exeter, between 8pm and 11pm and all for free. It will be the last club night in the Phoenix, so do come along if you can. posted by martijn at 8:11 am | 0 comments0 comments close 0 comments Loading comments... Pipas - Boxes [last.fm / youtube] If you don't see anything appear within ten seconds or so, please use this direct link. I once was an indiepopper. Today, on the train to work, I found myself listening to Leonard Cohen. I blame The Guardian, whose edition of Saturday contained a booklet with some of the man's lyrics. Had I bought Friday's paper instead, I would have been listening to the Arctic Monkeys. Except that I wouldn't. Here are some random, and predominantly indiepop-y, bits and pieces that I thought were too good to keep for myself. In its almost 20 years of existence, Slumberland Records have released records by Black Tambourine, Rocketship, Stereolab, The Aislers Set, The Saturday People and a great many more. They could have released a few death metal records, and I'd still love them. Thankfully, they haven't. The label is doing a series of split 7s under the moniker Searching for the Now. Bands that have featured on the first four releases include The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Bye! and The Happy Couple, while future releases will include Pants Yell!, Eux Autres, Soda Fountain Rag and Pipas, among many others. For people whose record player is hidden in a wardrobe, or who are going through a not-quite-indiepop phase or who are just too lazy to keep up with new releases (like me, in all three cases), every eight singles will be compiled on a CD. And there are mp3s of the songs to be downloaded from the label's website too. Four years ago, I attended the fifteenth anniversary party for Hamburg's Marsh-Marigold label, home of all great German bands that aren't called The Bartlebees. It was a superb night, with many great performances, so it is a bit of a shame that now, a little over four years later, I won't be able to attend the label's 20th anniversary. (Running a label makes time go by really fast.) The party, to be held in Hamburg from 18 to 20 July incidentally is also the 40th birthday party for label boss Oliver Goetzl. Much smaller, in name, fame, age and release format, is London's WeePOP!, whose first anniversary party I missed earlier this month, but who have some new releases \u2014by bands like the Just Joans and One Happy Island\u2014 which is worth a mention anyway.

Indietracks and to honour that fact (the festival, not my birthday), the Make Do and Mend label have released a compilation with 45 (!) songs by as many performing bands. If you don't see anything appear within ten seconds or so, please use this direct link. The estuary. Especially when seen from the train during spring mornings, when the sun is in the West and shines its light to reveal the true beauty of the Exe's east bank and the hills beyond. Also: little egrets. Exmouth shops. The town might be the second biggest settlement in Devon proper, but it has still a fair amount of 'village shops', the presence of which can not be annulled by the likes of Somerfield, Boots and Woolworths. I get all melancholic when I think about my weekly round of shops, getting bacon from the butcher, salmon from the fish monger and what not from the health food shop. Apart from those, I can not wait for us to move. There is a point when ones possessions become so manyin comparison to the dimensions of a flat that keeping it tidy becomes almost impossible. We had reached that point a while ago. Having a home 'office' in the corner of the living room, although a big improvement from spending four nights a week away from home, is far from ideal either. Fortunately, three weeks are not very long. Given what needs to be done, they actually are rather short. And then we will be based in Exeter. I have not seen many places in England, but I doubt there are many I like as much as I like Exeter. And no matter whether it's for the pop Pop!, for the football, for the city or just for us, you should come round and visit. posted by martijn at 4:40 pm | 0 comments0 comments close 0 comments Loading comments...

Wordle's tag cloud based on the contents of this blog's main page. Guess by the way what still doesn't work? [via, via] If you don't see anything appear within ten seconds or so, please use this direct link. This Sunday, we've been mostly fighting against a computer virus. In a weak moment of carelessness, we had invited it onto our laptop and it did not want to get away from there. It was the first time I had seen a virus in the wild; until now the only ones I had come across were those I was allowed to play with during a workshop. Therefore, it wasn't too bad an experience, especially since I've been working for a company which, to put it cynically, exists solely because there is an ever-growing number of people writing those damn things. Up to now it had been a bit like working at a hospital, without even knowing what a headache felt like. The virus itself was a rather annoying one, changing several settings and trying to lure us into 'fixing' the computer, which, that much I know, would have done a lot more harm. Still, it took several hours and two anti-virus programs to have the trojan... mysteriously disappear from our computer. But it all could have been worse. The Gpcode virus, which has been discovered recently, is capable of encrypting files using 1024-bit RSA encryption. It is not too often that my past and my current jobs meet and I have to admit I'm following the developments on this virus with more than average interest. RSA, which uses nothing but second year undergraduate mathematics, is a popular and potentially strong way to encrypt files and is used, for instance, when you are using online banking. All you need to use RSA is a public key (that you are supposed to share with the rest of the world) and a related private key (that you keep private). In one of its applications, someone can send you a message, encrypt it with your public key, and therefore be sure that only you, being the sole possessor of your private key, can decrypt and read the message. What the Gpcode virus does, is exactly that: it encrypts your files using public key of the virus writer; hence only this person, or group of people, who keep their private key secret can decrypt your files and restore them to their original state. Which, in fact, they are happily willing to do for you. If you pay them a ransom, that is. Ransomware has been seen for quite a while now, but virus writers generally used pretty weak encryption and just hoped you would be scared enough to pay them a ransom. This time, they seem to have been capable of encrypting files a lot more seriously. Researchers have guessed that it takes 15 million computers a year of computations to crack the encryption, which means computing the private key from the public key. If that doesn't sound bad enough to you, how about my guess that it will take posted by martijn at 10:14 pm | 0 comments0 comments close 0 comments Loading comments...

My life as a fifth year's student of mathematics had become as aimless as a John Terry penalty and as dull as a Geoff Hurst anecdote; hence in my eternal wisdom I decided not to go abroad for a some time, but rather spend at least another four years doing almost the same. I am still grateful for the job I had been given, mind you, and I did mostly have an enjoyable time but, when a few years later I found myself at a point in life when I did need to focus, I found myself incapable of doing so. As a side-effect of all that, I still have not finished that damn thesis. Which in turn helped me find a goal today, which was a bank holiday, and which I would have spent in an aimless haze otherwise. Instead, disregarding any 'should I not have done this earlier?'-feelings, I am suddenly feeling rather happy with myself.

Since you asked, Exeter City beat Cambridge by one goal to nil last week and thus reclaimed their place in The Football League. Which is great, firstly because they are my favourite team, secondly and thirdly because of that too, but also because in the past years, the club has gotten rid of their debts and, while at it, of the crooks who caused those debts too. Now it is a healthy club, run by its fans, strongly embedded into the local community and with players who don't get paid ridiculous amounts of money. It is good to like a likeable club. If you don't care about such things when choosing a team to support, you might be delighted about the sixteen unlikeable teams who will contest the European Championships starting next week. (Mind you, I would lie if I said I'm not going to follow it at all. In fact, watching Portugal beat the Netherlands in Klaipda four years ago, with all the players' names being Lithuanianised \u2014 Japas Stamas, Vandersaras\u2014 is one of my personal football highlights.) For lack of participating team from the British Isles, you might even consider supporting 'Holland', as the Dutch national team is generally known as. In today's Guardian, one Geoff Hurst gave five reasons for doing so. The Dutch, for example, play really good football. Also they have really good players. These players, furthermore, play football really well and some of these players are even better than others. Finally, there are loads of tulips in the country. Which, if you asked me, are rather sad reasons for supporting a team, are they not? Unless, of course, you are really into tulips. (Geoff Hurst was a footballer who played for Stoke City and West Ham United and now spends his days telling tedious anecdotes involving tulips.) posted by martijn at 11:40 pm | 0 comments0 comments close 0 comments Loading comments...

Elenette, whose Autenticitet EP on Cosy Den may well be the best Swedish language pop I have ever heard; to New Zealand's The Puddle, whose No Love, No Hate was a fine listen of Go-Betweens-y garage pop for the past few months; to the half-Scottish Social Services, whose The Baltic Sea should become Sweden's national Anthem; and to London's Still Corners, whom I am definitely going to see at Indietracks this summer, if only they play History of Love.

While I'm officially still employed as just a web developer, my job has become an interesting mix of things among which 'computer security journalist'. In that role, I occasionally warn people to keep their web software up-to-date, because tools like WordPress are known to have bugs discovered in them occasionally; not updating them would make it fairly easy for anyone with evil intentions to turn your blog into one that serves malware to anyone visiting your site. Which is probably the internet-equivalent to carrying a very contagious virus while welcoming people in your shop. When I'm just another WordPress-blogger though, like most people I tend to be lazy; hence I too had not upgraded WordPress in donkeys' years. I have now. Luckily, upgrading WordPress has become a piece of cake, not in the least because of the automatic upgrade plugin. I even like the new dashboard layout. And I excitedly discovered it tells you which of your plugins have a newer version and lets you upgrade them with one click as well. Unfortunately, I was a bit too excited about that. Not until I had upgraded all my plugins, did I remember that I had tweaked the last.fm plugin a fair bit. Of course, all my changes were made undone by upgrading and I had forgotten to make a backup-copy of the plugin. So it suddenly shows me a few dozen songs I have listened to today, rather than just the five most recent. I can live with that, I suppose. posted by martijn at 10:53 pm | 0 comments0 comments close 0 comments Loading comments...

Months of februariness and only last weekend I was still wearing my winter coat because it was cold enough for that and now, all of a sudden, it is uncomfortably hot even wearing a summer coat. Arriving at Reading station yesterday around noon made me feel like the world had retreated for a siesta. So was it weeks of dull and grey weather that made April go by in a daze? If it wasn't for last.fm I would have believed I hadn't listened to music for weeks. But even last.fm shows I did not play many songs and those I played were mostly by bands I have known for years. Easy listening: new music does not manage to excite me these days and I even can't be bothered to even give things a try. Which is quite alright really: there is no have to any more when it comes to music and good songs will be good songs tomorrow too. Or next week. Sometimes one needs to take time to recharge one's batteries, to get oneself together and re-focus on whatever things in life needs focussing. Which are quite a lot of things if you ask me and if you are me. Funnily enough, football manages to excite me a lot more than music at the moment. Exeter's current form \u2014 which, after coming back from 1-3 down on aggregate to local rivals Torquay and turning it into a 5-3 win, will take them to Wembley again Sunday next week \u2014 certainly helped the excitement, but can not be the sole reason. Football is nice and easy to follow: you just hope your team wins and if they don't, you're a bit sad and you think about all those people all around the world, though mostly around Exeter of course, being a bit sad too and that makes you happy again. Tim asked if I had been to any of the play-off matches, which I took as 'why didn't you go', for that is what he should have asked, as no, I did not because I'm shy and tend to prefer staying in above almost anything. And I don't like to spend money. But next season. Next season we will live in Exeter and I can go to the park more often. Regardless of next week's result, I should. And I will. And it is way past seven and the sun is still shining and there are ducklings in the pond and if it wasn't for them I would have believed it is July already. And life is good. posted by martijn at 7:41 pm | 1 comment1 comment close 1 comment Loading comments...

Scanning the reviews for the Burton/Schumacher series as its latent eccentricities blossomed into a hornier, MTV version of the '60s television show, one finds a rising chorus of demands for something \"darker,\" \"edgier,\" \"more adult,\" a resistance and even revulsion for the franchise's aestheticized distance from its material. Overreacting to complaints from parents over excessive violence, Warner Bros. amped up the camp in spite of agonized critics and fanboys, who at the time were reading a lot of Frank Miller and Alan Moore. Even in that first film, the \"darkest\" of the four, Jack's Joker was \"too over the top,\" Beetlejuice as Batman too \"weird\" and \"wimpy.\" Never say Hollywood can't learn from its mistakes. The producers have figured out how to please everyone: maintain earnestness regardless of the inherent absurdity of the genre, be 'topical' by way of empty allegory, be spectacularly violent, never stop moralizing. Meet these requirements, and a great deal of variety is possible: one has free reign to be jokey or serious, bright or gloomy, undisguisedly sexist, racist, homophobic, or none of the above, 'critical,' or 'wish fulfillment.' Or all of the above. These labels are simply not the creator's responsibility. Restore the superhero's propaganda function, in short, and in so doing prove Sontag's thesis that \"pure camp\" is always so for the future and not the present.** The comic book-loving nerds of my generation are now faced with the dubious realization of our pubescent dreams: the nerds have taken over Hollywood, and the responsibility thus falls to the Figure of the Superhero to 'teach us' something about the \"human condition.\" Pairing up the summer's two most critically and commercially successful entries: Iron Man and The Dark Knight, is instructive. One or two professional critics noticed the balls-out obvious apologies for the authoritarian, repressive 'excesses' of global capitalism, but the vast majority of the critical and popular response made me feel like I was in a bad parodic update of 1984 -- of the very few who bothered to address the films' unavoidable (or so I thought) pseudopolitics, the smart ones and the dumb ones alike seemed generally pleased. Neoliberal assumptions (avowed or disavowed) are typical for the output of most mainstream cinematic and critical output these days, and it's usually not even worth mentioning in the individual case. I bring up superhero movies in this context because they're just so open about it. And yet a liberal media that would spend half the day spitting on Bush and the evils of multinational corporations can spend the other half hyperbolically puffing a movie that shares, in exaggerated form, the contorted view of reality demonstrated every day by these institutions, some of which produced the films. What I suspect underlies the general tolerant attitude towards their content is the comforting but kind of really unlikely and unfounded assumption that corporate mass entertainment expresses collective desires -- even that it does so better than a production financed independently. We are then able to rationalize objectionable content. The curiously archaic gender roles -- the women of IM and TDK essentially spend the entire movie trying to decide who to screw -- are of a kind with the racial politics -- witness IM's moronic (and casually incinerated) Arab barbarians and their helpless Arab victims, TDK's Asian menace, its blacks whose humanity is dependent on their obedience to legitimate authority (the ferryboat prisoner's conscience is portrayed as spiritually profound while all the Joker needs to do to make two gangsters fight to the death, which we see them prepared to do on all fours, is drop a stick and say 'go'): they must be ironic, or 'really' a clever auto-critique. As chabert describes here, the meaning of what we see is deferred to a menu of metaphysical choices provided by the film itself -- positioning ourselves in relation to these ambiguously warring 'philosophies' is what gives the calculatedly shocking imagery its significance for us as individual viewers. But one need not approach the film in anything like an intellectual way, analysis is optional. Should one be unable or unwilling to process an image or line of dialogue, an alibi is always in play for shrugging it off as a completely meaningless special effect: \"it's just a comic book movie, man.\" Superhero movies are ideal for this sort of operation because they are what we might call post-genre. As A.O. Scott writes in the second linked article at the top of this post, their 'laws' are the abstract ones of the corporate PG-13 'blockbuster.' A hero is born, develops into an ideal self-image, inherits fortune along with an inevitable enemy who must be defeated via increasingly lengthy, bloodless explosions, etc. Given those requirements, all existing genres are fair game. IM is a little bit science fiction, a little bit Top Gun/Iron Eagle, visual borrowings from mecha anime, splash of romcom patter, pinch of Jackass (in a couple faux-amateur handicam shots of Stark hurting himself while testing his military hardware). These elements are not so much blended as they are thrown together, so that the film shifts around spastically in tone and style despite the grinding forward motion of its 3-act machine. TDK labors under a more consistent directorial hand, but its plot structure is similarly incoherent. About the only stabilizing force available for readings of either film comes from its foregrounded ideological formulas, which are both horrendous, but as I said earlier, optional, the films keeping themselves 'open' for more 'complex' interpretations. They're for kids and adults. The apparent openness of interpretation is more true of TDK than IM, since most of the latter's appeal is predicated on us being charmed by Robert Downey Jr. We watch him progress from bad-boy pop star captain of the military industrial complex to good corporate citizen, with a heart of liquid fusion (or something like that). In the comments of the post above, chabert remarks on the unreconstructed '40s era mores assumed without irony by a number of recent mass entertainments. I would have said '50s, as it seems clear to me that fantasy today is determined by its reaction to crisis; that decade's tropes, the power of technology despite (and even because of) recognized dangers, the insecure overstatement of moral and political superiority over monstrous enemies, the total subordination of women and 'minorities,' have been cropping up all over the place, from the queasy nostalgia of David Lynch to their seamless blend with 'realism' in IM and TDK. As Voyou writes, we seem to be experiencing a \"repetition-as-farce of the '50s\" in a number of areas, an experience perhaps of the failed realization of an older dream of the future. IM views the War on Terror and the energy crisis through 1950s-colored glasses, much like the original '60s character did for Vietnam and the rise of multinational corporations; its solution is to take the heroic-yet-faustian scientist figure out of his lab coat and literally meld him with the product of his alienated labor, only conceivable if he is also a capitalist. The film never stops playing up his personal power, making him out to be a hip pop mogul a la Steve Jobs. We see, however, that this flashy, superficial power is predicated on some major blind spots in his consciousness (i.e. his weapons are used to kill people). His path to true power (and moral vindication) is to master his personal limits. He builds his own Iron Man outfit, he completely binds his company to himself by rooting out the Jew-Arab conspiracy initiated by his co-CEO (not kidding, also his name is Obadiah), he shifts his company's business away from weapons (which can be 'misused') to privatized renewable energy (which clearly can't). He ends in a position of absolute control of his much-enlarged personal effects, the power journey going hand-in-hand with the moral journey, a necessary connection demonstrated by Stark scrupulously avoiding 'collateral damage' while blowing up Genghis Khan-quoting Arab terrorists, generating clean energy (the same substance that powers his heart!), and resisting the urge to pull a Mr. B on Gwyneth Paltrow's ingenue secretary. Once all these trials are completed, we get the basic difference between IM and TDK -- Stark can 'come out' as Iron Man. Maximum power=maximum accountability -- though retaining secret paramilitary backup just in case -- in other words, the old Clintonian boom years restored. Padraig notes in the comments here that Bruce Wayne's buyout of his own company (his repression of finance capital) makes him an old-school conservative, not a neoliberal. Stark does the same thing. So they are both, in a reactionary way, skeptical about capitalism (aren't we all). IM is organized around the fantasy that military power and accountability (and personability, charm) can and indeed must be seamlessly blended through a reassertion of natural and ethical limits, but TDK is structured by a series of interlocking thought experiments, the universalization of predetermined binary 'choices.' The film's much-vaunted 'shades of grey' are an effect of the complex 'moral calculus' needed to function in such a constrained environment, where you can't even blow up one little apartment building without elaborate justification, a challenge which mirrors the intellectual effort necessary to take this movie as seriously as its critics seem to. That it is considered more \"serious\" than IM -- IM is a \"guilty pleasure\" or an \"entertaining romp,\" TDK is a \"pulp epic\" of \"boundless imagination\" -- is evidence of the stronger cultural cache of deterministic 'pessimism.' We're presented with a bunch of high-powered decision-makers with entertainingly conflicting and destructive worldviews, not necessarily as points of identification (we're shown that Batman, the Joker, and Two-Face are all irresponsible assholes) but as points of departure for our own analysis. I'm reminded of a wikiquote from Slavoj iek colonizer of academia for the pop culture machine: iek: Yes, and the age of philosophy in the sense again that we are confronted more and more often with philosophical problems at an everyday level. It is not that you withdraw from daily life into a world of philosophical contemplation. On the contrary, you cannot find your way around daily life itself without answering certain philosophical questions. It is a unique time when everyone is, in a way, forced to be some kind of philosopher.Beyond the 'entertainment value' of things blowing up on huge IMAX screens, beyond the collector's appeal of the pop cultural references, the only value of these movies is equivalent to their ideological function: that we can use them to think about the world. The Batman film especially gives us the 'tools' to believe that we are 'some kind of philosophers.' We're supplied with easily digestible nuggets pulled from headlines and pop filosofy with which to examine and 'problematize' our lives with the dilemmas and theories of Great Men: the ethics of extralegal power, chance vs. anarchy, the surveillance state, \"what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object\" (another romcom setup!), all products of the clash of concepts. Any complicating factors which might come from a different engagement with reality are removed. One could say I'm being fussy, as this is all pretty standard convention for the creation of fairytales, but then, \"why so serious\" if it's assumed we all know better? As always, the way to understand ideology is not to ask 'what does the film think,' nor 'what can I think through the lens of this film,' but 'what does thinking 'with' the film prevent me from thinking.' They are not interested in making 'arguments' (that's our job), their job is to reinforce premises. Not because their creators have malicious intentions, but because it is important for their financial backers and consequently for them to ensure that those premises remain profitable. For example, the baseline pessimism and dependency that supports big-screen violent fantasies along with the notion that it is \"easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism\" is comforting, enabling to all kinds of fantasies, and serves as ground zero for a set of trained assumptions about the world, along with the opinions, laudatory, apologetic, or critical, derived from them. This is one definition of 'popular.' Movies featuring Batman and Iron Man are art in the same sense that this is art, with the important exception that Jeff Koons really exists. They are carefully planned and promoted media events; the buzz is the art, the actors' personal lives are art, the criticism is art, the advertising is art. The profit is art. Everyone's opinion is potentially valuable. Discussing the 'object itself,' relying on the tools it provides us with, is sort of quixotic in this context, inescapably minor and cliquish no matter if the critical lens is in the high culture modes of philosophy, psychoanalysis, and political theory or the sewers of fanboy mythography (not to mention the middle ground, allegorizing with headlines). Doing so just identifies the speaker with their discursive order: nerd, cult studs academic, movie critic, political moralist, etc., and helps establish a system of exchange between these 'fields' and the Hollywood production line. Given the increasing 'popularity' and 'purity' (openness/emptiness) of the object, what more can one reasonably expect? Corporate cinema has pushed the superhero, a product of a genuinely popular (though not universal) culture, beyond the limits of what it can encompass. As an entirely derivative studio subgenre the superhero movie seems about to commence its very own fake self-deconstruction phase, repeating a cycle that had already run its course in the comics world by the time Batman came out in the late '80s. What it needs is its Don Quixote, what it's getting is its Unforgiven. That's what they're selling: who's buying? *1978's Superman, aside from its inevitable (and like Phase 1 Batman, increasingly campy) sequels, didn't really start a trend, and so I count it as more pioneer than progenitor. Evidently there were still more than enough non-comic book, but equally homoerotic/phobic superheroes for Hollywood to entertain us with. ** OTT, 300 is going to be amazing in 12 years or so, if any of us are still alive. Wednesday, July 23, 2008 Apes, legal personhood and the plight of Nim Chimpsky Digg this Add to del.icio.us Stumble It! Technorati Apes, personhood and the plight of Nim Chimpsky. Eberhart Theuer: A legal person would be something like a company or a certain society that in itself, or a fund that has certain rights without being a natural person. Anita Barraud: This is similar to the US in common law notion of a juristic person that can apply to corporations and organisations that they're artificial persons created by the law. Eberhart Theuer: Exactly. Paula Stibbe: It's not talking about the rights for non-human animals to go and vote or be able to go to university, that would clearly be inappropriate and ridiculous. This is about recognising that non-human animals share with us sentience, which means that they have the ability to suffer, and that they have interests which can be damaged.In sci-fi-philosophic terms, this is the distinction between sapience and sentience; while apes likely cannot \"think\" in the human sense, they and other animals can certainly feel pain, and that capacity is something we are morally obliged to respect. I say likely because I am by nature extremely wary of the anthropomorphistic tendency to project human emotions and consciousness into animal behavior that is actually instinctual or learned\u2014in general I'm impressed with Daniel Dennett's theory in Kinds of Minds that our dogs appear to \"love\" us precisely because we've selected for just that impression over millenia of canine domestication. But as an anecdotal matter I must admit this is really evocative: Paula Stibbe: I've learned what he likes to do most, what food he likes to eat most, though that would include some games. He likes to use charcoal with paper sometimes to draw, or chalk. Anita Barraud: What does he draw? Paula Stibbe: They are kind of abstract angular kind of works and he takes the paper and the chalk and he leans against the wall, he bites his bottom lip and concentrates really hard on what he's doing. He won't let himself be distracted while he's drawing. (cross-posted at gerrycanavan.blogspot.com) Tuesday, July 22, 2008 thoughts on zizecology - 2 Digg this Add to del.icio.us Stumble It! Technorati There are two primary axes of political conflict in Kim Stanley Robinson's incomparable Mars trilogy: first, the expected (almost generically required) question of independence vs. interdependence with regard to the mother planet, Earth, which is really a question about Utopia and enclavism that is concretized in the fierce battles over the space elevator; and second and more relevant for my purposes today is the fierce break between the Red Martians and the Green Martians. The Greens believe the planet should be terraformed so as to inhabitable by humans without mechanical assistance, a technical problem that clumps around issues of surface temperature, atmospheric composition and density, and unpredictable climactic feedback mechanisms; the Reds believe the planet should be left as pristine as possible, whether because this is the only way it can be properly studied or because the otherwise dead rock is seen by some Reds to have a kind of mystical vitality all its own. Of course, Greenism and Redism both describe ideological spectra, not discrete sets of propositions: some moderate Greens propose to terraform only up to a level of 5 km, leaving Mars's huge mountains relatively untouched, while others believe the planet should be maximally terraformed and still others believe it should be terraformed only to the light-facemask level\u2014while for their part the Reds are divided between those who would only act as a partial brake on unchecked development and radical terrorists who bomb critical life-support equipment in an effort to force humans off the planet. And Redism is surely doomed, doomed from the moment of its first articulation on the Ares bringing the First Hundred colonists to the Mars\u2014doomed by the decision to colonize the planet in the first place, if not by earlier manned missions, if not by bacteria carried over on the Viking landers. The originary, humanless Mars\u2014the natural Mars\u2014is in this sense a logical impossibility\u2014in order to exist at all, in order to be a real place as opposed to some far-off speck of light in the sky, Mars must exist for us, which is to say Mars must enter into (human) history. It must be changed; it must be ruined. The Reds have always, necessarily, lost, though their recognition of this fact that doesn't dim their fervor. I bring this up as in attempt to return to iek's critique of ecology, specifically the radical reconsideration of finitude he ignites in the latter half of the essay. iek seeks to unmask liberal ecology as simply the latest ideological backing for the biopolitical structures of capitalism as a whole. \"Today's predominant mode of politics is post-political bio-politics,\" iek writes, and accordingly ecology's primary locus of action should be understood as an ecology of fear. iek does not deny the reality of the potential catastrophe we face but rather opposes the ends to which this potential disaster is rhetorically purposed:The lesson this ecology is constantly hammering is our finitude... This is why, although ecologists are all the time demanding that we change radically our way of life, underlying this demand is its opposite, a deep distrust of change, of development, of progress: every radical change can have the unintended consequence of triggering a catastrophe.What iek reveals, then, at the heart of liberal ecology is a deep-seated, unacknowledged conservatism that weakly opposes the status quo in appearance only to work to preserve it in reality. The ecology of fear's recognition of our precariousness, of our absolute contingency, iek says, in fact induces us to cling to the devil we know: With regard to this inherent instability of nature, the most consequent was the proposal of a German ecological scientist back in 1970s: Since nature is changing constantly and the conditions on Earth will render the survival of humanity impossible in a couple of centuries, the collective goal of humanity should be not to adapt itself to nature, but to intervene into the Earth's ecology even more forcefully with the aim to freeze the Earth's change, so that its ecology will remain basically the same, thus enabling humanity's survival. This extreme proposal renders visible the truth of ecology. And the problem goes still deeper. Given the Malthusian proportions of the current population of the Earth and the extreme, highly energy-dependent requirements for industrial agriculture alone, if the industrial civilization that is currently wrecking the planet were to suddenly stop, this too would be a disaster out of proportion with any ever experienced in human memory. We find ourselves trapped no matter which way we turn. \"Nature,\" as such, has in this sense already been entirely lost\u2014an observation iek draws in part from Timothy Morton, author of Ecology without Nature, who writes that \"it is very hard to get used to the idea that the catastrophe, far from being imminent, has already taken place.\" I am reminded here of Norbert Weiner's memorable depiction of the human race as \"shipwrecked passengers on a doomed planet\" in 1950's The Human Use of Human Beings. In recognition of the essentially entropic nature of the universe, Weiner asserts, the proper response is not despair or catastrophic fatalism but rather resolve to meet our challenges head-on and keep the final catastrophe as far off as we may. Weiner, despite his scientistic and technocratic positivism, becomes revealed as a proto-ecologist in this iekian sense, an ecologist aiming not at preservation but at utilization and manipulation. Felix Guattari, too, comes to make essentially the same claim in his \"The Three Ecologies\": There is a principle specific to environmental ecology: it states that anything is possible\u2014the worst disasters or the most flexible evolutions. Natural equilibriums will be increasingly reliant upon human intervention, and a time will come when vast programmes will need to be set up in order to regulate the relationship between oxygen, ozone, and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere.We can add to this a whole host of possible geoengineering projects, including the new proposal to add lime to the oceans to combat climate change that I blogged about just this morning. Guattari's vision of a \"machinic ecology\" is positively Weinerian in scope, if not utterly Promethean\u2014he goes on to argue that the telos of humankind is in part \"to dare to confront the vertiginous Cosmos so as to make it inhabitable,\" not simply to keep equilibrium or stasis but indeed to bend all of nature to our will (if with the proper ecosophic respect for life at all levels). If all this is true, why then does contemporary liberal ecology present itself in opposition to technological civilization and progress as such? How does ecology resist the recognition of its own central contradiction? iek attributes ecology's conservative blindness to a kind of childish denial, a refusal to accept emotionally what one knows to be the case intellectually, a psychological inability endemic to the modern age to reconcile cold scientific appraisal with common sense. iek\u2014perhaps not unexpectedly\u2014relates this fundamental divide between scientific knowledge and the Wisdom (\"the basic trust in the background coordinates of our world\") we need to \"unlearn\" to Lacan's notion of the \"big Other,\" the Symbolic figure whom we believe will \"guarantee the harmony between the levels, to guarantee that the overall interactions will be satisfactory.\" There is, of course, no big Other\u2014we are flying blind, with no co-pilot\u2014and the first solution to our predicament is the old Lacanian one of recognizing this uncomfortable fact: \"And the lesson of ecology is that we should go to the end here and accept the non-existence of the ultimate big Other, nature itself with its pattern of regular rhythms, the ultimate reference of order and stability.\" What iek rejects here is any notion of equilibrium (to use the Club of Rome's preferred term) or sustainability (to use the one currently in vogue). But this, it would seem to me, is in the end a too-wide application of the category of denial that itself amounts to an act of denial in the end. In the end, the fact must be admitted: All this\u2014technological civilization, even one that is ecological in the iekian/Guattarian sense\u2014simply cannot go on forever. There is, in the end, a limit point, some point past which it is simply impossible either to grow and expand on the one hand or perfect and regulate on the other. The laws of physics\u2014the laws of Weiner's entropic universe\u2014are in the end a kind of actually existing big Other, a big Other of a sort that cannot be dispelled through Promethean know-how, or through the infinite adaptability of the market, or through a position of Lacanian self-knowledge. In the end, they are final, including and especially the first and second laws of thermodynamics ( You can't get something for nothing, and Things fall apart.) There is, in the end, reality, such as it is. Given this, it seems prudent to inculcate some capacity to recognize and respect the limits to growth. In this sense Guattari and especially iek seem to get their infinities tangled up\u2014the flexible recombination of the market is of a very particular and limited kind, and should not be confused with the actual ability to do anything. iek is wrong, too, to argue that finitude necessarily leads to a hopeless conservatism, because the recognition of our finitude is also the prerequisite for effective ecological knowledge and environmental policy in the first place. There could be no ecology without finitude\u2014what need would there be for it?\u2014and in this sense finitude cannot ever be tossed out; it must rather be acknowledged, and assented to, even as we seek to do what we can for ourselves within that frame. It is only in first studying and understanding nature as \"the ultimate reference of order and stability\" that ecologists can come to know what they can and cannot do, what is and is not possible\u2014and therefore it is only in first recognizing and respecting natural patterns and regular rhythms that the ecologist can begin to do anything at all. Finitude, this is to say, is better understood as an immanent principle of existence rather than as some transcendent imposition from above. The finitude imposed by entropic nature is as much the playing field as it is a barrier or limit point. There is, of course, every reason to think that capitalism is uniquely unprepared to recognize either version of finitude, or to approach its production capacity with anything resembling rational growth\u2014if, that is, we have not in fact already and unknowingly flown past it. Rather, as Foster continually reminds us through his invocations of Marx, capitalism itself is the primary accelerant towards our own immolation. The problem is not merely the ceaseless, unchecked drive towards accumulation\u2014though this of course is crucial\u2014but also the ways in which there is no ability under capitalism to regulate the desires of consumers except by sudden (and in this case likely irreversible) scarcity: a crisis. John Bellamy Foster writes in Ecology Against Capital:For Marx, the very nature of capitalist society from the very beginning had been built on a metabolic rift between city and country, human beings and the earth\u2014a rift that has now been heightened beyond anything he could have imagined.... There is an irreversible environmental crisis within global capitalist society. But setting aside capitalism, a sustainable relation to the earth is not beyond reach. To get there, we have to change our social relations.Evoking John Kenneth Galbraith's famous dependence effect, which reverses the classic economic relationship between commodity and need to understand capitalism as first producing needs for consumers which its products then step in to fulfill, Foster concludes that the relations of production within capitalism will simply never be capable of generating \"a society governed not by the search for profit but by people's genuine needs, and the requirements of socio-ecological sustainability.\" In line with his understanding of Marx as a proto-ecological thinker, as elaborated at length in his 2000 book Marx's Ecology, Foster calls this state of affairs socialism. First and foremost among the things such a socialism will require, in part, is a ideology\u2014really, an ethos\u2014that would allow us to imagine a future for humanity that is neither radically Utopian or radically dystopian/apocalyptic, but rather in continuity with the present. The language of sustainability that Foster uses is one such paradigm\u2014but I find myself attracted instead to what Kim Stanley Robinson has called permaculture. In a recent interview with the Web site BLDGBLOG, Robinson defined permaculture in this way:But if you think of yourself as terraforming Earth, and if you think about sustainability, then you can start thinking about permaculture and what permaculture really means. It's not just sustainable agriculture, but a name for a certain type of history. Because the word sustainability is now code for: let's make capitalism work over the long haul, without ever getting rid of the hierarchy between rich and poor and without establishing social justice. Sustainable development, as well: that's a term that's been contaminated. It doesn't even mean sustainable anymore. It means: let us continue to do what we're doing, but somehow get away with it. By some magic waving of the hands, or some techno silver bullet, suddenly we can make it all right to continue in all our current habits. And yet it's not just that our habits are destructive, they're not even satisfying to the people who get to play in them. So there's a stupidity involved, at the cultural level. ... We should take the political and aesthetic baggage out of the term utopia. I've been working all my career to try to redefine utopia in more positive terms - in more dynamic terms. People tend to think of utopia as a perfect end-stage, which is, by definition, impossible and maybe even bad for us. And so maybe it's better to use a word like permaculture, which not only includes permanent but also permutation. Permaculture suggests a certain kind of obvious human goal, which is that future generations will have at least as good a place to live as what we have now. Permaculture, in this way, weds the techno-optimism of iek and Guattari with the eco-pessimism of Foster in a way that accounts for the rightness of both. It rejects the paradigm of sustainable growth in favor of what it is essentially raw futurity, the ethical imperative not only that there should be a future but that the people in it deserve a decent world in which to live. This, Robinson says, is closely tied to his career as a science fiction writer, which he imagines speaking both from and for the future: And you try to speak for them by envisioning scenarios that show them either doing things better or doing things worse - but you're also alerting the generations alive right now that these people have a voice in history. The future needs to be taken into account by the current system, which regularly steals from it in order to pad our ridiculous current lifestyle.For there is a third, unspoken suggestion in permaculture, too, beyond permanence and permutation, and that of course is permafrost, that permanently frozen tundra of the Arctic and sub-Arctic that is now for the first time in human history beginning to melt as a result of anthropogenic climate change. The future is indeed under genuine threat; the crises are indeed real, and perhaps the catastrophes as well. And as these things happen, and we continue to do nothing, our chances at permaculture, and a livable, better future, slowly melt away. Monday, June 16, 2008 Extinction level event Digg this Add to del.icio.us Stumble It! Technorati Love then screams in my own throat; I am the Jesuve, the filthy parody of the torrid and blinding sun. Let's consider Danny Boyle's Sunshine as both a characteristically exaggerated response to environmental crisis and an extended visual pun on the term 'Enlightenment.' The genre is easily the one most in tune with my lizard brain, sci-fi horror, combining an alien menace, cosmic scale, and the latent erotics of the military-industrial complex. The premise is suitably elegant: an elite crew of astronauts have to rejuvenate the dying sun by penetrating it with a huge bomb, thus saving the human race from extinction. There's a jingoism to this film that is no less present for its lack of national identification or corresponding ideological threat. It delivers the jingoism of crisis, its stance resolutely 'post-ideological,' a fantasy wherein the reactionary instincts of the nation-state are subordinated to the non-negotiable reality of impending destruction (though memorialized, aesthetically, by the pretty faces of the globalized cast). Humanity can then be reduced to its more cinema-friendly, individual-universal 'weaknesses,' such as lust for power, envy, moral feeling, and susceptibility to the sublime. All of which prove themselves to be liabilities in the crisis situation, if forgivable as sources of dramatic suspense, bathos, etc. A more 'objective,' classier...right, the UK, post-9/11 version of Armageddon. So do we then say Sunshine belongs with the recent spate of non-U.S. westerns, the parent genre to a certain dominant mode of science fiction? Naught Thought thinks so, in this piece understanding the already post-national history of the European Enlightenment as one with the history of colonial expansion and imperial violence. The obvious touchstone in contemporary philosophy is with Jean-Fran\u00e7oisLyotard's essay \"Can Thought go on without a Body?\" where the extinction of the human body is equated with the death of the sun, the absolute limit of thought. Bodiless thought is not without material conditions, but is also not reducible to preserved remains or combinatoric repetitions, the recorded memories which might manifest in, say, a satellite that outlasts the collapse of the solar system. Artificial intelligence, Lyotard claims, cannot be reducible to a program. It must be able to transgress its own limits, must carry some immanent differend, a complex, a libidinal motor for drives, desires, will. It must suffer. Thought, like the marauding cowboy, must have spurs. Lyotard's philosophical myth can be read as a gnomic restatement of the question of 'late capitalism' -- how does expansion continue in a post-ontological (post-national) universe? More or less rhetorical, its function is to reinforce the truth of its presuppositions. Post-American westerns and western-infused sci-fi serve as good popular counterparts: anti-heroes slay evildoers in spectacular fashion despite existential ennui. But the intrusion of horror complicates things somewhat. The inversion of the western, horror consists of variations on home invasion rather than the quest. Its villains tend toward the abstract. Like obvious influences 2001, Solaris, and Alien, Sunshine's setting is a 'haunted house in space,' a seemingly familiar structure infected by its vast, unfamiliar outside. Though the sun's five billion years premature decrepitude is never explained within the film, on the DVD commentary we're informed that an invisible force of matter gets trapped by the mass of the sun and begins to eat its way out. We're also told that because of our sun's relatively middling mass, this could never actually happen. Despite the realism of the hardware and the performances, then, the film is really closer to a thought experiment with set parameters, one of those 'push the fatty or pull the lever' things, than to traditional 'speculative fiction.' And unlike conventional horror there is little mystery even for the characters -- the premise is, not exactly established, but asserted beforehand: \"If the sun dies, so do we.\" Lyotard's question is answered with a simple \"no.\" Aesthetically Sunshine is wonderful when the sun is front and center -- CGI actually works in space -- and enjoyable in that modern, overbearing way when its not. Though like many movies these days it demands you think it intelligent for quoting the 1970s, and in the end a third-act slide into Event Horizon territory ruins all hope for respectability. After a series of moral dilemmas where the crew makes increasingly irrational blunders deviating from 'the mission' (trying to save the crew of the previous vessel is the first fateful misstep), they find themselves stalked by a crazy speechifying Romantic villain, in the Kurtz/Pinhead vein: I am Pinbacker, Commander of the Icarus One. We have abandoned our mission. Our star is dying. All our science. All our hopes, our... our dreams, are foolish! In the face of this, we are dust, nothing more. Unto this dust, we return. When he chooses for us to die, it is not our place to challenge God. Pinbacker's God-given task is to 'enjoy,' once and for all, the limit that the crew is determined to transgress. This limit, the border between the human world tamed by Enlightenment reason and its conditional beyond, is transcendentalized, the products of the former -- organized life, technoscience, the 'modern world' -- understood as a gnostic veneer over the Truth. After all, death, the horizon of experience, makes life itself intrinsically unknowable regardless of what form it takes. \" Resembles Life what once was held of Light, / Too ample in itself for human sight?\" But the significance of the 'beyond's' effect on the 'here' is reversible: plenitude or negation of meaning. In Lyotard's understanding, if thought dies with the sun, then \"everything is dead already.\" Pinbacker, on the other hand, aims to preserve the dialectic of human and inhuman knowledge by halting its progress, thus sacrificing the human species in exchange for an eternal moment of personal transcendence. Pinbacker's wish for 'totalitarian' transcendence is countered by the moments of selfless, hopeful transcendence experienced by (some members of) the heroic crew. A moral lesson: being obliterated by the sun while saving people is just as awesome as being obliterated by the sun while exterminating them. Quite apart from the romance of Enlightenment, the film's obscure object of desire, is the persistence of a certain ethical code, staged here as logical responses to objective facts. If the crew had stuck to the mission parameters (if they hadn't been swayed by moral sentiment to try and save the previous crew) they would have all survived. We are reminded over and over again that 'transcendence,' a category which seems to encompass more and more each day, is theft, from man and reason. A delusion, a drug trip, a private spectacle. A luxury. The last shot is the homestead on Earth, saved by what they will never know. In a time of certain crisis, an elect is permitted to live like heroes so that we don't have to. For us the sensible thing is to follow orders. 'They' will never know, but we will, all for the price of a ticket. Certain crisis. Would extinction matter if there were no one there to enjoy it? Friday, June 6, 2008 thoughts on zizecology 1 Digg this Add to del.icio.us Stumble It! Technorati Lord Stern, the World Bank's former chief economist, said governments had been slow to accept the awful truth that usable water is running out. Fresh rainfall is not enough to refill the underground water tables. \"Water is not a renewable resource. People have been mining it without restraint because it has not been priced properly,\" he said. If Slavoj iek is Theory's official contrarian, it still surprises to find him taking aim at what is surely among the most widely held shibboleths of the contemporary left, environmentalism\u2014and yet this is exactly what iek has done in recent lectures published on his Web site, lacan.com, and popularized on the video site YouTube. His critique of ecology centers around a series of interrelated claims regarding late capitalism and ecology's functioning within it, central among them what he describes as today's \"Fukuyamaian\" consensus: the unacknowledged majority view that history did in fact end with the fall of Soviet communism, that \"liberal-democratic capitalism is accepted as the finally-found formula of the best possible society, all one can do is to render it more just, tolerant, etc.\" Ecology, then, becomes simply the latest set of technologies and practices through which we can \"perfect\" capitalism; the possibility that ecology might function as an operative challenge to the market is always already proscribed by the Fukuyamaian assumption that ecology (like anything else) can only operate within and through the market. This is to say that we understand ecological correctives to capitalism as in some sense needing to pay for themselves: we will change our consumptive practices only when the price of oil becomes high enough to so induce us, just as the market will encourage the development of alternative energies and more efficient engines at such a time as they become profitable\u2014and so on and so forth, while the planet burns. Subsuming ecology to the logic of the market, iek says, has a number of pernicious consequences. First, the belief that the market's \"invisible hand\" will operate as a kind of Hegelian \"Substance\" that dominates the individual subject is unsettled by the newfound potential of individual actors to effect world-historical change:What looms on the horizon today is the unheard-of possibility that a subjective intervention will intervene directly into the historical Substance, catastrophically disturbing its run by way of triggering an ecological catastrophe, a fateful biogenetic mutation, a nuclear or similar military-social catastrophe, etc. No longer can we rely on the safeguarding role of the limited scope of our acts: it no longer holds that, whatever we do, history will go on. For the first time in human history, the act of a single socio-political agent effectively can alter and even interrupt the global historical process, so that, ironically, it is only today that we can say that the historical process should effectively be conceived 'not only as Substance, but also as Subject.'The market, that is, can no longer be trusted to intervene and \"course-correct\" the destructive behavior of individual actors, precisely because a single wayward individual can impact, unsettle, or even destroy entirely the market itself. (Notably, even the Catholic Church has suggestively adapted to this new post-Hegelian reality, with its recent announcement of a new set of 7 Deadly Sins for the modern age, including among them pollution, genetic manipulation, participation in morally debatable experiments, and amassing excessive wealth.) To imagine global capitalism standing unchallenged as the end of history, then, is to ignore Substance's newfound subjectivation at our collective peril\u2014it may well be that we shall all be destroyed before the logic of history is able to right itself, or, indeed, that the logic of history actually now points catastrophically towards our own doom. Next, iek writes that the logic of the market obscures the individual's role in second sense: thinking and acting ecologically becomes equated with a certain set of consumer practices that in many cases have, at best, only a tangential relationship with what actual ecology would look like. Liberals, even those fancying themselves environmentalists, happily shop at Whole Foods and Starbucks because these corporations \"sell products that contain the claim of being politically progressive acts in and of themselves\"\u2014obscuring not only the dubiousness of many or all of these claims of \"good consumption\" but also allowing the anti-union and otherwise exploitative practices of these companies to fade harmlessly into the background in the face of an often-misplaced, self-satisfied sense of \"ecological awareness.\" (Proclaimed environmentalism becomes in this way a type of free P.R., allowing such companies to effectively buy good-will on the cheap.) These two points, if anything, actually fail to take us far enough. iek writes of \"the infinite adaptability of capitalism which, in the case of an acute ecological catastrophe or crisis can easily turn ecology into a new field of capitalist investment and competition\"\u2014but such glib if backhanded praise of the market only works to obscure the fact that the efficient functioning of the market system is the ecological catastrophe already in process. Nowhere is this fact made clearer than in John Bellamy Foster's first book The Vulnerable Planet, which is a grim guided tour of the history of ecological degradation from the start of the industrial age to the present, a process that began with primitive accumulation's lassoing of the environment and has only accelerated during the period of revolutionary technological expansion following World War II. Such destruction, Foster says, is essential to capitalism's structure, and thus unchangeable:[Capitalism] is a system of creative destruction, in which the creative drive is the seemingly infinite ability to produce new commodities by combining materials and labor in new ways, and the destructive drive is the systematic degradation, transformation, and absorption of all elements of existence outside the system's own orbit.The so-called \"infinite adaptability\" of the market therefore should be understood to necessarily require environmental destruction of some form or another for its own creative functioning\u2014and therefore the destruction is not some potential or theoretically correctable side effect of the market's functioning but its very engine. Contra iek, the supposed newfound power of individual actors to affect History by degrading the biosphere only masks the extent to which capitalism has always demanded widespread and irreversible environmental degradation in order to function in the first place. Later in the same book we find Foster aptly describing the way that nature is figured dialectically as both inside and outside capitalism's orbit, a position that allows it to be drawn from for capital without ever being allowed to fully become capital itself (and, as capital, therefore be deemed worthy of protection). Against Barry Commoner's four laws of ecology, Foster offers the four counter-ecological laws of capital:(1) the only lasting connection between things is the cash nexus; (2) it doesn't matter where something goes as long as it doesn't enter the circuit of capital; (3) the self-regulating market knows best; and (4) nature's bounty is a free gift to the property owner.Understanding these four counter-ecological laws demonstrates a second way that that iek's backhanded praise for the market's adaptability is importantly misplaced: the logic of the market violently draws the material for capital from nature but on a structural level cannot respect nature except insofar as nature can be commodified. We can see now why a method of \"environmental accounting\" like the one Lord Stern suggests, which takes nature \"into the balance sheet\" and \"prices\" resources \"properly,\" would be unlikely to solve the problem of environmental degradation. This is a judgment Foster shares and argues in a number of places, most effectively in an essay on \"ecological reductionism\" reprinted in his 2002 anthology Ecology Against Capitalism. Though the logic of environmental accounting suggests the incorporation of \"externalities\" such as pollution and environmental degradation might be brought into the actual costs of commodities, such a process would in actuality have precisely the opposite of the desired effect by bringing nature fully and finally into the logic of capitalism, into \"the cash nexus.\" The protections promised by such a scheme can quickly be seen as illusionary. Foster chooses to expose this logic through the example of redwood forests in the Pacific Northwest, which has long managed its forests through a lens that views forests as factories whose production must be optimized, and which views aged trees and biologically diverse forests as \"unproductive assets\" to be made maximally efficient through their immediate destruction and replacement with an arboreal monoculture that is easier to harvest and sell. That the original, untouched forests might have a value other than cash value is anathema to the four counter-ecological laws, especially the first and the fourth; the \"nature\" protected under the logic of capital would always be nature-for-capital, not nature-in-itself. When nature is capital and capital is nature, then, there would at last be nothing outside capitalism at all. We can trust the market even less than iek thinks: it is, in fact, completely incapable of even ascertaining the actual gravity of the environmental crisis, much less of recognizing its causes or beginning to offer some solution. There will never and could never be a \"market solution\" to a crisis caused by the market itself. Thursday, May 29, 2008 monkeypocalypse Digg this Add to del.icio.us Stumble It!

Specialists in a variety of fields forecast immanent catastrophe, stemming from a combination of climate change, fossil-fuel depletion, and consumer waste. The recent bestowal of the Nobel Peace Prize on a group of scientists studying climate change indicates the degree to which \"peace\" has come to signify ecological balance; even the declaration by the Vatican of a new set of \"7 Deadly Sins for the modern age\" includes pollution in an attempt to grapple with the potential of individuals to inflict ecological damage on a global scale. In the name of an impending crisis felt to be collectively shared, new political, cultural, and intellectual alignments are being forged, just as seismic shifts in the flow of global capital once again threaten to \"redistribute\" the world's resources and people. Ecological crisis has become a 24/7 media event, canvassing the planet in the imagery and rhetoric of disaster. From the halls of research and policy to activist documentary and apocalyptic fantasy, at the news desk, podium, pulpit, classroom, and computer monitor alike, all channels are united by a single underlying conviction: the present ecological catastrophe has humanity as its cause. Precisely because the answer seems so obvious, we want to know: why now? Where are the points of antagonism in the midst of such apparent consensus, and what is at stake in their difference? The Polygraph Editorial Collective invites papers concerning any aspect of ecology's relationship to ideology, both interrogating ecology as a location for critique of global capitalism and analyzing the ways in which ecology functions as an ideology in its own right.

Technorati Sorry for the intense lag time -- like Gerry said we should be back on regular schedule shortly (ha!). part one can be found here Like the rest of the world, science fiction went through some major changes leading up to and following '68. I'm talking about what is now known as 'New Wave SF,' a loosely defined subgenre of science fiction which had the British magazine New Worlds as its flagship journal, under the editorship of Michael Moorcock from '64 to '71 (and again, though with less concentrated success, from '76 to '96). The 'experimental' work that came out of this period can perhaps best be defined by its deconstruction of the idea of outer space. This was carried out by a concerted attack on the older sf's representation of science and technology (its 'mode of production' so to speak), which tended either to the Gernsbackian -- technoscience as source of readerly edification enabling and regulating the pure entertainment of the hackneyed romance plots -- or the Campbellian, where science served as a medium for cosmic speculation. After Moorcock, Dick, Ballard, Pynchon, Ellison, LeGuin, Delany, Russ, Disch, Aldliss, and others, science fiction underwent a twin revolution of both form and content: it could violate all semblance of verisimilitude (always a contentious issue for the genre) and approach the terrain of pure fantasy, it could appropriate the stylistic techniques of literary modernism, and it could openly address 'social issues': radical politics, the war, feminism, sex, drugs, 'culture,' etc. People who were neither white nor male could write it. In short, it could find acceptance as 'serious literature.' Fascinatingly, in the midst of worldwide opposition to imperialism, Man finally realized the oldest science fiction fantasy of all time by landing on the Moon. (A more complete narrative of the New Wave's rise and fall can be found here.) In an amusing historical convergence, there are at least two points where the post-'68 tradition of French philosophy intersected with Anglo-American New Wave sf. The first is Jean Baudrillard's treatment of J.G. Ballard in Simulacra and Simulation. The other is Samuel Delany's 1976 novel Triton, which also quotes liberally from renegade figures in the analytic and ordinary language schools, Quine, Spencer Brown, and Wittgenstein. It's a brief mention, probably too much made of, of Michel Foucault's cryptic remarks on 'heterotopia' (themselves probably too much made of). Heterotopia refers to the places with the power of \"juxtaposing in a single real place several spaces, several sites that are in themselves incompatible,\" space here indicating an order or governing logic, of which there are always many. A heterotopia is a place where deviance flourishes in the midst of an external norm, potentially working to counter that norm. The examples he gives -- brothel, cemetary, ship -- are not archetypes, but singular instances. The existence of any particular heterotopia suggests a heterotopian analytic, a critical praxis: \"As a sort of simultaneously mythic and real contestation of the space in which we live, this description could be called heterotopology.\" This is what ultimately differentiates heterotopia from utopia. Utopia is a projection. If it isn't pure fantasy it has to be speculative, why it lends itself so well to 'speculative fiction,' the mainstream's pseudo-respectable title for sf. What I tried to argue last time was that speculation advances the will to a single, coherent universe, beginning from a given situation. Possibilities are considered to the extent that they are probable, and pursued to the extent that they are desirable. Within the realm of speculation we are talking about the relations between past, future, and an incomplete present. Heterotopia has nothing to do with such things. Heterotopology recognizes heterotopias as sites that can be noticed, built, or brought forth from what already exists. They do not not judge, compile, or evaluate existing possibilities, but prepare new ones. Triton takes place across multiple worlds, amongst the moon-based libertarian-socialist societies against a post-apocalyptic Earth and the capitalist dystopia of Mars. On the moon Triton, there is a representative government that allows a high degree of individual freedom. During elections, everyone wins (each governing those who voted for them). Work is optional. People live in communes according to their preference of gender and sexual orientation. 'Preference' is the key term here; the society is organized around satisfying individual needs and desires, which tends to select out antisocial needs and desires (the enforcers, \"e-girls,\" take care of the violently antisocial). Through advanced genetic and neurosurgery, even one's preferences can be tweaked. But the twist: there are \"unlicensed sectors\" in every city, where no laws apply. Ironically, violent criminals stay away, since the enforcers are also permitted in the unlicensed sectors, where they have carte blanche. Otherwise the \"u-ls\" serve as the exception to the regime of preference, though for this very reason some prefer to live there. There, where 'anything can happen:' religious cults, deviant sex acts, heavy drug use, non-consensual hallucinations, and general unhealthiness. And yet for Bron, the protagonist, this is not a paradise. He's from Mars, where sex (along with all other relationships) is mediated by credit, which has made him into an immature misogynist with no self-awareness. His innocent bumpkin act fails again and again with the independent, annoyingly self-actualized people of Triton. This basic antagonism inserted between foreground and background grants the novel freedom from its own ideals (and their shortcomings); without it Triton would risk appearing simply as a fantasy, or at least an improvement, but not a problem. The frisson of multiple active fantasies serves as the terrain through which the story navigates while Bron's antipathetic perspective serves as its vehicle. The novel thus includes its own interpretative topoi, positions from which various interpretations, criticisms, and distortions can be tested. In a revealing interview, Delany argues that there is an antinomy of sorts between an interpretation that takes the 'bad things' in a given situation to be justified or not by 'good things' (or more precisely, The Good Thing), and one that doesn't. My take on Star-Maker was in terms of option A. Most science fiction authors assumed option B, taking a moment or image from the novel and blowing it up into a novel of its own, or breaking down its formal rules of invention and closure and reconfiguring them to create new aliens, new worlds, etc. Option B leads us out of assumed conventions into something like a logic of genre, opening up a field for 'heterotopology' as well as a certain way of thinking about modal logic (see the philosopher David Lewis for the most extreme form this can take, a logical defense of many-worlds theory), where many possibilities are always criss-crossing one another, denying the possibility of closure. B's critique of option A, the utopian/dystopian mode of interpretation (and it should be clear by now that I'm not only talking about reading literature), is that it begins from a position that doesn't exist, that of completion, to judge what does exist, which is always incomplete. Before going on I want to mention that Fredric Jameson, whose recent work we keep coming back to on the question of science fiction and utopia, is not a utopian, option A-style reader in the sense I've been sketching out. He is not interested in figuring out which utopias are 'correct,' or in compiling the elements necessary to any fully realized ideal socialism. Jameson's utopian hermeneutic can be best understood as roughly analogous to heterotopology but with one major difference: it treats utopian projections as themselves critical sites or 'free zones,' but while reading them in the service of a deferred judgment. As with Marx, a formally messianic temporality (open not to the grace of God but to collective social desire and action -- provided my readers can still see the difference), gives Jameson's writing its urgency while in his case permitting criticism of the present to take place within and/or from the realm of literature and culture. The utopian critic writes for a reader in need of a location, something it is argued present reality and its discourses of power are able only to provoke without ever truly satisfying. In something of a minor masterpiece of deceitful self-aggrandizement reversing itself into self-refutation, Bron inadvertently demonstrates the circuity of legal ontology: \"'The fantasy/reality confusion...it's just marvelous in her work. I mean, there, it's practically like what we do, the fantasy working as a sort of metalogic, with which she can solve real, aesthetic problems in the most incredible ways -- I was actually in a few of her productions last year, a sort of ersatz member of the company. But finally I just had to get out. Because when that fantasy seeps into the reality, she just becomes an incredibly ugly person. She feels she can distort anything that occurs for whatever purpose she wants. Whatever she feels, that's what is, as far as she's concerned. But then, I suppose...' Bron laughed at the ground, then looked up: they'd just left the Plaza -- 'that's the right we just fought a war to defend. But Audri, when someone abuses that right, it can make it pretty awful for the rest of us.'\" (Triton) 'She' is the Spike, his ex-girlfriend, a performance artist who earlier on dumps him after realizing that he is, in our Earth terms, a typical heterosexual male. Throughout the novel, Bron encounters the liberated desires of others first with fascination, then with a desire to contain them in a hierarchy, to organize them in terms of classical, ordinal logic rather than modal (Delany's 'metalogics'). Bron's anxieties are triggered when fantasy moves from possibility to actuality. Once those fantasies move beyond logic into aesthetic expression, they become more fascinating, but more alienating to him once their motivating desires are more concretely actualized, when he can no longer pretend they exist for his pleasure. For Bron, \"Whatever she feels, that's what is\" is the ultimate affront. In the language of rights, he expresses his desire to meet the other on terms of abstract equality only, which in his mind includes the right not to have his deficiencies pointed out. Elsewhere he cries out for legal recognition of his own repression: \"What happens to those of us who have problems and don't know why we have the problems we do?\" Here the political logic of the archetypal capitalist state is folded into traditional ontology: both are exposed as attempts to define (and therefore justify) one's lack. Against the algebraic openness of the right to x, Bron yearns for the negative freedom promised by rights in defense of the other. The right not to know, not to struggle, not to think, not to feel, not to love, finally not to be bothered. Aesthetics and imaginative storytelling appear in Triton not only as counterfactuals, methods for 'solving problems' (as Bron would have it), but as restaging the situation that produced the abstract problem in the sensory 'language' of art. Triton claims 'heterotopology' for art -- and especially imaginative, extra-mimetic, theatrical art -- over critique, precisely by having most of the novel progress through a series of philosophical dialogues which float Platonic speculation over a stage teeming with Aristophanic grotesquerie. New Wave sf characteristically refuses the realist conventions accepted by earlier writing either for reasons of professional necessity or a simple lack of interest in form. In doing so it opened up the present for the same kind of speculation traditional science fiction reserved for the future, as well as the sort of quasi-future one finds in Triton and the earlier Dhalgren, more interested in merging aesthetic with social experimentation than technical details or high adventure. Doing so brought it dangerously close to sf's major antagonists, self-consciously 'literary' fiction and fantasy, and further away from the future as a space for either rational speculation or irrational hope. The idea of the future was imaginatively employed (or not) as just another space for experimentation, along with genre, gender, race, and politics, to exploit the possibilities immanent in human relationships now. Its constitutive wager was to deliberately treat imaginative writing as a material practice with which to examine (and intervene in) the present. Like its distant counterparts in film, this 'New Wave' would be aestheticized into oblivion, but one can't say it never had its moment. The negative theology of Star-Maker can now be read as the last gasp of traditional utopianism projected in advance, accomplished by meticulously running out all the genre's possible outcomes and representing them, from the POV of cosmic time, as just so many returns of the same. The Star Maker then exists to satisfy a lack that should not be, the irrational hope it spurs in the narrator experienced as a reassuring, even invigorating feeling of emptiness, overlaid with anticipation. \"One antagonist appeared as the will to dare for the sake of the new, the longed for, the reasonable and joyful, world, in which every man and woman may have scope to live fully, and live in service of mankind. The other seemed essentially the myopic fear of the unknown; or was it more sinister? Was the cunning will for private mastery, which fomented for its own ends the archaic, reason-hating, and vindictive passion of the tribe. It seemed that in the coming storm all the dearest things must be destroyed. All private happiness, all loving, all creative work in art, science, and philosophy, all intellectual scrutiny and speculative imagination, and all creative social building; all, indeed, that man should normally live for, seemed folly and mockery and mere self-indulgence in the presence of public calamity. But if we failed to preserve them, when would they live again?\"This is the nihilism from which Nietzsche extracted the promise of the overman, framing the future in terms of a binary choice: fear or praise. Of what? What could there be after we've seen the pitiless destruction of every hope, by a being totally indifferent to suffering? 'After' is inconceivable: we're confronted with inevitable dispossession, of something much more abstract than material objects or territories -- the future's promise. We're asked to believe that even this constant anticipation of dispossession can be revalued, through \"yes-saying\" (in Nietzsche's words), to become the 'preservation' of a daring without purpose or meaning beyond itself. Combine these two impulses -- aestheticization of the present as its critique + affirmation of our doomed future as its preservation -- and you get cyberpunk, the sci-fi appropriate to Reaganism, the simulacra, and the golden age of finance capital. Next, maybe something on cyberpunk and Afrofuturism. Maybe. Monday, May 5, 2008 where have all the culturemonkeys gone? Digg this Add to del.icio.us Stumble It!

Ray (M.A.; Ph.D.) -- former High School and University teacher. Read THIS before you spend money on education. Thursday, August 14, 2008 Exams for British High School diplomas 'now two grades easier than 20 years ago' A-level exams are now two grades easier than they were 20 years ago, academics claimed last night. Sixth-formers of the same ability awarded C grades in the late 1980s can now expect to gain As, they said. Researchers found that average results improved by more than two grades in most subjects, even though students were no brighter. In mathematics, scores jumped by three-and-a-half grades. Academics said the trend was likely to be influenced by a number of factors, including a fall in the rigour of exams combined with an increased focus on test preparation in schools and colleges, reigniting the debate over A-level standards. The findings - in a study by Durham University - come as almost 250,000 students prepare to receive results of A-levels on Thursday. Experts are already predicting a rise in the number of passes and A grades. Last year, 25.3 per cent of papers were awarded the top mark - more than double the number in 1990. Ministers have long claimed that the rise is down to improved teaching. But the latest study - published yesterday(MON) as part of a wide-ranging review of A-levels by the Institute of Directors - said it was \"hard to see how the claim could be convincingly substantiated\". The claims fail to explain why results improve quicker some years than others, or why improvements at A-level have been much quicker than GCSEs. \"A-level and GCSE grades achieved in 2007 certainly do correspond to a lower level of general academic ability than the same grades would have done in previous years,\" said the report. \"Whether or not they are better taught makes no difference to this interpretation; the same grade corresponds to a lower level of general ability.\" Robert Coe and Peter Tymms, from Durham's Curriculum, Evaluation and Management Centre, analysed standards achieved in A-levels between 1988 and 2007. They then compared them with the outcome of aptitude tests over the last two decades, which measure pupils' skills in a range of subjects without testing curriculum knowledge. They found that students with similar results in the independently-administered exam went on to score much better A-levels in 2007 than in 1988. In the study group, the average student was awarded an E in biology in 1988, but similar sixth-formers gained a comfortable C last summer. In French, students of the same ability saw results rise from a low D grade to a B. In maths, marks were inflated by 3.5 grades. Average students in the 1988 sample gained a U (ungraded) but saw results rise to a low B by 2007. Academics said rises in GCSE results were more modest, increasing by less than a grade in science, English, history, French and maths between 1996 and last summer. \"The quality of work presented for examination may well be equal to or better than that of candidates in previous years,\" said the study. \"However, given identical conditions, today's candidates might nevertheless be unable to match the performance of their predecessors.\" The IoD report also warned that university admissions tutors have seen no rise in the quality of new undergraduates, despite steadily improving A-level results in the past decade. Seven in 10 tutors believe standards either stayed the same or deteriorated in recent years. The conclusions come as Ofqual, England's new exams regulator, said it would launch a major review of standards in the Autumn. The study will cover setting, marking and long term standards in A-levels, GCSEs, Sats and other school examinations. Nick Gibb, Tory shadow schools minister, said A-levels lacked \"rigour and relevance\". \"The Government has been undermining A-levels for the last few years,\" he said. \"We are determined to restore public confidence in the A-level as the gold standard of British education.\" A spokesman for the Department for Children, Schools and Families said syllabuses and examinations were \"appropriate and reliable\". \"We've commented on Durham University's research time and time again,\" she said. \"Their work is quite different to GCSE or A-level as it uses aptitude tests which are not directly comparable to performance at GCSE and A level.\" Source Tell-all report cards to rate Australian schools Surprising sense from a Leftist The Rudd Government is on a collision course with Morris Iemma and teachers' unions who say its push for transparent report cards that identify test results, class sizes, teacher qualifications and even the wealth of students' families will lead to unfair school league tables. The federal Minister for Education, Julia Gillard - having met the chancellor of schools in New York, Joel Klein - says Australia can learn from his methodology of \"comparing like schools with like schools to measure differences in school results\". A former lawyer criticised for his lack of education credentials, Mr Klein has stirred the ire of New York teachers with his focus on standardised testing and links between student results and teacher performance. Ms Gillard has distanced herself from criticism from the NSW Government and teaching unions who warn her approach will name and shame disadvantaged schools. Rather, Ms Gillard said yesterday, teaching excellence should be identified and rewarded and high standards expected of all students, rich or poor. \"We're not talking about anything as simplistic and silly as league tables,\" she said at the Australian Council for Educational Research annual conference. \"But we are talking about parents and the community understanding what kinds of students are in schools, their socio-economic status, the number of indigenous students, the number of students with disabilities, because that obviously means the schools have special needs.\" Researchers have linked low performance at school to social disadvantage, with less able richer children overtaking more able poorer children by the age of six. Apart from investing in early learning and rewarding quality teaching, Ms Gillard said a spotlight was needed on schools needing extra help. \"The aim should be to robustly ascertain what mix of capacities and needs children are bringing to their school,\" she said. \"We need this information in order to understand what schools, in turn, should offer to these students, and how governments and communities working together can support schools to do so. \"As a nation, we should then be tracking attainment, knowing that we are in the powerful position of comparing like schools with like schools. If two schools have comparable school populations but widely varying results, we would be able to ask the question why and ascertain the answer. \"We should be able to identify best practice and innovation, and work systematically to ensure that they are spread more widely. We should be able to especially assist those schools that need it. Specifically we should be identifying excellent teaching and excellent school leadership. We must expect high standards of every child.\" However, a spokesman for the acting NSW Minister for Education, John Hatzistergos, said enough information was already available to help identify struggling students in need of help. \"There is considerable concern with proposals to excessively 'tag' students and schools with various labels for little purpose,\" he said. \"NSW is responsible for the welfare and education of its students and is committed to the constructive application of the outcomes of assessment in all its forms.\" The Premier, Morris Iemma, said it would be difficult to rank schools around Australia. \"It's like hospitals; it's the rules around that [ranking], because if you're going to stand in a hospital - and it's a similar example with schools - like Westmead and compare it, for example, with a small district hospital, like Canterbury, and then attempt in some way from the straight statistics that appear on that list to rank those two hospitals, you would not be comparing like with like.\" The president of the Australian Education Union, Angelo Gavrielatos, said the learning priorities of students would not be addressed by a \"divisive sideshow on league tables\". \"Raising overall student performance and addressing underachievement requires investment,\" he said. \"Teachers know it and parents know it. \"Public schools nationwide require an immediate $1.4 billion per annum to raise retention rates to 90 per cent and a further $1.3 billion per annum to ensure that all primary school-age children reach the minimum benchmark scores for literacy and numeracy.\" The principal of SCEGGS Darlinghurst, Jenny Allum, said students in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 had completed the first round of national literacy and numeracy tests in May, but no results had yet been made available to help schools diagnose any learning difficulties in students. The federal Opposition's education spokesman, Tony Smith, said: \"Already Julia Gillard has failed the first test in refusing to release the individual results of the national literacy and numeracy tests until the end of this year. The whole reason the Coalition government introduced these tests was to provide parents and schools with information in a timely fashion so parents could get help straightaway.\" Source # posted by jonjayray @ 12:19 AM 0 comments links to this post Wednesday, August 13, 2008 Better Grades Through Bling-Bling With alarming failure rates at our nation's inner city schools, one wants to celebrate any attempt to motivate success. Still, sincere efforts must be examined not according to their intentions but to their likely or demonstrated results. One new concept that is gaining attention gives kids immediate cash or gifts for completing normal academic tasks, such as homework. While such programs are well intentioned, hustling minority kids with \"bling-bling\" is sure to cultivate materialism and deteriorate family relationships. Harvard economist Roland Fryer developed the Sparks Incentive program in an effort to raise achievement scores for America's black children. In the pay-to-learn scheme, children are redirected from finding intrinsic meaning in their work, and are instead seduced to pursue the vanity of money. The power of learning the value of delayed gratification, one of the most important principles of long-term success in anything, is totally incapacitated. Last year, the New York City schools, desperate for solutions, hired Fryer as its Chief Equality Officer. His job was to figure out how to narrow the racial gap in achievement in the city's schools. Today, over 5,000 students in the New York City public school system are participating in this privately funded program. In one Brooklyn elementary school, students can earn up to $250 a year. School districts in at least twelve states have similar incentive programs, including the cities of Atlanta, Dallas, and Baltimore. One misguided school even offers free cell phones as an incentive. Fryer defends this rueful practice saying, \"[with] cell phones, [as] financial rewards for kids, we're meeting kids where they are and giving them rewards to do the things that we want them to do.\" What's next? Free sagging pants? Coupons for weaves, rims, designer jeans, gold chains, and gold-teeth grills? This type of disregard for the practical effects produced by striving for good ends via dubious means reduces the humanity of entire families. Black kids are more than simply a variable in a complex economic algorithm applied to education philosophy. Black kids are human beings with inherent dignity who must be formed into virtuous adults destined to make a positive contribution to the world within the context of family and community. Clinical psychologist Dr. Madeline Levine, author of The Price of Privilege, reports that research shows that giving kids cash for grades is one of the most psychologically damaging approaches to education. Manipulating behavior in this way profoundly sabotages the internal mechanisms needed to form the character and integrity required for adulthood. Hustling performance with cash can never substitute, Levine argues, \"for parental interest, presence, and guidance.\" It leads to a lessening of parental influence and cultivates greed. One would think that America's public school system would not wish to cultivate \"bling, bling\" ideology. Children have a nascent ability to desire and appreciate parental approval. Once upon a time, children were challenged to perform well--or else parents would be involved. Children knowing, early on, that they are accountable to their parents--and that other adults cooperate in that accountability--creates conditions for healthy family life in general. The late Professor Randy Pausch of Carnegie Mellon University railed against the deification of material goods as incentives for living well at the univeristy's commencement ceremony on May 18, 2008. Pausch encouraged graduates to pursue meaningful vocations that stirred their spirits. \"You will not find that passion in things,\" he warned, \"and you will not find that passion in money.\" When asked if giving cash for performance might send a message to children that learning is not its own reward, Fryer responded, \"Those are not my concerns. My biggest concern is [that] we don't do anything.\" Why is cultivating self-centered materialism and breaking down parent/child relationships the only alternative to doing nothing? Herein lies the problem of hiring an economist who may not have the wherewithal to connect economics to the formation of children with character and integrity. While economics teaches helpful things about the role of incentives, the dignity of children and the integrity of family life cannot be subverted for algorithmic results. Ignoring the character process will give us a generation of children who can perform on exams but have little humanity. Source When Will School Choice Come to the 'Land of the Free'? Note: Australia has for many years had a system where the Federal government pays a substantial share of the costs of private schools, thus greatly reducing the burden on parents who seek private education for their children. As a result, around 40% of high school students in Australia are privately educated While presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama was on his world tour, the world came to Newark, New Jersey and demonstrated how parental choice has become an engine of education reform around the globe. For the first time in its 30-year existence, the International Standing Conference for the History of Education held its annual conference in the United States--in Newark, July 23-26, with the city and Rutgers University as co-sponsors. It did not go without notice among the conferees that the school choice available through broad consensus in many nations still confronts stiff education-establishment resistance in the United States. Newark may have landed the conference partly because its mayor, Cory Booker (D), is a strong advocate of empowering families in this way. \"America, the land of freedom and choice, except when it comes to your schools,\" The Star-Ledger of New Jersey quoted Prof. Sjaak Braster of Utrecht University in the Netherlands as quipping. In Holland, one of the featured nations in a discussion of access and excellence, it has been a right of parents for almost 100 years to send their children to schools they choose, using a government grant. Two-thirds now choose private or religious schools. If schools fail, they can be de-funded. While the conference was underway, the Associated Press distributed a dispatch, run by many U.S. papers, telling how Sweden had defied its own welfarist ways and allowed parents to choose between state-run and independent schools. The independents are government-funded but may make their own decisions on staffing, teaching methods, and buildings. They may not charge tuition. Before the advent of choice in 1992, only 1.7 percent of Sweden's high school students attended private schools. Now, 17 percent do. In another deviation from democratic socialism, Sweden allows managers of independent schools to turn a profit if they can deliver quality cost-effectively. Sweden is not the most out-of-character fan of school choice. In 2003 the People's Republic of China gave private schools equal standing with government schools and began assisting them with tax credits and loans in an attempt to boost their growth. As China Daily explained at the time: \"Although local governments have put a lot of cash into education, government-run schools can't meet the needs of the public due to the large population of China.\" Choice is a force in many other lands. In Canada, the degree of school choice varies considerably among the provinces. Alberta, which has the most education freedom, also has the highest level of academic achievement, while spending the least per-pupil. So what about using the bully pulpit of the U.S. presidency to help bring more parental choice to American K-12 schools? Will that be a high-profile issue this fall? Until recently, education has not received much attention from the two major-party candidates. But that may have changed as of the mid-July NAACP convention in Cincinnati. Speaking there July 16, the presumptive Republican nominee, Sen. John McCain, made choice a central focus of his education program, endorsing the Washington, DC school voucher program for low-income families, an alternative to monopolistic teacher certification, new approaches to charter school funding that would empower principals, and creation of new charter schools offering online instruction. Sen. Obama, the expected Democratic nominee, put the onus on parents in his July 14 NAACP talk, stressing the need for them to provide their children more guidance. He criticized McCain for supporting vouchers. While endorsing public charter schools, Obama has taken a harder line against vouchers since first telling the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board in February that he might favor them if research proved they helped students succeed. Ultimately, it will be up to the voters to decide whether the U.S. has something to learn from the international community about choice in school reform--and, if so, which candidate is for true reform. Source Australian education unions oppose choice Like the little Stalinists they are The Australian Education Union has reacted angrily to plans to move towards a voucher-like scheme, which would give students the power to choose between private training providers and public ones such as TAFEs. AEU federal president Angelo Gavrielatos warned yesterday the union would launch a community campaign to head off any such changes, accusing federal Labor of continuing the \"failed policies\" of its Coalition predecessor. \"Vouchers represent an attempt to commodify education and an abrogation on the part ofgovernment for ensuring planned provision of education,\" he said. The Weekend Australian revealed on Saturday that the Rudd Government could use its reform of federalism to encourage its state Labor counterparts to introduce competition into vocational education. Victoria has already released plans to make public and private training bodies bid for students, prompting the AEU to declare the shift \"the biggest threat to TAFE\" in the state's history. Education Minister Julia Gillard said yesterday the Government was in intensive discussions with the states and territories on the best ways to deliver vocational education and training. But she said training providers should not be the ones to decide what should be available. \"Rather, the structure and funding of VET has to give students and industry the power to get providers to respond to their needs,\" Ms Gillard said. She said future reforms would, however, not be modelled on the previous government's voucher system, since cut by Labor, which offered young Australians up to $3000 for vocational training. \"There are a number of ways of achieving this reform, but an ill-thought-through, badly implemented voucher program like the Howard government's Work Skills vouchers isn't one of them,\" Ms Gillard said. Martin Riordon, chief executive officer of TAFE Directors Australia, which represents TAFE and technology institutes, said vouchers were one of the financing options being discussed by governments. While he was yet to see the details of the proposal, he said it was important any reform was accompanied by a funding boost. \"The last voucher system was trialled but it really was both poorly targeted and inadequately funded,\" Mr Riordon said. \"We are just keen to see that, in the next commonwealth and state agreement that comes in force in July next year, whatever funding agreement is ultimately agreed that there's a lift in training funding.\" Ms Gillard is also negotiating with the states and territories on school funding and yesterday told ABC's Insiders program she was \"very assertively\" challenging them to open up their schools to public scrutiny. In a speech to the Australian Council for Educational Research conference in Brisbane today, she will call for school-by-school data on student populations, their socio-economic mix and development status to be made available nationally. \"If two schools have comparable school populations but widely varying results, we would then be able to ask the question why and ascertain the answer,\" Ms Gillard said.

Kyle reached his limit about the time his pillow was taken away. Unable to sleep during nap time, and made to step into the hallway until he could stop crying, the cranky 4-year-old lashed out in a classroom at The Family Development Center at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. \"I am going to go shoot all my friends!\" he said, according to a written account that the day care center provided the boy's parents after the July 22 tantrum. What came next - after a day care worker talked to Kyle about appropriate language, eliciting an apology - was an investigation that sent university police to question Kyle's parents and ended with the boy's dismissal from the day care center he had attended for the past three years. Even if I had not given away the plot of this tragic farce in the first paragraph, you would have already guessed where this was going before they got to the University Police investigation part. This is the result of political correctness run amok. Officers questioned Kyle's parents, asking if they had any guns. His mother said they don't. She said she doesn't allow her son to watch TV or play with toy guns. The investigation ended with Kyle dismissal from the day care center he had attended for the past three years. His mother believes the whole thing was handled unreasonably. The fact that this situation was handled unreasonably is beyond dispute. The article mentions that Kyle has had numerous reports filed about his behavior over the last three years that he attended the day care center, most for behavioral issues such as not staying still during nap time and running instead of walking - flogging offenses I'm sure. Perhaps the authorities were fooled by young Kyle's size or the timbre of his voice, but they seem to have forgotten one tiny detail about him: HE'S FOUR YEARS OLD! I have an 8-year-old son, and even with daily admonishments, he still runs around when he shouldn't (in the store, in the house, in the barn - one shouldn't run around horses). I believe it's perfectly normal for a four year old to run instead of walk sometimes. This is the single stupidest story I have seen in memory. The road we are heading down, where children are expected to act like little adults, is one we will regret when we have a generation that is completely off their rockers simply because they were never allowed to really BE children. Also, with all the debate about our children becoming more and more obese and getting less and less exercise, one would think that a child running around would be looked upon favorably. Chalk up yet another cognitive disconnect for the adherents of political correctness, eh? What I fear even worse is that someone will soon approach Kyle's mom, who works in a mental health clinic, and explain to her that poor little Kyle can't concentrate and is fidgety and needs medication. Children are not being allowed to be children anymore, to the detriment of everyone save overburdened day care workers, and it's a sad sign of our times when that happens. Add in the fact of many schools banning tag and dodge ball and even running at recess, and what we have here is a movement so insane it defies definition. When I was a kid, we rode our bikes without helmets and our skateboards without kneepads, and climbed trees and fell out of them in our neighbor's yard. Nothing was said other than \"Oh, are you OK?\" We got angry with each other and made silly threats (\"I'm gonna hit you so hard your grandkids are gonna cry\"), and had fights, many times where one of us or - more usually - both of us ended up with bloody noses, scrapes, and bruises. But the next day, sometimes in the next ten minutes, we were back to being friends. Nobody got sued, nobody went to jail, and we grew up into perfectly fine adults capable of taking care of ourselves and treating our fellow humans in a decent manner. We are creating a generation of fearful drones who, once they are thrust into real life after they graduate from school, will be unable to handle reality, think for themselves, and speak freely, as they will never have been taught how to do so. They are simply being taught what not to say, how not to act, and what not to think. And I, for one, think that stinks. Source Swedish Left indoctrinating schoolkids Two new publishing houses for children's books have sparked debate in gender-equal Sweden over their professed aim of instilling the country's open-minded social values in the next generation. \"Our goal is for all people, regardless of gender, sexuality, ethnicity or other such things, to have the freedom to create their own identity and be respected for their personal qualities,\" said Karin Salmson, the co-founder of the new Vilda publishing house. But several critics are outraged, saying they are simply pushing propaganda disguised as literature. Vilda and another small publisher, Olika, both opened their doors last year with the express aim of making children's books that promote liberal values and challenge traditional views on gender, race and sexual orientation. \"Many parents feel forced to change he to she or she to he and other details as they read stories for their children, because so many details in children's books are so very traditional,\" Salmson said. Vilda has therefore introduced a so-called \"hug label\", guaranteeing that its books have been \"scrutinised from a democracy, equality and diversity perspective\" and contain no details \"based on prejudice or traditional gender roles that rein in individual freedom\". The publisher for instance makes sure girls are not always dressed in pink and boys in blue, that dad is not necessarily the one rushing off to work while mom stays home whipping up dinner and that same-sex parents are portrayed as a natural part of life. Olika's co-founder Marie Tomicic also says her publishing house aims to \"break down traditional gender roles and offer children broader role models, allowing them to be all they can be.\" Together the two small publishers have so far only released about a dozen titles, including a book about a boy who wears pink sandals, and a story about a girl who likes to make farting sounds using her armpits, who just happens to have two dads. The publishers' philosophies are largely in line with ruling attitudes in this Scandinavian country, which is widely considered a world leader in gender equality and minority rights. But critics have challenged their methods. \"For both Vilda and Olika, their values are the top priority ... and I think that is simply the wrong approach when you want to make good children's books,\" says Lotta Olsson, a literary critic at Sweden's paper of reference Dagens Nyheter. If the whole aim of a story is to promote an idea and alter children's behaviour and attitudes, the artistic and literary side of the book tends to suffer she insists. \"You cannot write a book simply because you want it to be gender equal. You can however write a good book that is gender equal, but as soon as you can see the thought behind the book, I think the artistic side has failed,\" she tells AFP. Both Tomicic and Salmson, however, dismiss the criticism as \"cultural elitism,\" pointing out that they have received an overwhelmingly positive response from parents. \"It is perfectly possible to make good literature that takes these issues into consideration,\" Tomicic says, pointing out that \"we have good authors and illustrators and we insist there is a good story. That is absolutely the most important thing.\" One of Olika's illustrators, Per Gustavsson, has publicly criticised the publisher's request to change the colour of a girl's T-shirt from its original pink in one book, while questions have been raised about the interest of portraying homosexual parents in another book when the fact is not important to the story line. \"We are trying to break a pattern,\" Tomicic responds, insisting that it is important to show children that there are many natural alternatives to traditional ways of describing gender roles, including the colours girls and boys wear, and family structures. Salmson agrees. \"Portraying a gay family in a story that is not simply about gay families shows that these families exist too and are just as normal as other types of families.\" \"I really can't see how that can affect the quality of the story itself,\" she says, adding however that \"I guess there are people who really feel very threatened when you try to open up perceptions on sexuality and gender identity.\" Olsson rejects that notion, maintaining that the problem with the new publishing houses is their \"prerequisite that they only take in authors with the same perspective. That affects their access to books in a way that just isn't good.\" \"I don't think it works either,\" she insists. \"Children do as we do, not as we tell them to do. If you look around and see women being treated worse than men, it makes no difference that you've read a children's book in which the mother goes to work and the father stays home with the kids.\" Source British education spending spree has 'failed pupils' The literacy and numeracy of new employees have tumbled over the past decade despite Labour's 28 billion increase in annual education spending, according to research by a leading employers' organisation. The Institute of Directors (IoD) found that 71% of its members believe the writing abilities of new employees had worsened, while 60% believed numeracy had also declined; 52% reported a worsening of the basic ability to communicate. With the exam results season under way, more than 60% of company directors now think GCSEs and A-levels are less demanding than a decade ago. Overall, only 27% believe schools have got better under Labour. A-level results to be released this Thursday are expected to show the number of passes going above 97% and the proportion of A grades rising slightly from last year's 25.3%, the 11th successive annual rise. One exam board chief said the results will show continued decline in the numbers taking languages but rises in some science subjects, reversing the trend of recent years. According to the IoD report, to be published this week, the results of Labour's education policies fall far short of what might be expected given the surge in school spending since the party came to power. In 1997-8, $96 billion was devoted to education, rising to $152.6 billion in the current year, an increase of nearly 60% when adjusted for inflation. \"Despite the impressive political energy and resources focused on education, our members believe the government has generally performed poorly in this critical area,\" said Miles Templeman, the IoD's director-general. \"There is a substantial credibility gap between what official statistics show and what employers feel on the front line.\" Exam grades improve almost every year, leading to arguments between ministers who claim they show a real improvement and critics who argue that standards are becoming more lax. The research also includes a review by Durham University academics of evidence on whether the rigour of GCSEs, A-levels and primary education has been maintained. They find that, at best, standards have remained the same or improved marginally. In basic scientific knowledge - such as knowing what density means - they report a \"dramatic\" fall, particularly for boys. The Durham academics, Robert Coe and Peter Tymms, found strong evidence of \"grade inflation\" in their analysis of GCSE and A-level results over the past three decades. They also report that the understanding of basic scientific concepts such as volume and weight among 11 and 12-year-olds has deteriorated since 1976. The proportion of boys giving the right answer to an elementary question on the displacement of water fell from 54% to 17% over the period. \"The fact schools are not teaching this is a real problem,\" Coe said. \"The scale of the drop is just huge: it is dramatic. Many people would argue that you cannot do science without these fundamentals.\" Jim Knight, the schools minister, said: \"English and maths standards have risen over the last decade and quality has been rigorously scrutinised. \"Business concerns about school-leavers reflect the reality of the changing economy with historic low unemployment and the virtual elimination of low-skill jobs. Employers rightly have far higher expectations of workers' skills than ever. \"We are tackling employers' concerns head-on with the biggest education reforms for generations such as tougher A-levels and GCSEs; improved skills training across the board; and raising the participation age to 18.\" - More teenagers are not in education, employment or training (Neet) than studying for A-levels in three of Britain's poorest boroughs, according to new research by the Conservatives. Michael Gove, the shadow schools secretary, argues that the figures for Rochdale in Greater Manchester, Sandwell in the West Midlands, and Knowsley, Merseyside, are evidence of \"shocking\" polarisation between rich and poor areas. Source # posted by jonjayray @ 12:17 AM 0 comments links to this post Monday, August 11, 2008 Homeschooling OK - even in California Reversed: Ruling that parents had no right to teach children An appeals court in California has ruled that state law does permit homeschooling \"as a species of private school education\" but that statutory permission for parents to teach their own children could be \"overridden in order to protect the safety of a child who has been declared dependent.\" The long-awaited case resolves many of the questions that had developed in homeschooling circles across the nation when the same court earlier found that parents had no such rights - statutorily or constitutionally - in California. The ruling released this morning by the 2nd Appellate District in Los Angeles said the dispute came out of juvenile court proceedings in which court-appointed lawyers for two children demanded \"an order that they be sent to private or public school, rather than educated at home by their mother.\" The dependency court did not agree, \"primarily based on its view that parents have an absolute constitutional right to homeschool their children,\" the appeals court said. The lawyers then advanced their case to the appeals level, which earlier granted the order. \"We filed our original opinion on Feb. 28, 2008, granting the petition on the bases that: (1) California statutory law does not permit homeschooling; and (2) this prohibition does not violate the U.S. Constitution,\" the opinion said. But the judges granted a request for rehearing \"in order to provide an opportunity for further argument on the multiple complex issues involved in this case, including, but not limited to: (1) additional California statutes that might bear upon the issue; and (2) potentially applicable provisions of the California Constitution.\" \"This is a great victory for homeschool freedom,\" said Micheal Farris, who is chairman of the Home School Legal Defense Association and was one of the attorneys who had argued the case. \"I have never seen such an impressive array of people and organizations coming to the defense of homeschooling.\" \"Tens of thousands of California parents teaching over 166,000 homeschooled children are now breathing easier,\" he said. The opinion said the judges were not deciding whether homeschool should be allowed. \"That job is for the Legislature,\" they said. \"Homeschooling was initially expressly permitted in California, when the compulsory education law was enacted in 1903,\" the court said. \"In 1929, however, homeschool was amended out of the law, and children who were not educated in public or private schools could be taught privately only by a credentialed tutor.\" However, since then, \"subsequent developments in the law call this conclusion into question. Although the Legislature did not amend the statutory scheme so as to expressly permit homeschooling, more recent enactments demonstrate an apparent acceptance by the Legislature of the proposition that homeschooling is taking place in California, with homeschools allowed as private schools,\" the court ruling said. \"Recent statutes indicate that the Legislature is aware that some parents in California homeschool their children by declaring their homes to be private schools. Moreover, several statutory enactments indicate a legislative approval of homeschooling, by exempting homeschools from requirements otherwise applicable to private schools.\" The court said, \"it is our view that the proper course of action is to interpret the earlier statutes in light of the later ones, and to recognize, as controlling, the Legislature's apparent acceptance of the proposition that homeschools are permissible in California when conducted as a private school.\" The opinion was authored by H. Walter Croskey, who had written the earlier opinion as well. He was joined by Joan Klein and Patti Kitching.... The court found multiple specific provisions in state law, including one that exempts \"a parent or guardian working exclusively with his or her children\" from fingerprinting requirements, that support the legitimacy of homeschooling. \"We therefore conclude that home schools may constitute private schools,\" the opinion said. In the specific case that prompted the questions, however, the court said state law permits a dependency court \"to issue any reasonable orders for the care of a dependent child, including orders limiting the right of the parents to make educational decisions for the child.\" \"Because the United States Supreme Court has held that parents possess a constitutional right to direct the education of their children, it is argued that any restriction on homeschooling is a violation of this constitutional right. We disagree. We conclude that an order requiring a dependent child to attend school outside the home in order to protect that child's safety is not an unconstitutional violation of the parents' right to direct the education of their children,\" the judges wrote. \"Parents possess a constitutional liberty interest in directing the education of their children, but the right must yield to state interests in certain circumstances,\" the court said. \"In this case, the restriction on homeschooling would arise in a proceeding in which the children have already been found dependent due to abuse and neglect of a sibling,\" the court said. \"Should a dependency court conclude, in the proper exercise of its discretion, that due to the history of abuse and neglect in the family, requiring a dependent child to have regular contact with mandated reporters is necessary to guarantee the child's safety, that order would satisfy strict scrutiny. There can be no dispute that the child's safety is a compelling governmental interest. Restricting homeschooling also appears to be narrowly tailored to achieving that goal. Without contact with mandated reporters, it may well be that the child's safety cannot be guaranteed without removing the child from the parents' custody. As such, the restriction on homeschooling would be the least restrictive means of achieving the goal of protecting the children; they would be permitted to continue to live at home with their parents, but their educators would change in order to provide them an extra layer of protection.\" The judges' earlier opinion had ruled in the case the family failed to demonstrate \"that mother has a teaching credential such that the children can be said to be receiving an education from a credentialed tutor,\" and that their involvement and supervision by Sunland Christian School's independent study programs was of no value. Nor did the family's religious beliefs matter to the court. Their \"sincerely held religious beliefs\" are \"not the quality of evidence that permits us to say that application of California's compulsory public school education law to them violates their First Amendment rights.\" \"Such sparse representations are too easily asserted by any parent who wishes to homeschool his or her child,\" the court concluded. The parents of the children talked with WND as the case developed about the situation over the education being provided to two of their eight children. The father said the family objects to public school because of the pro-homosexual, pro-bisexual, pro-transgender agenda of California's public schools, on which WND previously has reported. Just yesterday, California lawmakers decided to mandate a day of celebration and honor for Harvey Milk, the late San Francisco supervisor who was an activist for homosexuality. \"We just don't want them teaching our children,\" he told WND. \"They teach things that are totally contrary to what we believe. They put questions in our children's minds we don't feel they're ready for. \"When they are much more mature, they can deal with these issues, alternative lifestyles, and such, or whether they came from primordial slop. At the present time it's my job to teach them the correct way of thinking,\" he said. That was the court opinion, however, that was vacated by the appeals court prior to the newest ruling. And while today's decision was pending, a judge ended the juvenile court case that had established jurisdiction over the two children, opening the door for the demand for public school enrollment. The Home School Legal Defense Association said, \"the juvenile court judge terminated jurisdiction over the two young L. children in a hearing held on July 10, 2008.\" An estimated 166,000 children are being homeschooled in California, and their parents and advocates had expressed concern that the court's original ruling would leave parents who educate their children at home open to criminal truancy charges and civil charges for child neglect. A number of groups already have assembled in California under the Rescue Your Child slogan to encourage parents to withdraw their children from the state's public school system. The Discover Christian Schools website reports getting thousands of hits daily from parents and others seeking information about alternatives to California's public schools. WND reported leaders of the campaign called California Exodus say they hope to encourage parents of 600,000 children to withdraw them from the public districts. Source British universities discriminating against private school students Under big pressure from the government -- in the name of \"equality\" Top universities are at the centre of a new social engineering row over plans to reject the new A* grade at A-level, The Sunday Telegraph can reveal. An investigation by this newspaper has uncovered plans by several leading universities to ignore the new award because it will mean offering more places to independent school pupils. The A* grade was introduced by ministers because universities were finding it increasingly difficult to distinguish between top candidates in an era when 25 per cent of sixth formers gain an A grade at A-level. That proportion is expected to rise when exam results are released next week. Internal documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that admission committees at a number of Britain's universities are reluctant to sanction the new A* because they fear that state school pupils will not achieve the grade in sufficient numbers. Oxford University said it is \"highly unlikely\" that it will utilise the A* in offers until \"there is a sense of the probable grade distribution\". Exeter and Bath Universities cite concerns that if the top grade is used in offers, it is likely to \"disadvantage state schools\" and \"have a detrimental effect on widening participation efforts\". Bristol has also expressed reservations about the A* because \"some schools will be able to provide intensive preparation for their pupils and others will not\" which could \"exacerbate existing inequalities in education provision\". Critics last night accused the universities of trying to \"fix\" their admissions. \"It is quite disgraceful if universities are saying 'we are not going to use this measure because we are afraid of what it is going to show',\" said Professor Alan Smithers, the director of the centre for education and employment research at Buckingham University. \"It is a terrible situation to get in to that higher education is avoiding the best qualified candidates because of where they were educated in a bid to comply with state school benchmarks set by its paymasters. \"We will have good institutions, that should be recruiting the brightest talent, trying to fix admissions by ignoring a new grade.\" Independent schools accused universities of being \"lilly-livered\" in their approach to the A*. \"If there are reservations, they should be about potential differences between subjects and exam boards in the awarding of A*, not how different schools will perform,\" said Geoff Lucas, the secretary of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. \"This is woolly, lilly-livered thinking and not very honest. It shows the extent to which universities are cowered by Government pressure to widen participation. They should be giving credit to pupils who are best equipped to do well in the subject they are applying for.\" Pupils starting out on their courses in September will have the chance of gaining the grade when they complete their exams in 2010. It was assumed that universities would use the grade when making offers in that year. However, internal documents reveal many institutions have yet to decide and could delay using it in case it increases the dominance of independent school pupils. Admission tutors' concerns are based on research which suggests that private school pupils will do better in A* than comprehensive pupils. Almost a quarter of those at fee-paying schools are expected to gain at least one A*, compared to just nine per cent at comprehensives, according to an analysis by exam board AQA. Bath University admissions committee, which will consult with tutors on the issue in the autumn, fears that independent schools will gain too many of the top grades. \"It was noted that the A* grade was intended to be awarded only to the highest scoring percentage of students, who would largely be in attendance at independent schools,\" said minutes of a meeting earlier this year. \"There are some concerns that selection on the basis of A* might have adverse effects on widening participation.\" Extracts from the minutes of Exeter's admissions working group said: \"Other institutions are not including the A* in their offers as they feel that this is likely to disadvantage state schools.\" It added: \"The admissions group felt they required a more informed debate on the issue and have asked for an indicator from the 1994 Group of universities (of which it is a member).\" Bristol University said despite reservations, it would accept the A* but take in to account the school context in which candidates have studied. Only one university said it had made the decision to include the A* in some offers. At University College London, departments such as history, English and economics, which currently demand three grade As, will be permitted to ask for a maximum of one A* from 2010. Source The irrelevance of sociology At one large public university, more than 600 undergraduates are currently classified as sociology majors. Students pick among five concentrations, and one - criminal justice - attracts more than half of the majors. Yet of the 30 faculty members, only 3 specialize in criminology. The department is \"trying to bring the criminology majors in the fold of sociology\" but finding that many of the students interested in criminal justice aren't necessarily interested, said a professor in the department. \"They want hard core probation or forensics courses,\" not sociology, said the professor, who like many in this article asked that her institution not be identified. The professor spoke on Sunday at the American Sociological Association's annual meeting, at a briefing by a special task force.the association created to study its relationship to criminology and criminal justice. Another professor described a department of seven faculty members where they \"view it as a badge of honor to dismiss criminology\" and to deal with increasing student interest by hiring adjuncts for the courses. The tensions described by these professors were seen by task force members as typical of many campuses, where interest in criminal justice is taking off. At an increasing number of colleges, criminal justice has broken off from sociology into separate departments. But at many campuses where that has not happened, departments are facing what Steven E. Barkan, a professor at the University of Maine, called \"structural tensions\" of the sort he noted that sociologists realize have the potential to be unhealthy. Many departments have reported to the task force, of which Barkan is a member, that two-thirds of their enrollments are now in criminal justice while one-third of faculty slots are there. Elite universities appear to be less affected by the trend, but elsewhere it is increasingly visible. Between 2001 and 2006, criminal justice overtook sociology in the number of bachelor's degrees completed. Sociology increased by 14.5 percent during that period, to 31,406. Criminology increased by 35.7 percent, to 34,209. During the same period of time, sociology master's degrees declined by 15 percent while criminology degrees (of which there aren't as many) increased by 135.5 percent, and criminal justice master's degrees were up 56.5 percent. For sociology, the debates over what to do about these numbers aren't easy. Many in the discipline believe that such fields as gerontology and communications studies should be more fully integrated with sociology - and partisans of the various approaches debate whether sociology pushed them out on their own or whether professors in those areas wanted to be seen as independent from sociology. In an era of tight budgets, when enrollments are more crucial than ever to liberal arts departments, some sociologists want to be sure criminal justice stays within the discipline, while others fear its presence will dilute standards. For sociology, there are actually two discussions going on. One is about criminology - which is seen as closer to sociology's roots and has a shared research and theoretical base, but focuses on a subset of issues. The other is about criminal justice, a more practical field in many cases designed to prepare students for careers in law enforcement or the judicial system. Many sociology departments are changing their names to \"sociology and criminal justice\" or just becoming the major for students interested in criminal justice, even though there isn't as much shared intellectual vision between the fields. A survey of colleges by the ASA's task force found that 49 percent of institutions offered a sociology major only, 28 percent have separate departments of sociology and criminal justice with each offering a major, 19 percent have criminal justice and sociology majors offered by the sociology department, and the remainder offer only the criminal justice major. According to results that task force members stressed were \"very preliminary,\" many sociology chairs are reporting that they are being pressured to add criminal justice programs or to expand concentrations into full-fledged majors. The pressure, according to the chairs, comes from admissions offices, who report that criminal justice majors are hot, and will attract more applicants. Adding to the tension, the survey found, many chairs believe that their professors, especially older ones, hold their criminal justice colleagues in \"low esteem.\" If so, departments may be in for a rude awakening, according to data collected by the sociology task force. In the five years studied, the number of sociology Ph.D.'s increased by 3.1 percent, to 558. Doctorates in criminology and criminal justice, while still fewer in number, are increasing at much faster rates. The number of criminology doctorates awarded was up 19.0 percent, to 25, while criminal justice doctorates were up 88.1 percent, to 79. The increase is significant because many criminal justice programs have historically been led by sociologists, but with a critical mass of criminal justice Ph.D.'s being produced, that may change. Some sociologists at the meeting Sunday talked about concerns over a \"cop shop\" mentality in criminal justice programs. In some programs, sociologists said, retired police officers are hired to \"tell war stories,\" and the result is a loss of focus on the kinds of issues sociologists care about: the impact of poverty, race, gender and inequity on society. One sociologist said that he has been urged by his local police force to insist on the discipline's relevance in criminal justice programs. He quoted one police officer as saying: \"We don't want you to teach them to shoot. We'll teach them to shoot.\" But stressing traditional sociology knowledge may be easier said than done. Dennis W. MacDonald, chair of sociology at Saint Anselm College and chair of the task force, said that \"even our sociology majors don't like theory.\" Several said that the attraction of criminal justice is pragmatic - with either students or their parents seeing that a criminal justice degree leads to many jobs. Even as sociology professors boast about how their bachelor's students can package their degrees for a variety of careers, they acknowledge that there is a huge demand for criminal justice graduates - no packaging needed. That pragmatism upsets some sociologists, who view their field proudly within the liberal arts and sciences - not as job training. \"We've gone from a culture that values higher education for the civilizing influence it has produced. And it should civilize and temper the worst impulses of humanity,\" said one professor. \"Now we have a vocationalizing influence. Our students are not coming to be better citizens, but to be employable.\" The degree of frustration at individual colleges seems to vary widely. Several described respectful and even friendly relationships between sociology and criminal justice professors, but at the other extreme, one person described one mixed department as \"a war zone.\" Even some of those who described cordial relations, however, said that tended to change if departmental reorganizations were proposed. Beyond issues of philosophy, professors noted practical reasons some may want separate departments. One criminologist who is in a sociology department, but whose university has a separate criminal justice department, said that the criminologists in sociology have realized that their criminal justice colleagues in their own department are being paid more, and that's led them to discuss whether they want to move there. The sociology task force appeared torn on just how much to push sociology's values. Barkan said that one proposal the committee is considering would be to set up a minimum list of sociology course topics - theory, research methods, statistics, inequalities - that should be part of any criminal justice degree. One member of the audience said that would be a great idea because it would allow sociologists to point to a national standard to be sure criminal justice programs have enough intellectual heft. But another audience member said such a list of requirements might have the opposite of the intended effect. It could easily prompt more criminal justice programs to sever ties to sociology and just do their own thing, he said. An audience member who teaches criminology in a sociology program asked the task force to specifically address part of its report to non-criminology sociologists, and to stress that \"criminal justice does belong.\" MacDonald said he thought it was important that criminal justice and criminology stay connected to sociology and that \"it would be suicide\" for the discipline to be seen as kicking the field out. W. Wesley Johnson, president of the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences and director of the doctoral program in criminal justice at the University of Southern Mississippi, was not at the sociology meeting, but in a phone interview, he said he was not surprised by the discussion. Johnson said that when he started studying criminal justice, all programs were led by sociologists, and that's no longer the case. Currently, he said, there are three faculty jobs available for every new Ph.D. in criminal justice. Johnson said that he believes that sociology professors and criminal justice professors have more in common than they sometimes realize. The roots of criminal justice and criminology are all in sociology research, he said. \"We are both grounded in communities and environments.\" Another way that sociology and criminal justice are similar, he said, is that neither approach has a monopoly on academic excellence. \"This is a new degree and it is evolving, and some programs are more rigorous than others\" he said, \"but that's true of sociology as well.\" Johnson declined to endorse either joint sociology-criminal justice departments or separate programs. But he said that as long as enrollments boom in criminal justice, there will be more pressure to hire professors in the field and to be sure that the discipline's interests are addressed. \"Administrators are going to allocate resources to units that are producing the most credit hours,\" he said. \"Whoever hold the checkbook gets to call the shots.\" Source # posted by jonjayray @ 12:16 AM 1 comments links to this post Sunday, August 10, 2008 California Court OKs Homeschooling (Los Angeles, California) The teachers unions are not pleased about this ruling.A state appeals court lifted the cloud it had cast on the homeschooling of 166,000 California children and ruled Friday that parents have a right to educate their children at home even if they lack a teaching credential. After an outpouring of protest from homeschooling advocates and politicians, including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Second District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles reversed its Feb. 28 ruling that could have reclassified most homeschooled children as truants. In its earlier ruling, the court said California's compulsory education law requires parents to send their children ages 6 to 18 to a full-time public or private school or have them taught by credentialed tutors at home. After agreeing to reconsider the case in March, the same three-judge panel ruled Friday that parents - with or without teaching credentials - can comply with the law by declaring their home to be a private school. Schwarzenegger, who had pledged to get the law changed if the earlier ruling prevailed, issued a statement saying the new decision \"confirms the right every California child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children.\"In protest, a lawyer for the California Teachers Association said, \"Parents do not have an unfettered right to dictate the terms of their children's education.\" Presumably, the fight is not over. The teachers unions won't give up until every child receives indoctrination approved by the public school systems. # posted by Mike Pechar @ 8:06 AM 0 comments links to this post Britain: Correct spelling under attack Just because students can't spell `their' and `truly' doesn't mean we should accept variations that break all our useful rules So English spelling is in the dock once again. This time it's students who write \"thier\", \"ignor\" and \"arguement\" (and obviously don't know how to use a spell checker). The solution? According to Ken Smith, an academic at Bucks New University, we should now tolerate variant spellings. Students are now incapable of learning the spellings of \"their\" and \"truly\" that countless millions have mastered over the centuries. So let's change our attitudes to spelling to help this deserving minority. Two important things are left out of this argument. One is that English spelling does have a system. The silent \"e\" in \"tone\" shows that the preceding \"o\" is long; the lack of \"e\" in \"ton\" show the \"o\" is short. And so on with all the other vowels: \"Dane/Dan\", \"pin/pine\" etc. (The exception is TV commercials for Danone that pronounce the name to rhyme with \"salmon\" in breach of the silent \"e\" rule.) If we allowed odd variants like \"ignor/ignore\", this would obscure the silent \"e\" system in English. Better to teach people the real rules of English spelling, not folk myths about \"i\" before \"e\", which at best affects 11 common words. The real advantage of a sound-based system like English is indeed that anything can be read aloud - as newsreaders demonstrate with foreign names, such as Solzhenitsyn and Pervez Musharraf in the past couple of days. As the system has been around for centuries, it has stuck with various anomalies, like the 11 ways of saying only languages that don't have such problems are those with \"shallow\" spelling systems that were standardised comparatively recently, such as Finnish. English is called a \"deep\" spelling system because of rules like silent \"e\" and because it treats words as wholes. When we're reading silently, we don't read words like \"the\" and \"of\" letter by letter; we recognise them as wholes, just as we recognise a Nike swoosh or McDonald's golden arches. We go straight from the whole word to its meaning without passing through the sounds. We recognise the two hundred or so most frequent words of English as shapes - and we couldn't read silently at speed if we didn't. But reading whole words also applies to the famous oddities like \"lieutenant\" and \"yacht\": we store them as one-offs and don't work out their pronunciation letter by letter. If we made the spelling of \"they're\", \"there\" and \"their\" interchangeable, we would be ignoring all the aspects of English writing other than sounds. The three forms fit into sentences in very different ways; the difference in spelling helps us to see the structure of the sentence. Spelling makes distinctions that are impossible in speech, such as \"whole\" versus \"hole\" or \"beech\" versus \"beach\". Reducing writing to a pale shadow of speech is impoverishing the English language. There's nothing very unusual about using whole words: it's how Chinese works. Speakers of the different Chinese dialects can understand each other in writing even if they have different words for the same character. An educated Chinese speaker knows about 5,000 characters; a dictionary has 40,000. Surely we can manage a few hundred unique words in English? Memorising the spelling of the hundred most common words of English would mean that you spelt at least 45 per cent of the words correctly in any piece of typical writing, quite a useful start. The panel (above right) shows some of the words that English-speakers are most likely to get wrong, the variants that people produce and the percentage of web pages that get them wrong. Would accepting all these variants make life easier? One type of variation is between styles of spelling. Look up \"judgment\" or \"minuscule\" and the preferred spelling varies between North American and British dictionaries and from publisher to publisher. It's a matter of identity; use \"color\" and you're American, use \"colour\" and you're British. The most common type concerns the consonant doubling rules of English - \"embarrass\", \"accommodate\", \"desiccate\". \"Supersede\" and \"definitely\" are probably examples of one-offs where you have to remember the word as a unique whole. Before adopting greater tolerance to spelling, we need to take many factors into consideration, not just how letters go with sounds. And we need to take far more people into consideration than UK students. The majority of people using English in the world are not native speakers and live outside English-speaking countries. Any change will have to take their needs into account, in particular the need for a consistent spelling system with constant word forms rather than something based on native speakers' pronunciation and characteristic spelling mistakes. Source Florida school-voucher plan allowed on the ballot It's a disgrace that people have to fight to give voters a say. But the antidemocratic education groups are fighting tooth and nail to prevent that A Leon County circuit judge ruled Monday that two constitutional reforms designed to expand taxpayer-funded vouchers for private schools can go before voters statewide in November. Opponents promised to appeal. Judge John C. Cooper rejected arguments by attorneys for the Florida Education Association, school superintendents and other education groups that the Taxation and Budget Reform Commission had overstepped its authority by putting Amendments 7 and 9 on the Nov. 4 ballot. The two amendments were crafted to eliminate constitutional language cited by the 1st District Court of Appeal in 2004 and Florida Supreme Court in 2006 in decisions that scrapped former Gov. Jeb Bush's statewide voucher program called \"Opportunity Scholarships.\" Cooper, however, did not consider the legal merit of vouchers, which was not at issue in the Monday morning hearing. Instead, he ruled that the tax and budget commission -- empaneled every 20 years to review the state's finances -- has the authority to put the measures before voters. The state constitution's language empowering the panel to propose \"state budgetary process\" reforms allowed it \"to propose revisions to any portion of the constitution touching upon the state budgetary process generally,\" Cooper wrote in a 14-page decision. Amendment 7 would scrap state constitutional language prohibiting state aid to religious or \"sectarian\" institutions. Amendment 9 combines two issues -- spelling out that school districts must spend 65 percent of their budgets on classroom education, and also mandating that the state isn't \"exclusively\" required to fund education through a free public-school system. If the two amendments are approved by voters, the Legislature could reinstate and even broaden Bush's voucher program to subsidize enrollment at religiously affiliated and other private schools. More here Surprise! Free college boosts enrolment Tulsa County, Okla., is attracting the attention of educators across the country with a new scholarship program that has dramatically boosted college attendance by guaranteeing free tuition to all high school graduates. Tulsa Achieves is among a growing number of programs nationwide that seek to boost economic growth by expanding the skilled labor force though improved access to higher education. The Tulsa program has proved a boon for Cassidy Mays, 19, who had planned to take a year off after graduating from Union High School in Tulsa to earn money for college. \"I didn't really have money just to fork out, so it would have been a good time to take a break,\" said Mr. Mays, who is pursuing a pre-med associate degree. \"There's no telling if I would have ever gone back.\" He is not alone. Tulsa Community College has doubled its enrollment of county applicants in the past two years, from 972 in 2006 to more than 1,800 this year, said Lauren F. Brookey, the college's vice president of external affairs. Miss Brookey said the Tulsa Achieves scholarships will provide up to 100 percent of any county high school graduate's tuition at the college. The program requires applicants to complete up to 63 credits in three years. Tuition costs $2,100 for full-time enrollment, which is 30 credits a year. No new taxes were levied to pay for the program, said William Stuart Price, owner of a Tulsa energy company and vice chairman of the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. Instead, the college reallocated 1 percent of its general operating budget to fund the program last year, and this year will spend just less than 2 percent of the operating budget, Miss Brookey said, adding that private donations offset the reallocated funds. The budget comprises revenue from state and county taxes, and programs like the federal Pell Grants and the state Oklahoma's Promise, which gives free tuition to children from families earning less than $50,000 annually. \"Our goal was to get more people into the college pipeline so that they would go on to get higher degrees and increase the number of college graduates in the area,\" Miss Brookey said. \"All social indicators are tied to your level of education.\" Source # posted by jonjayray @ 12:31 AM 0 comments links to this post Saturday, August 09, 2008 Australia: EDUCATION, EDUCATION The Howard government made a big issue of declining educational standards but lost power before it could do much. Education problems remain, however, with the vested interests of Left-dominated government teachers entrenched against any reforms. Three recent articles below Second-ranking government universities fear private competition Lobby group Innovative Research Universities warns against allowing increased competition from private providers, and demands protection for existing public sector institutions in its in its submission to the Bradley higher education review. \"We argue against applying a pure market model to universities - they are critically important to this country. We don't want to see the risk of market failure, as happened in the case of ABC childcare, effecting universities'' IRU executive director Lenore Cooper told HES. IRU consists of six predominantly suburban and regional institutions, Flinders, Griffith, James Cook, La Trobe, Murdoch and Newcastle. Macquarie University vice chancellor and outspoken reform advocate Steven Schwartz took his institution out of IRU in June. IRU cautions against competition from private providers, arguing that further deregulation would \"drive greater homogenisation\" in higher education as all providers focused on low cost courses in high consumer demand and that student fees would rise. Endorsing a 2006 Labor Party policy document the lobby argues that the \"special role of public universities'' should be preserved and that \"pure market-base forces are not the solution to current funding shortfalls''. \"The opening up of Commonwealth supported places to private providers, which are driven by the need to maximise profits for owners and shareholders will inevitably result in those providers moving into the most profitable market niches,'' the submission states. IRU also rejects further deregulation of student fees suggesting that study costs would either rise or if the market was price sensitive that \"regional and outer metropolitan universities'' would lose income due to community pressure to offer a full range of courses at low fees. This would be \"a recipe for lowered quality and financial decline''. And the organisation also opposes research concentration, suggesting that it would be anti-competitive, and that its long term impact would be to \"lock institutions into their existing profiles, stifle innovation in research and to deprive many Australian regions of the research support that is required to stimulate regional development''. However the lobby also suggests that institutions undertaking insufficient research could lose their university status. \"IRU's view is that a university must be able to demonstrate research strength in a number of areas. If an institution did not do enough research - it could elect not to be a university and thus not to compete for research funds. This would depend on how much research government specified was necessary for an institution to qualify as a university,\" Cooper said. IRU proposes fine tuning the system to reduce the number of discipline clusters used by Canberra to allocate student funding and an end to what IRU says is the unfair subsidy of private providers which allows their students access to publicly supported loans while public universities are barred from offering full fee places to domestic undergraduates. The lobby also called for specific funding to increase university access for disadvantaged Australians in its submission. \"There has been enormous change in the last decade and there will continue to be plenty of change but we don't want dramatic change,'' Cooper said. Source Call for standards in testing Year 12 of school One of the nation's leading education researchers has called for national minimum standards in fundamental skills that all students must meet before qualifying for their Year 12 certificate. Australian Council for Educational Research chief executive Geoff Masters said Year 12 certificates should come with a guarantee that students had achieved minimum standards in some basic skills. At an ACER research conference next week, Professor Masters will propose minimum levels be set for fundamental skills including reading, writing, numeracy, science, civics and citizenship, and information technology. \"Most students can complete 13 years of school and be awarded a senior certificate without having to demonstrate minimally acceptable levels of proficiency across a range of fundamental areas,\" he said yesterday. \"Some things are so fundamental we should expect all students to achieve at least a minimum standard by the time they leave school.\" Professor Masters said the available evidence suggested that many students leave high school without possessing these fundamental skills. He said the results from international tests run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showed that 13 per cent of Australian 15-year-olds perform at a minimum baseline, below which students are considered atrisk of not having the basic skills to work or participate in thecommunity. While there is no data on how many Year 12 students graduate without those basic skills, Professor Masters said there was no evidence suggesting that proportion would decrease between Year 9 and Year 12. In fact, it was unlikely struggling students of that age had received the assistance they required to meet such benchmarks. Professor Masters said a national debate was required about the level at which the standards should be set and how the assessment should be conducted. He envisaged a system under which students could demonstrate they had reached the minimum standards earlier than Year 12 if they felt ready. The assessment could take the form of a national or state-based external exam or an online exam or use teachers' regular assessments where appropriate. Professor Masters said the current certificates were based on assessing students' knowledge in subjects. \"If someone is doing maths in Years 11 and 12, then you can be pretty confident they're going to pass a numeracy test,\" he said. \"But not all students study maths or science, for example, in those years and there's no way of knowing what they understand.\" Professor Masters said the standards should be set as part of a national consultation, but outline a minimum level of skill required in everyday life, such as reading and filling out job applications. The system should also report a range of proficiencies in the basic skills to give employers and others a sense of what students could achieve. \"We should set the standard at the level we hope everyone should reach by the time they finish school,\" he said. \"There's always a risk that standards are set too low and that the focus is then just on achieving low standards so there needs to be levels beyond a minimally acceptable standard.\" Other skills that could be considered were employability skills nominated by employers, such as planning, organisation and teamwork. But Professor Masters said assessing these skills was more complicated than the straightforward tests used in literacy and numeracy. Source Postmodern path to student failure POSTMODERNISM is hobbling Australia's best and brightest university students by locking them into narrow, prescriptive and politically correct ways of thinking and using language. The domination of postmodern theory, especially in humanities courses, is setting up a generation of students for educational failure, University of NSW professor Gavin Kitching argues in a book to be published this week. Based on an analysis of all honours dissertations written by politics students at the university over 23 years, Professor Kitching concludes that the students had abused their intelligence in writing their theses. In the book, The Trouble With Theory, he says even the best students produce radically incoherent ideas and embrace the \"extraordinary proposition\" that language uses people rather than being a tool manipulated by people. Professor Kitching, who describes himself as being politically left-wing, said postmodernism had become identified with being left-wing. \"It's postmodernism as intellectual radicalism - if you're on the Left politically you have to believe in all of this,\" he said. \"There are other traditions of being left-wing which respect the facts, which don't believe the world is simply what we believe it to be, that think if you're going to make political arguments, you have to have evidence to support them. I want to reinstate that kind of rigorous, realistic Left liberalism.\" Professor Kitching, a professor of politics and fellow of the Australian Academy of Social Sciences, argues that postmodernism locks students into inflexible and emotionally manipulative definitions of words in a way that ignores the nuanced nature of language and often defies common sense. This means that terms like terrorist, asylum seeker and gay are used to create stereotypes and not simply to refer to a group of people or to challenge the stereotype. He argues that postmodernist theory does \"active intellectual damage\" to able students and clouds their thinking. \"Postmodernism is addling the brain and wasting the time of some our brightest young people,\" he says. In an interview with The Australian, Professor Kitching said the book was not a critique of postmodernism but looked at the educational cost of theory in teaching. \"This book is about what a group of intelligent students think postmodernism is,\" he said. \"You could say they don't have it right, they don't understand it, they haven't grasped it. But if this is what they think postmodernism is, if it has led them to argue in these ways, then it's educationally damaging irrespective of whether they have it right or not.\" Professor Kitching analysed theses that achieved a distinction or high distinction. While they were only those in the school of politics, he said his experience as an external examiner and discussions with colleagues showed the problems ran through history and sociology. From his analysis of the theses, Professor Kitching said students were captive to a form of linguistic determinism that held that language forces people to think in certain ways. Students equate the way language is used with the meaning of words, so that the word \"terrorist\" always means a person using extreme violence for political ends, and anyone called a terrorist is actually a terrorist. But he said such thinking excluded sentences such as: \"Calling these people terrorists distracts attention from the justice of their cause. \"They have a very narrow idea of how we use words. \"(They believe) words have given meanings, and these meanings have certain biases or prejudices. If you use words, you have to accept the biases or prejudices - you're stuck with them. That you can use words ironically is not something they can take seriously. \"Clearly that's not true. We use words to refer to things, but we can refer to them ironically, we can refer to them sarcastically, doubtingly, aggressively.\" Source # posted by jonjayray @ 12:10 AM 0 comments links to this post Friday, August 08, 2008 The Harvard kindergarten A BOOK REVIEW of \"Back to School, Turning Crimson\" By Philip Delves Broughton. Review by ANDREW FERGUSON As Paris bureau chief for the London Daily Telegraph, Philip Delves Broughton had one of the most desirable jobs in newspapering -- indeed, one of the last remaining desirable jobs in newspapering -- and he did it well enough to earn the admiration of boss and colleague alike. He shared an apartment on the Left Bank with a charming and beautiful wife and a burbling baby boy. He dined with heads of state and traveled widely on his employer's dime. Despite the volatility of the journalism business, his professional future seemed exceedingly bright. So he quit and went back to school to study accounting. Of course, these weren't just any old accounting classes. As he tells us in \"Ahead of the Curve,\" his horrifying and very funny memoir, he entered Harvard Business School, joining 900 other strivers as a member of the Class of 2006. At 33, he was older than most of his classmates and wiser to the ways of the world but much less handy when it came to regression analysis. Half-Burmese and Oxford-educated, Mr. Delves Broughton knew of Harvard -- and particularly of HBS, as it is known in our acronym-crazed era -- mostly as a brand, and he emerged with an ambivalence toward the brand that most Americans will understand. Like our common language, like our love for baseball and bleached flour, our resentful mistrust of Harvard is one of the things that have traditionally bound Americans to one another, from the snootiest Yale graduate to the lowliest stevedore. Meanwhile, everybody is trying to get in. It is hard to account for the odd position that Harvard holds in the American imagination, and Mr. Delves Broughton's excellent book only deepens the puzzle. Some of what he found won't be surprising, particularly the sense of entitlement for which its students and faculty are famous. The self-regard must get handed out with the matriculation packets. Most graduate business schools, you might have noticed, award MBAs. HBS, according to the dean, specializes in \"transformational experiences.\" Asked to account for a Wall Street Journal poll of corporate recruiters that ranked HBS 13th among business schools, the dean shrugged off the poor showing as sour grapes. What did you expect? HBS grads reject so many routine job offers that of course recruiters are going to resent the school. Mr. Delves Broughton was prepared for the number-crunching nerdiness, the intense competitiveness and the unrealistically high levels of self-esteem. But there was much more. \"HBS,\" he writes, \"had two modes: deadly serious and frat boy, with little in between.\" The future titans of American industry celebrated the end of their first week of classes with a party at which everyone was expected to dress as his favorite hip-hop star. The central attraction was a \"booze luge,\" an ingenious and super-efficient means of chugging vodka. At midsemester came the Priscilla ball. \"The men were to dress as women and the women as sluts. . . . One man looked like Virginia Woolf in a white boa and black wig . . . while another wore a skimpy Heidi outfit and women's underwear, which failed to contain his errant . . . \" -- well, you get the idea. And it cost only $120 to attend. If Mr. Delves Broughton was surprised at the frat-boy excess, it is the other mode, the serious, non-frat-boy one, that the reader may find more disconcerting. The jargon-choked faddishness and fatuous therapeutics of pop business books and the modern workplace have seeped into HBS too. Or maybe it's the other way around. In any case, no serious student, even a serious Harvard student, should have to suffer through New Age group bonding games, as Mr. Delves Broughton and his classmates are forced to do. Another required \"personal development exercise\" is called \"My Reflected Best Self.\" He quotes the instructions: \"The Reflected Best-Self Feedback Exercise differs from other performance mechanisms in its explicit focus on understanding how key constituents experience individuals when they leverage their strength constructively.\" Mr. Delves Broughton remains appropriately appalled at this, but as the semesters wear on and he unspools his story, he shows signs of succumbing to a version of Stockholm Syndrome -- a hostage identifying, if not with his captors, then at least with his professors, even those who pretend to teach \"leadership skills.\" His prose, usually breezy and ironic, begins to sprout words like \"team-focused.\" By the end of his two years in Cambridge, Mass., he writes, \"I was happy I went.\" He knows how to do a regression analysis, and he has learned how to make an Excel spreadsheet do everything but play canasta. He hasn't found a suitable job yet, though, and readers will be happy to see that he retains a hint of skepticism about the whole HBS enterprise -- enough, at least, to include this wonderful bit of data from a study by a banking analyst who tried to track the American equity markets in relation to the number of HBS graduates who chose to go to work in finance each year. If the figure was less than 10%, the market went up not long after. More than 30% and the market was headed for a crash. In 2006, Mr. Delves Broughton reports, 42% of the HBS grads went to work in finance. Right on schedule. Source It's time for education reform By John McCain Campaigning at town halls across America, I am often asked about my plans to reform our public schools. And the answer begins with two points on which most everyone agrees: Every public school child deserves a first-rate education. And too many of our schools are producing second-rate results. Beyond that, the education debate divides quickly into two camps. Some say all that's needed is more taxpayer money, along with more prekindergarten and after-school programs. Others believe that the basic structure of the education system is flawed, and that fundamental reform is needed. You can put me squarely on the side of major reform. These days, the cause of education reform crosses all boundaries of party, race and financial means. In New York, Mayor Bloomberg and Schools Chancellor Joel Klein have taken up the cause of reform, as have many others, including the Rev. Al Sharpton. These men are strong supporters of the Education Equality Project, a group dedicated to finally changing the status quo in our education system. This group of leaders is no longer willing to accept a public school system in which many students never even graduate or learn the basics of math, science and English. As Chancellor Klein puts it, \"In large urban areas the culture of public education is broken. If you don't fix this culture, then you are not going to be able to make the kind of changes that are needed.\" The chancellor speaks for many, and especially for parents who cannot afford a private school. Consider the example of the Opportunity Scholarship program in Washington, D.C., which serves more than 1,900 children from families with an average income of $23,000 a year. More than 7,000 more families have applied for that program. What they all share is the desire to get their kids into a better school. Yet Democrats in Congress, including my opponent, Sen. Obama, oppose this program. Not long ago, addressing the American Federation of Teachers, he dismissed public support for private school vouchers for low-income Americans as \"tired rhetoric about vouchers and school choice.\" That went over well with the teachers union, but where does it leave children who are stuck in failing schools? Parents ask only for safe schools, competent teachers and diplomas that open doors of opportunity. When a public school fails, repeatedly, to meet these minimal objectives, parents ask only for a choice in the education of their children. No entrenched bureaucracy or union should deny parents that choice and children that opportunity. If I am elected President, school choice for all who want it, an expansion of Opportunity Scholarships and alternative certification for teachers will all be part of a serious agenda of education reform. We will pay bonuses to teachers working in our most troubled schools because we need their fine minds and good hearts to help turn those schools around. We will award bonuses as well to our highest-achieving teachers. And instead of measuring teacher achievement by conformity to process, we will measure it by the success of their students. Moreover, the funds for these bonuses will not be controlled by faraway officials. Under my reforms, we will put the money and the responsibilities where they belong - in the office of the school principal. One reason charter schools are so successful is that principals have spending discretion. I am proud to add my name to the growing list of those who support the Education Equality Project. But one name is still missing: Barack Obama. My opponent talks a great deal about hope and change, and education is an important test of his seriousness. The Education Equality Project is a practical plan for delivering change and restoring hope for children and parents who need a lot of both. And if Sen. Obama continues to defer to the teachers unions, instead of committing to real reform, then he should start looking for new slogans.

TERMINOLOGY: The British \"A Level\" exam is roughly equivalent to a U.S. High School diploma. Rather confusingly, you can get As, Bs or Cs in your \"A Level\" results. Entrance to the better universities normally requires several As in your \"A Levels\". MORE TERMINOLOGY: Many of my posts mention the situation in Australia. Unlike the USA and Britain, there is virtually no local input into education in Australia. Education is mostly a State government responsibility, though the Feds have a lot of influence (via funding) at the university level. So it may be useful to know the usual abbreviations for the Australian States: QLD (Queensland), NSW (New South Wales), WA (Western Australia), VIC (Victoria), TAS (Tasmania), SA (South Australia). There were two brothers from a famous family. One did very well at school while the other was a duffer. Which one went on the be acclaimed as the \"Greatest Briton\"? It was the duffer: Winston Churchill. The current Left-inspired practice of going to great lengths to shield students from experience of failure and to tell students only good things about themselves is an appalling preparation for life. In adulthood, the vast majority of people are going to have to reconcile themselves to mundane jobs and no more than mediocrity in achievement. Illusions of themselves as \"special\" are going to be sorely disappointed Perhaps it's some comfort that the idea of shielding kids from failure and having only \"winners\" is futile anyhow. When my son was about 3 years old he came bursting into the living room, threw himself down on the couch and burst into tears. When I asked what was wrong he said: \"I can't always win!\". The problem was that we had started him out on educational computer games where persistence only is needed to \"win\". But he had then started to play \"real\" computer games -- shootem-ups and the like. And you CAN lose in such games -- which he had just realized and become frustrated by. The upset lasted all of about 10 minutes, however and he has been happily playing computer games ever since. He also now has a degree in mathematics and is socially very pleasant. \"Losing\" certainly did not hurt him. I am an atheist of Protestant background who sent his son to Catholic schools. Why did I do that? Because I do not personally feel threatened by religion and I think Christianity is a generally good influence. I also felt that religion is a major part of life and that my son should therefore have a good introduction to it. He enjoyed his religion lessons but seems to have acquired minimal convictions from them. Why have Leftist educators so relentlessly and so long opposed the teaching of phonics as the path to literacy when that opposition has been so enormously destructive of the education of so many? It is because of their addiction to simplistic explanations of everything (as in saying that Islamic hostility is caused by \"poverty\" -- even though Osama bin Laden is a billionaire!). And the relationship between letters and sounds in English is anything but simple compared to the beautifully simple but very unhelpful formula \"look and learn\". For greatest efficiency, lowest cost and maximum choice, ALL schools should be privately owned and run -- with government-paid vouchers for the poor and minimal regulation. The NEA and similar unions worldwide believe that children should be thoroughly indoctrinated with Green/Left, feminist/homosexual ideology but the \"3 R's\" are something that kids should just be allowed to \"discover\" On all my blogs, I express my view of what is important primarily by the readings that I select for posting. I do however on occasions add personal comments in italicized form at the beginning of an article. I am rather pleased to report that I am a lifelong conservative. Out of intellectual curiosity, I did in my youth join organizations from right across the political spectrum so I am certainly not closed-minded and am very familiar with the full spectrum of political thinking. Nonetheless, I did not have to undergo the lurch from Left to Right that so many people undergo. At age 13 I used my pocket-money to subscribe to the \"Reader's Digest\" -- the main conservative organ available in small town Australia of the 1950s. I have learnt much since but am pleased and amused to note that history has since confirmed most of what I thought at that early age. I imagine that the the RD is still sending mailouts to my 1950s address! Discipline: With their love of simple generalizations, this will be Greek to Leftists but I see an important role for discipline in education DESPITE the fact that my father never laid a hand on me once in my entire life nor have I ever laid a hand on my son in his entire life. The plain fact is that people are DIFFERENT, not equal and some kids will not behave themselves in response to persuasion alone. In such cases, realism requires that they be MADE to behave by whatever means that works -- not necessarily for their own benefit but certainly for the benefit of others whose opportunities they disrupt and destroy.

BUT... a big thank you to the 200+ people who kindly took the time to vote, I can re-assure you, I am bloodied but unbowed Best of luck to the rest of the competitors and of course to the Intake blog which kicked my butt! PR Week Blog Competition... August 10, 2008 Posted by Tom Murphy in : Public Relations , 6 comments To celebrate its tenth anniversary PR Week is hosting a competition to find the most popular PR blog. Keith O'Brien and the team at PR Week have selected 32 blogs. [Actually they selected 16 and then asked those 16 bloggers to nominate 16 others, so given I wasn't asked to select a blog, one of the final sixteen was kind enough to nominate this blog - probably in a sly move to ensure weaker competition ] Given the calibre of the short list, I'm not sure that this blog can survive in such esteemed company, but following the inspiration of Professor David Weinbaum: \"while it's important to win, it's imperative to compete\" :-) If you feel like upsetting the odds do wander over here to vote. Voting opens on Sunday, August 10th, 2008 at 9pm and closes on Tuesday, August 12th at midnight. I'm tempted to echo the sentiments of the Chicago politician who exorted their followers to \"vote early and often\" - but that's (ahem) below me....

Filed under: \"Rare as hen's teeth\": It is often impossible to find nice things written about our profession online. Well ladies and gentlemen, we have one! Shel Holtz has a great example of good work from a PR person, in this case Jim Babb at Circuit City. The story took a turn for the great, though, when Jim Babb, who works in Circuit City's corporate communications department in Richmond, Virginia, sent a note to Consumerist. The note is a lesson in how to handle what could have turned into a significant annoyance for Circuit City (the story got 1,935 Diggs, for example, and was covered in an AP story) featuring charges of censorship and allusions to the First Amendment. [Aside: Shel has also published a comprehensive list of social media resources. Worth a look.] Via the bitemarks blog: A report from Jupiter Research has found that less than 5% of of advertisers' online budgets are going into \"social marketing\" in 2008. Some growth potential there I imagine. Eoin Kennedy from Slattery Communications (and one of our PR firms in Ireland) has blogged about a new Facebook application they've created. Get Creative provides a respository of creative ideas for marketing or PR programmes. It is currently in beta testing on Facebook but the philosophy behind it is that you can search for ideas, add your own and comment on other peoples contributions to give them further life. Launched internally we have found that it helps people to start thinking more creatively and watching what trends, ideas and initiatives are happening all around them. It was born out of frustration of thinking up great ideas which disappeared into the far recesses of your mind before you could full capture them. It will be an interesting test of collaboration amongst the public relations, marketing and advertising sectors. So the SEC has provided updated disclosure guidance. Neville Hobson has a good, detailed post on the subject. ReadWriteWeb has a post on the \"future of blogging revealed\". The future or a nightmare? Who has the time? The idle rich? Save me.

Posted by Tom Murphy in : Humour, Public Relations, Social Media , add a comment Trevor Cook has a very interesting post titled \"The revolution may not be blogged\" which ponders whether the \"new media revolution\" has stalled somewhat. Moreover, when they do blog organisations, like Telstra, often find it extraordinarily difficult to see their social media efforts as anything more than just another way to get out messages and push products. In the hands of a PR pro, the opportunity to bypass the 'media gateway' can just mean an open invitation to pump out unfiltered propaganda. Overtime, more organisations will adopt social media tools and they will have to become just a little more open, transparent and accountable to get the full benefit. Sadly, it will be a slow process. More on Trevor's blog. \u2014 Heather Yaxley has a great post on \"fast\" and \"slow\" Public Relations. Everyone in PR should know that quick reactions are required when called by media working to deadlines - this Fast PR is even more important in ensuring online media audiences get their fix of Fast News. But we also need good old fashioned Slow PR skills in building relationships, identifying possible feature articles, developing individual angles and stories, thinking outside our traditional media relations focus and taking the time to be accurate, informative and effective. \u2014 Bill Sledzik continues his recent strong run with a post on what PR is not.. Public Relations is NOT... Advertising... Promotion... Publicity... Media relations... Public affairs... Selling... Marketing... Read the full post here. \u2014 This blog is operated under the \"greenhouse code\", particularly when dealing with the \"outing\" of PR people. Well you just never know do you? You might be tired one morning, send a sloppy e-mail and next thing you're RSS-meat of the week. Mark Rose takes the New York Times' Joe Nocera to task for Nocera's outing of a PR person who was pitching on behalf of a manufacturer of \"juvenile transportation devices\" - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Fair play for Rose, but the use of the phrase \"children have become fashion accessories\" is at the very least ill advised. \u2014 Finally, it's Friday... New Media Douchebag [Hat tip to Lee Hopkins] The passing of a great human being... Posted by Tom Murphy in : Personal , 2 comments Back in October I first became aware of Randy Pausch. I'm sure there's few of you who aren't aware of the man who delivered the famed \"Last Lecture\". His talk inspired me. His talk saddened me. His talk made me laugh. But most of all, his talk made me think. What an incredible gentleman. Since I first saw the video I have kept an interest in his progress via his web site [it seems to be down] and today I was truly saddened today to hear of his passing. You know Randy Pausch has done something few can claim, he has made people around the world, to stop, think, take stock and hopefully make decisions on what is really important in their lives. While Mr. Pausch was interviewed on every major US television channel, for me, his original, unedited Last Lecture is one of the most powerful and thought provoking pieces of video on the Internet. Do yourself a favour, watch the video, buy the book and invest your time thinking about what really matters to you. I can only imagine the pain and suffering of the Pausch family at this incredibly painful time. But I hope that in the weeks, months and years ahead that they are consoled in the knowledge that Randy Pausch was, and is an extraordinary human being who touched people's lives.

Posted by Tom Murphy in : Blogs, He would say that, PR Blogs, Public Relations, Technology , 1 comment so far Device of mass disruption or eh is it a phone? Guys seriously I have stayed silent on this subject long enough. It's a phone. It's not a six inch device of mass disruption. Apple has done a good design job but I am bored to my back teeth with the ridiculous posts and tweets. I had a radio on my cell phone in the late 90's. If these devices were going to disrupt/kill/change radio it would be more likely to happen with radios on MP3 players. Why, oh why, is every 1.0 release of every 1.0 piece of hardware or software \"game changing\"? Me? I love my HTC, fantastic resolution, full touch screen, proper camera, great keyboard for grown up e-mail and word processing, not to mention loads of software - and the best part? It's not threatening to kill any industries, take people's jobs and the battery lasts more than 35 minutes and HTC don't advise you to turn off the 3G, you can have all the speed you like baby. *I debated whether to categorize this under \"He would say that\", and I did in the end. But regardless this is true. What's PR then? Bill Sledzik takes a run at a unified definition of public relations working through a variety of textbook definitions. Tom's Opinion: This is a breath of fresh air, it's great to get some informed writing on this topic. Too often when PR is discussed, what's really being discussed is \"media relations\", which although a major element of the profession is not the whole story. This is also the reason why we see so much rubbish about the \"death of PR\". The reality is that great communication remains a strong and valuable asset and Web 2.0 doesn't change that. Yes it's about relationships (duh), yes it's about understanding the tools and channels, but at the core it's about great communication and and audience insight. [Bill also tackles the issue of whether PR is part of marketing.] PR Blog Ranking Mania: Man it's PR blog rank weekend an I'm sinking faster than a stone, however while I'm gurgling water, I'll use one of my last breaths to pass congratulations to Stuart Bruce More here, here, here, oh and here.

Blog, Spot, dissected part 3], [Another and discrimination laws \"Cartoon Row\" dissected -- -- part 1], [Something resembling an introduction] Random Platitudes Being the completely unimportant musings of a hopelessly self-important person. Tuesday, August 22, 2006 The \"Cartoon Row\" -- latest roundup Without any protestations of apology for my long absence from blogging (I've been busy, so there), here are some snapshots of some of the recent newsworthy events concerning the \"Cartoon Row\": On the occasion of the holiday that marks the anniversary of the Danish Constitution, June 5, politicians all over Denmark traditionally give speeches on the state of democracy in the country. This year, Pia Kj\u00e6rsgaard, the leader of the islamophobic Danish People's Party (Dansk Folkeparti) unsurprisingly picked as her topic the threat to Danish democracy posed by Muslims, foreign and domestic. Ms. Kj\u00e6rsgaard was speaking at Lykkesholm Slot, a conference center located in a scenic manorial estate built in the 17th and 18th centuries. The place, one of Hans Christian Andersen's favourite hangouts, was the venue chosen by Kj\u00e6rsgaard to deliver an interesting diatribe that shines as an example of misinformation. Intent on attributing the escalation of the crisis into actual violence to the malicious actions of domestic imams and hostile foreign (Islamic) nations, Kj\u00e6rsgaard claimed that, from the publication of the cartoons until the sudden outbreak of attacks on Danish embassies, months later, \"nothing happened\", implying that the attacks came out of the blue. In this, she is not alone. Several Danish newspapers have presented the events in this fashion. It simply isn't true, however. They choose to ignore the many protests, both inside and outside Denmark, that took place in the months leading up to the outbreaks of violence. As I have written in earlier posts, these outbreaks of violence are in themselves conveniently timed for Syria and Iran, and there is reason to be suspicious regarding their supposed spontaneity. But to say that they came after months of \"nothing\" is to completely warp the fabric of truth. Standard practice for Dansk Folkeparti, of course. You may remember Iran's rather quaint response to the caricatures... Showing once again their clear belief that anything unpleasant that comes their way is somehow related to Israel's imperialist agenda in the Middle East, the Iranian newspaper Hamshahri decided to respond to the caricatures by soliciting caricatures from all over the world, lampooning the Holocaust. The mind boggles at the convoluted illogic behind this, but never mind that -- the caricatures (1100 of them, from over 60 countries) were collected, and over 200 of them are now on show in Tehran, according to aljazeera.net. Of course, as crude and purposely offensive as this exhibition of Holocaust-related caricatures is, it is unlikely to elicit quite the same over-the-top response as the Danish caricatures that set off the original crisis. As British blogger Robert Hinkley put it: \"Meh, whatever. As a result I expect a total of zero buildings to be set on fire or stormed by gunmen, no embassies to be closed nor ambassadors recalled, and nobody to be killed in rioting.\"That pretty much sums up my own expectations. Two prominent political debaters in Denmark, T\u00f8ger Seidenfaden (editor-in-chief of the moderate daily Politiken) and Rune Engelbreth Larsen (controversial author and lecturer, with an eclectic and very odd CV including leadership of the oddball Minority Party and editor of the even-more-oddball intellectual magazine Faklen) recently co-authored a book dealing with the \"Cartoon Row\". ISBN 87-02-05166-4), the book has produced a lukewarm debate in the press. It has been criticized in the right-wing press as being unduly critical of Danish PM Anders Fogh Rasmussen and his handling of the crisis, and in the left-wing press for being uncritical of Seidenfaden's own contributions to the crisis. Leftist daily Information went so far as to say that Seidenfaden was attempting a \"whitewash\" of his own actions. For a press release dealing with the publication of the book, which presents the propositions within it in a more neutral tone than they are presented in the text itself, look here. Note that I agree with many of the propositions as they are presented in the press release, but there is a noticeable difference between the relatively bland press release, and the book itself. Based on a cursory reading of the book (I'm going to have to devote more time to its individual propositions in later blogposts, I feel certain, but let's be pleasantly superficial here, for once), I would say that the critics are right. Seidenfaden and Engelbreth haven't produced a neutral analysis of the crisis -- rather, this is one angle on the subject, slightly misrepresented as more unbiased than it actually is. In fact, as several critics (left, right and center) have remarked, it is decidedly odd to see Seidenfaden (generally respected as an intelligent man with serious credentials) teaming up with Engelbreth, a man whom many would regard as an outright crackpot. Technorati tags: denmark, politics, cartoon row, current affairs, xenophobia, islamophobia, islam, media Friday, May 26, 2006 All in the family I love history. It's a wonderful subject, filled with odd anecdotes and quirky facts that make you exclaim: \"Well, I never would have expected that!\" Let's take a look at one of those surprising facts from history. Be warned, it is obscure, unverifiable and possibly untrue -- so the word \"fact\" may be stretching it a bit. But I guess it'll do for a \"fact\" until the real thing comes along. To set the scene for our little surprise, we need to go back in time to Spain in the age of the Reconquista. As you may know, much of the Iberian peninsula was conquered by Islam in the early middle ages -- and by 1492, the same year Columbus \"sailed the ocean blue\", the middle ages and the Moorish occupation of the peninsula were over. This era of reconquest of Spain and Portugal by Christian forces is called, borrowing the word from Spanish, the Reconquista. In between the beginning of the Moorish establishment in Spain and the end, there was a long period of wars, accommodations and intermittent coexistence. Like the crusader kingdoms in the Levant, the Christian and Muslim rulers of Spain often found good political reasons to make alliances across the divide of religion. One of these Christian monarchs was Alfonso VI of Leon and Castile (born before June 1040, dead July 1, 1109), the first king to style himself \"king of all Spain\", and one of the larger-than-life figures of El Cantar de Mio Cid, \"The Lay of the Cid\". Alfonso had many wives. He was married at least five times, and the recorded parentage of his children is rather vague. Genealogies tend to mention the probable mother of a particular child from among his list of wives, and a number of alternate possibilities (this, by the way, is why I mentioned earlier that this story is unverifiable). At any rate, let's focus on one of Alfonso's wives in particular. She has several names. In official genealogies, she appears as Isabella of Denia (born about 1071, died 1107). Isabella is almost certainly the mother of Alfonso's only son, Sancho (who never attained the throne, having predeceased his father at the Battle of Ucles in 1108). She is also variously listed as the possible mother of Alfonso's other children Sancha and Elvira Alphonsez. They're both pretty interesting, so let's have a closer look at them. Sancha married Rodrigo `El Franco' Gonzales de Lara, and counts among her descendants the Portuguese King Dionisio Henriques (1261-1325), whose descendants number every single Catholic royal family in Europe. Nor did Elvira's blood line go into historical obscurity. No, not at all. Her first husband was Raymond IV, count of Toulouse, and her second was Roger II Guiscard of the Norman kingdom of Naples. From these marriages, Elvira had several children, including King William I `the Bad' of Naples and Sicily, and Roger III de Hauteville. From the latter gentleman, many if not all of the dynasties of the German kingdoms and princely states descend. Etcetera, etcetera. Oh, heck, let's cut to the chase: so far as I can reliably determine, an index of the descendants of Alfonso VI and Isabella would be a complete listing of every single European royal family, most of the nobility, and many of the prominent families of the \u00e9lites of other nations (including the United States of America, which, like the late Roman republic, is more of an aristocracy than a republic). Just for instance... Isabella's the 23 times great-grandmother of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. Or, in another line of descent, the 24 times great-grandmother of Diana Spencer, the late Princess of Wales. So why is that line of descent so interesting? Good question. Well, Isabella wasn't born with that name. Actually, her name used to be Zaida. Nor was she a Christian, until she was forcibly converted to Catholicism. She was, in fact, the daughter of the deposed Emir of Sevilla, Abul-Kasim Muhammad ben Abbad al-Mu'tamid (born to wealth and power about 1040, died in poverty 1095). Again, so what? Well, the Emir of Sevilla wasn't just a nobody. In fact, he came from a pretty prominent lineage. More precisely, 16 generations before he came along, one of his ancestors had founded a new world religion. That's right, Abul-Kasim Muhammad ben Abbad al-Mu'tamid was a lineal descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. In other words, so is every single royal family in Europe. That sort of puts an interesting perspective on the entire issue of Islamic marginalisation in Europe, doesn't it? It opens up all sorts of job opportunities for down-on-their luck European nobility and royalty. \"Convert to Islam, and you'll be a candidate for Caliph...\" Facetious, I know, but interesting. Still, I promised you a curious fact, and I hope you'll agree that I've delivered, as promised. Tuesday, May 23, 2006 It's aliiive.....! \"Rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated,\" Mark Twain once remarked... and I have good reason to repeat the remark here, having been on hiatus for over six weeks. I could tell you a sob story about how dreadfully life has treated me, and how heavily burdened I've been... but the truth is that there are just 24 hours in a day. Being but frail mortal flesh, I still have to use some of them to sleep (I'm working on that problem, but my lab rats keep dying, dammit). Therefore, I've simply not had the spare time to blog. That hasn't really changed, honestly -- I'm still in arrears on most of my work commitments. But I've decided that it was time to stop neglecting my blogging, and start neglecting some of my other spare-time commitments. So if the guys on the translation project are reading this, now you know at least one of the reasons why I appear lazy, of late. So, now that I'm \"back in the saddle\", I'm wondering what to offer you -- you, my loyal and devoted readers (all nine of you). I've been flogging the Muhammad cartoon controversy until it is well and truly a dead horse, and I think you deserve a little change of pace. So in the next posts, I'm going to give you some material that isn't concerned with the cartoons. Not directly, anyway. But never fear, Random Platitudes is still going to be a political / historical blog. Any other material will go in \"sister\" blogs, as previously mentioned. My focus, as always, is on civil liberties, history, politics and the exposure of hypocrisy (as I see it). I invite you to join me once more, and to share with me your thoughts along the way. Thursday, April 06, 2006 The \"Cartoon Row\" dissected -- part 9 (continued from Part 8) As noted in the earlier parts of this narrative, the crisis over the Muhammad caricatures was eagerly seized upon by many different parties, each with their own agendas. Among those already mentioned are: K\u00e5re Bluitgen, arguably the instigator of the entire affair. His profit from the crisis has been immediate and tangible, with his fairly inconsequential book on Muhammad now already in its fourth printing, only months after its first publication. Various Danish politicians, notably Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen; MP Pia Kj\u00e6rsgaard, leader of the Danish and Naser Khader, MP for the Danish Social-Liberal Party; and others. All of these used the crisis to promote their own agendas. Danish imams, notably Ahmed Akkari and Abu Laban, who hastily seized upon the controversy, making a bid to raise their prestige in the Islamic community, and perhaps to obtain more funding from abroad. The governments of most Islamic nations, but especially Egypt, Syria and Iran. Again, the crisis itself was used by these states to promote agendas that were entirely disjunct from it. Confrontationalist religious leaders and activists in the Muslim world, notably in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Indonesia; as well as their counterparts in the more radical quarters of the Christian West, particularly in the United States. Although the crisis itself had a strong religious element, the focus of these groups was not on the issue of the crisis itself, but rather on the opportunity it afforded to enhance their own prestige, and to brand members of other religions as barbaric and inimical. Whether it was through instigating riots in Pakistan or inciting anti-Muslim prejudice through private radio and TV stations in the U.S., the religious confrontationalists were out in force, and clearly delighted at having a controversy to make use of. In short, a whole host of persons and groups thronged to make use of the opportunities afforded them by the crisis -- opportunities for raising their own media profile and making their own issues known to the public. Others, for somewhat more petty reasons, found the crisis to be a golden opportunity. One of these was Danish journalist Lasse Ellegaard, employed at the Danish daily Politiken. Ellegaard had a long career as a journalist, with jobs at most major Danish newspapers, including Jyllands-Posten and the respected left-wing newspaper Information (of which he was Editor in Chief from 1992 to 1994). In clear emulation of war correspondents like Peter Arnett, Ellegaard had made a name for himself as one of those journalists who was always in the thick of things. In recent years, he'd been covering the Middle East, and he somehow often managed to find himself in the midst of dangerous situations, at risk to his own life... at least, that was the case when he reported them. Ellegaard enjoyed a mixed reputation -- some Danish journalists, who gave full credence to his reports, regarded him highly as an exemplar of war correspondents. Other, more cynical, souls noted that his reports seemed rather excessively dramatic. Around the beginning of March 2006, Ellegaard had already made a number of reports from the widespread anti-Danish protests in the Middle East. His opinion was eagerly sought after by various interested parties, since he was considered an expert on the issue. For instance, he was booked to take part in a seminar on the topic \"Publish and be damned? Free speech, religious hatred and the cartoon controversy\" at the London Book Fair in March 2006, along with Fay Weldon and Abdul-Rehman Malik. For the early March 2006 (#4) issue of Journalisten, the official magazine of Journalistforbundet (the Danish Journalists' Union), Lasse Ellegaard wrote a short piece on the chilling effects of the crisis upon the safety of Danes in the Middle East, German?' 'Yes,' I immediately; Notes on a change of r\u00f4le as Dane in the Middle East\"). In this remarkable article, morose in tone, Ellegaard described how he had been asked by a hotel employee whether he was German, and had replied in the affirmative. From this, he went on to describe how this unthinking denial of his nationality was the result of a self-censorship born of fear -- and how he continued to adopt other nationalities in his journalistic work in the region, in response to the perceived risk of being Danish in the Muslim world. As peripheral as this article was, I am given to understand that it made a great impression in some journalistic circles -- the same circles which held Ellegaard's self-dramatizing style in high regard. Not everyone shared this view, nor did everyone agree with his assessment of the dangers of the Middle East. Lene Fr\u00f8slev, Middle East correspondent for the Danish daily Berlingske Tidende, chose not to be furtive about her nationality. In an article in the early April 2006 (#6) issue of Journalisten titled Laad os begr\u00e6nse hysteriet (\"Let us limit the hysteria\"), she described how she had openly admitted her nationality, and had been met with no hostility or threatening behaviour. A telling excerpt from her article describes her meetings with the supposedly hostile Muslim world: \"Jeg ankom fra Cairo til Damaskus, 15 timer efter at hooligans - formentlig statshyrede - havde sat ild den den for journalister 'forbudte' Hizbollah-zone.\" (\"I arrived in Damascus from Cairo, 15 hours after hooligans - presumably in the employ of the government - had set fire to the building housing the Danish embassy. 'Danish?', the airport customs officers asked interestedly. 'Yes,' I smiled. 'Welcome to Damascus!'\" {...} Whereas Lasse Ellegaard found it necessary to disavow his Danish nationality to a random hotel employee in the wealthy and safe district of Beirut, I experienced no problems asking people's opinions of the Muhammad caricatures in the 'forbidden-to-journalists' Hizbollah zone.\") As Fr\u00f8slev made it clear, the eagerness to attribute hostility and threat to the general Muslim population of the Middle East (most of whom probably couldn't care less) was not just a feature of the political and religious debate, it was also gratefully appropriated by elements of the media (of which Lasse Ellegaard was merely a sample) to enhance the cachet of their r\u00f4le as daring seekers of news, in the oh-so-dangerous wide world outside Denmark. Worse still, media reports exaggerating the scale of the crisis and the potential risk fed fuel to extremists who were all too happy to make use of it. Continued, sort of, in the August roundup Correction: Lasse Ellegaard, mentioned above, notes that he was Editor in Chief of Information from January 1, 1990 til September 1, 1994. He chooses not to comment on what he describes as my \"casting aspersions on his journalistic integrity\". Technorati tags: denmark, politics, cartoon row, current affairs, xenophobia, islam, media Wednesday, March 29, 2006 The \"Cartoon Row\" dissected -- part 8 (continued from Part 7) As the boycott of Danish goods continued to affect Danish exports to the Middle East, the Danish company that was under most pressure was Arla, a dairy goods conglomerate responsible for most of the Danish dairy exports, as well as most of the domestic market. Arla had recently had an unpleasant encounter with the effects of consumer boycott -- they had for several years been subjected to a domestic boycott, resulting from public outrage at their bullying tactics towards minor competitors. The domestic boycott had not been overwhelmingly effective, but had nevertheless resulted in an overall loss of Arla's market coverage in Denmark of several percentage points. This translated to a great deal of money, and Arla had learnt its lesson. Faced with a potentially equally harmful boycott (the Islamic countries constituted a much larger market, but with much less market penetration than Denmark, for a net result of approximately similar levels of potential harm), Arla was well aware of the potential damage to their interests, and wisely chose to play it safe and avoid antagonizing Muslim consumers further. For this reason, Arla had, in mid-February, formally renounced any support for the caricatures and Jyllands-Posten, and undertaken an intensive advertising campaign in the Middle East, trying to convince the consumers not to punish Danish companies for the activities of a single Danish paper. Humanitarian aid (to organisations like the Red Crescent) was part of the campaign, aimed at winning back the consumers of the Islamic world. While this was going on, the huge and influential Danish shipping, transport and industrial conglomerate, A.P. M\u00f8ller (M\u00e6rsk Line), continued its activities in the Middle East unabated. Most national governments were not going to let a little thing like consumer outrage get in the way of critical infrastructure development and transportation, and A.P. M\u00f8ller knew that very well. The development by M\u00e6rsk of a USD 5 billion off-shore oil field in Qatar continued unabated. At an energy conference in Doha, on February 19 2006, the Qatari Minister of Oil, Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah made it clear that the caricatures were not going to change the way Qatar dealt with M\u00e6rsk. Not surprisingly, Arla's willingness to disavow Jyllands-Posten was viewed in some quarters in Denmark as a disloyal and cowardly surrender to economic pressure. The perception was that the Danish companies were far more interested in making money than in standing up for Danish political and moral values. With this, pressure grew upon PM Anders Fogh Rasmussen to make it clear that the government continued to stand on the principles of free speech, and that the business affairs of these companies did not reflect official government policy. Because the government consisted of two intensely pro-business, pro-market parties, this was even more important. Moreover, many Danish intellectuals (and in particular, the Danish PEN club association of writers) had come out against the government and the caricatures, branding them culturally insensitive and deliberately confrontational. It was time for Anders Fogh Rasmussen to take an aggressive stance, and rein in the strays. He'd done so often before, in crisis situations, by forcefully attacking political opponents as well as any voices of dissent within his own party ranks. As brutal as this approach often seemed, it usually worked, leaving his opponents cowed and their criticisms forgotten or overshadowed. In late February, he decided to once more go on the offensive. It was to be one of the most potentially self-destructive decisions of his political career. Speaking with the pro-government newspaper Berlingske Tidende on February 26, Fogh Rasmussen strongly criticised both the PEN club and the media in Denmark, for failing to take a stand against Islamic aggression. He was especially vitriolic towards the \"intellectual elite\" who had \"failed to defend the free speech that they made their own living off\". It was his stated opinion that the intellectuals and the media, \"motivated by distaste for the Danish People's Party, for Jyllands-Posten, and for the government\" had let themselves be guided by their own prejudice into adopting a double standard. Referring to the matter of his failure to fully inform the Folketing's committee on foreign affairs (see part 6), he remarked that this was an immaterial matter in the face of the scale of the emergency. This, too, was a standard crisis management tactic used by Fogh Rasmussen -- ignoring scandals to begin with, and when they could not be ignored, not denying them, but adopting a \"pragmatic\" attitude that they were minor compared to the \"real issues\". Attacking the media and the intellectual elite was standard fare for Fogh Rasmussen. What was not so common was the fact that, lumped in with these two groups, he also accused the Danish companies operating in the Middle East of being \"unprincipled\", and sacrificing civil rights for monetary gain. To the Danish companies (which were frantically scrambling to salvage their markets from the long term political and economic fallout of Fogh's catastrophic decision to \"tough it out\" with the Muslim ambassadors), this attack was shocking. After all, the Danish government was considered to be pro-business, and the Danish mercantile/industrial sector were the financial backers of both government parties. Not unreasonably, this attack was received by Danish industrialists as an act of rank disloyalty. The very next day, Niels Due Jensen, chairman of the board of directors of the Danish company Grundfos, responded sharply to Fogh's comments, in the pages of Jyllands-Posten. Grundfos, the world's leading producer of pumps, naturally had strong economic interests in the oil-producing Middle East. Niels Due Jensen had previously called for Jyllands-Posten to apologize, and clearly felt that the prime minister's remarks were aimed at him (among others). In an unusually direct statement, Due Jensen said: \"B\u00e5de statsministeren dem selv. Vi den the prime minister and Jyllands-Posten have totally lost contact with reality in the Muhammed case. For the sake of principle one fights for freedom of speech. That's all right, but when one simultaneously offends millions of other people with it, it is no longer all right. {...} \"I strongly disagree with the prime minister's criticism -- and furthermore, with the criticism that is continually made by Jyllands-Posten of Danes and business leaders who have a different opinion than they do. We have freedom of speech in Denmark, however unpopular it may be. Jyllands-Posten is selective in its view on freedom of speech. People with differing opinions are {verbally, ed.} beaten up and ridiculed by Jyllands-Posten. This should be beneath their dignity.\") Another Danish business leader, Hans Skov Christensen, CEO of The Confederation of Danish Industries (DI, Dansk Industri), had also previously called for an apology, but disingenuously claimed not to feel targeted by Fogh Rasmussen's criticism. DI had always been in line with government policies, he diplomatically remarked. But in many sectors of business, irritation with the PM's remarks was evident. As several sources put it, the government had all along made strong efforts to salvage Danish business interests in the affected regions, and had cautioned everyone against confrontational policies -- it seemed unreasonable to turn around and attack the businessmen for keeping a low, non-confrontational profile, as they had been instructed to by the government. On several separate levels, the decision to attack Danish businessmen for their supposed lack of principles was a major blunder by Fogh Rasmussen. Whether or not the accusation was true, Fogh seemed to have forgotten that the businesses represented the political and financial base of support of both the government parties. On the one hand, the PM's own party, Venstre, was originally largely an agrarian party. Though the agricultural lobby had become less important, they were still a significant part of Venstre's constituency. Furthermore, Venstre's political platform was poro-business and strongly in favour of free markets. Attacking the major agricultural and industrial exporters meant attacking his own supporters. It couldn't help but be seen as a major breach of confidence. Similarly, the Conservative Party, Fogh Rasmussen's much-neglected and abused junior partners in government, were very strongly involved with Danish mercantile and industrial interests. For them, being involved in Fogh Rasmussen's attack on business leaders meant being tarred with the same brush, without the compensation of being viewed as \"taking a stand on principle\". They were being taken along for the ride, with or without their consent, and the ticket price was getting expensive.

It is often the case with quotations that they are taken out of context, but I've tried not to abuse this, and I've sourced them all as carefully as possible. Here you go: \"Evil forces journeyed out on a tour of the Muslim world. The Islamic Society in Denmark, with the imam Abu Laban at their head, spread lying and spiteful propaganda against the country that has received them with open arms. That the case has developed into an international conflict is solely due to deliberately misrepresented messages regarding both Jyllands-Posten and the government, as well as the Danish People's Party. And look at the mess it has gotten us into...\" - Pia Kj\u00e6rsgaard, Danish MP and leader of Dansk Folkeparti (Danish People's Party), writing in her weekly newsletter, January 30 2006. An interesting quotation, that illustrates the way the xenophobes in Denmark choose to interpret the affair. One can't help but note the use of the word \"evil\" and the phrase \"welcomed with open arms\" (here used in contrast, to illustrate how ungrateful and perfidious the imams supposedly are). \"If anyone should apologise, it is Saudi Arabia. Apologise for its open contempt of human rights, its scorn for freedom of religious expression, and its systematic repression of equal rights. {...} Saudi Arabia should be ashamed of itself, and an apology for offending that country with satirical drawings amounts to falling at the knees of fundamentalism. My message to Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries that joined the boycott is: You insult my democratic conviction. Say sorry.\" - Naser Khader, Danish MP for Radikale Venstre (Danish Social Liberal Party), writing in the Danish daily Berlingske Tidende, January 31 2006. \"...in the Muslim world, we are not used to laughing at religion, our own or anybody else's. This is far from our understanding. For that reason, these cartoons are seen, by average Muslims and not just radicals, as a transgression against something sacred, a provocation against Islam.\" - Tariq Ramadan, in the International Herald Tribune, February 5 2006. \"Fogh is dead in Europe. From now on, he's just the guy with the Muhammad case.\" - Anonymous source close to Danish PM Anders Fogh Rasmussen, quoted in the Danish daily Berlingske Tidende, March 19 2006, describing the remoteness of Fogh Rasmussen's chances of ever getting an important position in an international organisation after his eventual retirement. I'm generally unhappy with using anonymous sources, but this one was just too good to leave out. Also, please note that Berlingske Tidende is a conservative paper that is usually extremely supportive of Anders Fogh Rasmussen and his government. \"We regret that there has been this misunderstanding. It was never our intention. We're sorry that it has caused these hurt feelings and offense in Denmark. {...} It was never our intention to link Denmark and racism, or LEGO and racism in this way.\" - Jos\u00e9 Luis D\u00edaz, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to Danish television channel DR, March 21 2006, in response to Danish outrage at an anti-racism poster produced by the UN, using a LEGO brick, a poster that had been perceived in Denmark as a comment on the \"Cartoon Row\" (even though the UN had previously used LEGO in the context of posters, e.g. for the UNHCR's series of \"LEGO refugee\" posters, in 1994 & 1997). Apparently, the UN has no difficulty apologising over hurting people's feelings, intentionally or otherwise. Perhaps Anders Fogh Rasmussen could take a hint from this. That's what I have to offer, this time. I'll return, soon, with another installment in my series of articles on that great soap opera of our times, the \"Cartoon Row\". Technorati tags: denmark, politics, cartoon row, current affairs, freedom of speech, islam, quotations, xenophobia Monday, March 20, 2006 The \"Cartoon Row\" dissected -- part 7 (continued from Part 6) As February 2006 drew to a close, the domestic political situation for the government of Anders Fogh Rasmussen was essentially unchanged. The opposition had at no time managed to muster a united stance on the issue of the caricatures. The major opposition party, the Social Democrats, was leery of seeming too \"immigrant-friendly\", knowing that this would cost them votes to their main competition, the xenophobic Danish People's Party (Dansk Folkeparti). It may seem strange that voters would jump from a center-left party to a party that is often perceived as an extreme-right party. However, the situation is less clear-cut than that. The Danish People's Party appeals to voters not only on a xenophobic platform, but also with a centrist pro-welfare agenda which is at odds with the Liberalist-Conservative government of Anders Fogh Rasmussen, but which is very close to the Social Democratic agenda. As a result, the jump from Social Democrat to DPP is a short one, requiring only a xenophobic shift. The opinion polls supported this view; in late October 2005, before the crisis developed, the Social Democrats mustered the support of 22.5% of the voters, and the DPP were at 12.8%. A month later, in mid-November, both parties had gained slightly, as the initial stage of the crisis polarised opinions for and against xenophobia. The Social Democrats were now at 26.2% and the DPP at 14.0%. However, as the crisis wore on, and the Danish public began to feel more and more beleaguered by what they viewed as an essentially unfair foe, the opinion polls shifted. As the Social Democrats continued to lie low, they lost any initiative, and this showed in the polls. By mid-February 2006, they were down to 21.8%, and the DPP was up to a remarkable 17.8%, their largest voter support ever. Clearly, the DPP were gaining as a result of a public perception that they represented a \"tough stance\" on \"Islamic aggression\" towards a Denmark that increasingly considered itself the wronged party. Equally clearly, the Social Democrats were losing through lack of leadership. A strategy of \"borgfred\" was announced early on, but only served to make the Social Democrats look ineffectual. Borgfred (literally, \"peace in the castle\") is a Danish political term that stems from the fact that the seat of parliament is Christiansborg Palace, and which means that the opposition refrains from attacking the government in a time of national crisis, as a matter of good conduct. Worse still, when Anders Fogh Rasmussen failed to reciprocate by not attacking the opposition, this failed strategy gave him the initiative. Even worse, the Social Democrats couldn't \"reopen hostilities\" without seeming unpatriotic and petty. For the Social Democrats, it was a no-win situation. Not so for the opposition Danish Social Liberal Party (Radikale Venstre), which had previously made working for a stable multi-ethnic Danish society a key plank of their platform, and which included a number of prominent moderate Muslims in their ranks. For the DSLP, the situation was a gift, and their polls reflected this. In late October 2005, they stood at 9.6% voter support, slightly above their latest election result of 9.2%). By mid-November, they had dropped back a bit, but as they began to make their position known, they made great advances. By mid-February 2006, they stood at 12.1% voter support, a respectable advance. One strong influence on this advance was that of the prominent Muslim member of the DSLP, Naser Khader. In response to the crisis, he had been instrumental in forming a moderate Muslim political network, Demokratiske Muslimer (\"Democratic Muslims\"), which strove to bring a moderate Muslim viewpoint to the debate, both in Denmark and in the Islamic world. The DSLP's stance on the crisis was strongly disapproving of the government's handling of the process, but equally critical of the motives behind the protests in the Islamic countries. In a statement issued by the party's parliamentarians on February 22 2006, the criticism rained heavily on both sides: \"Uanset om man er enig \"Vi tegninger og tekst, der provokerer og dag. Men vi har ogs\u00e5 selv ret til at have en mening og ytre os om det, vi l\u00e6ser i en avis. Det er vel det, der er meningen med af Dannebrog.\" (\"Whether or not one agrees or disagrees with the 11 ambassador's letter to the government, democracy presupposes freedom of speech, equality and dialogue. When 11 ambassadors ask for a meeting, they represent 11 governments. It is therefore a diplomatic provocation in itself to refuse the request for a meeting. The refusal also becomes a refusal of dialogue and gives the appearance of a lack of respect for equality. \"There are many agendas behind the events that have developed like a bushfire in the Muslim countries. We support the government's efforts to bring the unrest to an end, and we strongly deplore the burning of embassies and threats towards Danes. We also deplore all extremists who have contributed to bringing the development out of control. \"We agree that JP [= Jyllands-Posten] has the right to publish illustrations and text that provoke and test limits. That right to freedom of speech is something that we will defend every day. But we also have the right to have an opinion about what we read in a newspaper. Isn't that what the intent of the provocations in JP, among others, is? \"The integration of Muslims in Denmark does not proceed through 'scorn, mockery and ridicule', which was part of JP's justification for the drawings. [RP's note: this was, in fact, a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of JP's original article, which merely said that any religion must be willing to put up with these things in a free society] And we definitely do not care for the hatred that is shown by burning the Danish flag.\" The DSLP, thus, were profiling themselves as the party of choice for moderates who supported multi-ethnic society, and showing a demonstratively even-handed attitude of disdain towards extremists on both sides. Other parties had a less clear stance. The voter support of the Danish Liberal Party (Venstre), the party of the prime minister, made no significant advances during the period, nor did they suffer any significant losses. This was probably the net result of losing one set of voters and gaining another (those who didn't care for Fogh Rasmussen's arrogant approach to the crisis, and those who approved of it). On the other hand, the supporting government party, the Conservatives, suffered a slight setback, probably for the same reason as the Social Democrats. The Conservatives had never been politically far from the Social Democrats, since the two parties represented more or less moderate mirror images, on either side of the center. As a result, they had the same weaknesses to the DPP's magnetic effect on the more xenophobic voters. The most interesting party to study, in the polls, was the tiny Christian Democratic Party (Kristendemokraterne). In a time of crisis coloured by religion, one would think that this party, ever a marginal presence in Danish politics, would profit in the polls. Not so, however. Only minor deviations took place in their poll results throughout the period. It should be remarked, in this context, that the semi-official stance of the Christian Democrats was in support of the Muslim moral outrage at the caricatures, on the grounds that they were offensive to people of faith, whatever the faith. The Christian Democratic view was that the caricatures marked a secular lack of understanding of the very concept of anything being sacred and beyond mockery. This may be taken as indicating that the focus of the crisis, as least in the minds of the voters of Denmark, was not a religious struggle between Christians and Muslims, but a cultural clash. It was a collision between the cultural background and expectations of the (secularised and Western) nation of Denmark, and the cultural background and expectations of the (religious and Middle Eastern) Muslim communities in Denmark -- a collision that grew to involve other nations as well. Hence, instead of moving their votes to the Christian Democrats, the voters shifted to the DPP, whose xenophobia were more clearly culturally oriented than religious.

Milliseconds can mean the difference between triumph and defeat in the world of Olympic sports, leading more trainers and athletes to look toward technology as a tool to get an edge on the competition. A fluids mechanics professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., is using experimental flow measurement techniques to help American swimmers sharpen their strokes, shave seconds from their lap times, and race toward a gold medal in Beijing. Professor Timothy Wei, head of Rensselaer's Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering and acting dean of the university's School of Engineering, helped develop top-secret, state-of-the-art equipment and mathematical techniques that USA Swimming coaches have been using to help train Olympians. \"This is the real thing,\" Wei said. \"We have the physical system, we're taking flow measurements of actual swimmers, and we're getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water. And so far, these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of Olympic swimmers.\" In years past, swimming coaches have used computer modeling and simulation to hone the techniques of athletes. But Wei developed state-of-the-art water flow diagnostic technologies, modifying and combining force measurement tools developed for aerospace research with a video-based flow measurement technique known as Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV), in order to create a robust training tool that reports the performance of a swimmer in real-time. \"This project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact,\" said USA Swimming Coach Sean Hutchison. \"The knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the Beijing Olympics was based.\" Watch one of the videos, of 2008 Olympian Megan Jendrick, below.

After Dr. Ivins killed himself, possibly due to the pressure the FBI was placing on him, the task force release some of the accumulated documents, pointing to Dr. Ivins as the anthrax mailer, who injured 17 and killed 5. Scientists who worked with Dr. Ivins and those in the same field think the evidence is not as airtight as the government would have us believe. REALscience will stay with this story and follow the science leads to try to answer the big questions in this case.

Capell, NHGRI Some of the top scientific minds met at University of Washington last spring. Their purpose-to discuss the future of personal genomics. They met on the eve of the passage of the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act. MIT biology professor Eric Lander, The Wellcome Trust's Dr. Leena Peltonen, Bill Gates III, and Harvard Geneticist George Church discussed the state of the science. Dr. Maynard Olson moderated the panel as they discussed the implications of knowing genetic predispositions for disease, talked about ways to get the public more engaged and, they shared whether or not they each had their genome sequenced or would if the chance arose. Bill Gates, through his foundation, is trying to find cures to what ails us. He's taking on malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases that kill millions every year. With better understanding of genes and our whole genetic map-our genomes-he says we can eradicate these global killers.

But a large ice shelf in Antarctica has been shrinking rapidly even though its wintertime down under. The Wilkins Ice Shelf is \"hanging on by a thread\" or an ice bridge right now. And, it could break apart at any time. This has scientists concerned because there is no evidence of an ice shelf ever melting during the winter.

Now a consortium of researchers in Florida and the United Kingdom is trying to wrestle power from the Gulf Stream, the fast-moving warm water current that stretches from Key West to Kensington.

Brain Asexy Beast AVEN EarthAngel's GLBT \u2014 Nat @ 9:15 am Fellow intersex blogger Zoe Brain has recently alerted me to the fact that being someone's intersexed status may not open their minds to gender variations. So here we have people that are living in physical bodies that blur the line between male and female, and yet feel that transgendered people are encroaching on the \"true\" intersexed with their claims that transgender is genetic or biological. HELLO?! Why are we fighting over this? Is it not a good thing for transgender to be recognised as nature rather than nurture? It doesn't hurt intersex as far as I can see, and in fact it ties in with all the intersexed people that feel they are one gender over the other - is that not some form of transgender? A cisgender intersex would, in theory, be intergendered. So any intersexed person that just knows they are a man or just knows they are a womyn deep down despite their body betraying them, should surely know the transgender plight... because that's what transgender is. Share This Comments (29) 2 May, 2008 The odds of my existence Filed under: Information \u2014 Nat @ 8:28 pm I decided to do a little number crunching (I hate maths but I'm not terrible at it) to analyse how rare an asexual person with complete gonadal dysgenesis and six toes really is. Incidence of Complete Gonadal Dysgenesis: 1 in 150,000 (0.00067%) [1] Incidence of Asexuality (estimate): 1% [3] Combine these? Let's see if I can figure this out. The population of the world is approximately 6,660,000,000. 1% is 66,600,000. 0.0374% of that is 2,490,840. 0.00067% of that is 1,669. That means there are about 1,669 people like me in the world, of all ages and ethnicities. That is 0.000025% of the world's population, or one in 3,990,413. I'm not just one in a million... I'm one in four million. Please, if you are a mathematician and I got something wrong, do say so. I haven't done anything particularly mathematical since I was sixteen. Share This Comments (3) 30 April, 2008 Raloxifene: Could this be my answer? Filed under: General \u2014 Nat @ 10:49 am I've been searching for a product that will remove my risk of brittle bones while maintaining my androgynous figure. Could this drug, Raloxifene, be my answer? It is a substance that acts like estrogen in the maintenance of bones and yet has an \"anti-oestrogenic\" action in the breasts and uterus. The apparent side effects include leg cramps, hot flashes and mild risk of deep vein thrombosis and a few other bloodstream related issues. Not that Premarin doesn't have side effects just as bad. So basically, this could be like having my cake and eating it too. If nothing else it would keep me safe (in fact, help fix my osteopenia) while I really weighed up whether I want to be female or not. Has anyone heard of this drug before? Apparently it's fairly new, less than 10 years of being available to the general population. It has been available in Australia since 1999. My main concern is, what do I tell my endocrinologist? I guess I don't have to take her advice if I don't feel it's right for me. I'm just really shy. I guess my good excuse is that when I get back to Australia, I will be living an hour's drive from her, giving me a reason to stop seeing her once she gets me my gonadectomy. Anyway this is still speculation. I don't know much about the drug, but I think it would be my best shot at maintaining a neutrois identity and not suffering for it. Share This Comments (1) 24 April, 2008 Life Story Filed under: General \u2014 Nat @ 6:55 am Do you think if I wrote a graphic novel about my life people would buy it?

The honor of the the officer corps has been weakened. Over the weekend, Galrahn at Information Dissemination broke the news that the new DDG-1000 Zumwalt class of destroyers were designed without capability for area air defense, a fatal flaw in the design of the ship. I have been silent on this topic for a couple of days, hoping my anger to settle somewhat, but it hasn't. This is a massive failure of the American officer corps.

I observed that everybody believed that he thought as he spoke, and that in all that he did he never had any bad intention; and he never showed amazement and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a thing, nor was perplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his aggravation, nor, on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious. He was accustomed to do acts of beneficence and was ready to forgive, and was free from all falsehood; and he presented the appearance of a man who could not be diverted from right rather than of a man who had been improved. I observed, too, that no man could ever think that he was despised by Maximus, or ever venture to think that himself a better man. He had also the art of being humorous in an agreeable way. Marcus Aurelius, The Meditations, I:15 There are few figures like Maximus alive today. Where do we find them? I think many of them are found in our resolute, obedient, and loyal enlisted force. They do their required tasks without fanfare and drama. Their stiff upper lips are tribute to their virtue. There are surely other figures in the mold of Maximus in the world. Where are they?

New Reading List Posted August 3, 2008 Filed under: Books, Military | Tags: Hammes, Professionalim, Reading Comments(5) Col Tom Hammes, of the Marines, has published a new reading list in Armed Forces Journal. These books will undoubtedly be added to my personal reading program. I have seen Col Hammes speak. He gave a seminar to my unit back in 2004 on 4GW, although I think that most of the officers in attendance weren't intellectually equipped to handle what Hammes had to say. I impugn their lack of professionalism and lack of a personal program of independent study. I will publish my personal reading list when I have completed it for public consumption. The Hammes list is here. Zen wrote about it here, too.

Command Climate in the Air Force Posted July 19, 2008 Filed under: Military | Tags: Command Climate, Discipline, Govt Waste, Military, Professionalism, US Air Force Comments(3) When I took command my first platoon in 2003, my unit commander, LtCol C., having just returned from the Invasion of Iraq (OIF I), sat me down in his office and told me the most difficult part of command: Setting an effective Command Climate. What is Command Climate? I don't think it's really definable, but suffice to say that it's the force that a commander exudes that causes his charges to make a particular decision without specific guidance. For a platoon commander, this force impacts the Marine's efforts at basic things like equipment maintenance, physical training, making safe decisions when off duty, etc. These aren't usually life-or-death decisions, but when added together, they have a great effect on discipline, morale, health, and effectiveness of a unit. Command Climate is the thing that guides a Marine when he has to make a decision, and the pluses and minuses of that decision cancel each other out, leading the Marine to think, \"Damn it, Cpl X, or Sgt Y, or MSgt Z, or Lt. SE would want me to do this, so I'm going to do it.\" Simply put, Command Climate is a sort of peer pressure that's exerted on a unit by the Commander. Command Climate can be positive or negative. While it is a truism that the bottom 25% of any group will take up 75% of a leader's time, it also seems to be true that 75% of the problems in a group of units seem to come from only 25% of those units. Strong leaders create Command Climates that solve and mitigate problems. Poor leaders create Command Climates that create and worsen problems. And so it appears to be so with the US Air Force. Today, the Washington Post reported: \"The Air Force's top leadership sought for three years to spend counterterrorism funds on \"comfort capsules\" to be installed on military planes that ferry senior officers and civilian leaders around the world, with at least four top generals involved in design details such as the color of the capsules' carpet and leather chairs, according to internal e-mails and budget documents.\" Read more \u00bb Friday War Picture (Updated) Posted July 18, 2008 Filed under: Friday War Picture, Military, War | Tags: Military, Picture, World War I Comments(5) Members of the Czechoslovak Legion in Vladivostok, 1918.

From the press release: \"In Gods We Trust,\" Andrew Schoultz's first solo exhibition at Marx & Zavattero in San Francisco, will be a tour de force encompassing an expansive group of two- and three-dimensional works. Against the backdrop of Schoultz's densely painted mixed media paintings on panel and paper will be large-scale painted sculptures \u2014 including scales of justice, splintered telephone poles, and debris of broken bridges \u2014 installed throughout the gallery. Schoultz will create a frenzied walk-through experience, placing the viewer inside the work virtually as a participant, and translate his ideas into a theater of chaos that speaks to the multifarious global issues that plague the world today. \"In Gods We Trust\" opens on Thu., Sep. 4, 5:30p.m.-7:30p.m. Show runs all the way through Oct. 25.

NotEng NotCS CS The Seeks Calls for v Democracy], Bloody Of Islamofascism], [Another Book Banned by Islamists] The Amboy Times Digital Handbill August 12, 2008 Bush warns Russia, negotiations begin Bush talks, Russia listens?President Bush consulted Tuesday with fellow leaders in Eastern and Western Europe about the crisis in the former Soviet republic of Georgia while aides scrambled to evaluate a Russian promise to stop attacking its neighbor. The White House also rejected a Russian call for Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili to step down. Earlier, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev ordered a halt to its military action in Georgia, saying the campaign had brought security in its South Ossetia region that is close to Moscow. According to my atlas, Moscow is over 1000 miles from South Ossetia, about the same distance as Berlin, another former Soviet satellite. \"The aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses. Its military has been disorganized,\" Medvedev said in a nationally televised statement. His order came just hours after Bush's strongest statement on the fighting since it began at the end of last week. He demanded that Russia withdraw its troops from Georgia, end what he called a \"dramatic and brutal escalation\" of violence, and accept international mediation to end the crisis. Bush said Russia's actions had \"substantially damaged Russia's standing in the world.\" With Georgia insisting that Russian forces were still bombing and shelling, White House spokesman Tony Fratto said Tuesday it was too early to comment on Medvedev's move. \"We are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place, of course,\" the spokesman added. The Telegraph has excellent coverage of the Russian advance. Now Russia wants to be rewarded for their aggression, and not with just South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Russia wants a buffer zone around these enclaves, from which all Georgian forces will be excluded, and is demanding that Georgia give a signed pledge never to use force in the regions again. With his Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner, Mr Sarkozy will now place these terms before President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia. After suffering five days of Russian onslaught, Georgia's beleaguered leader may have little choice but to agree. Speaking at a joint news conference with Mr Sarkozy, the Russian President, Dmitry Medvedev, insisted his forces would remain in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. \"That has been the case and that will continue to be the case,\" Mr Medvedev said. President Medvedev said the EU peace plan contained \"good principles to settle the problem,\" but that Russia would also add proposals and that it was \"up to Georgia now\". He said that President Saakashvili, whom he described as a \"lunatic,\" had lied about his side's respect for a ceasefire during the conflict. Ceasefire? However, over half an hour after Mr Medvedev gave his ceasefire order, The Daily Telegraph saw three Russian helicopters fire nine missiles at targets 25 miles north of Tbilisi. It was not immediately clear what they were shooting at. \"Despite the Russian president's claims earlier this morning that military operations against Georgia have been suspended, at this moment, Russian fighter jets are bombarding two Georgian villages outside South Ossetia,\" the Georgian government said. Now the question remains, if Russia succeeds in it's quest for Georgian territory today, what's to stop the hungry bear from gobbling up more 'buffer zones' tomorrow? AQ in Iraq bans Cucumbers Hat tip, Trad.Al-Qa'eda is losing support in Iraq because of a brutal crackdown on activities it regards as un-Islamic - including women buying cucumbers So, what happens if sharia is taken to the Wahhabist extreme? Besides the terrible killings inflicted by the fanatics on those who refuse to pledge allegiance to them, Al-Qa'eda has lost credibility for enforcing a series of rules imposing their way of thought on the most mundane aspects of everyday life. They include a ban on women buying suggestively-shaped vegetables, according to one tribal leader in the western province of Anbar. Women can't but cucumbers because they're too sexy. Sheikh Hameed al-Hayyes, a Sunni elder, told Reuters: \"They even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward, which they said was haram. Goats have to wear panties. \"They regarded the cucumber as male and tomato as female. Women were not allowed to buy cucumbers, only men.\" Vegetables become genitalia. Other farcical stipulations include an edict not to buy or sell ice-cream, because it did not exist in the time of the Prophet, while hair salons and shops selling cosmetics have also been bombed. Ice cream, hair styling and cosmetics are verboten. Most seriously, Sheikh al-Hayyes said: \"I saw them slaughter a nine-year old boy like a sheep because his family didn't pledge allegiance to them.\" Children are murdered. Such tactics have triggered a backlash among Sunnis, whom Al-Q'aeda had claimed to be protecting, the sheikh and military leaders said. Lieutenant-Colonel Tim Albers, an American intelligence officer, told the news agency: \"Al-Qa'eda's very heavy-handed killing of civilians backfired on them. The Sunnis just wouldn't stand for it any more. \"The self-described protectors of the Sunni community now kill more Iraqi Sunnis than anyone else.\" Killing their own, they lose the war. August 11, 2008 Georgia Seeks US Help The Russian blitz continues.Times of London-As a Russian jet bombed fields around his village, Djimali Avago, a Georgian farmer, asked me: \"Why won't America and Nato help us? If they won't help us now, why did we help them in Iraq?\" A similar sense of betrayal coursed through the conversations of many Georgians here yesterday as their troops retreated under shellfire and the Russian Army pressed forward to take full control of South Ossetia. Smoke rose as Russian artillery fire exploded less than half a mile from the bridge marking South Ossetia's border with Georgia. A group of Georgian soldiers hastily abandoned their lorry after its wheels were shot out and ran across the border. (...) President Saakashvili of Georgia has ordered a complete ceasefire and offered talks to the Russians. Despite this, the sound of gunfire and shelling could be clearly heard along the border zone last night. Terrified civilians have fled in their thousands, convinced that Russia will not stop at the border but sweep into Georgia. Some fear that the Kremlin is intent on establishing a buffer zone to guard South Ossetia against future incursions. (...) The Georgian Government is recalling its 2,000 troops serving in Iraq to confront the threat at home. Many Georgians will be reluctant to send them back after this war ends. Their despair was in sharp contrast to the confidence on the other side. At a base near the border, Russian peacekeepers appeared sure they would soon be joined by comrades from the regular army. \"We are operating normally; nobody has disturbed us at all,\" said one. In Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, refugees from the fighting told how Russian helicopters bombed homes in Tshkinvali and neighbouring villages. Some spent days in basements before emerging to discover that their communities had been obliterated. Mzia Sabashvili, who hid for three days, said: \"I know that lots of my neighbours are dead. I have no idea who is left.\" Bush Expresses Concern. \"I've expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of Russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of South Ossetia,\" Bush said in an interview with NBC Sports. In turn, Putin criticized the United States for airlifting Georgian troops back home from Iraq on Sunday at Georgia's request. \"It's a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way,\" Putin said at a Cabinet meeting. \"I mean among other things the United States airlifting Georgia's military contingent from Iraq effectively into the conflict zone.\" Putin Continues to strike beyond South Ossetia. The Georgian president said Russian warplanes were bombing roads and bridges, destroying radar systems Monday and targeting Tbilisi's civilian airport Sunday night. One Russian bombing raid struck the Tbilisi airport area just a half-hour before the EU envoys arrived, he said. Georgia said another hit Friday near the key Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, which carries Caspian crude to the West. No supply interruptions have been reported and Russia denies targeting the pipeline. While not addressing reports of the incursion near Gori, Nogovitsyn, the Russian general, said Russia had no intention to move deeper into Georgia. \"We aren't planning any offensive,\" he said.

August 10, 2008 Georgia's President Calls for Ceasefire The Russians claim they just want to help the separatists in South Ossetia. But if you look at the map, the attacks cover much of country, including pipelines that supply 1% of the world's oil supply. It's hard to believe the Russia's superior forces couldn't secure South Ossetia without crippling the entire Georgian economy. Daily Mail-Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili called for a ceasefire and accused Moscow of mounting an unprovoked invasion that put 'the entire post-Cold War order of Europe and the world at stake'. But Moscow said that the conflict could not be resolved unless Georgia withdrew from its breakaway region of South Ossetia. The alarming developments followed a second day of drama and bloodshed in the pro-Western country in which: Russian jets widened the offensive by bombing the central Georgian town of Gori - Joseph Stalin's birthplace - in an attack on military targets that Georgian authorities claimed killed 60 civilians, and attacked the port of Poti. Georgia claimed that Russian troops had opened a new front by moving into another disputed province, Abkhazia, which has also suffered from ethnic tensions. Georgia declared a state of war, recalled all its 2,000 troops from Iraq and ordered a mass call-up with reservists being sent to the war zone to 'defend the motherland'. Russia claimed that it had 'completely liberated' the capital of South Ossetia Tskhinvali - a claim denied by Georgia - after flying in elite troops in an operation Moscow said was intended to force Georgia into a ceasefire. Georgia claimed to have shot down 12 Russian combat aircraft - but Moscow confirmed that only two planes were missing. Georgia may pull its 35-strong Olympic team out of the Beijing games because of the Russian military attacks, the country's National Olympic Committee said. The Russians are asking the Georgian government to withdraw from their own territory.Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has announced the recall of the country's entire contingent in Iraq to return home to fight against Russia. The Georgian President made the remarks at a Tbilisi meeting with members of the Georgian opposition. Reports says Russian jets have bombed a Georgian town amid the deepening crisis over the breakaway South Ossetia region. (click to enlarge) As you can see, the air strikes in Poti are about as far from South Ossetia as one can get, and Georgia's tiny military is grossly over matched. Russia's invasion of Georgia strikes a blow to the West on many levels. In addition to the aforementioned oil pipeline, support in Iraq of 2000 troops, and attempts to join NATO make the tiny former province of the USSR an irresistible target for Putin. (...) the Georgian parliament has approved a presidential decree declaring a state of war for 15 days against Russia. Meanwhile, at the Olympics...In Beijing, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was seen to approach President Bush in the Olympic stadium, where they were attending the opening ceremony. The Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he witnessed a heated discussion between the two leaders. 'The President and Mr Putin were in an animated conversation two seats in front of us and I imagine they had a few things on their agenda,' he said. Mr Putin later accused Georgia of seeking 'bloody adventures' and trying to drag other countries into a military conflict in South Ossetia. 'Georgia's aspiration to join Nato... is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures,' Mr Putin said during a meeting in the Russian city of Vladikavkaz, some of which was shown on TV. It appears the Russians are using a divide and conquer strategy to restore it's USSR borders. Global Security-The military actions in South Ossetia are not just a confrontation between Georgia and its breakaway republic, says Viktor Mizin, a political analyst from the Institute of Strategic Assessment in Moscow. \"What we see here is not just a confrontation of minor republics but probably the confrontation between, I am sorry to say that, Moscow and the entire West because now Russia is basically protecting its clients and its own citizens. Up to 80 per cent of South Ossetian population have Russian passports,\" Mizin says. GS also has background on Abkhazia. Strategypage has more background and an update on the Russia/Georgia conflict. August 08, 2008 Russia Invades Georgia On the opening day of the Olympics no less.Russia sent forces into Georgia on Friday to repel a Georgian assault on the breakaway South Ossetia region and Georgia's pro-Western president said the two countries were at war. South Ossetia's rebel leader Eduard Kokoity said there were \"hundreds of dead civilians\" in the main town Tskhinvali, Russia's Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. A senior Russian military commander said parts of Russia's 58th army were approaching the rebel capital, where fighting raged between Russian-backed separatists and Georgian forces sent in on Friday to seize it.

The US Olympic team has chosen a Jihad survivor, Lopez Lomong, to carry the American flag in China, which sponsors ethnic cleansing in his native Sudan through oil purchases and arms sales. At the age of 6, Lomong was among 100 children kidnapped from a church service by Islam's Holy Warriors duirng a Religion of Peace raping and killing spree. I've had mixed feelings about the Olympics taking place in China. But after seeing this story, I've decided that Jesse Owens' medals in Berlin are a greater victory than Carter's boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Carter's boycott showed disapproval and little else. The absence of boycotting countries just enabled the Communist nation to gather more medals and toot their own horn. Jesse Owens' four gold medals sent a clear message to Hitler's master race in his own backyard that ethnic Africans were not inferior. Decades later, we are still struggling against oppressive and violent totalitarian ideologies. Lomong's presence is a stark reminder that we will not be silenced by terrorism, but we will rise up victoriously. That trumps a boycott in my book.

August 07, 2008 Nissan offends Muslims For those of us who are sick of high gas prices and aware of the added sting that the House Of Saud exports Wahhabism, sharia and jihad along with crude oil, this commercial is pretty funny. JW-Gulf states are threatening to boycott Nissan. The reason? A new Nissan commercial airing in Israel has offended the oil-rich Arabs. The commercial depicts a group of robe-flowing sheikhs walking out of a building only to encounter the new Nissan Tiida car, touted for its fuel efficiency. The Saudis slowly walk towards the vehicle, and then begin abusing it -- first verbally then physically. One Saudi shouts \"You've ruined my house!\" (colloquial Arabic for \"You've put me out of business!\"). As he's being carried away, he hollers one last curse, literally: \"May Abu Tiida be cursed!\" Since \"Abu\" means \"father that's another way of saying, \"May Nissan be cursed,\" as the Japanese company is \"father\" to the model (pretty slick marketing move, portraying Nissan as the solution for high oil prices). According to the Jerusalem Post, one Arab official, Hani al-Wafa, speaking on Saudi TV, said: \"It's my opinion that Nissan made a huge error by igniting these [racist] instincts. \"We need to apply punishments... against these things. In order for Nissan to keep its interests in the region, it must apologize.\" I Imagine Nissan will probably pull the ad and perhaps even apologize for the typical PC reasons. But the message is out, when you buy a Nissan Tiida is doing a lot more than just saving money at the pump, you're keeping more of your money in the free world. Chavez v Democracy Once again, Hugo Chavez continues to choke the voice of the people. Riot police used tear gas Wednesday to block hundreds of Venezuelans protesting the latest moves by President Hugo Chavez to concentrate his power. The demonstrators said a blacklist of opposition candidates and a series of socialist decrees are destroying what's left of their democracy. Though the protest of about 1,000 people chanting \"freedom!\" was small compared to past marches, there is a growing public outcry over the sidelining of key government opponents ahead of state and local elections in November. Chavez opponents also are outraged by 26 laws the president just decreed, some of them mirroring the socialist measures voters rejected in a December referendum. \"We said in the referendum that we didn't want that, and now he's put it in the decrees,\" said protester Josefina Bravo, a 59-year-old who wore a sticker reading \"No means no\" on her baseball cap. \"That's the problem we have: All the powers are concentrated in the president.\" This is what I said last November in response to Chavez's troops gunning down student protesters. Back in May I said, Chavez is predictably carrying out what America's left habitually accuses Republicans of doing, silencing the opposition with an iron fist. Socialism always ends up having to clamp down on it's critics in order to stay in power, just ask the Cubans. The clampdown continues, and I promise you it will get worse before it gets better. I'm really getting tired of being right about Chavez, but such is socialism. August 06, 2008 CAIR's Corey Saylor: Hiding The Bloody Truth Of Islamofascism Another Anti-CAIR Blogburst.\"may unintentionally legitimize Al Qaeda Corey Saylor, national legislative director for the terrorist front organization, CAIR, recently wrote an op-ed in hopes of fooling the public that an amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act offered by Rep. Pete Hoekstra: and other anti-American forces\" Saylor, a key member of CAIR; an organization founded by members of the anti-American Islamic terrorist group Hamas, says the amendment, which passed by a 249-180 vote, needs to be reconsidered. Why? Apparently, Saylor believes 'Islamist,' or 'Islamic terrorist' should instead be replaced by language that describes Islamic terrorists as 'thugs\" and 'criminals'. Could it be that Saylor's leash-holders in Hamas find the terms used in the amendment just a bit too close to describing the Islamist ideology? Or is it more likely that CAIR members and officers have been known to share the ideals and goals of the \"Islamofascists\" of Hamas...and since the imposition of an Islamic \"caliphate\" is odious to North Americans...Saylor wants to obscure this from the public? \"Fighting for freedom, fighting for Islam -- that is not suicide. However, Saylor is obviously not conversant with his own organizations history. Witness: CAIR founder Omar Ahmad, appearing at the Islamic Association of Palestine's third annual convention in Chicago, praised suicide bombers: They kill themselves for Islam\" Is Saylor repudiating the actions of those \"fighting for freedom...(those who) kill themselves for Islam\"? And what would Ahmad have to say about Saylor implying that these so-called \"freedom fighters\" are \"thugs\" and \"criminals\" as \"heroes\"? Who is right? Saylor describing those who terror-murder in the name of Islam as \"thugs\" and \"criminals\" is insulting to all self-respecting thugs and criminals who don't use religion to justify their crimes. Pete Hoekstra's amendement preserves the terms that perfectly describe the religious ideology of Hamas terrorists. Corey Saylor - CAIR terrorist sympathizer - can't handle this truth. But then again, when could any CAIR lap dog ever handle the truth ...? Another Book Banned by for the fear of Islamists.Starting in 2002, Spokane, Wash., journalist Sherry Jones toiled weekends on a racy historical novel about Aisha, the young wife of the prophet Muhammad. Ms. Jones learned Arabic, studied scholarly works about Aisha's life, and came to admire her protagonist as a woman of courage. When Random House bought her novel last year in a $100,000, two-book deal, she was ecstatic. This past spring, she began plans for an eight-city book tour after the Aug. 12 publication date of \"The Jewel of Medina\" -- a tale of lust, love and intrigue in the prophet's harem. Hat tip, DW. It's not going to happen: In May, Random House abruptly called off publication of the book. The series of events that torpedoed this novel are a window into how quickly fear stunts intelligent discourse about the Muslim world. Random House feared the book would become a new \"Satanic Verses,\" the Salman Rushdie novel of 1988 that led to death threats, riots and the murder of the book's Japanese translator, among other horrors. In an interview about Ms. Jones's novel, Thomas Perry, deputy publisher at Random House Publishing Group, said that it \"disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now.\" He said that after sending out advance copies of the novel, the company received \"from credible and unrelated sources, cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the Muslim community, but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small, radical segment.\" After consulting security experts and Islam scholars, Mr. Perry said the company decided \"to postpone publication for the safety of the author, employees of Random House, booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel.\" Related, Muslims hold new protests against Rushdie knighthood Muslims Riot in Calcutta Spencer's Islam Unveiled banned in Malaysia Book about Mohammed's Sex Life draws Threats Top Saudi cleric calls for writers' deaths \u00bb The List of Things That Offend Muslims Rest Stops The List of Things That Offend Muslims On The Road Always On Watch Two Anti-CAIR cheese in my shoe Edge's Conservative Movies Elmer's Brother Eye On The World Eyes geeeeeZ!

This may be one reason the MSM has labored so mightily to install Barack Obama in the White House. FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell explains: Key quotes, via Business and Media Institute: So you know, this election, if it goes one way, we could see a re-imposition of the Fairness Doctrine. There is a discussion of it in Congress. [...] I think it will be called something else and I think it'll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate. In other words, a new version of the Orwellian Fairness Doctrine would be used not just to hush Rush, but to censor the Internet. Another key quote: Then, whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair, under a so-called \"Fairness Doctrine,\" which won't be called that \u2014 it'll be called something else. So, will Web sites, will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their Web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that? Imagine the people who run the DMV regulating every word published on blogs to impose conformity with their moonbatty conception of \"fair.\" Good-bye blogosphere.

Here's an excerpt from the column, The trend of blaming the victim was there before Russia invaded Georgia; this current conflict was just the latest and most obvious example. Yes, it may seem absurd, but in the case of the Caucasus war, some are indeed blaming the victim -- and anyone who supports the victim.

Return to Top Van Helsing | 03:19 PM | (30) Oil Pricing and Politics You may have noticed recently, that oil prices have gone down. As you might imagine, there's no magic involved, no conspiracies and nothing particularly profound which has caused this to happen. In fact, it is a result of more supply than demand at this moment because use, on a world-wide basis, has temporarily fallen. Global oil demand for this year is expected to stand at 86.9 million barrels a day, unchanged from the previous month's forecasts, the IEA said in an August monthly report. Oil supplies, on the other hand, are expected to remain strong. The world produced 87.8 million barrels of oil in July, up 890,000 barrels from the previous month, the IEA said. \"The slowdown in demand related to the general economic downturn and high oil prices is becoming increasingly evident,\" the IEA said in the report. \"Consumers clearly are reacting by a change in [driving] behavior.\" I seem to remember, for instance, that Americans cut their driving mileage by 4 billion miles one month. That has been one reason, among many, that supply has temporarily outstripped demand by about about a million barrels a day. It is also a reason, other than the obvious one, that tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will have little or no effect on pricing at the pump, and certainly no lasting effect. It also makes the case that speculation isn't driving pricing (crude was trading at a $114 a barrel this week). So two of the Democrats primary \"solutions\" (beside inflating your tires properly, of course) to the gas price crisis are really non-starters. However (there's always a however), such a condition (higher supply than demand) is a temporary one. And while demand in developed countries seems to be falling, or at least remaining steady, it is expected that developing countries will continue to increase their demand for oil. The IEA's estimate for non-OECD countries is about 3.8%. So what does that mean for usage? Although the IEA didn't change this year's outlook for oil demand, it said consumption in the next year will increase to 87.8 million barrels, up 70,000 barrels from the previous month's forecast. That is exactly what it estimates the world is producing right now. So? So expect prices to go back up a bit. And expect that if everything remains peaceful and there are no disruptions in production. And we all know that's going to happen, right? Demand in developing countries is still strong, geopolitical tensions in Nigeria and other countries could still disrupt supplies, and Hurricanes Bertha and Dolly, although did little damage to oil facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, \"flagged a vigorous start to what could be an active autumn storm season.\" The point? Well two points really. As mentioned, the Democratic solutions would have no effect on pricing as is obvious. Secondly though, prices are going to go back up when demand resumes its rise. USA Today points out that demand for smaller cars has already fallen off as gas prices have dropped this past month. Apparently $4 a gal. is the pain threshold for most Americans and below that, they seem less concerned with gas prices. What does that mean politically then? With this current drop in oil prices look for a couple of things in the coming months. One look for Democrats to try to run a bluff and claim credit for the price decrease due to their threat to tap the SPR and regulate speculation (a bit like Obama's claim that Democrats being elected in '06 is what turned Iraq around). I'd expect them to paint this temporary dip in demand as a more permanent one which would preclude any need to drill on an extensive basis. Two, I'd be willing to bet that Congress will authorize some very limited drilling in some areas offshore (to appease those who want to see more drilling and protect Dems in districts demanding it), but extend the ban on most drilling when September 30th rolls around, citing the drop in price as the reason. Three, look for prices to increase again on or about the November election as the world catches its collective breath and we see demand again surge. And finally, four, come January we will be in exactly the same situation we are now with even less hope that extensive drilling will become a reality. All speculation on my part (a type of speculation that Congress thankfully can't regulate - yet). But having watched the maneuvering by Pelosi, Reid and company these last few months, it is a very plausible scenario. If it plays out that way, our energy deficit will continue to mount, prices will continue the rise and we may reach the point, barring some energy miracle, where a certain segment of the consumer market can no longer afford the cost of energy. But Dems will have won the political battle won't they? That's something. Rate this article: Rating: 4.3/5 (13 votes cast) Share this article!

It's a non-negotiable at my house, not only because we have a pool, but because I just believe that all children should know how to swim, and at a young age. They also need to know how to rescue someone else because so many children drown trying to save a friend or sibling. Still, does training like this give parents and families a false sense of security. The child in the video was clearly fatiguing. The training buys a parent precious minutes, but does it make tragic events more likely because parents or care-takers are less vigilant?

Return to Top Melissa Clouthier | 09:28 AM | (4) The Netroots: America And Georgia To Blame For Russia's War Of Aggression Liberals, being liberals, make certain assumptions when it comes to foreign affairs. Among them are, #1) Whatever happens in the world, if it's bad, must somehow be the fault of the Bush Administration and/or America. #2) Any country that is allied with America, by virtue of being allied with America, must be in the wrong if it gets into a conflict with a nation that is not allied with America. That brings us to Russia's war of aggression on Georgia. Russia has spent years engineering this conflict, cared nothing about the civilians it killed, and aimed to thwart democracy, intimidate other free states in the region, and to destroy an alternate route for oil outside of its borders. There were no good intentions, no higher purposes -- just the Russians attacking a smaller, weaker neighbor because it was to their advantage and no one was in a position to stop them. So, is the \"anti-war\" left railing against Russia? No. To the contrary, their reactions tend to be either muted or they're bending over backwards to try to find ways to blame George Bush and the Georgians for Russia's murderous attacks. Don't buy it? Well, here are just a few reactions from the netroots to Russia's rampage, \"Is it possible that this time the October surprise was tried in August, and that the garbage issue of brave little Georgia struggling for its survival from the grasp of the Russian bear was stoked to influence the U.S. presidential election?\" -- Robert Scheer at The Huffington Post \"Since Cheney has exactly the same view about the use of American military power as Putin does about Russian power, I'm not sure what grounds he has to complain. Maybe we should start complaining when as many Georgians have perished as Iraqis - and when Putin throws thousands of innocent Georgians into torture chambers.\" -- Andrew Sullivan \"If Bill Clinton were still President and the Republicans still controlled Congress, I think they'd skip the impeachment hearings and proceed directly to a Bill of Attainder. As Kevin Drum says, this explains why the Beloved Leader stayed in Beijing and the Secretary of State stayed on vacation as the Russian tanks rolled into South Ossetia; that wasn't actually a surprise. The only surprise was that the tanks didn't stop at the provincial border. Clearly, if we were going to tell the Russians they were free to clobber the Georgians, we should have told the Georgians the same thing. \"Please be restrained\" isn't at all the same thing as \"You're on your own, buddy.\" If Saakashvili had known that the Russians had the green light from us, he wouldn't have tried to take Tskhinvali.\" -- Mark Kleiman at The Daily Kos \"NATO, the US and Europe broke their word. They expanded NATO further and further, into what Russia considers its buffer states, states which cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of potential enemies. Russian geopolitics has been obsessed with controlling those states for centuries (along with getting a warm water port). This is not a short term, minor issue. It is at the heart of what Russia believes it needs to be defensible--lots and lots of space. Next, US and Western policy towards Russia in the 90's was based around a shock therapy transition to a free market. The result of that was an actual decline in the Russian population. US neo-liberal economics applied to Russia killed millions of people. No exaggeration. It wasn't the only cause, but when you've promised the sky (and the free-marketers did) and the result is hell on earth, well, people remember that.\" -- Ian Welsh, Firedoglake \"Washington's bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of South Ossetia. Georgia President Mikhail Saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. After all, Saakashvili owes his entire political career to American power-brokers and US intelligence agencies. If he disobeyed them, he'd be gone in a fortnight. Besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support; especially if it's perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the Olympic games. (another petty neocon touch) That means Pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with Georgian generals for months in advance. Nothing was left to chance ...Putin has played his cards very wisely, which makes it look like the fighting in South Ossetia may be Washington's way of trying to win through military force what they could not achieve via the free market.\" -- Mike Whitney, The Smirking Chimp Give it a few weeks and the comments you've just read will be the conventional wisdom on the Left...

That's an undeniable reality. There were also Christians who wouldn't vote for Mitt Romney because he is a Mormon, men who wouldn't vote for Hillary because she's a woman, blacks who wouldn't vote for Hillary because she is white, people who won't vote for McCain because they think he's too old, etc, etc. Will Obama's race cost him significantly more votes than McCain's age or Hillary's sex would have, if she had been the nominee? While that's certainly an open question, I haven't seen much evidence that Obama's race is an enormous hurdle compared to the baggage that the other candidates brought to the table. To the contrary, I would say that Barack Obama's race is actually his primary asset, not his biggest liability. Obama is arguably the single least qualified serious candidate for the presidency on either the Republican or Democratic side and he only won the nomination because black Democrats voted for him en masse because he's also black. Had Barack Obama been white, not only would he have failed to beat Hillary Clinton, he would have been fighting it out with Joe Biden and Christopher Dodd in the \"4th rate also ran\" category. Moreover, look at what Barack Obama brings to the table: he has almost no experience, has terrible judgment, isn't particularly bright, is gaffe prone, arrogant...he will be one of the least capable, least promising, least qualified men to become President in American history if he actually wins the election. So, what does he have going for him? The political environment -- which he didn't create. He's also good at reading stump speeches -- which he didn't write. He's also young -- which again, isn't an accomplishment. Other than that, he has the fact that a lot of white Americans would love to put a black man in the White House so that they can finally say, \"See? America isn't a racist country because we have a black President!\" In other words, Barack Obama is a mediocrity who has risen this far, this fast, largely by trading on the color of his skin. If he were white, even in this heavily pro-Democratic environment, he'd have little chance of beating John McCain - and it's about time more people started pointing out that rather obvious fact.

Alleged Mata Hari of Al Qaeda Could Provide 'Treasure Trove' of Intelligence ...When she was arrested in Afghanistan last month, Aafia Siddique allegedly had in her possession maps of New York, a list of potential targets that included the Statue of Liberty, Times Square, the subway system and the animal disease center on Plum Island, detailed chemical, biological and radiological weapon information that has been seen only in a handful of terrorist cases, as well as a thumb drive packed with emails, ABC News has learned. Wow, that poor girl. She's probably an indigent goat herder who was driven into Al-Qaeda by poverty, lack of education, and a lack of options in life, right? Only a \"handful\" of captured alleged Al Qaeda associates have had the kind of detailed information on weapons of mass destruction that Siddique, who attended MIT as an undergraduate and earned her PhD in neuroscience at Brandeis, had in her handbag, multiple current and former US intelligence and law enforcement officials told ABC News. Hmmm, well at least her terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, right? \"The Warrant Officer saw and heard Siddique fire at least two shots as Interpreter 1 tried to wrestle the gun from her. No one was hit. The Warrant Officer heard Siddique exclaim 'Allah Akbar!' Another interpreter (Interpreter 2) heard Siddique yell in English 'Get the f--- out of here,' as she fired the rifle,\" the complaint stated.

Between one candidate who's a talker, and the other candidate who's the leader America needs as our next president.\" -- Joe Lieberman Lieberman could have also added that we have a choice between one candidate who has always raised his hand for the national anthem and another who has not.

Return to Top rwnadmin | 02:16 AM | (0) Obama's Communistic Past: Is MSM Failing To Report The Truth? Again? Today, Barack Obama received the enthusiastic endorsement of the Communist Party USA. Here is their hope: If Obama's candidacy represented nothing more than the spark for this profound initiative to unite the working class and defeat the pernicious influence of racism, it would be a transformative candidacy that would advance progressive politics for the long term. Meanwhile, what of Obama's connection to communism? If there were one, would the mainstream media report it? Cliff Kincaid has a must-read piece over at Accuracy in Media where he discusses the implications of the non-reporting of Edwards affair and it's implications for the non-reporting of anything negative about Obama: The implication of the Edwards scandal is that, if ABC News's top investigative reporter could take Edwards' side, without any serious checking of the facts, then other candidates may be concealing scandals and hoping and planning to get away with it. That is certainly the case with Obama, who is far more of a media favorite than Edwards ever was and has, with the help of the influential Associated Press (AP), carefully concealed his relationship with an identified CPUSA member. Obama's communist connection, which he failed to disclose in his 1995 book, Dreams From My Father, by referring to Davis only as \"Frank\" and ignoring his communist affiliation, is a far more serious scandal than an Edwards \"love child.\" If you're reading this blog, it's likely that you use other forms of news-gathering than the traditional media. But the vast majority of Americans only recently heard about John Edward's affair. Would they ever hear about Obama's communist connections? In February of this year, Cliff Kincaid noted Obama's communist mentor: However, through Frank Marshall Davis, Obama had an admitted relationship with someone who was publicly identified as a member of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). The record shows that Obama was in Hawaii from 1971-1979, where, at some point in time, he developed a close relationship, almost like a son, with Davis, listening to his \"poetry\" and getting advice on his career path. But Obama, in his book, Dreams From My Father, refers to him repeatedly as just \"Frank.\" The reason is apparent: Davis was a known communist who belonged to a party subservient to the Soviet Union. In fact, the 1951 report of the Commission on Subversive Activities to the Legislature of the Territory of Hawaii identified him as a CPUSA member. What's more, anti-communist congressional committees, including the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), accused Davis of involvement in several communist-front organizations. Trevor Loudon, a New Zealand-based libertarian activist, researcher and blogger, noted evidence that \"Frank\" was Frank Marshall Davis in a posting in March of 2007. Obama's communist connection adds to mounting public concern about a candidate who has come out of virtually nowhere, with a brief U.S. Senate legislative record, to become the Democratic Party frontrunner for the U.S. presidency. In the latest Real Clear Politics poll average, Obama beats Republican John McCain by almost four percentage points. You have not heard about these connections in the MSM. Don't expect to. But it is important to recognize two things: 1. Given the media climate, it is possible for a candidate to receive no scrutiny until it's too late. 2. Obama, because he is adored by the media, will receive less scrutiny than even an average Democrat. It is possible that in today's biased climate, that an unexamined and inexperienced candidate could achieve the highest elected office in America and most influential leadership position in the free world. That is disturbing to contemplate. Cross-posted at MelissaClouthier.com Rate this article: Rating: 4.2/5 (17 votes cast) Share this article! Return to Top Melissa Clouthier | 12:31 AM | (14) Cindy McCain Speaks In New Jersey I've always had my doubts about John McCain as our presidential nominee, but I can't help but very much admire his wife, who seems to be as humble, generous, and gracious as she is beautiful. And until this morning, when I heard her speak at a fundraiser for her husband, I have had little desire to attend one of his events. After hearing her glowing affirmation of McCain - however unsurprising - I believe I'm a little more at ease about the next four years. With a poise that could rival any First Lady, Cindy McCain spoke today about how humbled she was to be in the position she is in at present, and how she has confidence in her husband as \"the greatest man\" she's ever known to be the leader of our country. She refrained from getting political, instead discussing the qualities of his character: \"The things that first attracted me to John are things that I think are what attract him to the American people,\" naming among them intelligence, strength, and courage. She affirmed what a good father he was to their children, always making time for them in his schedule and never missing out on any of the important events in their lives. To be sure, we've heard all of this more times than we can count over the past year, but if I'm like anyone else, most of us don't simply eat up a candidate's praises of himself without some substantive reason. Yet Cindy's genuine words seemed sincere enough to give him credibility, as though she wouldn't be here today if she didn't fully believe he had what it takes to be America's next president. If nothing else, I'd have to agree with Lew Eisenberg, today's host and Finance Chairman of the RNC when he said that Cindy was a sure \"testament to McCain's good judgment.\" Cindy also talked about her recent experience in Rwanda with the ONE Campaign, where was inspired to continue \"helping those who need help.\" She was \"never so humbled, never felt so small\" as when she spoke to a young woman there who, after witnessing her family being murdered and then being gang raped and left for dead, had the grace and fortitude to forgive her offenders; she hoped to be \"strong for the good of her country\". It was touching to see someone as affluent and privileged as Cindy McCain so moved by what she saw in this woman and in the Rwandan people. She's been a humanitarian for years, and I'm sure she would make the most of her position if she were First Lady. In the end, I guess my point is that while my support for John McCain is more out of necessity than my liking for him, his wife makes him more appealing in the same way that Michelle Obama has made Barack look like less of a patriot. Clearly, there's a reason she hasn't been in the public eye much since her first-time-I'm-proud-of-my-country statements. If today's crowd was any indicator, however, Republicans around the state seem to have a great deal of respect and admiration for Cindy; there was a constant buzz about what a good \"First Couple\" the two would make. Especially considering the alternative. Incidentally, I sat next to two Democratic Hillary supporters at the event who had decided to join McCain's campaign and make a permanent switch to the Republican Party, expressing their strong dislike of Barack Obama and lamenting that the Democrat Party is \"no longer what it used to be.\" They both assured the rest of us that there are plenty of others out there who are like them, and November was looking good for McCain. I'm still waiting to see whether it will be looking good for conservatives, but in the meantime I'm quite thrilled to see what a strong role model America might have in Cindy McCain. As she promised today, she hopes to be \"the best representative she can for young women\"; from what I can tell, though, she's got the potential to reach far beyond this realm. Many thanks to Republican fundraiser Candy Straight for the invitation. Cross-posted from Conservatives with Attitude! Rate this article: Rating: 4.3/5 (14 votes cast) Share this article! Return to Top Sharon Soon | 12:10 AM | (4) August 12, 2008 Vapidness is \"much more than Barack Obama\" The creator of the \"Flying O-Hole\" that MichaelW reported on a few days ago is a bit stunned by the negative feedback he's seen since his idea first surfaced: Among the hundreds of comments posted on the Whispers site were those comparing it to a gang gesture, a Nazi salute, or worse. \"This is how Sieg Heil got started. And, no I'm not saying Obama is Hitler. I just think people should be careful about slipping into a personality cult for a charismatic leader,\" wrote Jake of Tennessee. Jake has a point and Rick Husong, creator of the Obamanation, was pretty depressed until he heard of someone wearing a T-shirt sporting his artwork on Venice Beach. That turned his world around. [But I have to ask, isn't it possible that somewhere in this world, to include Venice Beach, you could find someone to wear just about anything?] Husong took this as a sign. A positive sign. And as he looked into it in more detail, he chose to interpret other signs as positive as well: In fact, despite the tsunami of criticism, the artwork has been downloaded 7,700 times and his site has been hit 214,000 times since the first Whisper went live. \"I would call that a raving success,\" he says, adding that he plans to make his Big-O the \"peace sign of our generation.\" I'd call it a raving oddity that people just had to see to believe (the hits) and was probably downloaded 7,000 of the 7,700 times to be photoshopped. But hey, no negativity - his is all about hopey-changitude: \"Our symbol 'O' is about much more than Barack Obama. It's a symbol of unity, hope, solidarity, and an end to the divisiveness that has plagued this country for too long. It is the peace sign of our generation; a sign for those who are tired of the fear, the hatred, the greed, and the ignorance. There will be resistance, democracy requires it, but we believe that the good in the American people will persevere. \"Barack Obama is a very exciting catalyst. At first we were bothered by the negative and vulgar comments made. When someone attacks something you hold dear, it hurts, but as we continued to read all the comments, we realized just how silly and frankly unimaginative most of them were. Many didn't even take the time to read the article. People came out against the peace emblem in the sixties, making accusations that it was an anti-Christian symbol, an inverted crucifix, a satanic symbol, and a Communist sign. But like our 'O,' the goodness inherent in the peace symbol persevered, and today it is the international symbol for peace. The hand sign for peace was first a British form of giving someone the bird, then it became a war cry for victory. Today it is a symbol of peace & love. Once again goodness persevered. We too will persevere. Bring your hands together over your head to make a large 'O' and join us in our fight to take America back. Vote for Barack Obama.\" It's not about Obama, but really, it is about Obama, except when it is about whatever we decide it is about. But whatever it is about, it is always about peace, love, change and hope ... or something like that. Ummm. My suggestion? Put wings on the \"O\" and everyone will know immediately what it really connotes. Ye gods. Crossposted at QandO. Rate this article: Rating: 3.4/5 (15 votes cast) Share this article!

High gas prices are making people more aware of the extravagant costs associated with the global warming hoax. The facts that it hasn't gotten any warmer for the last 10 years, and that there is no proven connection between human activity and the climate, have begun to seep through cracks in the complicit media. Consequently, the whole preposterous crisis is running out of gas. But that's no reason not to panic and demand draconian solutions to nonexistent problems. What else can hoaxers do but wave their arms and scream? You might want to put some cotton in your ears; here goes Oliver Tickell of the Guardian, who claims that the temperature's going up by 4\u00b0C: Global warming on this scale would be a catastrophe that would mean, in the immortal words that Chief Seattle probably never spoke, \"the end of living and the beginning of survival\" for humankind. Or perhaps the beginning of our extinction. The sea will rise 70-80 meters. There will be the usual Biblical apocalypse stuff, droughts, floods, hurricanes, et cetera. But Tickell admits that the farcical Kyoto treaty was a waste of time, and that the biofuels boondoggle has increased dreaded greenhouse gases while also causing a food crisis. There's only one alternative to the extinction of the human race. Conveniently for the lefties at the Guardian, it's totalitarian moonbattery. Tickell shouts that we must \"place a single global cap on greenhouse gas emissions\" and \"commit hundreds of billions of dollars per year to finance adaption to climate change, especially in poor countries.\" In other words, there must be global totalitarian control over all human activity and massive transfers of wealth from those who create it to those who don't, so that we can all be equal under the benevolent boot of Big Brother. If we submitted to liberals' dystopian dreams, we wouldn't be humans anymore anyway, but something more like farm animals, so we may as well take our chances with extinction. On a tip from mega.

Return to Top Van Helsing | 03:32 PM | (12) Fat and Fit New research demonstrates the limitations of making sweeping health generalizations based on body mass: You can look great in a swimsuit and still be a heart attack waiting to happen. And you can also be overweight and otherwise healthy. A new study suggests that a surprising number of overweight people -- about half -- have normal blood pressure and cholesterol levels, while an equally startling number of trim people suffer from some of the ills associated with obesity. The first national estimate of its kind bolsters the argument that you can be hefty but still healthy, or at least healthier than has been believed. It looks like the waist measurement is the key. Pot bellied people beware: The results also add to mounting evidence that thick waists are linked with heart risks. Among people of healthy weight in the study, elevated blood pressure, cholesterol and other factors were more common for people with larger waists or potbellies. This often signals internal fat deposits surrounding abdominal organs, which previous research has shown can be especially risky. Similarly, among overweight and obese adults, those in the \"healthy\" category tended to have smaller waists than those with at least two risk factors. Smoking, being sedentary and eating junk isn't a good idea for health, obviously. Still, a person can have an active life, eat well, sleep well and carry extra pounds and be healthy. Focus less on fat and more on doing the things that make a healthy life. A person might end up losing weight, or not, but will likely live long.

Return to Top Melissa Clouthier | 03:18 PM | (1) Everything The American Voter Needs to Know About Foreign Policy in One Paragraph First, the lead. George Will writing about Bill Richardson: Clinging to the Obama campaign's talking points like a drunk to a lamppost, [Former Governor, Ambassador and Presidential Candidate Bill] Richardson said this crisis proves the wisdom of Obama's zest for diplomacy, and that America should get the U.N. Security Council \"to pass a strong resolution getting the Russians to show some restraint.\" Apparently Richardson was ambassador to the U.N. for 19 months without noticing that Russia has a Security Council veto. Now, your paragraph. It is roughly paraphrasing the outburst I had yesterday when I heard on the radio about Sen. Obama calling for a cease fire. Which made the veins stand out in my neck and forehead. You might not understand that in the moment in which you read this sentence; but the paragraph below will make it all clear. Begin paragraph. Republicans talk to people as if they're talking to teenagers; democrats talk to people as if they're talking to little tiny kids. When you talk to a teenager, you essentially say \" you do what you want, but if you do this then these are the likely results, and if you do that then those are the consequences.\" You do not do this when you talk to little kids. When you talk to little kids you are responsible for weighing consequences yourself, and then you say \"do this...don't do that.\" Normal kids eventually mature to the point where they can weigh cause-and-effect on their own -- but democrats don't seem to think that is the case. They talk down to people, cradle-to-grave, saying do this...don't do that. You see it in Senator Obama. The man seems to have a medical condition. He can't stop telling people what to do and what not to do. The folly of this communications tactic in foreign policy is evident when democrats achieve positions of power, and conceive new doctrines that consist of telling recalcitrant foreign powers \"do this...don't do that.\" They do this even against history's backdrop, in which it's fair to assert that every foreign policy success has been a direct result of conducting diplomacy in the style one conducts diplomacy with a teenager. They do this in situations in which it has been proven that the teenage-diplomacy is the only viable option, short of military force. They don't seem to be capable of rising to this challenge, intellectually. They dispense instructions...they form their foreign policy around the dispensation of instructions...like teaching a preschool class...and then the policy crumbles, inevitably, the day it comes up against a foreign head of state who defeats it handily with a single syllable, simply by saying: \"No.\" We've seen this happen, again and again and again. End paragraph. I would further add one more thing: As ethereal and sloppy a definition the word \"conservative\" has managed to achieve in domestic issues, with foreign policy the definition has remained crisp, clear and distinctive. It means, quite plain and simply, to elevate the cost of being our country's enemy by any means necessary, and to reduce the cost and enhance the benefits of being our friend. Liberalism is quite the opposite; liberalism, with regard to other countries, is very much like the slutty woman who spurns the likable nerd who brings her chocolates and flowers and carries her piano up the stairs on moving day, and then talks her mother into taking out a second mortgage on her house so she can buy truckloads of beer for her other boyfriend who bruises her face and dreams of one day getting the band back together. When a liberal runs the United States, you know how to get the United States to do what you want. Just say you don't like the United States. The liberal will come running to drink tea with you at Camp David, and find out what your \"demands\" are. If you go on record calling yourself an \"ally\" then the liberal won't give a rat's a*s what you want. Liberalism means only bending over backwards for people who don't like your country. And so left-wing diplomacy is always doomed to fail. By saying \"do this...don't do that\" what it is saying is \" if you want to be our friend then do this and don't do that.\" But then, it says, you're only going to be treated decently if you're our enemy. In a sane world, the \"do this don't do that\" people would make it a worthwhile proposition to be on friendly terms with us -- so that there would be some motivating agent to get foreign powers to do things. In reality, it is quite the reverse. Don't ask me to explain it. Ask them. Cross-posted at House of Eratosthenes. Rate this article: Rating: 3.8/5 (18 votes cast) Share this article! Return to Top Morgan Freeberg | 02:30 PM | (22) English Ilkka nails it: I have mentioned a few times that since I already speak English, I really don't see any value in learning other languages, since the time and effort needed would be much better spent on other things. There is so much opinion, information and knowledge available in English that I can only ever read an infinitesimal portion of it. Besides, in this petabyte word that we live in, the problematic part is not acquiring the information but filtering the signal from noise. If somebody has something important to tell me, he can do that in English, and if he doesn't want to do this, then that something probably wasn't that important in the first place, simple as that. The English language is perhaps the most underrated bozo filter currently in existence, silently blocking out tons of idiocy. Of course you could argue that I must learn some language so that I could understand and relate to the people who speak it. Very well, tell me then which language A I ought to learn, instead of any one of the other languages B, C, D, ... Also, please tell, why is this duty unidirectional the same way that all multiculturalism always seems to be? Couldn't the speakers of other languages just as well learn to speak English? Why do I have a moral duty to learn their language, when they clearly don't have the reciprocal duty to learn mine? I've been hearing a very long time now that the simple act of learning any non-native tongue has a \"broadening\" effect upon the mind. Back when I was in high school this made perfect sense to me, although looking back on it I should have paid better attention to the evidence I was seeing. I'm referring here, mostly, to those fellow students in high school who were members of the \"Esperanto Club.\" Indeed, their communication skills in English did seem to go up as they learned second-languages, and of course they were on the fast-track for other accolades, positions held, class President, et al. One problem: When I talked with them one-on-one about deeper matters, computer programming, trigonometry, etc., they didn't know a whole lot. But never mind, because all the teachers acted as if they were little geniuses. I just don't find any evidence to support that this truly broadens the mind. Quite to the contrary: People who learn multiple languages tend to become pretentious. Not all of them. There are those who use it as a tool -- I need to know this other language, so I learn it, I don't brag about it. Like that. The folks who learn multiple languages as a social signal, as in ooh look at me, I'm so smart, I know more than one language...they're a bunch of freakin' pinheads. Always have been. And no, that's not jealousy talking. If I wanted to learn another language, I'd have done it by now. But it comes down to -- Ilkka's right. You invest the time, you get a benefit. If you already know the English language you're not going to get much of a benefit unless you're about to spend more than a few days in some country that speaks a different language. And there are all the problems with logic, for which the polyglots fall, again and again. Like this one: English-only is racist. No, it's NOT. English is not a color. Sen. Obama made an issue out of this. He says our children need to learn more than one language -- specifically, Spanish -- but Obama hasn't done this himself. Millions of people are falling for it. Some of them know more than one language...in which they help prove my point, multiple-language people falling for crap...and some of them don't, in which case they're no better than he is. And here's something else peculiar I've been noticing. Languages I'm supposed to learn in order to become a \"better\" individual, it seems, are languages from Europe. People don't say you're better if you learn Swahili. They say you should learn one of those high school fad-and-fashion languages...French...Italian...Spanish. And Europe is historically mostly white. Listen to the rhetoric sometime -- how does the politically-correct crowd protest a school exam that has not been sufficiently \"diversified\"? They call it euro-centric. How does that help keep me from being a racist if I learn languages from a continent whose name is virtually synonymous with whiteness? What is it about Europe, anyway? I don't see anyone saying people from Chad are ticked at Americans for not having passports. I don't see anyone saying people from Ghana are opining away about our isolationism...or people from Tibet...or people from Madagascar. It's always Europe. Europe, which from what I'm told, has been made into a tourist trap. Hmmm...guilt for dollars. Here's some irony. English is the official aviation language as of January 1, 2008. Internationally. There ya go. You want to identify with other countries, the first step is to speak English. I like the point about the bozo filter. Gathering information for yourself is always useful, but I think it's high time the point was made that an ability to filter things out is far more useful. Once you've given it a fair hearing, I mean. Someone says \"A big problem we have with kids today is they're traumatized when their parents are overly competitive\" and you say \"Oh really? Like who?\" and the other person says \"Well, I saw it in a whole bunch of movies...\" (Thing I Doubt #18). One eyeball-roll later, that should be the end of the discussion. And we have a great many more people walking around lacking an ability to filter out stupid things, than lacking the ability to gather the raw material. They see things in movies, and they think those things are true. Does learning multiple languages help stop people from doing this, indulging in this confusion between reality and fantasy? The opposite seems to be the case. There is also a point to be made about differentiating between learning something, and learning something well. From listening to people, and observing things for myself, I have come to gradually notice that people in foreign lands who are addressed by tourists in their native tongues, don't seem to appreciate the gesture unless some high degree of proficiency has been attained. Maybe not even then. I still think, if you're going there, you should learn the language of where you're going to some utilitarian level. I'm just saying, don't count on people showing an appreciation for it. Why should they? Isn't it rather conceited to assume some guy over in France, minding his own business, will appreciate the opportunity to tell you where the damn bathroom is just because you know how to say S'il Vous Pla\u00eet? How insulting. One other thing I keep getting told is that people in foreign countries -- again, Europe -- don't like Americans because Americans are rude. Maybe our multi-culturalists are the problem. Shouldn't someone be asking them about it? I mean, if you're the kind of person who's going to get a passport and travel to Europe just so you can say you're so much better than another American who will stay home, it just makes sense that you're probably the kind of person who's going to bug people over there for directions and then act like you're the one doing them a favor. And if I happen to be that foreign guy, you're probably going to piss me off pretty well. Next guy who asks me about Americans, I'm going to say they're rude and full o' themselves. Anyway, that's my theory. Makes pretty good sense from where I'm standing. And as Ilkka points out in a more recent post, don't forget all the carbon you're blowing out your rear end by flying there in the first place. But above all, that parting-shot question has to stand. And it seems to me unanswerable. How come I have to learn your language, but you don't have to learn mine? Cross-posted at House of Eratosthenes.

Return to Top Morgan Freeberg | 02:26 PM | (34) Like a Chicken Who Loves Colonel Sanders Via Ezra Levant, via Mark Steyn, via Five Feet of Fury: Naomi Lakritz' write-up of that patently absurd \"The System Works\" argument appears in the Calgary Herald. Maybe you've heard this one. Canada's Human Rights Commission figures out it has been harassing an innocent man, as a result of its very own proceedings, dismisses the complaint, and this just goes to show how successful it is at protecting the freedoms of everyone. University of Calgary law professor Kathleen Mahoney is absolutely right when she says the outcome of Levant's case demonstrates the process works. It does, indeed, and without such institutions as human rights commissions, where would people go for redress? In other countries, when people feel their racial or religious identity is under attack, they take up arms. Here, we have a civilized outlet for making such complaints -- the human rights commission. Just disgusting. Levant responds: Kathleen Mahoney is a left-wing kook. And she's a thin-skinned liberal fascist in her own right. Here's a story in the Globe and Mail about her own human rights complaint filed against Alberta Report, for daring to suggest that some Aboriginal kids benefited from residential schools. The article cited by Levant tells a grim tale: In the past year, the Regina Leader-Post, Alberta Report, the North Shore News, the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix and The Toronto Star have all had to appear before tribunals to answer charges of publishing \"discriminatory\" material, in violation of the human-rights codes in their provinces. A quick refresher: Human-rights law was created to prevent discrimination in lodging and employment. So why is it now being used to prevent the dissemination of certain ideas? Isn't this the sort of thing the free-expression section of the constitutional Charter of Rights and Freedoms is supposed to prevent? The strangest case of the bunch is the one against Alberta Report. Last year, reporter Patrick Donnelly wrote a feature article for the magazine entitled, \"Scapegoating the Indian residential schools: The noble legacy of hundreds of Christian missionairies is sacrificed to political correctness\". The thrust of Mr. Donnelly's argument was that residential schools, government-funded institutions operated by religious orders, were on the whole positive for natives. His argument was supported with quotes from former students and teachers, many of whom said that they had nothing but positive memories of the residential system. He alleged that this point of view has been buried by Indian advocates hungry to capitalize on white guilt by portraying the institutions as a form of cultural genocide. Whether his analysis is insightful or misguided is, legally speaking, entirely beside the point. Or rather that's the way the law used to work. Not any more. University of Calgary law professor Kathleen Mahoney responded to the publication by filing a complaint with the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission, alleging that Alberta Report had \"expose[d] First Nations people to hatred or contempt on the basis of their race or ancestry\". She asked for remedies including \"an apology, damages, and an order that the respondents attend education sessions about human rights in Alberta.\" The creepy call for \"education sessions\" was not laughed out of the Alberta commission. Instead, the commission has asked Alberta Report to respond to the complaint. It will then consider whether to prosecute the magazine. So what we have here -- assuming Lakritz and Mahoney are on the up-and-up -- is a situation in which the people get their rights from the government, after the government defines what they are, and this includes supposedly \"free\" speech. Levant owns the chicken analogy, and he thinks it's lame. I disagree. The only way it could fit any better, to my way of thinking, is if the chicken saw one of his fellow chickens tossed into the McNugget hopper, and lucky for him the blades were suddenly jammed at exactly the right moment, allowing the intended victim to walk away -- and the first chicken, because of this, gleefully began clucking away about how the machine works. The longer I'm on the planet, the more suspicious I am of intellectuals who base their arguments about a bureaucracy on a fundamental axiom that the bureaucracy consistently produces results that are \"correct,\" by virtue of possessing the authority to define exactly what \"correct\" is. It is a child's discourse. I expect anyone of respectful intelligence who's graduated from the sixth grade, or anyone of mediocre intelligence who's graduated from the eighth, to immediately see what's wrong with it. For a law professor to use it, or a Calgary Herald columnist to use it, is tantamount to admitting said user-of-argument somehow expects to be kept out of the machine's blades. Access to attorneys, names in the rolodex, knowing where the bodies are buried...whatever. The most likely and common ace up the sleeve: A determination to spend the balance of one's career staying well away from the wild frontier. To stick to doing what others are already doing. After all, is the highest point of a mountain not at its center? Of course it is, and so to the center we shall stick. Thus, the McNugget blades will always be whirring treacherously against the flesh of another chicken who ventured too far. Not us. So what's to worry about? These people are, quite plain and simply, not to be trusted. They pretend to be the guardians of a civilized society. In reality, they don't belong in one. Cross-posted at House of Eratosthenes.

Return to Top Morgan Freeberg | 02:20 PM | (4) Hard Power, Soft Power & The Russo-Georgian War There are a couple of columns I've read this morning about the Russo-Georgian war that have stuck with me. The first is by Spengler and while I don't agree with most of what he has to say, there were some points he made that shouldn't be discounted, If Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin were president of the United States, would Iran try to build a nuclear bomb? Would Pakistan provide covert aid to al-Qaeda? Would Hugo Chavez train terrorists in Venezuela? Would leftover nationalities with delusions of grandeur provoke the great powers? Just ask Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili, who now wishes he never tried to put his 4 million countrymen into strategic play. ...The number of flashpoints for violence in the world has grown in inverse proportion to their importance. The world is full of undead tribes with delusions of grandeur, and soon-to-be-extinct peoples who rather would go out with a bang than a whimper. Along similar lines, here's an excerpt from Victor Davis Hanson's spot-on take on the war, Together with the dismal NATO performance in Afghanistan, the Georgian incursion reveals the weakness of the Atlantic Alliance. The tragic irony is unmistakable. NATO was given a gift in not having made Georgia a member, since otherwise an empty ritual of evoking Article V's promise of mutual assistance in time of war would have effectively destroyed the Potemkin alliance. ...Indeed, tired of European lectures, the Russians are now telling the world that soft power is, well, soft. Moscow doesn't give a damn about the United Nations, the European Union, the World Court at the Hague, or any finger-pointing moralist from Geneva or London. Did anyone in Paris miss any sleep over the rubble of Grozny? ...The Russians have sized up the moral bankruptcy of the Western Left. They know that half-a-million Europeans would turn out to damn their patron the United States for removing a dictator and fostering democracy, but not more than a half-dozen would do the same to criticize their long-time enemy from bombing a constitutional state. The Russians rightly expect Westerners to turn on themselves, rather than Moscow -- and they won't be disappointed. Imagine the morally equivalent fodder for liberal lament: We were unilateral in Iraq, so we can't say Russia can't do the same to Georgia. (As if removing a genocidal dictator is the same as attacking a democracy). We accepted Kosovo's independence, so why not Ossetia's? (As if the recent history of Serbia is analogous to Georgia's.) We are still captive to neo-con fantasies about democracy, and so encouraged Georgia's efforts that provoked the otherwise reasonable Russians (As if the problem in Ossetia is our principled support for democracy rather than appeasement of Russian dictatorship). ...We talk endlessly about \"soft\" and \"hard\" power as if humanitarian jawboning, energized by economic incentives or sanctions, is the antithesis to mindless military power. In truth, there is soft power, hard power, and power-power -- the latter being the enormous advantages held by energy rich, oil-exporting states. Take away oil and Saudi Arabia would be the world's rogue state, with its medieval practice of gender apartheid. Take away oil and Ahmadinejad is analogous to a run-of-the-mill central African thug. Take away oil, and Chavez is one of Ronald Reagan's proverbial tinhorn dictators. Here's the reality of the world: most nations would cut the throats of their neighbors to put a dollar in their pockets, if they were only offered 50 cents to leave them alone. In other words, the law of the jungle, not the law of tea room chats prevails on planet earth. Does that mean that soft power is pointless? Not at all. However, the West has grown more and more reluctant to use even its soft power (See Iran for one perfect example of that) and since using old school European hard-power is abhorrent to much of the West, other than in the US and Israel, they've let their capabilities and will erode to the breaking point. So, when Iran builds nuclear weapons, OPEC works to keep oil prices high, or Russia invades Georgia, their expectation is that ultimately, we will respond with nothing more than empty words. The problem with this is that, despite what so many people would like to believe, most of the world is not comprised of civilized, reasonable, and good people. Therefore, simply explaining our point of view to them and looking for common ground isn't going to fix the problem. That doesn't mean we have to haul out the bombers for every situation, but it does mean that unless we respond to provocations like the one that has just occurred in Georgia in some sort of meaningful way, they will become more frequent and serious across the world as the bad actors deliberately test us to see how much they can get away with.

The McCain campaign has put out another ad that hits the same themes as the now famous \" Celebrity\" and \" The One\" ads, Hilariously, Jake Tapper over at ABC is cranky because so many white women are featured in the video, How many young white women professing adoration for Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois, can you count in this anti-Obama web video that the campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, was sending out yesterday? One...two...three...four...sure are a lot of young white women in this thing.... Why do you think they put so many young white women professing their love for Obama in what is clearly an anti-Obama video? What would possibly be negative about young white women liking Sen. Obama? I can explain it, Jake. It's the same stategery that Mike Huckabee's campaign used when they put out his much discussed cross video. You see, the only people who think it's racist to have white women in an ad with Obama are liberals, who think all conservatives are racist anyway -- while everybody else thinks their complaints are silly. Heck, even Obama must think those complaints are silly because he has had white women in his own ads numerous times. So, why does McCain put them in there anyway, if libs like Jake Tapper are going to freak out over it? Duh -- because he WANTS THEM TO FREAK OUT OVER IT. When they freak out, it creates controversy. Controversy creates views of McCain's YouTube videos which hit Obama on the issues -- taxes, for example -- and also hammer home the meta-meme that Obama is a substanceless puffball who isn't qualified to be President of the United States. In other words, the McCain campaign isn't worried about offending liberals with these ads -- to the contrary, they're counting on it. Seldom do I use the words \"brilliant campaign strategy\" and \"John McCain\" in the same sentence, but he deserves the compliment on these ads. PS: Jake?

Return to Top John Hawkins | 09:57 AM | (9) We Can't Let Russia Get Away With It I've deliberately refrained from commenting on Russia's assault on Georgia in the last few days because it seemed difficult to add anything beyond the obvious... * Russia engineered this entire conflict and was waging a war of aggression against a small, democratic state and ally of the US in hopes of intimidating them and the whole region. * Georgia is not a member of NATO and was therefore, not entitled to any military support from the West during this attack. * This should prove once again, without a shadow of a doubt, how hapless the United Nations is. Not only did it do nothing of significance during the crisis, one of the primary bad actors on the world scene and the villain in this case, Russia, sits on the UN Security Council. * We shouldn't let Russia get away with this. Towards that last bullet point, National Review has some excellent suggestions about how the West should respond to Russia's provocation (which thankfully may be drawing to a close), In the long term, however, America and its allies must demonstrate that Russia has lost more than it gained from this conflict. One first step must be for the U.S. to agree with its NATO allies to confirm an offer of NATO membership for both Georgia and Ukraine. Poland, the Baltic states, and other central European countries are already calling for an emergency NATO summit that might issue such a declaration. Only Germany seems to stand in the way of such a decision -- and the Germans should be told firmly that their opposition to Georgia membership earlier this year encouraged the siloviki to mount this attack. Time for them to forget Rapallo once and for all, and join the rest of the West in resisting the re-emergence of the USSR. Second, we should ask Poland and the Czech Republic to hold any necessary referendums on installing a missile defense system to be held at once -- and campaign on the argument that Russia has just shown that it cannot be trusted to be a good international neighbor. Such a victory would lose the Kremlin far more than it gained in the Caucasus. Third, once the fighting has definitively stopped, the U.S. should offer a generous rebuilding program in Georgia -- to be carried out, in part, by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. That is one piece of social work that the Pentagon should relish. It's now the West, not Russia, that is under the spotlight. Russia has just used its military to intimidate a small democratic state on their borders. Unless we make them pay a price for it, other nations will learn the wrong lesson from our fecklessness, and we will see more of this same behavior in the future from Russia and from other nations.

Now With More AIDS One of the biggest problems with our government today is there are so many people, who want to do so many things that defy all common sense, that incredibly stupid ideas can become law without ever hitting the public's radar. For example, After more than two decades on the books, a little-known yet strictly enforced federal law barring foreigners with HIV or AIDS from entering the country is on its way out. Tucked in a bill pledging $48 billion to combat the disease, signed into law by President Bush last week, was language stripping the provision from federal immigration law. But that change didn't fully lift the entry ban on visitors with HIV or AIDS, which applies whether they're on tourist jaunts or seeking longer stays. The secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services still needs to delete HIV from the agency's list of \"communicable diseases of public health significance,\" which includes tuberculosis, gonorrhea and leprosy. An HHS spokeswoman declined to comment, noting administrators are still reviewing the new law. An April report from the Congressional Budget Office said that, based on information from HHS' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV will be dropped from the list and new regulations will be in place in two years. Both immigrant and HIV awareness advocates, however, say the toughest hurdle has been cleared, that the lifting of the immigration provision has been a long time coming -- politics finally catching up with medical knowledge. \"Today everyone knows that you can't get AIDS from sitting next to someone on an airplane or sharing a bathroom -- American policy should reflect this,\" said Victoria Neilson, legal director of Immigration Equality, a New York-based advocacy group that has led a years-long campaign against the ban. In San Antonio, people in the HIV/AIDS community welcomed the new law, but noted that plenty of people here had already circumvented the travel ban, since the area has been a long-standing destination for unauthorized immigrants. Jan Patterson, an infectious disease specialist in San Antonio, agreed that the ban has no scientific underpinning. When HIV first surfaced, researchers didn't know how it was transmitted, but it has long been widely known that HIV is not easily contracted and that even people with full-blown AIDS can live for a long time, said Patterson, who has taught for 15 years at the University of Texas Health Science Center. Let me tell you what more immigrants with AIDS coming to America means: it means more Americans getting AIDS from them and more American tax dollars being used to treat them. Yes, it is correct that nobody is going to get AIDS from sitting beside of someone who has it in an airplane, but they can unknowingly get it from them by having sex with them or sharing a needle -- and just wait, because eventually, some immigrant with AIDS will get into the gay scene in San Francisco or hook up with a bunch of heroin addicts in Berkeley and they'll end up being the source of hundreds of infections. Then, the media will report it -- or maybe they won't, remember John Edwards -- and then what? What do you say to the families of the people who get AIDS from an immigrant because of this policy? Sorry your daughter has a death sentence hanging over her head, but we didn't want to hurt the feelings of Brazilians with AIDS? The problem here is that the politicians have gotten so caught up in political correctness and have forgotten the very first rule of immigrant policy: that is, the purpose of allowing immigrants into the United States in the first place is to benefit the people who are already here.

Return to Top rwnadmin | 08:29 AM | (0) Combatting Myths About Offshore Drilling By Betsy Newmark The Washington Post debunks the myths about drilling propagated in the latest anti-drilling ad put out by the the Natural Resources Defense Council. But there are three \"truths\" masquerading as fact among drilling opponents that need to be challenged: Drilling is pointless because the United States has only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. This is a misleading because it refers only to known oil reserves. According to the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service (MMS), while there are an estimated 18 billion barrels of oil in the off-limits portions of the OCS, those estimates were made using old data from now-outdated seismic equipment. In the case of the Atlantic Ocean, the data were collected before Congress imposed a moratorium on offshore drilling in 1981. In 1987, the MMS estimated that there were 9 billion barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. By 2006, after major advances in seismic technology and deepwater drilling techniques, the MMS resource estimate for that area had ballooned to 45 billion barrels. In short, there could be much more oil under the sea than previously known. The demand for energy is going up, not down. And for a long time, even as alternative sources of energy are developed, more oil will be needed. The oil companies aren't using the leases they already have. According to the MMS, there were 7,457 active leases as of June 8. Of those, only 1,877 were classified as \"producing.\" As we pointed out in a previous editorial, the five leases that have made up the Shell Perdido project off Galveston since 1996 are not classified as producing. Only when it starts pumping the equivalent of an estimated 130,000 barrels of oil a day at the end of the decade will it be deemed \"active.\" Since 1996, Shell has paid rent on the leases; filed and had approved numerous reports with the MMS, including an environmentally sensitive resource development plan and an oil spill recovery plan that is subject to unannounced practice runs by the MMS; drilled several wells to explore the area at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars; and started constructing the necessary infrastructure to bring the oil to market. The notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth. With oil prices still above $100 a barrel, that charge never made sense. Drilling is environmentally dangerous. Opposition to offshore drilling goes back to 1969, when 80,000 barrels of oil from an offshore oil well blowout washed up on the beaches of Santa Barbara. In 1971, the Interior Department instituted a host of reporting requirements (such as the resource development and oil spill recovery plans mentioned above) and stringent safety measures. Chief among them is a requirement for each well to have an automatic shut-off valve beneath the ocean floor that can also be operated manually. According to the MMS, between 1993 and 2007, there were 651 spills of all sizes at OCS facilities (in federal waters three miles or more offshore) that released 47,800 barrels of oil. With 7.5 billion barrels of oil produced in that time, that equates to 1 barrel of oil spilled per 156,900 barrels produced. That's not to minimize the danger. But no form of energy is perfect or without trade-offs. Besides, if it is acceptable to drill in the Caspian Sea and in developing countries such as Nigeria where environmental concerns are equally important, it's hard to explain why the United States should rule out drilling off its own coasts. The Post repeats the argument that drilling now won't pay off for a decade. They're ignoring basic economics about how the market would react to such a change in American policy. The Post is correct that we need a comprehensive plan that couples drilling with expanded research in alternative sources of energy as well as nuclear energy.

Fred Kaplan does an excellent job, though, of bringing the irrational rage and absolute venom of the Left towards President Bush to the fore: Regardless of what happens next, it is worth asking what the Bush people were thinking when they egged on Mikheil Saakashvili, Georgia's young, Western-educated president, to apply for NATO membership, send 2,000 of his troops to Iraq as a full-fledged U.S. ally, and receive tactical training and weapons from our military. Did they really think Putin would sit by and see another border state (and former province of the Russian empire) slip away to the West? If they thought that Putin might not, what did they plan to do about it, and how firmly did they warn Saakashvili not to get too brash or provoke an outburst? You know, this analysis deserves an analogy. So, you're a woman married to an abusive jerk. You can't leave. Finally, you have a chance, you divorce. You change your life, but you can't move. You have kids together with the jerk, so you have to stay around. One of the kids, prefers abusive dad. You know what's best, but what can you do? You try to assert yourself. The ex, though, he's no nicer. It pisses him off that you dare defend yourself. He brings his gun over and he shoots you. Attempts to kill you, for having the nerve to defy him. And oh, by the way, he will show the others around where it's at, too. He's above the law, because he's crazy and everyone is afraid of him. Most friends are outraged at this jerk's actions. He's wrong. He's abusive. He's vicious. But some people go after the woman for daring to believe she could be independent and assert herself. She should have known better. She should never have provoked him. Stupid woman. She deserves what she got. And furthermore, she's a complete idiot for listening to anyone who believed she could be independent. Why does the Left always, always take the side of the abusive spouse? While they should be protecting the rights of the woman to wear what she wants, screw who she wants, the Left always blames the victim when it comes to freedom and sides with the aggressive, oppressive, dictatorial jerk. Always. The most important thing Kaplan says, though, is this: In the long term, the best way to take Russia down a notch (along with Iran, Venezuela, and other hostile powers overflowing with oil money) is to pursue policies and fund technologies that slash the demand for oil. The Georgia crisis should make clear, if it isn't already, that this is a matter of hard-headed national security. How about blaming Clinton for vetoing the drilling ten years ago? Oil dependence has given these world thugs power they don't deserve. Slash demand? How about increase our supply? Wait. Wait. America is wrong. Always. Wrong. Everything is America's fault.

In Alabama, Al Sharpton's younger brother, the Rev. Kenneth Glasgow, will take his \"Prodigal Son\" ministry into state prisons with voter-registration cards for the first time. The American Civil Liberties Union recently filed suit there and in Tennessee to make it possible for an even larger class of felons to register. In Ohio, the NAACP will hold a voter-registration day at the Justice Center in downtown Cleveland this month to register \"people caught up in the criminal justice system,\" a local official said. In California, a team will stand in front of jails on Aug. 16 to register people visiting prisoners and encourage them to take registration cards to their incarcerated friends or family members, some of whom can legally vote. In Florida, RINO Governor Charlie Crist recently pushed through a change that made 115,000 felons eligible to vote. The campaign to get them registered is being led by Obamunist civil rights lawyer Reggie Mitchell, who crows: The majority of people to get their rights restored are Democrats, and if we get them registered, [we] might overtake the state. Nice work, Crist. At least this might keep you from getting reelected. That left-wing outfits assume the overwhelming majority of convicted felons would vote Democrat tells you all you need to know about the Party of Decline. Charlie Crist, clueless RINO.

Have Patience & Get To Work Excellent article by Seth Godin about what it takes to succeed on the internet and everywhere: The media wants overnight successes (so they have someone to tear down). Ignore them. Ignore the early adopter critics that never have enough to play with. Ignore your investors that want proven tactics and predictable instant results. Listen instead to your real customers, to your vision and make something for the long haul. Because that's how long it's going to take, guys. Here's another thing: it's not just patience. It's hard work. One thing I've noticed following people on Twitter is that some people are just working All The Time. Most don't consider it \"work\". It's their love and they've parlayed it into a job or career, but they're working all the same. Their job gives their lives meaning and mission. In fact, it's likely that their work is their mission. Lots of smart people have lots of smart ideas that never see the light of day because they never take the risk to work. And it's a daily grind, oftentimes, or can be. And sometimes, the work that you find important other people think is stupid or useless. Conversely, some throw away efforts surprise you because it's well-received. Go figure. Either way, if the work wasn't done and the risk taken, nothing would have been accomplished. So go to work and hang in there. Success will follow.

Lately Loony's Hollyweird career has suffered a slight setback, as he's devoted his energies to making pretentious propaganda films that are only watched by masochistic moonbats out of ideological loyalty, in which Americans are always the villains, even in WWII. Amusingly, he recently blew $85,000 on a guffaw-inducing moonbatmobile so as to make a pageant of his environmental piousness. Quotes that offer some insight into Obama's friend and advisor can be found on Celiberal. Clooney as a judge of other men: Let's face it: Bush is just dim. Clooney as a humanitarian and defender of the Second Amendment: Charlton Heston announced again today that he is suffering from Alzheimer's. [...] I don't care. Charlton Heston is the head of the National Rifle Association; he deserves whatever anyone says about him. Clooney on combating terrorism: I just want someone smart to stand up and shout, \"Bullsh*t!\" They tell us we're going to war and no one's saying \"Bullsh*t\" loud enough. And the language! Listen to the language! \"Evil\"? \"Nexus That's my favorite, Clooney the historian: What did Bush do on 9/11? He ran away and hid. Even Reagan knew more about leadership than that, and he was as bad a symbol of America as I can think of, off-hand. But at least he's been in enough cowboy movies to know he had to come out and stand on top of the rubble and be seen shaking his fist or something. Clooney's habit of poking his nose where it does not belong and acting like a liberal jackass is so pronounced that the UN's Ban Ki-Moonbat named him a \"Messenger of Peace,\" and last year Time magazine listed him as one of the 100 people it wishes were most influential. If the sky falls and the tasteless joke of Barack Obama's candidacy becomes the Dadaist nightmare of an Obama Administration, Clooney really will be influential. According to the Daily Mail: George Clooney once famously declared he could never run for public office because he'd \"slept with too many women, done too many drugs and been to too many parties.\" But now the Hollywood heart-throb has entered the political arena at the highest level \u2014 by becoming an unofficial adviser to US Presidential front-runner Barack Obama. [...] Sources say the actor has tried to hide the pair's friendship for fear his Left-wing views and playboy image would hurt the Presidential hopeful's bid for the White House. Obama trying to hide his association with an anti-American screwball because of his extreme left-wing views? I could swear I've heard that somewhere before... Loony is reportedly in constant contact with Obama, via emails, text messages, and twice weekly phone calls. Unsurprisingly, in light of his admitted terrorist sympathies, he is pushing the clueless Obama to side with Palestinians against our ally Israel. He also wants us to surrender unconditionally to the terrorists our troops have been fighting in Iraq. It looks like John Edwards (aka, Love Lips) is out as Attorney General. But we might still get our share of narcissistic cheese with Clooney as Secretary of State. A candidacy getting more alarming by the hour. Hat tip: Michelle Malkin; on a tip from Burning Hot.

Eh, well, this is an important story and my take is a bit different. For what it's worth, I'm not quite sure that Russia plans to stop and let Georgia remain sovereign at all. As of this writing, they look to be pushing into central Georgia. In some respects, the point is moot. Georgia will effectively be helpless before Russia and a more willing partner. It's difficult to be independent with a noose around the neck. *********** Russia's ongoing assault on Georgia bodes ill for Europe and the world. I do believe that history will show this action to be a seminal moment in the shift in world power. Russia herself is not all that strong, but if she controls Europe, she doesn't have to be strong, just strong enough. Mikheil Saakashvili writes in the Wall Street Journal today: Ostensibly, this war is about an unresolved separatist conflict. Yet in reality, it is a war about the independence and the future of Georgia. And above all, it is a war over the kind of Europe our children will live in. Let us be frank: This conflict is about the future of freedom in Europe. No country of the former Soviet Union has made more progress toward consolidating democracy, eradicating corruption and building an independent foreign policy than Georgia. This is precisely what Russia seeks to crush. The first step in warfare is economic. With this military action against Georgia, Russia wages economic war on Europe. The analogies to Tibet extend only to an imperialistic nation consuming an independent neighbor. Russia's action is entirely different. Putin wants to control the region and Europe sits and watches while he is beginning to do just that. More from Tigerhawk about the absent anti-war movement. And, this should encourage you guys, McCain actually saw this coming. Well, so did I, but I don't think this makes me a foreign policy genius It might make Obama a dummy for not seeing it. I'm being generous here. Cross-posted at MelissaClouthier.com Rate this article: Rating: 3.7/5 (28 votes cast) Share this article! Return to Top Melissa Clouthier | 09:23 AM | (161) The Bear Resurgent The Russian invasion of Georgia is more than just a military action, it is a statement to the world that Russia is back and seeking to regain its superpower status. In a carefully chosen military action, it is essentially thumbing its nose at the West and especially NATO. I say carefully chosen because unlike the Ukraine, for instance, there is very little if anything we can do of any immediacy to help Georgia right now. Mounting any sort of military operation would be extremely difficult without the ability to support them from, say Turkey or Armenia if we're talking about ground and airforces. Getting the permission to do that is very unlikely. That leaves the sea and the same sorts of difficulties. Again, permission to pushing a fleet through narrows of the Dardanelles is not likely. It would also be of limited military value. And then we'd face a Russian Black Sea fleet. Rumors of an amphibious landing on the western coast of Georgia seem unlikely. It doesn't appear an operation like that will be necessary. Russian troops have pushed through South Ossetia into the Georgian town of Gori, effectively cutting the country in half. Tblisi is isolated to the east. The other breakaway province of Abkhazia, in NW Georgia, is also effectively in Russian hands. While Georgia pretty much brought this about by invading South Ossetia Friday, it is obvious by the quick reaction that Russia anticipated the move and was more than prepared to counter it. And their counter-attack was an overwhelming attack with a purpose. It is also obvious that the plan involved going beyond what most observers consider to be the logical stopping point if the purpose was only to repel the Georgian attack into South Ossetia. Russia, it would seem, is making a statement. One part of the statement has to do with NATO and the reality, not the promise, of the protection it does offer to those former Warsaw Pact nations (and new nations which were formed when the USSR disintegrated). Or said another way, it is demonstrating what NATO is and isn't willing to go to war over - and it seems Russia has a very good handle on that. NATO isn't going to go to war over Georgia. Nor is the US. Of course that's not what Georgia expected. As a Russian jet bombed fields around his village, Djimali Avago, a Georgian farmer, asked me: \"Why won't America and Nato help us? If they won't help us now, why did we help them in Iraq?\" A similar sense of betrayal coursed through the conversations of many Georgians here yesterday as their troops retreated under shellfire and the Russian Army pressed forward to take full control of South Ossetia. Of course the expectations of Georgians are pretty unrealistic. A) it was Georgia who started the conflict - NATO is a defensive organization which is under no obligation to back aggression by one of its members (and Georgia isn't yet a member). B) it is obvious Georgia completely miscalculated the Russian response. And C) by the time NATO or the US could actually respond in force, the conflict will be over. So back to Russia, if part of their action is to demonstrate the impotence of NATO to the new nations formed out of the old USSR, what else is it trying to say? I think it is saying it is no longer the shambling, bumbling, toothless bear of the recent past. It is demonstrating in a very visible way that it can and will again project power, at least militarily, within its region and do it both swiftly and decisively. If you don't think the Ukraine and other bordering nations aren't paying attention, you're wrong. This will, at a minimum, indeed change the balance of power within the region. While Russia is nowhere near the power it once was, it is no longer an impotent state either, and it has just served warning that it will no longer stand idly by and allow what it considers to be assaults on its sovereignty to go unanswered. How does that relate to us and what is going on in Georgia? Well, regardless of how resurgent the Russian military is, it still can't stand up to ours and they know it. So they will pick their battles carefully until they feel they're capable of doing so (if necessary). Georgia is perfect example of that. They know perfectly well that neither NATO or the US can really do much, militarily, to aid the Georgians. Russia has a 1.1 million man military, Georgia has about 37,000. The time and basing factors preclude any meaningful intervention on our part. About all we can do is put intense diplomatic pressure on them to stop the invasion and withdraw. Endgame? Most likely they \"get\" South Ossetia and perhaps Abkhazia out of the deal. I say \"get\" meaning they will exercise control over what will become \"autonomous regions.\" A bit of payback over Kosovo, whose independence the Russians opposed. Georgia will regain its sovereignty but at the price of those two areas and with the understanding that Russia holds the mortgage on it and will foreclose at the slightest provocation and there isn't much the West or NATO is willing or able to do about it.

Return to Top McQ | 08:57 AM | (13) An Interview With Ron Coleman About Legal Issues For Bloggers And Blog Readers Last week, I did a phone interview with my RWN co-blogger, Ron Coleman of Likelihood of Confusion and Likelihood of Success. Ron is one the premier internet lawyers out there and has represented numerous bloggers, myself included, in court and/or against legal bullying. What follows is an edited transcript of our conversation. What's the most common mistake you see bloggers making? What are you seeing people do that could get them sued? Well, it's fair to say that well over 90% of bloggers are not risking any legal trouble. Most people write their original thoughts, they make legitimate links, and even things like hotlinking graphics, even aside from the copyright issue, are probably not actionable. It's interesting to think about whether if you knocked out someone's website with a hotlink to a graphic, he could come after you on a trespassing theory... But, if there is any single problem that seems to consistently be out there, it's copyright infringement regarding the use of photographs from news services. Well, let's talk a little bit about that. One of the toughest areas for bloggers to make a determination about, because it's kind of nebulous in the law, is fair use. Can you give us a quick guideline to follow? How can bloggers steer clear of trouble in the copyright arena? Fair use is a great doctrine in copyright law, but it's a little hard to apply on an as-you-go basis, especially in regard to photographs. The rule of thumb on all fair use is probably at what one point are you replacing the need for readers to view the original work by providing yours? For example, the Associated Press' view regarding text is that the headline and the lead paragraph of every story may not be quoted exactly as written in a blogger's story or anywhere else because that is what they sell. Now, without acknowledging that they are right or wrong about that, it's an internally consistent position. As a general rule, you look at the percentage of work used, but what the AP is saying is in this case -- almost without regard for the rest of the story that's used -- people who are scanning a site that has paid for the Associated Press feed are looking at the headline and the first paragraph. That's the value. Beyond that kind of special case, you generally want to look at the percentage used and whether, in order to get the full value of the original work, you still need to go to the original or not. With photos, it's much more complex. I think you can make a rule of thumb regarding photographs that there is usually not a fair use basis to use anything like a recent new picture from a newspaper or some other site on your blog. All things being equal and keeping in mind that there are exceptions upon exceptions, if in doubt, when it comes to pictures, you should not display it on your website. Now many people say things online that they would never say to another person in the real world. They slander them, make threats, etc. Just to clarify, is there a meaningful legal difference between saying that sort of thing online and saying it in the \"real world?\" The real world historically has been divided into two largely conceptual spheres. ...There is a difference between what you say orally and what you say in writing. What the internet has done is given us a hybrid where we act as if we are speaking orally, but we make our comments in writing. So, technically speaking, the law will treat your written comments in the same way it would treat other written comments in a book, newspaper, magazine, or a letter. On the other hand, a court considering the defamatory effect of internet statements will inevitably consider the question of how seriously do people take comments in the comments thread of a blog? In other words, the test for defamation doesn't change, but the measure of damage would certainly be considered in the context of how authoritative and above the fold a statement is as compared to say, comment #73 in a blog that isn't (particularly well read). ...I am frequently approached with requests to deal with internet defamation situations and overwhelmingly, my advice is... ...Let me guess -- that they would be better off not (suing) because it would just draw more attention to it. Absolutely, absolutely it draws attention on so many levels and it also gives the defamer the opportunity to put you on trial for the act that you claim never took place because the fundamental question in a defamation action is whether the statement that was made about you is true. So, even if it isn't technically true, it may be damaging enough and as you say, meanwhile inevitably more attention is drawn to the cure than to the damage. It almost never pays. And people online almost always side with the person being sued. ...I think that it is the case that on the internet, there is a punky attitude that disguises itself as sort of an electronic libertarianism that is unreasonably skewed towards assuming that information wants to be free or the best antidote to a false statement is a corrective statement. I've actually written at length on this topic. Although it's true that defamation on the internet is best ignored, on the other hand, unlike all previous forms of publishing in the history of mankind, it is easier to create more damage, faster, and with fewer consequences on the internet than it ever has been before and American defamation law in particular is probably unreasonably slanted in favor of a very strong presumption against permitting defamation claims to succeed based on what the world looked like 20 years ago.... An issue that has come up more than a few times relates to the privateness of email. If someone reveals the contents of email he receives from you, whether solicited or not, do you have legal recourse? I'm not aware of any case that says releasing someone's email is actionable. So, probably not. So, if you send an email, you should be prepared for it to go public, right? ...There's a strong argument for not using your work email for any online playing. Oh yeah, I've seen lots of disasters happen related to that. Yeah, you don't want to drag your employer or your employment relationship onto the internet where you have decided to be a troll or have decided to take a controversial stand on a controversial issue. As a regular person on the internet, what sort of privacy rights do you have? It depends on where you are located. I can tell you, for example, that in Europe, they have a fetish about privacy. It also depends, for example, what you're doing. For example, registering for a website has the effect of creating a little law between you and the people who took your registration information. So, you have rights against them that you wouldn't necessarily have with strangers. The fact is that in the United States, privacy is very, very narrowly circumscribed. ...To a large extent, your problems on the internet involving privacy are not going to be solved in the court. They are just not built for that. Ron, I really appreciate your time. Rate this article: Rating: 3.4/5 (21 votes cast) Share this article! Return to Top John Hawkins | 08:15 AM | (1) 6 Big Questions About The Edwards Affair 1) Did the affair begin before Hunter began working with the campaign? If nothing was going on, why did Edwards pay a novice $114,000 to shoot a handful of videos for his campaign? 2) If Edwards' loyalist Andrew Young is really the father of Rielle Hunter's baby, why did his wife consent to having Hunter living under the same roof? 3) Can anyone seriously believe that John Edwards' supporter Fred Baron was paying off Rielle Hunter without his knowledge? 4) Did Elizabeth Edwards really know about the affair back in 2006 or is that just a cover story concocted after the fact? If she did know about the affair, why did she allow Rielle to remain on with the campaign after finding out Hunter had been copulating with her husband? 5) If John Edwards didn't love Rielle Hunter, the baby isn't his, and the affair has been over since 2006, what was he doing meeting in a hotel with her? 6) Why did Rielle Hunter decide not to take a paternity test when establishing who the \"baby daddy\" was could be worth an enormous sum in child support? Could it be because she was paid a considerable sum of money NOT to take a paternity test that would show he is the father? Furthermore, if John Edwards really believes the baby isn't his, why isn't he demanding a paternity test to put the matter to bed, once and for all? PS: I do have a working theory about why Edwards came forward with an admission of the affair that opened up all these cans of worms. There's no way to know for sure whether it's right, but it would explain what happened: ABC had the goods on Edwards and was going to do a damaging piece on the affair. ABC then came to Edwards and gave him an opportunity to do an exclusive interview rather than breaking the story. Edwards took that opportunity, but felt compelled to lie about a number of things because Elizabeth may not have known the whole truth. So, he either had to go public with a story full of holes or admit to his wife that he was still cheating on her with the woman who'd had his love child.

Part of my duty, as a professional blogger, is to read the tabloid stories that most of you are too classy to touch with a 10 ft. pole so that I can let you know whether we have another John Edwards/Rielle Hunter scandal or merely the political version of Batboy. So, when I saw this on the cover of the Globe, I knew I was going to have to step up and buy it. Long story short, according to the Globe, Bush is off the wagon and sleeping with Condi, Laura is sick of it, and they're in Splitsville. The Globe says they are already living apart and Laura is buying a home in Dallas. Is there anything to it? Well, there are three things that say there isn't. #1) There are no named sources in the piece. #2) They post a pic of Bush downing \"a cold one\" in Germany last year. However, the beer Bush is drinking is non-alcoholic. #3) They quote Bush as saying, \"Laura's over there (in Dallas) trying to buy a house. I like Crawford but, unfortunately, after eight years of sacrifice, I'm apparently no longer the decision maker.\" That quote is real; however, Laura doesn't appear to be moving to Dallas solo, Dallas County may be turning Democratic, but it's about to gain two prominent Republican residents: The Bushes are moving back to town. First lady Laura Bush was in Dallas on Thursday to introduce a national program designed to expose urban children to nature. Mrs. Bush and students from Williams Preparatory School shook a shrub and examined what fell from it. First lady Laura Bush confirmed Thursday that she and her husband will return to the area when they leave the White House in January. \"I guess I can announce it in front of the press,\" Mrs. Bush said at a National Park Foundation event at Williams Preparatory School in Dallas. \"President Bush and I will be moving back to Dallas, which is where we lived\" before Mr. Bush was elected governor in 1994, she said. \"After 14 years away, we're excited about having this chance to live here again,\" the first lady said. It's long been thought likely that the Bushes would come back to the area after his presidency, but Thursday's statement was the most definitive yet that the couple would live in Dallas, where Mr. Bush's presidential library will be built at Southern Methodist University. White House communications director Kevin Sullivan said the couple will split their time between Dallas and their ranch in Crawford. If Laura were really splitting from W., how likely is it that out of the entire US, she would choose to move to the same city where his presidential library is going to be located? It doesn't seem likely at all and neither, come to think of it, is this story in the Globe. Rate this article: Rating: 2.9/5 (21 votes cast) Share this article! Return to Top John Hawkins | 07:10 AM | (8) Mini-Movie Review: The Dark Knight Yesterday, I finally got around to seeing The Dark Knight, which looks like it's on pace to crack the $500 million dollar mark domestically. To be honest, I went in wondering if the movie would live up to the hype and for the first 30 minutes of this 2 1/2 hour long flick, things seemed a bit slow. But from there on out, this wasn't your parents' \"Biff,\" \"Boom,\" \"Kaplow,\" Batman. To the contrary, the last two hours of the movie was violent, intense, and a dark thrill ride piloted by the late, great Heath Ledger who, in his final performance, turned the Joker into one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. Additionally, for those that paid attention, there was definitely a message in there about the war on terrorism. Even though the Joker was chaotic, violent, and utterly without redeeming qualities, the people of Gotham started to treat the person doing the most to stop him, Batman, as if he were the real problem. Meanwhile, in the process, good people died, morals were tested, and the audience was left with no doubt that even though there were two sides to the fight, there was no moral equivalence between them. That being said, this wasn't a perfect film. The first 30 minutes were poorly paced, there were some unnecessary scenes throughout the movie, and the fight sequences were very pedestrian. Still, because the Joker was such a great villain and because the movie was so intense, it's still fair to say this is, at a minimum, one of the 5 best super-hero movies of all-time. So, thumbs way up to The Dark Knight. Rate this article: Rating: 3.4/5 (17 votes cast) Share this article!

We hope to release this before year end, assuming we are confident that the outputs add value and increase the breadth, depth and richness of what makes up the SMARTCROWD consensus index. Currently the index is calculated solely from prediction market data. News There's been some very significant changes in prediction market ratings since October 7th, when we last reported our ratings. The most significant changes are the extent to which Hillary Clinton has further consolidated her lead, from 65.76% to 72.15%, and the extent to which Fred Thompson has slipped in the prediction market ratings, from 21.84% to 7.49%. Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney have improved their ratings from 37.17% to 42.87% and 25.62% to 32.15% respectively.

This will be very powerful and will significantly increase the awareness of prediction markets. Go Google! We'll obviously have to start focusing on more meaningful metrics! This will be a great development. Awareness of prediction markets has progressively increased over the past 6-12 months, & especially since elements of established media have started to take interest. That's it for this time.

Here's a new chart comparing poll data against prediction market data for both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama over a 3+ month period. Polling data, which is based on publicly information available at Angus Reid Global Monitor, is usually generated from the question \"who will you vote for?\" As such, polling is a % measurement of how respondents will vote, one way or another. The prediction market (PM) data, by stark contrast, is generated from traders who are each trying to answer the question \"who do you think will win (and how certain are you of the outcome, based on a scale of 1-100)?\" There are, of course, no surprises here in terms of leader or trailer. What is more interesting though is the correlation betwen poll data and PM data over time. We'll be taking a closer look at this over the coming months. Other important data Clearly, the media influences sentiment which in turn generates price changes in prediction markets. We'll be taking a closer look at this third data set, comparing it against poll data and PM data, over the coming months, to look for different correlations. As a teaser, we took a look at a couple of new sources of data. First, take a look at Wonkosphere which measures \"buzz\" in the blogosphere; good, bad and neutral. According to current data, Hillary Clinton is generating 25% of the buzz across the top 12 candidates, while Obama scores just under 10%. Second, take a look at Hitwise a website that monitors the traffic to different candidates sites. By this measurement, Obama has a clear lead. Through analysis like this we hope to produce some useful analytics! News This weekend the FT ran Obama woos Iowa but Clinton surges, while the Economist ran the line The American presidency is Hillary Clinton's to lose. But that doesn't make her a shoo-in just yet. Right now, the polls, the prediction markets and the media all seem to be aligned in terms of how the Democratic nomination might unfold. Next week we'll take a look at the Republican data.

From the crew at SMARTCROWD August 13, 2007 SMARTCROWD Update: Election '08 The Iowa Straw Poll Mitt Romney won the Iowa straw poll this weekend with 31.5% of the vote, ahead of second placed Mike Huckabee with 18.1%. The final result contained a few surprises. The media naturally spun the outcome in different ways. The National Public Radio lead with Iowa straw poll yields limited victory for Romney, while Australia's Sydney Morning Herald took a more irreverent view separating the wheat from the chaff. The Boston Herald reported that Romney did not believe his victory was a hollow one. Time Magazine's What Iowa's straw poll tells the GOP provides a more in-depth view. While Romney was widely expected to win in Iowa, Mike Huckabee's second place is attracting attention, lifting his national profile. According to USA Today Huckabee spent just $58 per vote for 2nd place in Iowa. This is likely to keep him in the campaign for a while yet. His odds of dropping out by December 31st, dropped from 67.5% to 50% at Intrade. Rudy Giuiani, John McCain and Fred Thompson all skipped Iowa. McCain instead focused his attention on New Hampshire. There's speculation that Tommy Thompson may now scrap his Presidential bid following his 6th place showing. While Mr (T) Thompson may be looking for the exit door, there's talk brewing about Newt Gingrich wanting in. Rudy Giuliani continues to lead the national polls. Here's how the Angus Reid Global Monitor reported findings on August 12th. Prediction Markets According to the prediction markets, Giuliani continues to lead the GOP candidates in this format too. Giuliani has a SMARTCROWD rating of 31.74%, followed by Fred Thompson on 26.01% and Mitt Romney at 25.18% (trending up), following his victory in Iowa. John McCain continues to score in the single digits with a rating of 6.27%. At Intrade, Newt Gingrich is rated at 35.5% (on small volume), suggesting some believe he might actually enter the GOP nomination battle. Hillary sees off Obama In the Democratic nominee markets, Hillary Clinton further extended her lead. She now has a commanding SMARTCROWD rating of 55.65% (and trending up). According to the markets she's the clear favorite to become the Democratic Party's Presidential nominee. Barack Obama's rating slipped in the same markets; his SMARTCROWD rating is now below 30%, currently standing at 25.27% (trending down). See chart. John Edwards scored 8.25% Two's company, three's a crowd Last week, we wrote about the prospect of (perhaps only a slim chance today), the big 3 contenders for the White House in 2008, being Hillary Clinton, Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg (if he annouces he's running); all from New York. The New York Times article No, It Wouldn't Happen. Couldn't. No Way considers this prospect in depth. That's it for this week's coverage. Interesting times, indeed. August 05, 2007 SMARTCROWD Update: Election '08 From the crew at SMARTCROWD. Bloomberg - is he running? Speculation continues about New York Mayor, Mike Bloomberg, and whether he'll run as an Independent in '08. Ed Koch of the Washington Post reckons he will and explains why in his article I Like Mike. So Will You. News outlets also reported that former Democratic Senator Sam Nunn (Georgia) and Bloomberg talked about the need for an independent challenge in 2008. Read Not Running Mike is Talking from the New York Post and Bloom and I talked about Prez race: pol from the Daily News. The International Herald Tribune covered it too. Bloomberg, however, has consistently denied he is a candidate. In the prediction markets, Bloomberg is given a 41.5% probability of running at FT Predict, and 51.3% in thin trading at Inkling Markets, reflecting the constant speculation and suggesting i) it won't be a much of a surprise if he does run and ii) that traders and pundits don't place much value on his denials; making it more of a question of when, not if, in their minds. Expect this cat-and-mouse game to continue for a while; at least until its clear who the Democratic and GOP nominees are going to be. Iowa poll has Democrats all tied up According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll in Iowa, released August 3rd, the leading Democratic contenders are virtually tied in their race for the Presidential nomination in Iowa. Listen here to CNN's podcast explaining the findings. The Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire Primary are litmus tests for the national campaign and a defeat in either or both states can have a damaging impact on a candidate. The Iowa poll is at odds with national polls. Here's how the Angus Reid Global Monitor reported findings on August 4th. In the prediction markets, Hillary Clinton currently has a SMARTCROWD rating of 50.09%, extending her lead over Barack Obama whose equivalent rating is 30.58% (refer chart). John Edwards' SMARTCROWD rating is 7.85%. Hillary Clinton is now the clear favorite for the Democratic nominee, making her a genuine contender for the White House. Giuliani draws clear on the GOP side (or does he?) On the other side of politics, Rudy Giuliani secured a narrow lead among the GOP contenders, but Fred Thompson and Mitt Romney are still in contention for Republican nomination. Here's how the Angus Reid Global Monitor reported findings on August 6th. Demonstrating how open the Republican race is, however, the Washington Post-ABC News poll focusing on Iowa, favored Mitt Romney. In the prediction markets, Rudy Giuliani has a SMARTCROWD rating of 33.77%. He leads Fred Thompson at 29.08% and Mitt Romney at 21.78%. The International Herald Tribune ran the article: Rivals for Republican nomination for US President seek distance from Bush, following tonight's GOP debate in Iowa. New York, New York - two's company, three's a crowd How will New Yorkers and Americans react to the possibility - perhaps remote at this point in time - that New Yorkers Hillary Clinton, Rudy Guiliani, and Mike Bloomberg might be the last ones standing in the '08 race for the White House? Will it happen? Will it matter? What's the probability of Bloomberg (I), Clinton (D) and Giuliani (R) being the primary challengers after the DEM and GOP nominations, and after Mayor Bloomberg makes up his mind for certain? Perhaps about 10%, right now, based on current probabilities. We'd welcome hearing a more accurate calculation and/or seeing a prediction market contract to give us a regular signal. Interesting times, indeed. July 29, 2007 SMARTCROWD Update: Election '08: Clinton & Obama - rivals or running mates? From the crew at SMARTCROWD Following the CNN/YouTube debate last Monday, the Clinton and Obama camps launched a spat about foreign diplomacy, generating plenty of media coverage. While their respective camps were going at each other, others piled in too, kicking up the dust. In the prediction markets, Hillary Clinton strengthened her lead with a SMARTCROWD rating (trending up) of 46.3%. See chart, above. Barack Obama still trails Clinton with a rating of 33.31%, slightly lower than his early-July rating following his stellar fund raising performance. John Edwards' rating remains in single digits. Surprisingly (or was it?), a lot of fuss was made about a Washington Post article that referred to Hillary's neckline, sending political commentators and the media wading into a \"cleavage\" debate, generating newsprint, TV and blog coverage around the world. Elsewhere, according to CNN, Newt Gingrich today predicted that Barack Obama would be Hillary Clinton's running mate in '08. Its obviously too early to tell whether this is an insightful prediction, or simply adding political fuel to the fire, or both. But the angle, not surprisingly, is getting coverage 1, 2. Meanwhile, on the GOP side, the Republican nominee race still remains open. According to the prediction markets, Rudy Giuliani leads with a SMARTCROWD rating of 32.52% (trending up), ahead of Fred Thompson at 29.37% (trending down) and Mitt Romney at 21.38% (trendiing up). John McCain again scores just 7.2%. New York Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, continued to downplay suggestions that he will run, yet he still commands a probability rating of 33.4% (trending up) at FT Predict. Interesting times, indeed. From the crew at SMARTCROWD July 07, 2007 SMARTCROWD Update: Election '08 (Note: we're releasing this article without links (and with apologies), due to a technical hitch. We'll repair these asap, as there's some great content out there!). Prediction Markets Barack Obama is making up ground on Hillary Clinton following his outstanding fund raising efforts. Barack Obama raised a stunning $32.5m in the second quarter of this year, considerably more than Hillary Clinton and more than the top two Republicans combined, the Economist reported in its election update \"Of cash and crushes\". The gap between Hillary and Obama, whose SMARTCROWD ratings are 43.24% (trending down) and 34.49% (trending up) respectively, is now only 8.75 percentage points. See the chart, above right. At Intrade, the gap between the two rivals was just 3.8 points, while at the Iowa Electronic Markets it was 9.1 points. In the GOP nominee markets, John McCain's probability rating continues to wane. McCain's SMARTCROWD rating is now just 7.2%, which compares unfavorably with a rating of 28.57% in mid-May. That's a staggering change in sentiment. CNN reported McCain camp to undergo significant shakeup earlier this week. According to the prediction markets, Fred Thompson and Rudy Guilliani continue to lead the GOP nominee race, with SMARTCROWD ratings of 34.04% and 30.09% respectively. Mitt Romney's equivalent rating is 18.74%. According to FT Predict, the likelihood of Al Gore joining the race is 22% (Gore price chart), while the likelihood of Michael Bloomberg running as an Independent is 40.5% (Bloomberg price chart). At Inkling Markets, the corresponding prices were 47.3% 11.2% and 11.2% 47.3% respectively*. At Inkling Markets, the Gore price looks to have fallen following reports that Gore (still) has no interest in running. Expect further movements in the markets over the next 12 months as campaigning, ahead of the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, moves into full swing! July 03, 2007 America's Cup: Update From the crew SMARTCROWD. * amended PM 7/7/07 Alinghi hoists the America's Cup for a second time. Swiss yacht Alinghi successfully defended the America's Cup against New Zealand's Emirates Team after a photo-finish win in Race 7 today, taking the match series 5-2. In the run-up, New Zealand's Emirates Team defeated yachts from around the world, including Larry Ellison's BMW Oracle Racing, winning the Louis Vuitton Cup and the right to challenge Alinghi for the America's Cup, but the Kiwis failed at the last hurdle with the Swiss team proving too strong. The bitter irony is that Alinghi was skippered by Brad Butterworth from New Zealand. After putting the America's Cup defeat behind them, all New Zealanders will be pinning their sporting hopes on the mighty All Blacks who go into the Rugby World Cup tournament in France, in September, as overwhelming favorites. At Inkling Markets, the All Blacks are rated with a 51% probability of winning the Rugby World Cup. At Tradesports, the All Blacks are quoted at 68-73, on nil volume. New Zealand is one seriously competitive sporting nation, especially given its population is just under 4.2 million. June 30, 2007 America's Cup: Update From the crew at SMARTCROWD Swiss yacht Alinghi is now just one win way from defending the America's Cup following its win in Race 6 over New Zealand's Emirates Team earlier today. At Tradesports, Alinghi jumped more than 20 percentage points to 88, while Emirates dropped a similar amount to just 12.5. The Kiwis are in trouble and now need a small miracle to win, after Alinghi notched up its third win in a row to lead 4-2, in the best of nine Match series. The Guardian described it well Teams try to stay focused as the end of the America's Cup looms. It could be all over tomorrow, Sunday, if the Swiss team wins, making it the first European team to defend the trophy. More news, here. From the crew at SMARTCROWD June 24, 2007 SMARTCROWD Update: Election '08 What's new in the prediction markets? Michael Bloomberg got plenty of media coverage this week. Even though Bloomberg continues to say he's not running in '08, the media continues to speculate after he dropped his Republican Party affiliation to register as an independent. Here's how the FT covered it \"Bloomberg hints at run for President\" on Wednesday. The Economist reported \"New York's mayor flirts with an independent bid for the presidency\", while today, The New York Times ran the front page article \"President? or Kingmaker?\"; note, now behind NYT's subscription page. The prediction markets covering \"Bloomberg to run as an Independent\" responded by marking Bloomberg up. Inkling Markets moved the New York Mayor up to 47.8%, while over at Intrade, the probability rating was 45.3%, having reached a high of 50%. Democrats Hillary Clinton has cemented her lead as the likely Democratic nominee. The SMARTCROWD Index for Clinton to become \"the Democratic Party nominee\" now stands at 47.51%. Barack Obama has slipped slightly in the same markets, with a SMARTCROWD Index rating just below 30%, on a single point spread, demonstrating a consistent view across the markets we're monitoring. Both candidates continue to command considerable coverage. The Economist ran this heading \"Disliked, but still most likely\" in the Lexington article Pillorying Hillary. The FT summed up Obama's predicament, like this \"Obama tries harder, but still No.2\". John Edwards' campaign is slipping, if you believe the ratings across the various prediction markets. GOP In the GOP race, according to the prediction markets, Fred Thompson and Rudi Giulliani are neck and neck with SMARTCROWD Index ratings of 27.96% and 27.03% respectively. There's still plenty to fight for in this race..... Mitt Romney runs third with 21%, while John McCain, who has slipped significantly in recent weeks, is now just 13.6%. The polling group Angus Reid Global Monitor has similar findings. General Ratings for a GOP President in 2008 stand at 40% and 58% for a Democrat President. For the latest SMARTCROWD Index ratings for the leading GOP and DEM candidates click here>. That's it for this week! From the crew at SMARTCROWD June 09, 2007 Election '08: SMARTCROWD Update The Democrat and Republican nominees each participated in another round of debates this week. Here's how the UK's Guardian newspaper covered the Democrat's debate, while Forbes covered it in a more serious tone. Here's how TheStreet.com reported the Republican debate, while the Washington Post ran this article \"GOP hopefuls keep distance from Bush\" SMARTCROWD Index The SMARTCROWD Probability Index calculations currently *stand at: Clinton DEM Nom. 41.73%, up 1.5% Obama DEM 34.34%, unchanged** Edwards 9.04%, down 1.6% Guilliani, 26.22%, unchanged** McCain, GOP 20.05%, down 1.7% Romney, GOP Nom, 23.32%, up 0.5% Thompson (F), GOP Nom, 22.32% (first rating) DEM Pres, 59%, unchanged GOP Pres, 41%, unchanged Spreads Going forward, SMARTCROWD will periodically publish spread calculations. The spread calculation measures the gap between the lowest and highest probability ratings across the various markets that make up the SMARTCROWD Index. The lower the spread calculation, the closer prices correlate across the various markets. This is generally a good indication of a solid price/probability rating. The larger the spread the greater the pricing anomoly. This is one reason we created an index in the first place. A large spread does not automatially mean prices are being artificially pumped or dumped in any particular market. It could mean that one market is better informed than the others. Such discrepancies definitely arise when comparing play money markets (even where they have many hundred people participating) against real money markets, since play money markets often apply relatively higher ratings across a broader range of contracts in that market. The opening SMARTCROWD Spreads currently* stand as follows (please note spreads change constantly with changes in prices/probabilities in the underlying prediction markets): Clinton DEM Nom, Spread 14 pts, WSX/IEM @ 51.5% vs Inkling @ 37.5% (1.8 pts in \"for-money\" markets) Obama DEM Nom, Spread 24.5 pts, WSX @ 54.98% vs Intrade @ 30.4% (1 pt) Edwards DEM Nom, Spread 15 pts, WSX @ 21.42% vs Intrade @ 6.1% (0.6 pt) Guilliani GOP Nom, Spread 23.5 pts, WSX @43.78% vs IEM @ 20.3% (4.3 pts) Romney GOP Nom, Spread 32.5 pts, WSX @ 42.56% vs Inkling @10.1% (0.7 pt) McCain GOP, Spread 21.3 pts, WSX @ 34.3 vs IEM @ 13% (0.5 pt) Thompson GOP, Spread 9.9 pts, Intrade @ 27.9% vs Inkling @ 18% (n/a) DEM President, Spread 11.6 pts, Newsfutures @ 52% vs Inkling @ 63.6% (5.5 pts) GOP President, Spread 13.2 pts, Newsfutures @ 48% vs Inkling @ 34.8% (1.9 pts) Other news and data Thanks to techPresident for the link to OpenSecrets.Org.

Campaigning for the '08 Presidential Election is well and truly underway. Both parties have held their first round debates, which attracted plenty of media coverage. Here's how NPR.Org reported the GOP debate. Prediction Markets There's been some modest changes in the prediction markets. since we last calculated the index in mid April. According to the SMARTCROWD index, Hillary Clinton still leads the Democrat race with a rating of 41.12%, followed closely by Barack Obama at 33.92%. John Edwards slipped back a few points to 10.35%. Refer to the probability chart*, below left, comparing April and May standings. The candidates for the GOP nominee are bunched much tighter, with Rudy Giuliani and John McCain now neck and neck at 28.36% and 28.33% respectively, with Mitt Romney trailing a close third at 21.69%. Refer to the probability chart*, right, which again compares data for this month and last. John McCain clearly gained a couple of points at Rudy Giuliani's and Mitt Romney's expense, since we last measured the index based on a range of prediction market prices/probabilities*. The SMARTCROWD Index for the major contracts <click here> is shown in the top left panel. There's likely to be some changes in the markets over the next few weeks as participants respond to statements by the candidates or to events they're involved in. Expect more significant movements if either Mike Bloomberg or Al Gore (or dare we say both) declare an intention to run. So, what's new? This past week, there's been plenty of speculation that New York Mayor, Mike Bloomberg, might enter the '08 race for the White House as an independent. Here's how The Washington Post and The New York Observer each covered the buzz. Right now, Inkling Markets is the only PM covering \"Bloomberg to run as an independent\". While trading is thin, at the time of this post, Inkling quoted a probability of 44.3% on low volume of about 600 contracts. If media speculation continues, you can expect other PMs to float similar contracts, and for volumes generally to increase. While not new, the latent speculation continues to bubble up about Al Gore. The New York Times Magazine, this weekend, dedicated four pages to AG under the title \"Al Gore has big plans\". The article included the following Q&A..... A. \"I'm not issuing a Shermanesque statement because that's not where I am. I'm not ruling it out for all time. Although I cannot presently foresee any circumstances, such circumstances could emerge.\" Q. \"And such circumstances could emerge in 2008?\" A. \"It's extremely unlikely, but not impossible.\" Larry King will be interviewing Al Gore on Tuesday May 22nd. The LKL trailers are teasing the LKL audience about the choice facing Al Gore; continuing to spearhead global warming awareness and strategies to address climate change, or returning to Washington. The markets seem to think he'll choose the former, but stranger things have happened in politics. The long standing WSX contract for Al Gore as President trades at just 11.41. Continue reading \"Election '08 - More hands to play? \" \u00bb April 29, 2007 Dusting off the cobwebs* We've decided to start posting again, after a 6 month break. We're going to be sticking to a similar format <sample>, usually posting once a week or so, on average, for the next 3 to 6 months. Our focus will mostly be on politics, but we may cover some alternative markets. Uh? So the first big question, Q1. \"should any readers ever really be expected to wait 6 months for the next posting on any site?\" A1. No, obviously. Our sincere apologies therefore to one and all, especially if you actually noticed we were gone during this period. Plus, a big \"thanks\" if you're still reading this, and even more, if you return to read future posts. Q2. Should we always be expected to take such long breaks after any campaign finishes (our last coverage was of the 2006 mid-term elections)? A2. Potentially, yes, though we'll look to keep the time gaps much smaller next time, provided we can find relevant and worthy content. Why? So, what's the real reason for getting back in the saddle...... Three reasons. 1) there's plenty happening in politics right now, especially now the 2008 Election campaign has moved into second gear, with the nominees from both major parties now actively campaigning for their party's Presidential nomination. 2) there's also plenty happening in the prediction markets space more generally (more about this at a later time). For those who want to understand more about prediction markets, there's a great resource at Midas Oracle. 3) it seems the '08 election will really embrace the web and a bunch of related new technologies, even more than before, and vice versa. One small example, candidates are already posting on YouTube! See John Edwards' message for the YouChoose campaign <initial message>, followed by a <random response>, and the subsequent <Edwards' response> adding to this video conversation over the web. Who knows what role Google and other media and internet companies will play in '08? Its going to be very interesting to watch how it all unfolds through this medium. SMARTCROWD Probability Index As the campaigns get into full swing, we'll be aiming to report on any significant action in the markets, while simultaneously calculating and publishing the SMARTCROWD Probability Index, as we did in the '06 mid-terms, to give you an aggregate view of the what the different crowds are signalling across some of the more relevant markets. The index will cover Inkling Markets, Newsfutures, WSX, Casual Observer (after it morphs into PredictionXchange) and other major markets like Intrade. We've published our initial Probability Indexes (for April) <click here, if you are linking from an email or feed reader>, covering most of the leading GOP and Democrat nominees. We also have published an index rating for the expected likelihood of a Democratic President, currently at 60% or a Republican President, currently at 40%, following the '08 election. The SMARTCROWD Probability Index, based on a range of prediction markets, recently showed Democratic nominee John Edwards at 13.28%, trailing Barack Obama, at 31.73% and Hillary Clinton, at 40.57%.

Dec 31 Another Birthday, Christmas, New Year. Uncategorized 7 Comments \u00bb ( Find it in Debian Experimental, Kubuntu Gutsy Backports, and Kubuntu Hardy ) Well its been a while since my last post and since I've celebrated my 29th Birthday on December 19th, Spent a wonderfull Christmas with my family ( pictures for both here ), and getting ready to ring 2008 ! Sitting here thinking about what I want to accomplish in 2008 I only have a few easy to reach goals IMHO : Make it to 4 Linux confrences this year ( Penguicon, Ubuntu Developers Summit [ 1 of 2 ], SCALE, and Ubuntu Live ) Give atleaste 1 talk at a OpenSource Confrence, and run 1 Local \"Package Jam\" here in Kansas City Quit Smoking Cigarettes Decide between a eeepc or Mac Book for my next \"mobile\" machine Upgrade all my systems to use FL/OSS friendly vendors like Dell,Intel,Apple etc. ( I'm not talking 100% ideal companies, but ones that atleaste show some effort ) Keep and install of Ubuntu GNOME arround alongside my Main Kubuntu KDE ( I'm still a kde guy through and through, but its good to see the \"other side\" from time to time ) Blog and Post Photos ( to flickr ) more Regularly Also on a side note this year I've introduced all my imediate family members to Ubuntu and they all continue to use it ( Wife, Stepfather, Brother, and Mother ) instead of XP or Vista, My \"support\" phone calls have basicly dissapeared. And with that, I wish every one a safe and Happy 2008... May this be the year of the Linux Des... ahh nevermind, yall enjoy the holiday. Dec 21 New Computer Followup Uncategorized 4 Comments \u00bb First of all a GIANT thank you to all who made this possible. It was hugely a success. Today the parts arrived to piece my system back together , I'm typing this post on it as we speak. This means I'll be able to get alot more done in a sane amount of time, in fact kdebindings-kde4 is calling my name tonight ( was far too large to compile before ). For those of you interested in the new system specs here they are: AMD with nForce Chipset and onboard Nvidia 6100 GPU Lots of USB 2.0 ports and all the other standard ports Time to get all my disk configurations and such upto-date :) Dec 07 Baby Steps Uncategorized 6 Comments \u00bb Everyone have a Happy and Safe Holiday Season ! Well the last few days I have updated many things in a lot of different areas, the most noticeable right away is I have updated my website theme, I'm still not 100% happy with it, link colors are a bit off and such but its \"good enough\" to go live, if your reading this via an RSS feed go check out my main page and drop me some feedback. ( if your really interested in the theme and want it for your own website you can grab it at http://www.imbrandon.com/misc/human_0.5.tar.gz I've released it under GPLv2 , its not perfect but its exactly what I'm running as of this writing. ) The next thing is I changed ISP from Comcast Cable ( ugh ) to Yahoo! Branded AT&T 6M/768k DSL, not only is this faster and cheaper than my old connection, it has the nice side effect of giving me a flickr Pro account free* ( *included in the connection price somehow I'm sure ), that brings us to the next change ... I've started using my flickr pro account and am loving it, with things like the fuse filesystem FlickrFS and kFlickr makes using flickr easy and painless.

Surely I will be called a racist for saying this, but I never thought otherwise, from the very first time I read about this at telegraph.co.uk a while back. The triggers in my mind that Powell would join Team Obama were that Powell is Black and a great majority of Blacks are for Obama (nothing racist about this, huh?), and Powell's wife had previously expressed her concern that he would become the target for \"racist\" assassins. At the time she said it I thought that comment a bit strange and yes, somewhat racist (I figured that both Powell and his wife shared similar distorted views of America). So, surprised about Powell's decision? Of course you're not! Besides, golly gee, where else have we heard such a comment? (Hint - think \"Angry\" Michelle) Of course Powell's wife said it first, but \"angry Michelle\" took it a step further by saying a Black man in America just has to expect that could happen and Barack could even get shot just going to the gas station (I guess Michelle wasn't aware that 93 percent of blacks are killed by someone of their own race). And then there's this clue back in January of this year:On the eve of the New Hampshire primaries, Powell reflected on his experience eight years ago when faced with the decision of whether or not to run for president. He told Smiley that he is \"taking joy\" in the Illinois senator's success, and encouraged Americans to \"enjoy this moment where a person like Barack Obama can knock down all of these old barriers that people thought existed with respect to the opportunities that are available to African Americans.\"How odd and racist of me for never having considered that a man's color had anything to do with his qualifications for being president or that the good of my country takes precedence over color-related issues. . Take for example the fact that there's no way in hell that I'd ever vote for Barack Obama to even be dogcatcher - he's just not qualified, and has far too many radical and shady friends and associates to be president, but there was a time before I found out more about his positions (far too liberal) that I sure as hell would have voted for Colin Powell.

Boone Pickens' \"Pickens Plan\" to move our nation from foreign oil dependence to domestically produced wind power and natural gas fuel for automobiles. The plan that's touted as a cleaner, more eco-friendly alternative to our current reliance on coal power and gasoline., is a big time money maker for its investors. It's quite an interesting and profitable scheme. Madam Speaker is clearly a sleaze bag. While Pickens deserves credit for coming up with a creative plan to reduce dependence on foreign oil (and Pelosi deserves condemnation for letting her personal agenda get in the way of what's right for America), America can't let itself be fooled into thinking that drilling here and drilling now isn't desperately needed for the foreseeable future. Developing alternative energy is going to not only take a long time, but the then necessary development of the infrastructure and conversion to such energy will take even longer. We are not going to abandon gas and oil any time soon, no matter what the loudest advocates of renewable energy sources insist. As a writer noted at Fosters.com, a sane energy policy will require tuning in to a program of multiple sources. Fossil fuels -- developed and yet to be developed -- wind power nearing a scope envisioned by T. Boone Pickens, solar power, nuclear power, biomass, geothermal power and sources we haven't thought of yet are in our future - as in waaay in our future.

That is certainly the case with Obama, who is far more of a media favorite than Edwards ever was and has, with the help of the influential Associated Press (AP), carefully concealed his relationship with an identified CPUSA member.Is the next major disgrace and embarrassment for the mainstream media it's failure and outright refusal to report Obama's associations with Frank Marshall Davis. As Kincaid points out in his piece, the key to understanding Obama is knowing about and understanding the degree of Davis's influence over him during his high-school years in Hawaii. This relationship helps explain why he would later associate with terrorists, communists and socialists. Is this a job for the National Enquirer?

(Updated) John Hawkins suggests that Barack Obama's race, contrary to what the Dems have argued, is actually his primary asset, not his biggest liability. However, given Obama's liabilities as described by John - \"no experience, terrible judgment, isn't particularly bright, is gaffe prone, arrogant...he will be one the least capable, least promising, and least qualified,\" (John failed to mention that BHO's a Marxist with no real moral or family values of his own that relate to mainstream America) my personal opinion is that Obama's race is the ONLY damned asset he's got, not just his \"primary\" asset. To be blunt, if Obama wasn't Black and hadn't had the good fortune of having a myth conjured up for him and then marketed by the David Axelrod team with the help of a blatently biased left-wing media, he'd still be known as the cheap (check that - I forgot about Rezko, etc.) south side, Black nationalist, far left Chicago politician that he in fact still is. As Stanley Kurtz said in his piece, Barack Obama's Lost Years, as details of Obama's early political career emerge into the light, his associations with such radical figures as Reverend Jeremiah Wright, Father Michael Pfleger, Reverend James Meeks, Bill Ayers, and Bernardine Dohrn look less like peculiar instances of personal misjudgment and more like intentional political partnerships. This is the real Barack Hussein Obama, he is Black, he has been professionally marketed, and has absolutely no qualities that make him worthy of being president - except his ability to take advantage of liberal White guilt and the naive emotions of the less informed among us, of which there are unfortunately, a large number.

Jonah Goldberg frames it nicely:[...] During Obama's make-believe presidency, we've heard about bold action, about the courage to talk to dictators. When faced with a real \"3 a.m. moment,\" Obama -- who boasts about 200 foreign policy advisors, broken into 10 subgroups -- proclaims, \"I'm going to get some shave ice.\" [...] The campaign significance for Obama is easier to calculate. He has been playacting at being presidential in order to convince voters that we live in a \"new moment\" with \"new challenges\" -- and that he is the president we need for this new era. This moment calls for more than playacting, yet Obama looks lost without a presidential script. Events in the Caucasus -- and, for that matter, in Beijing -- suggest that the times aren't so new after all. Two powerful antidemocratic foes are once again flexing their muscles at a moment when America seems weak and distracted. That is not a new challenge but a very old one. Perhaps this is not a time for a novice spouting grand rhetoric about a new page in history, but for someone who's actually read the pages of some old, but still relevant, books. Perhaps this is not the time for playacting.Continue reading, \"Obama without his script.\" As Paul at Powerline notes, contrary to the Klutz Obama (my description not Paul's), John McCain \"has a huge leg-up on foreign policy and military matters will translate into a huge leg-up for our country, if we still care enough about world, and about our national security, to elect him president\":McCain's intense interest in foreign policy and military issues, combined with excellent instincts, gives him a huge leg-up in these matters, and not just as compared to the woefully inexperienced Barack Obama. This was evident when it came to the surge in Iraq. It is also evident from the fact that McCain has had the correct line on Russia and the intentions of Putin with respect to Russia's neighbors. Here is McCain discussing this matter in 2007. Watch for his pet line: \"I looked into Putin's eyes and I saw three letters -- a K, a G, and a B.\" Posted by Richard at 6:59 PM | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0) John Kerry Visits Illegal Alien Hangout Watch as John Kerry comes out of the Padaria Brazil bakery in Framingham Mass. where the illegal aliens stand outside looking for work.

Release the tapes. Create immediate pressure that deprives him of oxygen.What tape or tapes is he referring to in his memo? Is he referring to the same tapes discussed in this HuffPo piece saying they're \"innocent\"? I find it hard to believe that this late in the game any \"data tapes\" that could damage Obama that in fact do exist, haven't shown up yet.

It comes from the editorial board of the Washington Post today and destroys the Democrats' (particularlly Pelosi's, Reid's, and Obama's) claims that drilling is pointless because the United States has only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves; the oil companies aren't using the leases they already have; and drilling is environmentally dangerous. The WaPo piece makes mince meat of the myths about drilling propagated in the latest anti-drilling full page ads put out by the the Natural Resources Defense Council (best known for its extreme liberal positions and alarmist rhetoric) that decry offshore drilling for oil as \"George W. Bush's Gasoline Price Elixir\" that is \"100% Snake Oil, and shows their ad to be nothing less than pure \"poppycock\" (my use of the word, not WaPo's) Redstate suggests that with the Washington Post taking this line on new drilling the chances improve that the Congress will actually act on this issue, and indeed, that may be beginning to happen already as a result of the House oil party.

According to Pipes, an estimated forty Al-Qaeda sympathizers or operatives have sought to penetrate U.S. intelligence agencies:Westerners are indebted to Muslim agents like Fred Ghussin and \"Kamil Pasha\" who have been critical to fighting terrorism. That said, I stand by my 2003 statement that \"There is no escaping the unfortunate fact that Muslim government employees in law enforcement, the military and the diplomatic corps need to be watched for connections to terrorism.\"Read it all here ... As Pipes goes on the note in his piece, one must wonder what catastrophe must occur before government agencies, some of which have banished the words \"Islam\" and \"jihad,\" seriously confront their internal threat? I would add to his comment that there are many liberally-minded, politically correct American citizens that have the same problem as the government agencies that banish the words \"Islam\" and \"jihad,\" and fail to take both the internal threat and the threat from radical Islamists all over the world, to the survival of our culture and Western civilization.

God forbid he did so and picked up one of those \"3 AM calls.\" As the Minority Report points out in Obama And McCain Contrast In The Response To Russian Attack On Georgia, the Obama approach stresses negotiation, while the McCain approach stresses action. The Obama approach appears passive, while the McCain approach is aggressive. And there is no clearer delineation between the two candidates than the last lines of their two statements:Sen Obama (the buffoon and \"great pretender\": \"Let me be clear: we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the Russian government, and friendship with the Russian people. We want Russia to play its rightful role as a great nation - but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century, not regression to the conflicts of the past. That is why the United States and the international community must speak out strongly against this aggression, and for peace and security.\"Sen McCain, the grandmaster: \"Our united purpose should be to persuade the Russian government to cease its attack, withdraw its troops, and enter into negotiations with Georgia. We must remind Russia's leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values, stability and peace of that world. World history is often made in remote, obscure countries. It is being made in Georgia today. It is the responsibility of the leading nations of the world to ensure that history continues to be a record of humanity's progress toward respecting the values and security of free people.\"The Obama approach is about touchy/\"feely\" Hope and Change. The McCain approach is about concrete action to bring about that touchy/\"feely\" hope and change. Call it a pre-election \"3 AM call - test,\" and the buffoon failed it.

Labels: crafty, do want, etsy, mixtape, silkscreen, wallet Saturday, February 02, 2008 fact: staying in on a saturday night might lead to impossibly long-winded & reflective blog posts. i don't make resolutions because i feel like i'm setting myself up for failure...ha. but, i did make a semiconscious effort to not partake of one of my most superficially-rewarding activities for the duration of january: shopping. this was partially because i am perpetually broke. also partially because i feel pangs of guilt when i purchase $20 babydoll dresses from forever 21 that will last all of 3 months and/or 12 8 wearings (both due to quality & my fashion fickleness/short attention span) and whose manufacturing & inevitable elimination from my wardrobe only add to my environmental impact in these trying ecological times. *i will say, however, that i am a clothes (w)hor(e)der & also rarely throw anything away, instead donating it or bringing my castoffs to our semi-regular clothing swap. so i guess i'm not as horrible as i could be. so, last month i decided not to buy any clothing - after all, i received a few goodies for christmas and really, do i need any more clothes? probably not, but i do love the fashion. baby steps here people! i was almost successful too - save one minor purchase which was a product of a severe fashion emergency (jess's going away dinner & party last weekend). hey, desperate times call for fashionable measures. and i justified it threefold: a) it was on super sale b) it was from a local boutique so i was supporting a small business owner (who happens to be a woman - lookin' out for the laaaadies) and c) it is seasonally versatile & i can wear it pretty much year round in SF - layered with tights & long sleeves in the winter, on it's own on the two days out of the year it's actually warm enough to go bare armed & legged. so january was a successful experiment, in my book. and now, inspired by natalie's 2008 decision to follow the compact movement (and her new blog documenting her progress), i think i'm going to try to keep up with curtailing my shopping. also, when i do shop, i'm going straight vintage/used in the clothing department (hello, ebay wonderland!) - except for things like undergarments, duh. i will also aspire to purchase only used items in other shopping categories when warranted & possible. in other, related news, i signed up for mint.com and have been tracking my spending trends and boy do i spend a nice chunk of change on coffee. i already know this, and it's an extravagance i allow myself to indulge thankyouverymuch, BUT it also got me thinking - that's a lot of disposable coffee cups i go through! for shame! even though i recycle them, it's just a little ridonkadonk to be that wasteful. so tomorrow i have decided to invest in a travel mug. and yes, i will probably buy a NEW one, but i'm justifying that purchase by knowing i will no longer be discarding to go cups at an alarming rate. go me. i'd promise regular updates on my progress with this non-resolution but we all know i'm a sporadic blogger these days. maybe rectifying that situation will be next on my list... ---------------- Now playing: The Helio Sequence - Can't Say No via FoxyTunes Labels: blah blah blah, ch-ch-ch-ch-changes, shopping, yes i'm at home on a saturday night Thursday, January 31, 2008 what YOU should be doing friday night! nevermind the rain, it's time to ROCK! come one, come all - celebrate bagel radio's 5th birthday with a few hundred of your rock n roll friends! get your tickets here - and see you tomorrow, yes?!?

WHO IS THIS? i know this band...ummmm, this song is awesome! crap. ryan, look it up on your iPhone NOW!\" - after 30 seconds of surfing the intarwebz via handheld mobile device we got our answer: it was superdrag - \"sucked out\"! unfortunately, even though manlio texted me the name of the song & the band AND ryan emailed me the link, i accidentally deleted the text and the url didn't work when i tried to utilize it this week...ack! as you know, these unanswered musical questions are unacceptable to me. i had to figure it out or there would be a hole in my heart that could only be filled by tracking down this very important information! luckily, after some diligent research on ryan's part (again. what would i do without the ryan king?!?), my prayers were answered and this gem popped up in my inbox this morning. yay! i can't believe this song is twelve years old. wow. and remember 120 minutes? matt pinfield, i miss you! someone needs to do a web show in that format. (wait - maybe *i* should do it...don't steal my idea!) in any event, i was so inspired by discovering this little nugget of ear-joy that i bought the whole album and will be revisting the rock of my adolescence this afternoon. huzzah! good story, huh? ;) Labels: friends are teh awesome, music, sleuthy, superdrag Wednesday, January 23, 2008 i feel it all. \"wild card inside, wild card inside\" the trifecta of feist videos is complete! ha. this was my theme song of 2007 - last year was all about FEELIN'.

Performics was part of the DoubleClick acquisition Google completed in March. What Is Google Earth? Disney in 3D With Google Earth How to Turn on Featured Layers in Google Earth While there's nothing wrong with Performics, it's an SEO (search engine optimization) service.

Google Page Creator Is Leaving Tuesday August 5, 2008 Linda Roeder thinks getting rid of Page Creator is a huge mistake, but it seems like the most logical step to me.

They've shut down new accounts. If you've got an existing account, it will be moved over to Google Sites over the next year. I wondered why they had two very similar products, and I guess Google had the same thoughts. Google Sites has better collaboration features and more options for file sharing, so it is logical for it to stay, and I'm sure options like AdSense will be added to it at some point. Google Page Creator still had the better name. \"Sites\" is just too vague.

In this post, Scott also offers, quite magnanimously, to setup and host subversion repositories for any mathematician who happens to want to start collaborating using subversion. Which, to my mind, immediately prompts the question: why stop there? I've had ideas about setting up a free and easy to use platform for modern communication in the mathematical community before; but they were along the lines of duplicating wordpress.com's efforts; which isn't really something that pays off on your efforts. Reading this, though, raised a new idea.

He has, recently, written a post inspired by the xkcd comic on purity in the sciences. The comic is funny, and rings true, but Ben brings up a severe criticism of the premises of the comic that rings back to my own years as a hotheaded undergraduate.

We've been trying to get a new teaching session together since early February, but they had a hell of a time all through February, and all our appointments ended up canceled with little or no notice; and then I spent March and April on tour. We pressed on with knot theory. Today, we discussed knot sums, prime knots, knot tabulation, behavior of the one invariant (n-colorability) we know so far under knot sums, Dowker codes, and we got started on Conway codes for knots. Next week, I plan for us to finish up talking about the Conway knot notation, get the connection between rational knots and continued fractions down pat, and start looking into new invariants.

It has been very much fun - traveling the world, talking about my research and meeting people I only knew electronically - and also very intense. To break the lull, I thought I'd try to pick up what I did last summer: parallel computing on clusters. It's been a bit of blog chatter about SAGE and how SAGE suddenly has transformed from a Really Good Idea to something that starts to corner out most other systems in usability and flexibility. Matlab? SciPy bundled with SAGE and the Python integration seems to be at least as good, if not better. This is a preview of Parallel and cluster computing with MPI4Py.

I'm booked at several different seminars to do the following: Title: On the computation of A-infinity algebras and Ext-algebras Abstract: For a ring R, the Ext algebra carries rich information about the ring and its module category. The algebra is a finitely presented k-algebra for most nice enough rings. Computation of this ring is done by constructing a projective resolution P of k and either constructing the complex or equivalently constructing the complex . By diligent choice of computational route, the computation can be framed as essentially computing the homology of the differential graded algebra . Being the homology of a dg-algebra, has an induced A-infinity structure. This structure, has been shown by Keller and by Lu-Palmieri-Wu-Zhang, can be used to reconstruct R from This is a preview of Tour dates. Read the full post (286 words, 8 images) . Introduction to Algebraic Geometry (3 in a series) A-infinity, Conferencing, Mathematics, PhD, Topology, Travel I'm going to move on with the identification of geometric objects with functions from these objects down to a field soon enough, but I'd like to spend a little time nailing down the categorical language of this association. Basically, we have two functors I and V going back and forth between two categories. And the essential statement of the last post is that these two functors form an equivalence of categories. Now, first off in this categorical language, I want to nail down exactly what the objects are. In the category the objects are solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. And in the category , the objects are finitely presented Noetherian reduced k-algebras. The functor acts on objects by sending an algebra R to the solution set of the polynomial equations generating the ideal in a presentation of the algebra.

Hence, I won't take the usual course such an introduction would take, but rather set the stage reasonably quickly to make the transit to the more abstract themes clear. But that's all a few posts away. For now, recall that we recognized already that any variety is defined by an ideal, and that intersections and unions of varieties are given by sums and intersections or products of ideals. This is the first page of what is known as the Algebra-Geometry dictionary. The dictionary is made complete by a pair of reasonably famous theorems. I won't bother proving them - the proofs are a good chunk of any decent commutative algebra course - but I'll quote the theorems and discuss why they matter.

Read the full post (565 words, 11 images) Introduction to Algebraic Geometry (1 in a series) Algebra, Algebraic geometry, Geometry, Mathematics I'm growing embarrassed by my lack of understanding for the sheaf-theoretic approaches to algebraic (and differential) geometry. I've tried to deal with it several times before, and I'm currently reading up on Algebraic Geometry again to fill the void that the finished thesis, soon arriving travels and non-existent job application responses produce. So, why not learn by teaching? It's an approach that has been pretty darn good in the past. So I thought I'd write a sequence of posts on algebraic geometry, introducing what it's supposed to be about and how the main viewpoints develop more or less naturally from the approaches taken. Varieties The basic objective of algebraic geometry is to study solution sets to systems of polynomial equations. That is, we take some set of polynomials in some polynomial ring over some field . And we write for the set of all simultaneous roots to all these polynomials: This is a preview of Introduction to Algebraic Geometry (1 in a series).

(79 words) PROPs and patches Brent Yorgey wrote a post on using category theory to formalize patch theory. In the middle of it, he talks about the need to commute a patch to the end of a patch series, in order to apply a patch undoing it. He suggests a necessary condition to do this is that, given patches P and Q, we need to be able to find patches Q' and P' such that PQ=Q'P', and preferably such that Q' and P' capture some of the info in P and Q. However, as such, this is not enough to solve the issue. For one thing, we can set Q'=P and P'=Q, and things are the way he asks for. Now, I wonder whether we can solve this by using PROPs (or possibly di-operads or something like that). Let's represent a document as a list of some sort of tokens. We'll set the set of all lists of length , and we'll set to denote operations that take a list of length n and returns a list of length m. This is a preview of PROPs and patches.

And I've worked on getting the corrections in quickly. The last push started yesterday, when I got a bunch of corrections in the morning, had the last draft ready at 4pm, and then sat reading it myself until 1am. My advisor took it home with him, spent the evening on it, and had his batch of corrections in the morning. Hence, today at 10-ish when I got myself in to the office, I had two batches of corrections in front of me, and a printer closing at 2pm. So I worked - and now, well, it's done. That's it. It'll get printed. Then read. In May, we should get all the comments back from the external examiners. This is a preview of Thesis written.

Today, we'll abandon algebraic topology completely, and instead go into knot theory. I'll want to discuss what we mean by a knot (embedding of in ), what we mean by a knot deformation (thus introducing isotopies while we're at it) and the Reidemeister moves. Also we'll discuss knot invariants - and their use analogous to topological invariants. Later on, we'll continue with other invariants; definitely including the Jones polynomial, and possibly even covering Khovanov homology. One possible end report would be to explain a bunch of knot invariants and show using examples how these have different coarseness. (149 words, 2 images) Edited to add: I got myself some damn smart students. They figured out the Reidemeister moves on their own - as well as minimal crossing number in a projection being highly relevant - with basically no prompting from me. I'm impressed. Algebraic surface toys! 10th grade topology, Geometry, Mathematics, Topology At the start of the German Year of Mathematics, the Oberwolfach research institute has released an exhibition and the software they used to produce it. The software, surfer, is a really nice GUI that sits on top of surf and lets you rotate and zoom your algebraic surfaces as well as pick colours very comfortably. They have a whole bunch of Really Pretty Images at the exhibition website, and I warmly recommend a visit. If you can get hold of the exhibition, they also have produced real models - with a 3d-printer - of some of the snazzier surfaces, so that one could have a REALLY close encounter with them. But also, I'd really like to show you some of my own minor experiments with the program. This is a preview of Algebraic surface toys!.

I bought one book - Adams' Knot book, with free shipping, for $22. And I drooled over one more - Kozlov's Combinatorial Algebraic Topology. The hardcover was down from $99 to $70 at the congress stand, but still was WAY outside my own budget capabilities. Now, this book does algebraic topology on simplicial complexes. It does everything I've wanted a reference for with simplicial complexes. And at some point, I'll REALLY need to get it. I listened to a bunch of talks on Mathematics and Arts - including one on knitting hyperbolic pant crotches for toddlers - and one on an analysis of a combinatorial game on graphs: \"Flee from the Zombies\" - very entertaining. I also spent an hour talking about the historical background of -algebras and bialgebras with one of Ron Umble's students. This is a preview of AMS-MAA JMM 2008 Liveblogging, day 4 - final day.

I overslept, went to the convention center, and realized that I had forgotten my badge. Back to the hotel, and then back to the convention center. By the time I got there, the first talk I wanted to hear - one on a generalization of Kuratowski's theorem to simplicial complexes - was already over by the time I got there. So instead, I learned beading. I did two prototype versions of small and neat little Borromean rings in golden seed beads and blue, shimmering bugle beads. The SF fan / knitter / crafter who taught me was busy doing earrings in the shape of torus knots. Gorgeous. She has a plan for doing triple torus knots (solid spirals with bugle - seed - bugle - seed - bugle - seed) interlinked like Borromean rings.

And yet, I had trouble finding anything in the talks I wanted to hear. i woke up, went down to the employment schedule, and fetched my interview schedule. Then I went to Frank's pancake house and ate their World Famous Apple Pancake. The thing was 20cm high, covered a full plate and incredibly delicious. It also cost more than I expected to spend on breakfasts, but splurging once is alright. Then I walked around, doing nothing much, and checked out the universities I was assigned to interview with on the web. Small. Teaching oriented. And in small towns. Both of them. First interview went well enough, though I doubt I'll want to go there and I doubt they'll want me either. I'm not convinced that a university whose main claim to desirability is their pre-veterinary and equestrian programs will agree with my severe horse allergy.

If nothing else, the storm that hit the Californian seaboard on January 4th ensured that. I get out of bed at 3.30am, CET, not having been able to sleep particularly well at all. At 4am, I drag myself out to the taxi; which charges more to get me to the airport shuttle than the airport shuttle itself does to get me out to the airport. I don't care that much - I need the coddling at that ungodly hour. Checking in and going down to Frankfurt is uneventful.

(70 words) The year 2007 in review From each month, the first sentence of the first post. January: I decided on a whim to look in at the Dilbertblog, where the top post at the moment has Scott Adams calling all atheists that discuss on the net irrational, using a rather neat strawman carbon copy of most discussions of faith between believers (i.e. mostly Christians) and atheists he has seen on the web. February: The second carnival of mathematics is up over at Good Math, Bad Math. March: I just met up with the workgroup in the Deutsche Mathematikervereinigung (German Association of Mathematicians) with interest spanning \"Information and Communication\" - which turns out to mean that they care about libraries, about communicative tools for mathematicians, and spend their time thinking about these things, and meeting at conferences. April: The website/forumsite Mathetreff, run by the Bezirksregierung (region government) D\u00fcsseldorf, just performed a mail interview with me. This is a preview of The year 2007 in review. Read the full post (294 words) Papers status Blogs, Meme, Metablogging I just received my first ever referee's report. Yikes! Suffice to say, the report did not, as some I've seen blogged about, tear me a new one. Far from it - it was civil, kind, and pointed out several areas where my article text overlapped known arguments from other people and was generally superfluous as well as several areas where my article was too curt and didn't actually spell out the new ideas sticking in it. Also, making the relation of my results and those I rely on to the results of the Grand Old Man in applying -techniques in group cohomology explicit and discuss these in more detail was requested. I know I couldn't expect to write The Perfect Article as my first submission ever. And it's not a flat out denial. And it brings constructive comments about how to make this a better article. Still, I think my ego needs a little bit of training to learn to cope with this part of the review process. (169 words, 1 image) Planning the future The last meeting with my 10th grade topology kids this year just finished. We introduced singular homology, calculated the singular homology of a point and discussed homeomorphism invariance. Next term, we'll want to show homotopy invariance and that the singular and simplicial homology coincide when applicable. After that, we'll change directions slightly. The future after that holds knot theory, was decided today. We'll want to introduce knots, look at Reidemeister moves and basic knot invariants. I use basic here in a pretty wide sense - we'll probably do the Jones polynomial and we might even end up doing Khovanov homology if I feel particularly insane late spring. (108 words) Riding the Google Charts API bandwagon Last week, the news hit the blogosphere that Google had released a beta API for generating graphs using a reasonably easy and transparent GET parametrisation. Inspired by this, and inspired by my early playing around with Ruby on Rails, I decided to whack together a Rails plugin that takes care of building the Google Charts IMG tag using what I hope is reasonably easy to use syntax. I have a test-site using random data up for playing around with it. The test-site as such runs on Ruby on Rails. The controller does some parsing and setting up of relevant arrays, and primarily generates random data for plotting. The view has the following source code: a preview of Riding the Google Charts API bandwagon.

And one of the things that makes Rails so Damn Neat is that if you only set things up the right way around, it guesses almost everything you need it to guess for you. One of the ways it does this is by pluralization. Basically, the model Foo has a model defined in app/model/foo.rb and it accesses the database table foos. So, when talking a good friend through the basics, we created the table persons and generated the model Person. And promptly got an error from the framework.

The last postdoc carnival for 2007 is coming to town, and given my current position in my career, I thought I'd try to slowly edge into that arena as well. A short background blurb for those who haven't read this blog before - and for those who haven't heard the story: I'm a mathematics PhD student from Sweden in Germany, living apart from my wife for about 2\u00bd years now. She has a position waiting for her in Michigan, and my advisor told me to get that thesis written and go for a postdoc to stay at least on the same continent. Hence, I currently try to finish up my thesis (progressing surprisingly well!) and land postdoc positions for fall 2008 (~25 applications out, contacts duly notified, and a LOT of job search angst). This is a preview of Reaching for the postdoc world doorknocker. Read the full post (282 words) Synaesthesia and cognition So, there is this one condition called synaesthesia, where basically perception gets crosslinked. Most commonly, numbers, letters, and words get colours coupled to them. This way around, I have a few friends who I know have it. The more exotic varieties couple more or other senses to each other. The whole thing gets Really Interesting, and ties in to quite a bit of philosophy as well, when you start coming near the really odd cases. Qualia are the philosophical term for \"how things are perceived by us\". Basically, it boils down to the following: if I see something red, is this intrinsic to the object, or something existing in my perceptive neurons only? And so far, arguing about it has been more or less all there was. At least known to me. This is a preview of Synaesthesia and cognition. Read the full post (224 words) It's carnival time!

The next couple of weeks will be spent doing homology of simplicial complexes, singular homology, equivalence of the two, neat things you can do with them; and then we'll start moving towards a Borsuk-Ulam-y topological combinatorics direction. I might end up pulling combinatorics papers from my old \"gang\" in Stockholm on graph complexes, and graph property complexes, and poke around those with them. (104 words) Beef sous vide 10th grade topology, Combinatorics, Geometry, Homology and Homotopy, Mathematics, Topology I tried out an idea from Khymos recently when inviting a bunch of friends over for a party. We took six slices, about 1100g, of beef entrec\u00f4te and rubbed them all over with vodka (in order to minimize the risk of getting for instance botulism growth in the heating process). These were then put in an ordinary plastic bag and into a 60 degree (+- ~7 degrees - I monitored it reasonably closely, but couldn't keep it within a few degrees of 60) water bath. Alas, once I started the water bath, I forgot about the camera I had to document the whole process with, so I probably should repeat it with more photos sometime later on.

First off, we'll start with a definition: The wreath product is defined for groups G,H and a G-set X by the following data. The elements of are tuples . The trick is in the group product. We define (or possibly with a lot of inverses sprinkled into those indices) Consider, first, the case of with the nontrivial G-action defined by gx=1, g1=x. We get 8 elements in the wreath product . Thus, the group is one of the groups with 8 elements - . We shall try to identify the group in question using orders of elements as the primary way of recognizing things. Consider an element ((x,y),z). This is a preview of Wreath products.

However, I do note that the mathematics department in Sydney is located in a building as drab and boring as the Stockholm University main building. Its main architectural feature is the pale, washed out blue panels on the upper parts of the hollow concrete slab. Just a short way away, though, we find the Quadrangle - a cathedral in the religion of learning, and the main building of Sydney campus. Complete with stained glass windows and stucco heraldic designs, all dedicated to the branches of scholarship.

And after wrestling a LOT with the assistant, I ended up being able to prove some pretty basic group theory results. And this is how it goes: Section Groups. Variable U : Set. Variable m : U -> U -> U. Variable i : U -> U. Variable e : U. Hypothesis ass : forall x y z : U, m x (m y z) = m (m x y) z. Hypothesis runit : forall x : U, m x e = x. Hypothesis rinv : forall x : U, m x (i x) = e. This sets the stage. It defines a group as a group object in Set, but without the diagonal map. It produces a minimal definition - the left identity and inverse follow from the right ones, which we shall prove immediately. This is a preview of Coq and simple group theory.

And M-x set-variable LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix didn't do anything close to what I expected. Today, I, on a whim, go and search the auctex mailing list archives for this. And lo and behold! One of the first messages tells me that I need to do M-x customize-variable LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix.

These times that are too short for productive work - where I know from the beginning that I cannot sit down and do something - too little time for reading, for coding, for writing, for .. well .. anything. And yet, while trying to get through them, they are obviously too long. An hour here, an hour there, interspersed with lunch, then coffee, then a seminar, and all of a sudden out of an 8 hour workday, the only vaguely productive thing that got done was hearing the seminar.

(Map from CIA - The World Factbook) The Daily Dish had a reader make the following statement: \"...It claimed that there are a majority of ethnic Russians in South Ossetia. In fact, the majority are Ossetians, a small Iranic-Language speaking group.\" (original here) I have no special knowledge of the linguistic diaspora in this region, so I did a little quick research. It does seem to be the case that a) there are a majority of Ossetians in South Ossetia; and b) Ossetians do speak an Iranian language. According to The CIA World Factbook, Georgia's overall population is 4,630,841. According to its Wikipedia page, there were about \"45,000 ethnic Ossetians and 17,500 ethnic Georgians in South Ossetia in 2007\" (let's say about 62,000 altogether). According to Ethnologue there is a language called Osetin with about 100,000 speakers in Georgia (figure from 2001). Osetin's typological classification is Indo-European, Indo-Iranian, Iranian, Eastern, Northeastern. The answer, then, is yes, Ossetians speak Osetin.

(screenshot from NYT) The New York Times today had a nice story about the official introduction of boxed win in Italy. Quoting Bloomberg, the NYT rerported \"Italy's Agriculture Ministry said that some fine Italian wines that receive government quality guarantees will be allowed to be sold in boxes. \" Good for them. I'm a hater of corks. No other technology in the world would be allowed to fail as often as corks do and be allowed to persist. What if gallons of milk went bad at the rate that bottles of wine do? The dairy industry would die off in weeks. But I must say, what counts as a \"box\" is being given clever and stylish leeway. For me, a prototypical box is most certainly square-ish, with 90 degree angles. If a box is to deviate from this prototype, for me it needs a special modifier like \"hat box\" or \"pill box\" or (even \"Leopard Skin Pill Box Hat\" as in this most excellent Dylan song). The specialty wine box above seems to be a haute couture variation on Labov's famed 1973 study of how how an object's function affects its naming. Prototypical wine boxes might be square-ish, but a variation may take the box name because it is more importantly a wine container fashioned out of a similar material (presumably cardboad of some sort). (pssst, the best reference I could find quickly for Labov's 1973 study is this Google books result here. If anyone knows of a better one, just let me know.)

(above is the xkcd comic found here) The interwebs is abuzz with the latest girls can't do science scuttlebutt (Alex Tabarrok at Marginal Revolution has a useful overview). This got me to wondering why this kind of speculation never seems to be applied to linguistics. First, of course, is the fact that linguistics is a small field (I'm near certain that Language Log had a post in the last few months regarding the small size of linguistics compared to other fields, but I've failed miserably to find it). There simply aren't enough of us to cause any controversies, except when someone wants us to prove that \"X\" is not really a word and we refuse (see Zwicky's relevant post here). Second, there are many easily recognizable female linguists who have been highly influential. Off the top of my head I can easily think of Barbara Partee, Adele Goldberg, Joan Bresnan, Joan Bybee, Eve Sweetser, and Eve Clark , amongst a great many others (hehe, that list TOTALLY marks me as a Buffalo functionalist). At least as interestingly, the highly technical sub-field of computational linguistics/NLP is brimming with examples of influential female scholars, such as Ann Copestake, Paola Merlo, Bonnie Dorr, Tanya Reinhart, and Jan Weibe to name a just a small few. The only sub-field of linguistics that seems to be male dominated is syntactic theory invention. I can think of many males who are strongly associated with the invention of a theory of syntax/grammar (though, in all honesty, no one person truly invents a theory alone), but only Goldberg & Michaelis's construction grammar comes to mind as a theory of grammar designed by female linguists (I happily solicit examples of my ignorance). Whereas, a list of male-invented grammatical frameworks/theories is easy to compile: GB, Transformational Grammer G. Structure Grammar Van Valin & LaPolla --> Role and Reference Grammar D. Perlmutter --> Relational Grammar C. Fillmore --> Case Grammar Is there a gender gap in grammar theorization?

Nein! Das ist Falsch! R. Langacker --> Cognitive Grammar There are a variety of ways of proving this false. 1) There is no such thing as a language. We use the word \"language\" as a convenient label to refer to the behavior of communities of people who seem to be able to understand each other when they move their mouths. We say \"they speak X\". But there is no definition of \"language\" such that X can be described in any scientifically valid/reliable way. There is, therefore, no way of counting how many language are spoken anywhere, let alone comparing the numbers between locations. 2) Assume there is such a thing as language; I have no clue how many languages are spoken in the US, but I'm sure whatever that number is, it's less than the total number of languages in the world (5,000-7,000, depending on whether you think Flemish is really just Dutch with a lisp). There are many languages with less than 100 speakers, all of whom are over 60 and live in remote villages. Did one of the remaining senior citizens wander into the US, ya know, on a whim? I kinda doubt it.

She writes carefully, long winded when necessary, but in that proper British style which includes wit and panache and a little naughtiness when appropriate (read this post, in particular).

Posted by Chris at 6:00 PM 0 comments Labels: blogosphere Tuesday, July 15, 2008 Yiddish Schmiddish I just completed the online Survey of American Jewish Language (HT polyglot conspiracy). No, I'm not Jewish, but the survey is about the use of language with no special requirements on who is doing the using. To be honest, I was not impressed with the survey design. There is ambiguity in many of the response choices, making the results difficult to interpret. But, true to my word, I'm all for moving forward with using the interwebs as a tool for linguistic research. We gotta start somewhere, right? We'll tinker with the methodology as we move forward. So, what do we learn out from this?

So, I would say \"X infers Y\", not \"X infers on Y\". My guess is that Sullivan was trying to evoke the semantics of speculates on and transferred the syntax to infer. Just a guess. [pssst, btw, I used to be able to cut-and-past from Word into Blogger to get formatted text like colors and highlighting (the quote above was green and shaded), but now I get an error because of all the crud code that Word includes. The crud code has always been there and Blogger used to handle it, now it don't.

Anyhoo, Zwicky mentioned this series of articles at Slate.com: The Sex Difference Evangelists (posted July 1) by Amanda Schaffer and Emily Bazelon. The six part series takes a critical look at the claims about neurological sex-differences made primarily by two people: 1. Louann Brizendine, a psychiatrist at U.C.-San Francisco. 2. Canadian psychologist Susan Pinker. I read the first two articles and I'm reasonably impressed with the reporting (something I rarely say about Slate). The authors are generally even-handed (though, it's not at all clear to me why the authors point out Pinker's Canadian nationality as if it meaningfully modifiers her profession). Anyhoo, this quote stood out for me: \"All told, what's striking about the evidence on language is not so much a profound gap between the sexes, but the large gaps in our understanding of the brain.\" All psycholinguists repeat after me now: And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. Posted by Chris at 3:56 PM 0 comments Labels: psycholinguistics Friday, July 4, 2008 Online Psycholinguistics Experiments Experimental psycholinguists requires experimental subjects like any other empirical cognitive science. Unfortunately, researches are often constrained by limited resources. Typically, psycholinguists use college students bribed with money or extra credit as subjects. It's not unheard of for a published psycholinguistics study to have involved as few as 12 subjects. This has been a necessary evil because there has never been a good way to collect large numbers of subjects together and provide them with a coherent experimental design. Lately, however, researchers are turning to the web as a place to conduct experiments with large groups of subjects. Yes, there are issues regarding control (e.g., if you need native speakers of English, how can you ensure that a subject really is a native speaker?), but these issues come up in all types of experimental paradigms. I believe that good standards and practices to ensure quality online psycholinguistic experiments will emerge over time. So, I'm all for moving ahead. With that in mind, here are a set of sites offering online psycholinguistic experiments: The Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics -- Online experiments The Portal for Psychological Experiments on Language (largest selection of experiments, that's a modified screen grab of some of their experiments above) Cognition and Language Laboratory (they have a blog too!)

Rarely has a single conference involved such critical debate about a new theory (I'm no physicist, of course). University of Edinburgh School of Informatics, Blizzard Challenge 2008 (this is actually an evaluation of speech synthesis, but good enough for starters). From Wikipedia's page: \"Perhaps the most famous conference was the October 1927 Fifth Solvay International Conference on Electrons and Photons, where the world's most notable physicists met to discuss the newly formulated quantum theory. The leading figures were Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr. Einstein, disenchanted with Heisenberg's \"Uncertainty not play dice.\" Bohr \"Einstein, stop telling God what to do.\" (See Bohr-Einstein debates.) Seventeen of the twenty-nine attendees were or became Nobel Prize winners, including Marie Curie, who alone among them, had won Nobel Prizes in two separate scientific disciplines.\" The picture includes (by row): A. Piccard, E. Henriot, W.L. H.A. Kramers, P.A.M. Dirac, A.H. Compton, L. de Broglie, M. Born, N. Bohr; I. Langmuir, M. Planck, M. Ch. E. Wilson, O.W.

Posted by Chris at 6:40 PM 3 comments Labels: causative. semantics, lexicon \"Historical Vegetarian\" This summer I will be celebrating my 30th year as a vegetarian. Yippy for me. There are many ways to be a vegetarian and I'm often asked \"what kind of vegetarian are you?\". There are many ways of answering this question. 1) I could use one of the names that have emerged as labels for \"dietary practices commonly associated with vegetarianism\" (as this Wikipedia page explains ... it lists more than ten names). 2) I could list the things I eat, so I could say something like \"I don't eat fish or meat. I'm not opposed to dairy, but it's a small part of my diet (mostly cheese). I'm not opposed to eggs, but I rarely eat them\". I rarely say either of the above. Instead, I typically say \"I'm an historical vegetarian\". I coined this term decades ago in order sum up my answer, which has nothing to do with what I eat, but everything to do with when and why I became a vegetarian. I chose to became a vegetarian in the late 1970s when I was seven years old for one reason and one reason only: My oldest brother Rob decided to become one. Rob was around 16 at the time, and if my understanding of the late 70s is accurate, every 16 year old was becoming a vegetarian. It was a fad. They all wore bell-bottoms (oh my, did Rob ever have the bell-bottoms!), listened to disco, and became vegetarians. As a seven year old, I knew full well that Rob was the coolest person on the planet, so I followed him around and did whatever he did. He became a vegetarian, so I became a vegetarian and so did my brother Don. My mother didn't seem to mind (she probably rolled her eyes a few times, knowing the fad would pass, and decided to wait it out). I remember the first day remarkably well because my mother informed us that we were going to have hamburgers that night, and we all decided it would be wise to postpone our veggie inauguration by a day. But the next day, we stuck by our word and renounced meat (we allowed fish and foul and dairy). My mother patiently cooked multiple dishes as was needed and waited. Within a year, Rob was munching on hamburgers again. Within two years, Don fell off the wagon and dove into hotdogs with relish (frikkin sweeeeeeeet ambiguity! Both semantic AND syntactic. Parse THAT, LKB!). And I was the last man standing. At ten years old, I renounced fish and foul and dug in for the long haul. Somewhere along the line, my sister Lori became a vegetarian, but I think that was later. She held out for a good long while, but alas, she too has fallen off the wagon as well. I've never quite understood my motivations for sticking it out, except perhaps the stubborness of a youngest child. But I have never been comfortable with any of the silly labels that people have concocted for cutting up the vegetarian space. I'm most happy with vegetarian. Nice and basic level. But I find other people are not happy when I call myself a vegetarian. They seem to feel I've misled them somehow when I re-tell the little story. So I coined historical vegetarian to label the tiny little space in veggie-land that I occupy. It may be the case that I alone am properly labeled by this term (god I love my syntax sometimes!).
