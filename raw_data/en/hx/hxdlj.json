[Show details](#__NBK548536_dtls__) OVERVIEW Introduction Ashwagandha is a popular Ayurvedic herb used as a general tonic, to increase energy and reduce stress. Ashwagandha has not been implicated in causing serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but recently has been implicated in rare cases of clinically apparent liver injury. Background Ashwagandha is an Ayurvedic herb that is derived from extracts of the roots of Withania somnifera, a low growing evergreen shrub that is endemic to India and Southeast Asia. Sometimes called \"Indian ginseng\", it is purported to have neuroprotective and antiinflammatory activities and is used to treat stress, fatigue, pain, skin diseases, diabetes, arthritis and epilepsy. It is also used as a general tonic to increase energy, reduce fatigue and counteract the effects of aging. Its efficacy in these conditions has not been consistently shown in rigorously controlled prospective studies, but it has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries and is currently becoming a popular herbal product in Western countries. Withania somnifera extracts have as many as 35 different chemical constituents and the specific active ingredient responsible for its activity has not been identified. Constituents include alkaloids, steroidal lactones, saponins, withanolides, withaferins and iron. Extracts of ashwagandha are often supplied as tablets which are taken once to three times daily. Side effects are uncommon and have not been clearly defined. Large doses can cause gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, probably because of direct irritation to the intestinal mucosa. Hepatotoxicity Despite widescale use, ashwagandha is considered generally safe and without major adverse effects. In clinical trials, there have been no reports of serum enzyme elevations occurring during therapy and no mention of serious adverse events or hepatotoxicity. Recently, however, several cases of clinically apparent liver injury have been reported in patients taking commercial herbal products that are labelled as containing ashwagandha. The liver injury presented 2 to 12 weeks after starting ashwagandha with a cholestatic or mixed pattern of injury, jaundice and pruritus. Immunoallergic and autoimmune features were not prominent. [Jaundice](/books/n/livertox/glossary/def-item/glossary.jaundice/) tended to be protracted but ultimately resolved without fatalities or chronic injury. Because commercial herbal preparations are often mixtures of herbs and nutritional products and can be mislabeled and contain unknown herbs and medications, it is not always clear whether the reported cases were due to ashwagandha and one of its components or to a contaminant. In several reported cases, however, the commercial product being taken was tested and found to have ashwagandha without other contaminants. Thus, clinically apparent liver injury attributable to ashwagandha appears to occur, but is rare. [Likelihood score](/books/n/livertox/glossary/def-item/glossary.likelihood-score/): C (probable cause of clinically apparent liver injury). Mechanism of Injury The cause of hepatotoxicity from products containing ashwagandha is unclear. The possibility of mislabeling or adulteration with hepatotoxic herbal products is always an issue in commercial multiingredient dietary supplements. Outcome and Management The few cases of ashwagandha associated liver injury have been mild-to-moderate in severity and self-limited in course without acute liver failure or persistent liver injury. In most instances, the liver injury subsides within 1 to 3 months of discontinuing the herbal product. [Rechallenge](/books/n/livertox/glossary/def-item/glossary.rechallenge/) with the same product should be avoided.
