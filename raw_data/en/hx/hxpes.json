CBD gummies are exploding in popularity as a natural way to improve a variety of health outcomes. Many individuals are curious whether CBD gummies can improve sex drive and sexual performance. Is there any medical research backing the efficacy of CBD gummies for libido enhancement? What about improved sexual wellness? How do real users rate and describe the effects of CBD for sex? In this article we'll answer all of these questions and more as we analyze clinical studies to give our take on whether or not CBD gummies are effective for sexual enhancement, and share real, unsponsored user reviews of CBD gummies for sex. Do CBD Improve Sex? A Medical Review While cannabidiol (CBD) gummies have been studied extensively in medical research, they're not primarily studied for effects on sex drive or sexual function. As we referenced in our review of the best CBD gummies, this type of supplement is clinically shown to reduce anxiety and inflammation and improve sleep. However, we can't identify a single clinical trial on CBD for sex or sex drive. In fact, a medical review published in the Frontiers in Pharmacology journal found that CBD may negatively impact testosterone levels in men and theoretically reduce sex drive. These findings are based on animal studies and not conclusively proven in humans. Most of the top articles from major health publishers on the topic of CBD gummies for sex suggest that the products can indirectly improve sex by reducing anxiety, in a cheap attempt to shill consumers CBD gummies. However, this line of reasoning is illogical. A supplement or pharmaceutical medication that reduces anxiety does not necessarily improve sex drive or sexual performance. If anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) products improved sex, then Xanax would be prescribed for sex drive, but it's not because it has never been proven to directly increase sex drive in clinical studies. There is some evidence that cannabis can improve sexual experience in both men and women. A medical review published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine found that 38.7% of participants found cannabis to improve sex, while only 4.7% said it had a negative impact on sex. Overall we do not believe that CBD gummies are likely to improve sex, and we recommend that consumers be wary of CBD brands or health influencers claiming this association without clinical proof. However, CBD may be effective for improving sexual desire in a small subset of the population which we'll discuss in the next section. What Group May Benefit From CBD for Sex? While we haven't come across any clinical research that healthy adults benefit from CBD supplementation for any sexual health outcome, it may be effective for those with anxiety. Both anxiety and depression can negatively impact sex drive, and therapies which resolve these conditions tend to improve sex drive. Patients with depression who were treated with an antidepressant in a clinical trial experienced positive effects on average. 58% of patients reported improved sexual function. An anti-anxiety drug venlafaxine was shown in a clinical trial to successfully treat premature ejaculation. This data suggests that CBD may be effective for improving sexual function specifically for those with mental health complaints, because improving mental wellness can return the body to homeostasis and normalize sex drive. CBD was described as having \"a promising role as an alternative therapy in the management of anxiety disorders\" in a medical review published in the Journal of the American Pharmacists Association. Real, Unsponsored CBD for Sex Review A YouTube channel called \"The AUXORO Podcast\" published a conversation about the effects of CBD on sex: Can Ginseng Naturally Improve Sex Drive? Panax ginseng, which is a plant native to Asia, has been studied in various clinical trials for its ability to improve sex drive in men and women, and to improve erections in men. A 2013medical reviewon ginseng and male reproductive function found that with daily use, the supplement increased sex drive. Aclinical trialpublished inThe Journal of Sexual Medicinefound that panax ginseng supplementation increased sex drive by 13% in menopausal women. Aclinical trialpublished inThe Journal of Urologyfound that after eight weeks of treatment,erectile function scores were \"significantly higher\" in the ginseng group than the group taking placebo pills. Illuminate Labs sells a Panax Ginseng Extract supplement which is third-party tested to ensure label accuracy, potency and purity, and which contains no questionable additive ingredients. Interested consumers can check out Illuminate Labs Panax Ginseng Extractat this linkto the product page on our website, where the supplement can be purchased for only$15on a subscription basis.

We were unable to identify a single clinical trial proving CBD to have positive effects on any sexual outcome. Individuals with anxiety or depression who experience relief from their anxiety or depression with CBD use may experience an indirect increase in sex drive, but this is entirely theoretical at this point as it hasn't been directly proven in clinical studies. There are natural compounds on the market that are clinically shown to enhance sexual desire, so it seems illogical in our opinion to use CBD gummies for sex. It's also worth considering that many CBD gummies contain unhealthy additive ingredients like added sugar and artificial flavors. "}
