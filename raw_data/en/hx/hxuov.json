Although weak at the time of birth, it is strengthened as we grow by being in constant interaction with various kinds of microbes in our environment and fighting against them. With the changes in seasons, the human body is prone to infections of different kinds which in Ayurveda is described as beej-bhoomi theory. As per this theory, if one's body is accumulated with toxins(Ama) and has a deficit of vigour(Ojas), then the body is more susceptible to infections spread as the presence of toxins serve as a fertile place for microbes to flourish. In Charaka Samhitha, immunity(Bala) is defined as the human body's ability to prevent or hinder the furtherance of any disease by maintaining an optimal body condition. According to [immunity in Ayurveda](https://www.ishaniayurveda.com/), the body's immune system and its strength depend on a few different factors like Agni(Digestive Fire), Metabolism, Balanced hormone and healthy liver functions.
