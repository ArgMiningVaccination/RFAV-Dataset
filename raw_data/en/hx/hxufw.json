Join ConnectIONS Live at 11 AM PST on November 18th as we welcome IONS Scientist, Dr. Garret Yount and his special guest, Dr. Shelley Evans. Along with the IONS research team and other energy medicine practitioners, they launched the Energy Healers Pilot Study in 2019. It was one of the largest and most ambitious research projects they have attempted. In this exciting presentation, they will be talking about one of the most surprising outcomes they observed in their research - the presence of non-physical beings participating in the energy medicine sessions. Plus, Dr. Evans will explain the terms \"frequency, resonance, and harmony\" and why she believes they are vital to the scientific conversation about energy medicine. She'll also talk about how energetic (frequency) signals 'inform' the physical body and how a practitioner taps into that field. Don't miss this webinar and what it might tell us about the presence of non-physical beings in our lives. Science, Energy Healing, and Non-Physical Beings Friday, November 18th 11:00am - 12:00pm PST Please register even if you can't attend live and you'll receive an email with a link to the recording. PRESENTERS Garret Yount, PhD, is a Scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. Dr. Yount's primary interest is bridging molecular neurobiology with aspects of consciousness and the nonmaterial mind. He began his formal studies in consciousness research with a small grant from the Institute of Noetic Sciences in 1995, which allowed him to work with biofield practitioners and spiritual healers in the laboratory. Dr. Yount was among the first scientists to be awarded a Research Project Grant (R01) from the National Institutes of Health to study energy healing. He has spoken nationally and co-authored peer-reviewed papers on the topic of establishing rigorous guidelines for research into biofields and micro-psychokinesis. Shelley Evans, PhD, DNM, DHM, is internationally recognized in Quantum Medicine circles for her contributions in Bliss and Consciousness Research, Frequency Medicine, and the Sacred Arts, as a Mental Health Specialist, Dr. Shelley Evans provides both preventive and restorative modalities. With over 30 years' experience in Natural Health, Psychoeducation and Research, informed through universal laws observed in Mother Nature, her forte is identifying subtle world influences. Her protocols establish harmony between the psycho-somatic expression of mind/body and Spirit. Dr. Shelley is currently writing her second book called 'Lucid Living for the Suddenly Sovereign' which builds on skills established through lucid dreaming. Her website called The Shareable Wave underscores her belief that the Highest level of Joy comes from the Deepest level of Understanding and that we can all access our own higher wisdom to solve the mysteries behind patterns and subtle world influences by learning the language of Nature called Quantum Physics.
