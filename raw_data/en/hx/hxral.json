People come to me with a variety of concerns. Oftentimes, pain is the main complaint. ... Internal health, internal medicine, digestive disorders, menstrual disorders, pregnancy. I have teens here for anxiety, ADHD, sports injuries,\" said Cohn Rieselman, who's been a licensed acupuncturist and board-certified Herbalist for 18 years. Acupuncture can help all those? \"Yes.\" How did you get into it? \"I graduated with a degree in biology from Northern Illinois University. I was trying to figure out what to do. Then I encountered Chinese medicine and it lit the lightbulb. I was living in Portland, Oregon, and it's popular on the West Coast. I had an autoimmune disease in remission. I went to a student clinic and it was amazing. I thought it was the coolest thing. ... My boyfriend at the time was very much into natural health. ... I started to use natural remedies to heal myself. It's beautiful medicine.\" What makes it beautiful? \"It's based on the laws of nature. ... Modern, conventional medicine, you can't say it's all natural. ... You've got answers other than drugs and surgery.\" How are you a herbalist? \"The master's program (I took) included herbal medicine. I had always loved plants and been interested in the ways people use plants. ... Acupuncture and herbs work closely together.\" Is acupuncture difficult to learn? \"You need to learn anatomy and physiology. There's some of the required science. The texts our profession is based on were written 1,800 to 2,000 years ago. And they're still 100 percent relevant. ... I'm the type of person who needs a lot of variety, who needs to always be learning. I can be in this field forever and never get tired of it. There's so much to learn.\" What happens when someone comes in? \"Part of the exam is a neuro-emotional technique that involves muscle testing. ... I want people who value their health and believe in mind-body-spirit medicine.\" What makes acupuncture special? \"It works on a level that no other medicine works on. It works with blood flow and circulation of all the fluids in the body. It works with the nervous system. It's working on another energy level (that) I think modern medicine doesn't recognize or acknowledge.\" How long until someone feels better? \"It's different for everyone. ... We say about six treatments for an acute problem you've had less than three months. We estimate for every year you've had a chronic problem, expect a month of treatment.\" What about herbs? \"I customize everything here.\" Is ginger popular? \"Ginger is a very important Chinese herb. We have three kinds. ... Cinnamon is very important, too. ... It warms the blood so it promotes circulation. That's why it's good for diabetics.\" Is there a busy time of year? \"September gets busy after people get back into the school routine. March has been pretty busy.\" What do you like best? \"I love the one-on-one work with another person and how I can be that safe place for them, be that one person they can completely complain to about everything.\" Any negatives? \"Marketing is pretty hard, letting people know I'm here and what I can do for them.\" What misconceptions do people have about your business? \"That it hurts. People are afraid of needles. These are people who haven't had acupuncture. They got vaccines as kids and that's what they base it on.\" Do you have competition? \"There's competition, but the area is not saturated. I never feel threatened. There's another acupuncturist in this building.\" Are people more likely to try acupuncture now than they were 10 or 20 years ago? \"Yes. More people are getting good results with it and telling their friends and family. I get referrals from chiropractors, medical doctors.\" Any favorite stories? \"I helped one woman with her for fertility for six months. Then she stopped coming in. I never knew what happened. Then, six, seven years later I saw her post on Facebook: 'Amy's the reason I have my daughter.' I don't know how many babies are out there because I helped them get pregnant.\" What about men with ED? \"Herbal medicine is important for that. Works great.\" Future plans? \"I'm still trying to grow the practice.\" What's your advice for someone starting a business? \"Don't put limitations on yourself. Dream big.\" If you know of a business you'd like to see to profiled in Down to Business, contact Steve Metsch at [metschmsfl@yahoo.com](mailto:metschmsfl@yahoo.com).
