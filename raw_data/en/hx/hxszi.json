I came to an awareness in an area I didn't think I would ever get past. I understand and know now what I have to do to move forward.\" -Renee S. Click on a question below to see the answer: Everyone can benefit from Energy Healing. Whether you have been diagnosed with a physical disease or are experiencing physical discomfort, are struggling with mental or emotional difficulties, or are looking to bring your mind, body, and spirit into alignment, you can benefit from this service. Energy Healing opens you up to a deeper sense of ease, well-being, and purpose, and brings you back to your true self. Energy Healing is supportive for patients in all phases of traditional medical care and treatment. It is effective as an independent therapy and is also extremely successful as an adjunct therapy to traditional healthcare.

We readily accept that our body functions and is powered by energy. Our heart beats using energy pulses. Our brain and nervous system communicate with our entire body through complex energetic pathways. Our human energy field is constantly reacting to the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of our body. At HealingSpace, we practice EnergyTouch\u00ae advanced healing. This type of Energy Healing works not only in the first set of seven chakras, but into the second through seventh set of chakras and beyond. It also focuses on the energy field (aura) that surrounds our bodies, organs, and individual cells. Our Healing Practitioners address blockages and open the natural channels of our being at a high vibrational level, so mind, body, and spirit are functioning together optimally. The body can then work to reverse dysfunction and disease through its natural ability to heal itself. [Back to top of page.](http://www.healingspacellc.com/energy-healing.html) EnergyTouch\u00ae is distinctive from other types of Energy Healing in that practitioners are skillfully capable of moving fluently throughout the human energy field to clear blocks and restore function. Our work is contactless and therefore includes accessing an energetic \"hologram\" (vibrational representation) of the physical body, which is a unique and vital aspect of EnergyTouch\u00ae Healing. This acts as a matrix precisely connecting the energies of the outer levels of the field with the physical body on a cellular level. Another significant focus of EnergyTouch\u00ae Healing is on the emotional and spiritual influences that may contribute to the patient's illness and subsequent recovery. EnergyTouch\u00ae Healings help reveal the energetic interrelatedness of all aspects of health and well-being.

Then, you relax on a massage table, fully clothed, and experience the energy work. Our Healing Practitioners work on an energetic, vibrational representation of your body, organs, and cells (a \"hologram\"). This means it is a non-touch therapy, but many people experience meditative states, peaceful sleep, or awareness of the work during the session. Afterward, you will talk with the Healing Practitioner about what came up during the session and ways to maintain the healing. Energy Healing appointments are 90 minutes. The healing session itself is about an hour, with 15 minutes at the beginning to review health history, answer questions, and set intentions, and 15 minutes at the end to discuss the experience. Long-Distance Session: You will connect with your Healing Practitioner over the phone and then lie down in a restful space for the duration session. Many patients feel the same sensations as they would in person. Afterward, you connect with the Healing Practitioner again. [Back to top of page.](http://www.healingspacellc.com/energy-healing.html) Due to the non-touch nature of the healing work that we do all Energy Healing Sessions could be considered long-distance. The only difference is that the Healing Practitioner is not physically in the room with you. In both cases, the Healing Practitioner is working on an energetic, vibrational representation which will then affect your physical body. Many of our most profound and successful cases have been achieved through long-distance healing sessions. We have had long-distance patients in France, Japan, Canada, California, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois to name a few.

We often work with conditions that are puzzling and difficult to diagnose and treat in a conventional way.

He had cardiac surgery as an infant, was on long-term steroids, and was on a respirator long-term due to respiratory difficulties. He received feeding through an NG tube (Nasogastric tube) for much of his life due to feeding issues and GI problems. When he first presented for an Energy Healing, he had severe pneumonia and IV antibiotics were not working to resolve it. Also, his gastric reflux was so severe, despite the NG tube, that doctors were planning to surgically place a permanent gastric feeding tube after the infection had resolved. The first healing was conducted long-distance and he was discharged from the hospital two days later. His gastric tube surgery cancelled, and he was doing so well that his NG tube was removed. This meant that he was finally able to eat on his own. Many of the doctors who listened to his lungs subsequent to the healing mentioned that they sounded better than ever--\"like he has new lungs.\" For some time after the healing, the gastric reflux was not a problem. His overall energy and stamina improved to nearly the same as his siblings. He has continued to receive long-distance healings over the years, as he has faced various medical and developmental issues. Energy Healing has helped reduce the amount of medical and surgical intervention needed and has also enhanced any medical and surgical therapies that were necessary. At the time that she presented for an Energy Healing, she was suffering from an unwavering migraine headache that was 13 months old and 16 months in the making. She was blind in her left eye and deaf in her left ear. She was unable to sleep through the night or attend college. She had been to many doctors, esteemed specialists, and headache clinics; she was taking the latest medications. Nothing was working. After her first healing, which was performed long-distance, she slept through the night. She awakened the next morning with normal vision in her left eye. Later that afternoon she experienced popping in her left ear and her hearing returned. Although the pain of the headache was still present, it was diminished. She reported that the pain was not diminished to a low enough level that would normally bring her vision back. She received another long-distance healing and a third healing in-person. Since that third session, she has been pain free and started to lead a \"normal life\" (as she puts it). She was weaned off her medications. She enrolled in college full-time, can live away from home, drive, and hold a job. She received the three healings in 2006 and she has not had a migraine since.
