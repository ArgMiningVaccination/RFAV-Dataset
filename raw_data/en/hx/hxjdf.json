Examine the evidence.](https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4026.pdf) There is no scientific evidence that MMR vaccine causes autism. The question about a possible link between MMR vaccine and autism has been extensively reviewed by independent groups of experts in the United States, including the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine (now renamed the National Academy of Medicine). These reviews have concluded that the available epidemiologic evidence does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism [Talking about Vaccines: Autism](https://www.immunize.org/talking-about-vaccines/autism.asp) Claims that vaccines cause autism have led some parents to delay or refuse vaccines for their children. The most common claims are that autism is caused by MMR vaccine, vaccines that contain thimerosal, or too many vaccines. Many scientific studies have been done to test these claims. None has shown any correlation between vaccines and autism. [Vaccine Ingredients - Thimerosal](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/thimerosal#.VldqRV5N8jc) Some people have worried that thimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative in some multi-dose preparations of influenza vaccine, could cause mercury poisoning in children or affect the unborn children of pregnant women who receive this vaccine. But, for many reasons, thimerosal contained in vaccines is not harmful. [Vaccines and Autism](http://www.chop.edu/service/vaccine-education-center/hot-topics/autism.html) Examines the fear held by some parents that the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) causes autism. Two studies have been cited by those claiming that the MMR vaccine causes autism. Both studies are critically flawed. [Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/index.html) Provides links to resources discussing the hypothesis that vaccines cause autism. [Vaccination Rates among Younger Siblings of Children with Autism](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1708223) The relationship between adverse reactions to vaccine and autism spectrum disorder has received little attention in research as of this writing. At the public health level, a better understanding of the relationship between perceived adverse reactions to vaccine and autism spectrum disorder is necessary in order to more effectively address concerns about vaccination. [Autistic spectrum disorder : no causal relationship with vaccines](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/autistic-spectrum-disorder-no-causal-relationship-with-vaccines) Reviews recent controversies surrounding immunizations and ASD (austic spectrum disorder). [Les troubles envahissants du : donn\u00e9e n'appuie entre ces deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments. [NICHD Autism Research Information](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/autism/researchinfo/Pages/articles.aspx) The US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is one of many federal entities involved in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research. NICHD's portfolio covers a variety of topics in autism, including autism etiology, epidemiology, treatment, and screening. The institute also supports professional training and the development of research infrastructure that will facilitate research in ASD and other intellectual and developmental disabilities. [Evidence Shows Vaccines Unrelated to Autism](http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4028.pdf) Claims that vaccines cause autism have led some parents to delay or refuse vaccines for their children. The most common claims are that autism is caused by measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, vaccines that contain thimerosal, or too many vaccines. Many studies have been done to test these claims. None has shown that vaccines cause autism. This sheet lays out the facts to help parents understand why experts do not think vaccines cause autism. "}
