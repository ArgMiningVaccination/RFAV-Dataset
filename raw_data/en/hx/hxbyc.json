Typically, when accessing care outside of Hawaii, you will obtain care from healthcare provid ers that h ave a contract ual agreem ent (i.e., are participating providers) with the lo cal Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geographic area ( \"Host Bl ue\"). In some instances, you may obtain care from nonparticipating healthcare providers. Our paym ent practices in both instances are described below. Under the BlueCard\u00ae Pro gram, when you a ccess cove red healthcare services within t he geographic area served by a Host Blue, HMSA will remain respon sible for fulfilli ng our c er, the Host Blue is respons ible for contracting w ith and generally h andling all interactio ns with its participating healthcare p roviders. Whenever you access cove red healthcare services outside Hawaii and the claim is processed thr ough the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay f or cove red healthcare services is calculated based on the lower of: The billed covered ch arges fo r your covered services; or The negotiated price that t he Host Bl ue makes available to HMSA. Often, this \"n egotiated price \" will be simple discount that reflects an actual price that t he Host Blue pays to your healthcare provider. Som etimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with your healthcare provider or p rovider group that may in clude types of settle ments, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based on a disco unt that results in expected average savings for similar types of hea lthcare pr oviders after taking into accou nt the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Estimated pricing and avera ge pricing, going forward, also take into account adjustments to correct f or over - and underestima tion of modifications of pa st pricing for t he types of tra nsaction m odifications no ted above. Howeve r, such adjustments will not affect t he price HMSA uses for your claim because they will not be applied retroactiv ely to claims already paid. Laws in a small number of states may require t he Host Blue to a dd a s urcharge to your calculatio n. If any state laws ma ndate other liability calculations me thods, including a surcharge, we would then calcul ate your liability for any covered healthcare services according to applicable la w. When covered hea lthcare services are p rovided outside of Hawaii by nonparticipating healthcare providers, the amount you pay f or such services will generally be based on e ither the Host Blue's nonpartici pating healthcare provider local payment or the pricing a rrangements re quired by applicable state law. In these situations, you will be liable for the difference between the amount the nonparticipating healthcare provider bills an d the payment we will make f or the covered services as set fo rth in this paragrap h. In certain situations, we may use other payment bases, such as b illed covered charges, t he payment we would make if the healthcare services had been obtained within our serv ice area, or a special n egotiated payment, as permitted under Inter-Plan Programs Policies, to determine the amou nt we will pay for servi ces rendered by nonp artici pating healthcare pr oviders. In these s ituations, you will be liable for the difference between the amount that the nonparticipating healthcare provider bills and the payment we will make for covered services as set forth in this paragrap h. 3 6738.5.1.1121.01/02/14 Chapter 1: Important Information BlueCard PPO Providers Finding BlueCard PPO Providers Finding BlueCard Participating Providers Carry You r Member Card Benefit payments for covered emergency services provided by nonp articipa ting providers are a \"reasonable amount\" as defined by federal law at 45 C FR \u00a7147.138(b). If you get services from a Mainland BlueCard PPO provide r you enjoy advantages similar to those availabl e when you receive healt h care from participating pr oviders in Hawaii. For help f inding BlueCard PPO pr outside Ha waii, call 1-800-810- BLUE (1-800-810- 2583). BlueCa rd PPO provide rs may n ot be in some areas . In areas where BlueCard PPO providers are not available , you can stil l receive BlueC ard PPO advantages if you receive services from a BlueCard participating provider. The Host Blue in the area where you need services can pr ovide you with information on participati ng provid ers in the area. You can also visi t the BlueCard Doctor and Hosp ital Fi 1-800\u00ad 810-BLUE (2583 ). Always carry your HMS A Member Card . You r membe r card ensures that you receiv e all the conveniences you'r e used to when you get medica l service s at home in Hawaii . The card tells participati ng and BlueCard PPO providers which independent Blue Plan you belong to. It also includes information t he provider needs to file your claim for you. Is the Care Covered? Does the Care Meet Payment Determination Criteria? Questions We Ask When You Receive Care To receive benefits, the care you receive must be a covered treatment, service, or supply. See Chapter 4: Descrip tion of Benefits for a listing of covered t reatment, services and supplies. All care you receive must meet all of t he following Payment Determination Criteria: For the purpose of treating a medical condition. The most appropriate de livery or level of service, considering potential benefits an d harms to the p atient. Known to be effective in im proving health ou tcomes; provided that: - Effectiven ess is determined first by scien tific eviden ce; - If no scientific evidence exists, then by prof essional stand ards of care; and - If no professional standards of care exists or if they ex ist but are outdated or contradicto ry, then by expert opinion; and Cost-effecti ve for the medical condition being treated compared to alternative health interven tions, incl uding no interven tion. For pu rposes of this paragraph, cost-effecti ve shall not necessarily m ean the lowest price. Services that are not kn own to be effective in im proving health ou tcomes include, but are n ot limited to, services that are e xperimental or investigational. Definitions of terms and more inf ormation re garding app licati on of this Payment Determination Criteria are contained in t he Patient's Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, Hawaii Revised Statutes \u00a7 432E-1.4. T he current langua ge of this statutory provision will be provided upon request. Requests should be submitted to HMSA' s Customer Serv ice Department. The fact that a physician may prescr ibe, order, recommend, or approve a service or supply does not in itself m ean that the service or supply meets Payment Determination Criteria, even if it is listed as a covered service. Exce pt for BlueCa rd partici pating and BlueCard PPO p roviders, partici providers may not b ill or collect ch arges f or services or supplies that do not meet HMSA' s Payment Determinati on Criteria unl ess a written acknowledgement of financial respon sibility, sp ecific to the servi ce, is obtained from you or yo ur legal representati ve prior to the time services ar e rendered. 4 6738.5.1.1121.01/02/14 Is the Care Consistent with HMSA's Medical Policies? From What Provider Category Did You Receive Care? Is the Service or Supply Subject to a Benefit Maximum? Is the Service or Supply Subject to Precertification? Did You Receive Care from a Provider Recognized and Approv ed by Us? Did a Provider Order the Care? Chapter 1: Important Information Participati ng provid ers may, howev er, bill you for services or supplie s that are exclude d from coverage without getting a written acknowledgeme nt of financial respon sibility from you or your representative. See Chap ter 6: Service s Not Covered . More tha n one procedure, service, or suppl y may be appro priate to diagnos e and treat your condition. I n that case, we reserve the right to approve onl y the least costl y treatment , service, o r supply. You may ask your physicia n to contact us to decide i f the services y ou need meet our Payment Determination Cr iteria or are excl uded from covera ge before you receiv e the care. To be covered, the car e you get must be consiste nt with HMSA' s medical policies. These are policies dr afted by HMS A Medical Directors, ma ny of whom are practicing physician s, with comm unity physicians a nd na tiona lly recognize d authorities. Each policy provides detailed coverage criteria for when a specific servi ce, drug, or supply meets payment determination cr iteria. I f you have questions abou t the policie s or would like a c opy of a policy related t o your care, please call u s at one o f the telep hone nu mbers on the back cover of this guide. Your be nefits may be d ifferent depe nding on the category of provide r that you receiv e care from. In general , you will get th e maximum benefits possible when you receive services from an HMS A participatin g provider. When you see a nonparticipati ng provider you wil l owe any copayment that applie s to the serv ice plus the difference betwee n HMSA's eligibl e charge and the provider's actual charge. Also, nonpar ticipating providers ha ve not agreed t o HMSA's payme nt policies an d can bill you for services or other ch arges that HMSA does n ot cover. Participating provide rs have ag reed not to c harge y ou for these services. Th ese amount s will be included in t he nonparticipati ng provider's actual cha rge.

For e xample, your partici pating p rovider may send a bloo d sampl e to a nonparticipating lab to analyze . Or, your participati ng provider may send you to a nonparticipati ng specialis t for added care. Benefi t Maximu m is the maximum benefit amount all owed for a covered service or supply.

HMSA's payment and your copayment are based on the eligible charge. Exception: For services pr ovided by participati ng facilities, HMSA' s payment is based on the maximum a llowable fee and yo ur copayment is based on t he lower of the actual charge or the maximum a llowable fee . The eligible charge for emergency services provided by nonparticipating providers is cal culated in accord with federal law as described at 45 CFR \u00a7 147.138(b). Participating providers ag ree to accept HMSA' s paym ent plus your copa yment as payment in full for covered se rvices. Nonpartici pating providers gene rally do not. If you receive services f rom a nonparticipati ng provider, you are respon sible for a copayment plus a ny difference between the actual charge and the eligible charge. Please no te: Eligible charge does not i nclude excise or other tax. You are responsible for all taxes related to the medical care you receive. Copayment Definition A copayme nt applies to most covered se rvices. It is e ither a fixed percenta ge of the e ligible charge or a fixed do llar amount. Excep tion: For services provided at a participati ng facility, your c opay ment is ba sed on the lower of t he facility's actual charge or the maximum a llowable fee . You owe a copaym ent even if the facility' s actual ch arge is less than t he maximum a llowable fee . Please no te: If you receive services fro m a nonparticipating or noncontracting provider, you are respon sible for t he copayme nt plus a ny difference between the actual charge and the eligible charge. Amount See Chap ter 3: Summary of Benefits and Your Payme nt Obligations. 7 6738.5.1.1121.01/02/14 Chapter 2: Payment Information Examples Here are two example s of how the copayment works. Let's say you have a sore throa t and go to a participati ng physician to ha ve it checke d. The physician's b ill or actual ch arge = $125. HMSA' s eligible charge = $60. Your copayment = $1 2. If you go to a nonparticipating physicia n, your out of pocket will be higher. The physician's bill or actual ch arge = $125. HMSA' s charge copayment = $18 ( 30% of $60). The difference between the actual charge and the eligible charge = $65. You o we $83 (your copayment plus t he difference between the actual charge and the eligible charge). Nonparticipating Provider Annual Deductible Definition Nonp articipa ting Provider A nnual Deductible is the fixed do llar amount you must pay each calendar year before benefits subject to the nonparticipating provider annual d eductible become available. You cannot pay the nonpartici pating provider a nnual ded uctible amount to us in a dvance. Please no te: Services rendered by partici pating providers are not subject to the nonparticipating p rovider annual deductible. The following am ounts you pay do not apply t oward meeting the nonparticipating p rovider annual deductible: Copayments for services that are not su bject to the nonparticipati ng provider annual deductible.

Any amounts y ou owe in a ddition to your copayment for covered services. e Please no te: For services subject to t he nonpartici pating pr ovider a nnual deductible seChap ter 3: Summary of Benefits and Your Payme nt Obligati ons. Amount $100 per person or $300 (maximum) per family Example Here is an example of how the nonparticipati ng provider annual de ductible works. L et's say y ou have single coverage, your nonparticipa ting provider annual deductible is $100, and you receive the following services from a nonparticipating p rovider: In March, y ou br eak your leg and you rent crutches to get around while your leg is in a cast. The eligible ch arge is $75. Y ou are responsible f or the entire amount because y ou have not met the n onpa rticipa ting provider a nnual deductible.

You owe $25 to m eet the rem aining deduc tible balance, plus a $18 copayment ( 30% of t he remaining $60 balance) a nd any d ifference between the actual charge and the eligible ch arge. Here is an ex ample of how your ma ximum per family deductible works. Your nonparticipating provider annual deductible is $300, and you receive the following services from a nonparticipating pr ovider: In February, your son is tested for allergies at the d octor's office. The eligible charge is $7 5. You are res pons ible for t he entire amount because you have not met the n onpa rticipating provider a nnual ded uctible.

Maximum Allowa ble Fee Definition The Maxim um Allow able Fee is the ma ximum dolla r amount pa id for a covered service, supply, or treatment. These are examples of some of the m ethods we use to determine the Maximum Allowable Fee: For most services, supplies, or procedur es, we conside r: - Increases in the cost of medical and non-medical services in Hawaii over the last year. - The relati ve difficu lty of the service comp ared to ot her services. - Changes in techno logy. - Paym ent for the service under federal, state, and other private insurance program s. For some facility-billed services, we use a per case, per treatment, or per day fee (per diem) rather than an itemized amount (fee for service). This does not inclu de pr actiti oner-billed facility services. For nonp allo wable fee for all-in clusive daily rates established by the hospital will never ex ceed more than if t he hospital had charged separately for services. For servi ces billed by Bl ueCard PPO and partici pating providers outsi de of Hawaii, we use the lower of t he provider's actual ch arge or the negotiated price passed on to us by the on-site Blue Cross and /or Blue Shield Plan.

A service or s upply may be lim ited by dolla r amount, duration, or number of visits. The maxim um may apply per: Service. For examp le, Online Care is li mited to no more th an 15 minutes per session. Calen dar year.

When this p lan is primary, its benefits are determined be fore those of any ot her plan and w ithout considering any other plan 's benef its. When this plan is secondary, its benef its are determined af ter those of another plan and may be reduced because of the primar y plan's payment. As the secondary plan, this plan' s paym ent will not exceed the amount this plan would have paid if it had been your only coverage. Additionally, when this p lan is secondary, benefits will be p aid only for those services or supplies covered un der this plan. If there is an a pplicable benefit ma ximum under this plan, the service or supply for which payment is made by either the pr imary or the seconda ry plan shall count toward that bene fit maximum. For examp le, this plan c overs one tuberculin test per calendar year, if this p lan is secondary and your primary plan cove rs one tubercu lin test per calendar year, the test covered under t he primary plan will count toward the yearly benefit ma ximum a nd this p lan will n ot provide benefits for a second test within the calendar year. However, the first twenty days of confinement to a sk illed nursing facility that are paid in full by Medicare shall not co unt toward the benefit ma ximum.

For more information, c ontact your employer or the Center s for Medicar e & Medicaid Services. If You are Age 65 or Older If your group employs 20 or more e mployees a nd if you are age 65 or older and eligible for Medicare only because of your age, the coverage described in this plan will be provided before Medicare benefit s as long as your employer or group health plan coverage is based on your status as a current active employee or the status of your spouse as a current activ e employee. If You are Under Age 65 with Disabili ty If your employer or group employs 100 or more employees and if you are under age 65 and eligible for Medicare only becaus e of a disability (and not ESRD), coverage under this plan will be provided before Medicare benefits as long as your group health plan coverage is based on your status as a current active employee or the status of your spouse as a current activ e employe e or on the current active employment status of an individual for whom you are a dependent. If You are Under Age 65 with End-Stage Renal Dise ase (ESRD) If you are under age 65 and eligible for Medicare only because of ESRD (permanent kidney failure) , coverage under this plan will be provided before Medicare benefits, but only during the first 30 months of your ESRD coverage.

If you are entitled to Medicare benefits, we will begin paying benefits after all Medicare benefits (including lifeti me reserv e days) are exhausted. If you rece ive inpatient servi ces and have coverage under Medicare P art B only or have exhausted your Medicare Part A benefits , we will pay inpatient benefits based on our eligible charge less any payments made by Medicare for Part B benefits (i.e., for inpatient lab, diagnostic and x-ray services).
