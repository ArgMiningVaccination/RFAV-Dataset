Oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs play an important role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Anti-diabetic medications have been developed for targeting the destructive pathways that eliminate insulin-producing pancreatic cells or in vivo formation, thereby improving insulin resistance in the peripheral tissues [ [3](#B3)]. Oral hypoglycemic agents currently used in clinical practice have some side effects [ [5](#B5), [14](#B14)]. Side effect of metformin include diarrhea, nausea, and gas [ [8](#B8)]. Recently, it has been hypothesized that compounds used in oriental medicine may offer alternative methods for treating diabetes mellitus due to their effectiveness, minimal side effects, and relatively low cost [ [18](#B18)]. [7](#B7), [10](#B10), [12](#B12)]. N-containing sugars have also been found in mulberry leaves [ [22](#B22)]. [17](#B17)]. The major amino acids of silk alanine, serine, and tyrosine [ [1](#B1)]. Fibroin was found to enhance insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes [ [9](#B9)], and fibroin-derived peptides are able to increase glucose transport in normal and insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 cells [ [11](#B11)]. In addition, fibroin lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats [ [24](#B24)]. However, the detailed mechanism underlying these anti-diabetic effects remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the anti-diabetic effects of silk fibroin hydrolysate (SFH) and the associated mechanisms in C57BL/KsJ-db/db (db/db) mice, a well-known animal model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Materials and Methods Animals Preparation of low-molecular weight SFH [16](#B16)]. Low-molecular weight silk fibroin was acquired through a desalting process using ion exchange chromatography as previously described [ [16](#B16)]. Amino acid composition of the SFH made by mentioned above ( [Table 1](#T1)) was determined with an amino acid analyzer (Pico-Tag System and Waters 486/600/626; Waters, USA). Measurement of body weight, blood glucose, and insulin Glucose tolerance test [13](#B13)]. Measurement of islet size and cell mass [2](#B2), [6](#B6), [20](#B20)]. To measure islet size, a 40\u00d7 magnification field was chosen at random. The islets in this field and those in the immediately adjacent fields were examined until 20 islets had been evaluated. Each of these 20 islets was evaluated to determine the total islet cross-sectional area. The percentage of the insulin-positive area (insulin immunoreactive area per \u00b5m2 of pancreatic epithelium in the sections) measured stereological morphometry using an Olympus BH-2 microscope (Olympus, Japan) connected to a Hewlett-Packard (USA) computer with Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, USA). Fibrotic tissue outside the pancreatic lobules was excluded from the measurements. Pancreatic cell mass was calculated by multiplying the percentage of insulin-positive areas by the weight of the corresponding pancreatic tissues. Statistical analysis Results SFH decreases blood glucose levels in db/db mice [Fig. 1A](#F1)). In contrast, blood glucose levels of untreated db/db mice gradually increased weeks. SFH did not have any hypoglycemic effect on the normal mice as expected. [Fig. 1B](#F1)), indicating that SFH treatment did not have a marked nutritional effect. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of the SFH-treated db/db mice were significantly lower compared to those of the untreated db/db mice (6.55 \u00b1 0.76 vs. 10.11 \u00b1 1.51%, p < 0.01), indicating that glucose levels in SFH-treated db/db mice were maintained at near normal levels throughout the treatment period ( [Fig. 1C](#F1)). Taken together, these results suggest that SFH had an anti-diabetic effect on the db/db mice. SFH improves glucose tolerance of db/db mice [Fig. 2A](#F2)), suggesting that SFH improves glucose tolerance. Plasma insulin levels of SFH-treated db/db mice were higher at 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose injection compared to the untreated db/db mice ( [Fig. 2B](#F2)). Results the AUC for glucose levels in SFH-treated db/db mice was significantly less than that of < 0.01). In addition, the AUC for insulin levels of the SFH-treated db/db mice ( [Fig. 2C](#F2)) was significantly < 0.01), indicating that SFH improved pancreatic cell function. Taken together, these results suggest that SFH improved pancreatic cell function and glucose tolerance of the db/db mice. SFH helps maintain pancreatic cells integrity by increasing pancreatic cell mass [Fig. 3A and D](#F3)). In comparison, insulin immunoreactivity was weak and glucagon-immunoreactive cells were observed in the center of the islets from the pancreas of control db/db and immunoreactivity and F](#F3)). [Table 2](#T2)). In cell volume was significantly decreased in the SFH-treated db/db mice relative to the untreated db/db mice ( [Table 2](#T2)). These immunohistochemical observations were closely correlated to our biochemical measurements demonstrating the anti-diabetic effects of SFH, suggesting that this compound helped maintain pancreatic cell integrity. Discussion [9](#B9), [17](#B17)] and add new information about how SFH works in a non-insulin dependent diabetic mellitus animal model. Our findings clearly showed that SFH helps maintain integrity of pancreatic cells and up-regulates the production of insulin in the hyperglycemic db/db mouse. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation is increased to response to high glucose levels in db/db mice [ [4](#B4)]. It is well known that pancreatic cells are extremely sensitive to ROS, and ROS are involved in the progression of pancreatic cell dysfunction [ [4](#B4)]. Since SFH was found to decrease ROS formation in a pancreatic cell line [ [19](#B19)], the reduction of ROS by SFH treatment is likely due to elimination of glucose toxicity resulting in protection from the toxic effects of ROS. In the present study, SFH treatment decreased glucose levels and maintained cell mass. [21](#B21)] and animals [ [22](#B22), [23](#B23)]. The SFH used in our study contained a mixture of various-sized peptides and individual amino acids. Therefore, it is possible that the single amino acids may have promoted insulin secretion in the diabetic animals. To exclude this possibility, db/db mice were treated with an amino acid mixture of the same composition. These amino acids did not decrease blood glucose levels in the db/db mice (data not shown). Recently, Kim et al. [ [11](#B11)] reported that a fibroin-derived peptide (GAGAGY) enhances glucose transport in normal and insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 cells. It would be interesting to determine whether the SFH used in our study contains "}
