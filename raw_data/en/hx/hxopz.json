Information and guidance about COVID-19 care and vaccination continues to evolve. Please refer to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the latest. Getting the COVID-19 vaccine is a critical step toward [protecting you from the virus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html), but remember \u2014 its effect isn't immediate. Getting vaccinated also doesn't mean you can let up on those important safety measures. Here's what to know and what to do after you get the COVID-19 vaccine. Get your second dose, if applicable. If this is your first dose and the vaccine you are receiving requires two doses, make sure you get the second dose at the appropriate time. You should get your second dose as close to the recommended interval as possible. Learn more about the different types of vaccines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html). Keep wearing a mask. It takes time for your body to build protection after any vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines that require two shots may not protect you until a week or two after your second shot. So, continue to wear a mask, physically distance from others and wash your hands often, even after vaccination. For more specific guidelines on life after vaccination, consult these [CDC post-vaccination guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html). Care for side effects. While mild side effects are to be expected, the likelihood of experiencing severe side effects is less than .5%. Side effects may feel like the flu and even affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. You may take an over-the-counter pain reliever after getting vaccinated for mild side effects like soreness or [fever](/blog/fever-101-what-to-do-and-when-to-worry/) (as long as your doctor has told you they are safe for you).

To reduce discomfort from fever: - Drink plenty of fluids. - Dress lightly. If you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction or an emergency after leaving the vaccination site, call 911. Tell your doctor.
