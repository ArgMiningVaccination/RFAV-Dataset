[Read more]() Yoga at home for beginners, intermediate and advanced levels. Deepen your understanding of yoga, not just on a physical or practical level, but as a way of moving through life with our at home yoga practice series. Now, you can practice wherever and whenever it works for you! This online yoga course is different from others because it's focused on also helping you understand the philosophy behind yoga. This understanding can bring tremendous alignment to your practice and life. You'll no longer see yoga as something you just do, or a practice that's separate from you. Your thoughts, words, and actions will start to come together in a unified and powerful way. In this program, you're immersed into other aspects of yoga beyond the physical - some of the rich philosophy and background of yoga - which will give you a much more full and in-depth experience as you shift into moving your body into these ancient postures that have centuries' of energy charged behind them. This online yoga course includes: Yoga can look intimidating, especially if you associate yoga with handstands and \"challenging\" poses, but if you're just starting out and want to truly understand the pure beauty that is yoga, I'm confident you'll get so much from this program. And remember - doing \"hard\" poses certainly is not the goal of yoga. The goal is to experience internal and external shifts and start feeling more aware and conscious in all areas of your life\u2014 the formless parts that can't be seen with your physical eyes. Perhaps you've done some yoga in the past, and made some progress. This program can help you take your practice to the next level. You'll discover how to level up your practice, but also ease into it. Force and strain is the enemy of yoga, as it creates an internal sense of suffering and takes you away from your awareness of your breath and body. It's much better to be gentle and progress slowly, almost as though you don't even know you're \"working out\" - only to wake up one day and see how different your body looks and feels. If you've been doing yoga for a while, congratulations! You already know so much of what yoga can do for you. And the good news is, this program will not only provide some new sequence flows for you to practice with, but it can help deepen your understanding of yoga-not just on a physical or practical level, but as a way of moving through life. This allowed me to create a home practice, and practice yoga on my own schedule. It opened my mind to the philosophy of yoga and educated me about the Eight Limbs of Yoga including Pranayama (breathing and meditation), which I now include in my practice. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about yoga, and taking their practice to the next level. - Sharon It's been a while since I've done yoga, and I've been wanting to get back into it for a while. Everything on the video flows at a good pace and is narrated wonderfully so that I don't have to watch my screen the whole time. I love that it also has the course along with it that explains all the poses, the philosophies of yoga, the benefits for your health, and eating for your yoga. It's a complete package. I will definitely recommend this to all my friends! - Susan This is a different type of workout from my other strenuous power yoga programs. My favorite part of the routine was the 360 degree Mandala movements, which break us out of our usual linear poses. It does a great job teaching the importance of breath and linking it to the poses. The practice is very well-rounded. It isn't very strenuous but does leave you feeling detoxed and refreshed. As a professional triathlete, I enjoy the lengthening and stretching of this yoga. It is an excellent compliment to the pounding my body takes from running. Kimberly's instructions are specific and reassuring if you are a beginner, and she also provides a gentle relaxation for more advanced practitioners. Love it! - Kristyn The first time I did the full Vinyasa sequence, it felt amazing and I like that the pace is slow paced and not rushed. I would 100% recommend the course to a friend. You have 3 hours of yoga and so much information. This course leaves me with overall positive vibes. I can't stress enough how I love the slow pace and her peaceful voice. Simple as that. - Marina "}
