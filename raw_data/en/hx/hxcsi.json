Word to the Wise: Skip the ashwagandha gummies, as they tend to be full of sugar and low in potency. 2. TURMERIC A mainstay in Indian cooking, turmeric is Ayurveda's \"golden spice.\" This twisty root is ground into vibrant yellow powder that's used to flavor curries, but it has many health benefits, too.

Yes\u2014ashwagandha is a stimulant\u2014that is one action, but it also has the quality of being adaptogenic. According to the circumstances, it will adapt to handle any issues.
