In fact, the ancient Mayans and Aztecs revered cacao beans so highly that they used them as offerings to their deities and as currency to trade for other goods. They also concocted a bitter and spicy cacao beverage called xocolatl, which means \"cacao water.\" Xocolatl was consumed before battles, religious rituals, weddings, and other important events. Xocolatl was honored as a giver of strength, energy and courage, as well as a bridge to communication with the divine. Cacao was also used for medicinal purposes, such as treating diarrhea, coughs, fevers, skin problems, and snake bites. Ceremonial cacao was mostly an upper-class luxury in Aztec societ.

Health Benefits Of Ceremonial Cacao Ceremonial cacao contains various vitamins and minerals, including magnesium, calcium, iron, and antioxidants like flavanols. Here's a brief overview of the health benefits of ceremonial cacao: - Antioxidants: Ceremonial grade cacao can lower inflammation in the body due to its high concentration of antioxidants that fight oxidative stress and chronic diseases. - Gut Health: Drinking ceremonial cacao can support your gut health by acting as a prebiotic that feeds the beneficial bacteria in your digestive system. - Heart Health: It supports heart health by cleaning the deposits from your arteries, lowering blood pressure, and improving blood flow. - Blood Sugar Control: It helps control blood sugar by regulating insulin levels and reducing cravings for sweets. - Mood Boosting: By stimulating the production of serotonin, dopamine, and anandamide, which are neurotransmitters that make you feel happy, motivated, and relaxed, ceremonial cacao acts as a natural antidepressant. One of the reasons ceremonial cacao can increase serotonin is because it contains tryptophan, a heat sensitive amino acid that converts to serotonin in the body. Usually it's\"cooked out\" of conventional processed chocolate. Ceremonial cacao preserves the tryptophan content by using low temperatures and minimal processing. Because ceremonial cacao has the ability to increase feelings of love, it plays an essential role in many spiritual practices. - Reduces Anxiety: Ceremonial cacao has one of the highest concentrations of magnesium known to man, with about 103 mg per 28 g serving. Because magnesium is is essential for muscle relaxation and nervous system function, the mega doses you get of this important mineral will help with stress management.
