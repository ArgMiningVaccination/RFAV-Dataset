There is less scientific evidence available about their safety and effectiveness , than for conventional treatments for pain management. Many of the complementary approaches studied for chronic pain have good safety records , but that doesn't mean that they are risk free for everyone. Many things need to be considered prior to using any CAM therapy such as a person's age, current health status , prese nce of other medical conditions or pregnancy . Another major consideration is taking prescribed or over the counter medications , as these may affect the safety of some complementary approaches. If you are considering or using a complementary approach for pain, you need to check with your health care provider to make sure that it is safe for you and is compatible with your conventional medical treatments .
