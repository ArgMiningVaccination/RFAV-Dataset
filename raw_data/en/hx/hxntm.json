Problem -solving is a viable solution to improving self-care behavior. One approach to helping those living with diabetes is DECIDE, Decision-Mak ing, Education for Choices in Diabetes Every Day,\u00a9 a problem-solving approach. Currently, DECIDE\u00a9 is delivered through several modalities (self -study, individual, group, and enhanced). The next natural step is to deliver DECIDE\u00a9 through novel technology su ch as web -based or mobile apps. This study provides preliminary background on usability testing of the eDECIDE website to better understand the user - centered design approach and acceptance. METHODS Participants (n = 11) with a diagnosis of diabetes and no current diabetes self -management education were recruited to capture the user- centered design of the eDECIDE intervention website. Qualitative interviews and the System Usability Scale was used to capture participant satisfaction and perception of site usability. RESULTS Eleven participants (three male, eight female), with a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes , completed usability testing of the eDEICDE website. For system usability, 100% of participants stated they would use eDECIDE frequently, 7 2% stated they would be confident in using eDECIDE and found the program easy to use. Majority of participants stated they were satisfied with the overall design of eDECIDE and would recommend to others. DISCUSSION The benefit of using a web -based modali ty to deliver problem-solving interventions in community settings is the ability to reach more of the population and easier access to diabetes self -management education for the patient. Usability testing helps ensure proper designs.

Since this implementation, there have not been any requirements developed for dental educational institutions to integrate the new diagnostic system. This pilot study explored how dental residents from differing doctoral programs were taught to classify periodontal and peri -implant diseases, to determine if a current standard exists. METHODS This IRB -approved pilot study distributed online surveys to 11 dental residents enrolled in an advanced education residency program through Qualtrics secure survey system. The survey consisted of 26 questions designed to measure understanding and implementation of periodontal classification systems. Additionally, there were four descriptive questions to collect demographic data and two open ended questions. RESULTS A total of nine residents (81%) completed the survey, six were male and three were female. Frequency analysis indicated a lack of standardization related to the c lassification of periodontal disease and peri - implant disease among the dental school curriculums that the residents attended. The distribution of responses for what periodontal classification system was taught (p = 0.01) was significantly different. The classification that residents use to diagnose gingivitis and periodontitis (p = 0.006) was also significantly different among responses. DISCUSSION The development of a standardized curriculum is suggested to provide the best educational experience for den tal students and provide the highest standard of periodontal care for patients. To gain additional knowledge if periodontal classification educational standards exist across institutions, the survey will be disseminated to a larger dental resident population.

Utilizing current research on various factors affecting sleep (probiotics, melatonin, light, polyphasic sleep) and effects of sleep (hormone secretion, body composition), a general assembly of kno wledge was compiled. METHODS Seven students gathered data from several online scientific databases and journals. Each article answered a distinct research question, with subsequent articles further investigating that topic. This research furthered our col lective understanding of sleep. RESULTS Probiotics alter gut health and improve sleep quality through the gut -brain-axis. Through a tryptophan- rich diet, melatonin synthesis increases. As sleep quality and deprivation worsen, a disruption in hormone levels occurs, creating a rise in body mass index and obesity, often leading to sleep apnea. Sleeping techniques can affect the brain's ability to flush out neurotoxins. Blue light disrupts circadian rhythms, potentially delaying sleep onset. By capitalizing on certain lucid dreaming techniques, people can employ sleep to accomplish specific goals. DISCUSSION By taking more mindful actions while awake to prepare for a better night's sleep, we can procure its benefits. The complex nature of sleep allows researchers to progress our understanding and applications of sleep, especially as technology advances.

Although some ingredients boost health, the large amount of caffeine found in these drinks causes adverse health effects. The Food and Drug Administration's daily limit for caffe ine is 400 mg; 200 mg is found in a single energy drink. METHODS To substantiate the advertised amount of caffeine in energy drinks, an Agilent 6850 gas chromatograph (GC) was used to quantitatively analyze actual caffeine content in energy drinks. A standard caffeine solution was prepared using 50 mg caffeine in 50 mL methanol. Prepared dilutions of known concentration were used to create a calibration curve, peak area vs. molarity. Samples of energy drinks (N 1-N4) were diluted with methanol (solvent) and analyzed using the GC. The area of the caffeine peak was used to determine concentration of caffeine in the sample. RESULTS Using the caffeine standard, the retention time of caffeine was determined to be 16.48 minutes. In our energy drink chromatogr ams, peak areas for caffeine were identified. Using the equation for the best fit line from the standard calibration, the concentration of caffeine was calculated. Based on the energy drink label, our error was approximately 7%. DISCUSSION Although we could identify the caffeine content in each energy drink tested, we could not accurately calculate the quantitative amount due to our error. Our plans include repeating the procedure to increase our sample size (n>39) to facilitate a lower margin of error.

Without a formal curriculum on these subjects, residents learn primarily from attending physicians and community practices. This study aimed to evaluate contraceptive education, knowledge, and contractive counseling practices among OB - GYN residents and recent OB -GYN graduates. METHODS This was a prospective study utilized a cross-sectional survey administered to current KUSM -W OB -GYN residents and program graduates from the last five years. Survey questions included demographics, knowledge of contraception, provider confidence, and contraceptive counseling and procedures. Responses were included if any knowledge questions were answered. RESULTS Out of 43 possible participants, 26 were included in the final analysis for a response rate of 60.5%. Approximately half of respondents were residents (n = 14, 53.9%). Of the residents, 42.9% (6/14) answered at least 75% of knowledge questions correctly, compared to 91.7% (11/12) of graduates (p = 0.012). Half of residents (50%, 7/14) strongly agreed that they felt confident with counseling, compare d to 100% of graduates (p = 0.004). Half of residents (50%, 7/14) strongly agreed that they were confident with procedures and prescribing methods compared to 90.9% (10/11) of graduates (p = 0.063). Contraceptive knowledge increased with increasing resident year and graduation year (p = 0.0093). DISCUSSION Over the course of residency, residents attain more knowledge regarding contraception. Graduate data suggests knowledge and confidence increase with real -world clinical practice. Including a formal family planning curriculum may result in increased contraceptive knowledge and confidence in procedural skills among resident physicians earlier in their training.

We tested the hypothesis that topical delivery of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) was superior to intravenous (IV) administration in the setting of primary TKA. METHODS This cross -sectional study included a six- year retrospective cha rt review of TKA patients done by a single surgeon. We compared post-operative hemoglobin levels and the incidence of blood transfusions among three patient subgroups: no EACA, topical EACA, or IV EACA. Key outcome measures included post -operative hemoglob in, need for post -operative transfusion, and length of hospital stay . RESULTS Of the 668 patients included in this study, 351 (52.5%) received IV EACA, 298 (44.6%) received topical EACA, and 19 (2.8%) received no EACA. For the three -way comparisons, signi ficant differences were observed for post-operative mean hemoglobin on day one (p < 0.001), day two (p < 0.001), and day three (p = 0.004) with consistently higher means for participants in the topical group. Eight patients required transfusion in the IV EACA group, but none were needed in the topical EACA group (p = 0.027). Length of stay was shortest for patients in the topical group with 66% staying hospitalized for two days, while 84% of the IV group remained hospitalized for three days (p < 0.001) . DISCUSSION The topical delivery of EACA is superior to IV administration with respect to blood conservation for patients undergoing primary TKA .

The purpose of this study was to determine if this practice has an effect on screw purchase . METHODS Using an axial -torsion load device, we measured the maximal insertion torque (MIT) required to insert 3.5 mm stainless steel cortical screws into normal and osteoporotic bone models. MIT was determined in three different test conditions: (1) long screw (LS) insertion; (2) LS insertion, removal, and insertion of a normal -length screw (NS); and (3) LS insertion, removal, cutting excess length from the screw tip, and reinserting the CS. RESULTS In the normal bone model, mean (\u00b1 SD) MIT of LS insertion was 546 \u00b1 6 N-cm comp ared to 496 \u00b1 61 N - cm for NS reinsertion and 465 \u00b1 69 N -cm for cut screw reinsertion. In the osteoporotic bone model, MIT of LS insertion was 110 \u00b1 11N -cm, whereas the values for NS and CS reinsertions were 98 \u00b1 9 N -cm and 101 \u00b1 12 N -cm, respectively. Ther e was no significant difference in MIT between CS and NS reinsertions in the osteoporotic bone analog . DISCUSSION Cutting excess length from a 3.5 mm stainless steel cortical screw does not decrease its purchase regardless of bone density. During osteosynthesis, orthopaedists may remove screws which are too long, cut the screw tip, and reinsert the shortened screw as a cost -saving measure without compromising fracture fixation .

Hollenbeck, M.D. Stacked 1/3 Tubular Pl ates for Fixation of Pediatric Forearm Fractures : A Biomechanical Study Benjamin Cooper, M.D.1, Alex Wendling, M.D.1, 1University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita, 2Wichita State University INTRODUCTION Among operatively treated pediatric forearm fractures, many different fixation constructs are described. The goal of this study is to define the biomechanical properti es of a do uble stacked 1/3 tubular plate construct used by the senior author for some fractures and to review available literature regarding the use of stacked plates . METHODS Biomechanical testing was performed by four -point bending of three different plate constructs: 1/3 tubular plate, stacked 1/3 tubular plates, and 2.7 mm LC -DCP plate. Five test specimens were evaluated for each of the three plate constructs. From stress -strain curves, flexural stiffness (N/mm), force to cause plastic deformation (N), and force to cause 10\u00ba bend (N) were calculated and compared using standard t -test statistics . RESULTS Key outcome parameter means (\u00b1 SD) for the three plate constructs (1/3 tubular plate, stacked 1/3 tubular plates, and 2.7 mm LC -DCP plate) are reported respectively \u00b1 13.0 N, 10\u00ba \u00b1 8.4 N, 299.4 \u00b1 14.1 N, 265.5 \u00b1 21.2 N). Mean values of all three measures were significantly larger for the stacked 1/3 tubular plates than for the other plate constructs . DISCUSSION The stacked 1/3 tubular plate construct was biomechanically superior to the other plate co nstructs. Stacked plating significantly improves stiffness of the fracture fixation construct supporting use of this technique in selected trauma cases .

Carrier Screening Knowledge and Clinical Practices A mong Resident and Attend ing OB/GYN Physicians Chandler Kasuske, School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODUCTION Carrier screening offers patients a test to assess individual carrier status for a disorder. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and American College Medical Genetics recommend offering carrier screening to all couples as a component of pre -conception counseling to allow individuals to make informed reproductive choices. The purpose of this study is to assess and compare knowledge and practices related to genetic carrier screening among obstetrician -gynecologists. METHODS This prospective study utilized a cross -sectional web- base d survey administered to a convenience sample of resident and faculty obstetrician-gynecologists at a single academic institution. Survey questions included demographics, knowledge of genetic screening, and comfort with counseling regarding genetic screeni ng. Gynecology Oncology and Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive subspecialists were excluded. Responses were included if any knowledge questions were answered. RESULTS A total of 29 participants completed the survey, for a response rate of 47.5%. Approximately 75% of respondents were attendings (75.9%, n = 22). All respondents reported that the physician addressed genetic carrier screening in the clinic setting. Most respondents (75.9%, n = 22) referred positive screening results to genetic counselor s for further management. Of respondents correctly answering 75% or more knowledge questions correctly, more were attending physicians (p = 0.049). There was a statistically significant difference in agreement between attendings and residents regarding the statement, \"I am comfortable discussing positive carrier screening results with the patient\" (p = 0.009). DISCUSSION Obstetrician -gynecologists report addressing genetic carrier screening in clinical settings, although most referred positive results to genetic counselors. Resident physicians are less comfortable discussing positive screening results with patients than attendings.

The twelve weeks following delivery, referred to as the fourth trimester, has recently been emphasized as the period to initiate ongoing interventions. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a scripted, structured phone call to patients one week postpartum to increase breastfeeding and maternal outcomes. METHODS This prospective cross -sectional survey study included patients treated at a single obstetrical clinic. The intervention, a scripte d phone call performed 7 -10 days postpartum by a nurse, assessed breastfeeding practices, postpartum depression, safe sleep, gestational diabetes, and confirmed the postpartum visit. At the postpartum visit, patients were invited to complete a survey colle cting demographics, breastfeeding practices and difficulties, postpartum support, and safe sleep practices. RESULTS Out of 17 surveys collected, the majority of respondents were white (64.7%, n = 11), with an average age of 26.7\u00b15.5 years. Half of respondents (52.9%, n = 9) were exclusively breastfeeding, 17.7% (n = 3) were exclusively formula feeding, and 29.4% (n = 5) reported a mixture of both. Half of respondents (56.3%, 9/16) reported no difficulties breastfeeding. All respondents felt they received a dequate breastfeeding support from providers antepartum, and 94.1% (n = 16) felt adequate support postpartum. Most respondents felt providers were proactive asking about breastfeeding problems (88.2%, n = 15). Eleven (64.7%) respondents correctly reported appropriate safe sleep position for their baby. DISCUSSION Implementation of a scripted, structured postpartum phone call intervention promoted maternal education and provider support of breastfeeding and demonstrated improved breastfeeding support for patients. An opportunity to discuss safe sleep could be improved.

Most postpartum hemorrhages are attributed to uterine atony. The best combination of uterotonics to prevent primary postpartum hemorrhage after high rates of oxytocin has yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to examine whether rectal misoprostol administered immediately after delivery reduces the risk of hemorrhage in women with high doses of intrapartum oxytocin. METHODS This study is a retrospective cohort study of patients treated by a single obstetrician -gynecologist. Patients were included if delivering at a single institution between October 1, 2015, and December 1, 2020. De -identifed data were provided to investigators for secondary analysis. Patients were excluded if medication logs did not indicate supplemental oxytocin was given during labor. Patients were classified into two groups based on whether th e patient received rectal misoprostol postpartum. RESULTS Out of 417 patients, the majority (86.1%, n = 359) were white, with an average BMI of 34.2\u00b19.1 at the time of delivery. Average patient age at delivery was 29.5\u00b14.7 years old. Most patients deliver ed vaginally (98.9%, 365/369). There were 22 (5.3%) patients who received rectal misoprostol postpartum, with an average dose of 609.1\u00b1115.1 mcg. Out of 10 (2.4%) of diagnosed hemorrhages, 20% (n = 2) of patients received rectal misoprostol compared to 80% (n = 8) of patients who did not receive rectal misoprostol (p = 0.093). DISCUSSION Prophylactic use of rectal misoprostol after delivery may potentially reduce the risk of hemorrhage in women with high doses of intrapartum oxytocin -additional studies with a larger sample size should be conducted.

The objective of the study was to gain insight into the knowledge and attitudes regarding fertility preservation among medical students. METHODS Medical students at The University of Kansas School of Medicine (KUSM) participated in a prospective, cross -sectional web-based survey study. Survey questions included knowledge- based questions based on the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) fertility preservation guidelines, and attitudes towards fertility preservation were measured using Likert scales. RESULTS Most respondents (N = 123, response rate: 14.1%) were 20-29 years old (94.3%, n = 116) and were seeking Family Medicine as a specialty (18.7%, n = 23). In terms of training, 16.5% of respondents (n = 20) reported having formal lectures on fertility preservation and 31.7% (n = 38) on assisted reproduction technology. More than 45% of clinical students reported not being exposed to reproductive endocrinology and infertility o r fertility preservation on clinical rotations (n = 32/70). Only 1.6% of respondents (n = 2) correctly answered at least 75% of knowledge questions about fertility preservation. Almost half (49.5%, 51/103) of respondents reported discomfort discussing fert ility preservation with patients needing fertility preservation. Patient prognosis, finances, and age were the top factors influencing the professional decision to provide a patient with fertility preservation information. DISCUSSION Students indicate poor familiarity and comfort with discussing fertility preservation, which in the future, may reduce and/or delay patient access to this option. Thus, medical student curriculum focused on reproductive endocrinology and fertility preservation represents an im portant educational opportunity to improve patient care and outcomes.

PFA has shown promising results, especially when custom protheses are utilized. The purpose of this study is to evaluate short -term functional outcomes and complications of the custom PFA in treatment of isolated patellofemoral arthritis. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted to analyze patients who received a p atellofemoral arthroplasty operation from a single surgeon. Inclusion criteria were surgical patients from 2012 to 2018 who underwent patellofemoral arthroplasty using a custom prosthesis implant. Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Repl acement (KOOS, JR) and Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS) were collected both pre - and post -operative. RESULTS A total of 89 patients participated in the study; a majority, 67 (75.3%), were female. The mean age was 56.8 at the time of index arthroplasty; 30 (33.7%) were bilateral. Median follow up was three years. Overall pre- and post -functional scores differed significantly for both KOOS, JR and LEFS. Post scores increased for KOOS, JR by 27.5 points, and for LEF they increased 26.0 points; p < 0.001 for both. This difference was greater for females in both scores. Complications included six reoperations related to patellofemoral replacement: four conversions to total knee arthroplasty one VMO advancement secondary to patellar maltracking, and one manipulation under anesthesia. DISCUSSION The custom patellofemoral arthroplasty in patients with isolated patellofemoral arthritis showed good short-term functional outcomes and low revision rates with very few complications.

We hypothesized that high -grade supraspinatus fatty infiltration would be negatively correlated with handgrip strength, shoulder strength and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) METHODS Patients with MRI -proven rotator cuff tears treated by a single sports medicine fellowship -trained orthopaedist at a single institution underwent comprehensive preoperative evaluation including bilateral handgrip and shoulder strength measurements with dynamometers and multiple online questionnaires from the Surgical Outcomes SystemTM (Arthrex, Naples, FL). Available shoulder MRIs were reviewed to grade supraspinatus fatty infiltration severity according to the 5 -tier Goutallier system and an alternate 3 -tier classification scheme. Differe nce analysis and Spearman (rho) rank order correlation were applied to the collected data to define the relationships between supraspinatus fatty infiltration and key variables including handgrip strength, shoulder strength and scores derived from the shou lder PROMs RESULTS Ninety of the 121 patients enrolled in the study had shoulder MRIs available for review. We found no correlation between supraspinatus fatty infiltration and handgrip strength, shoulder abduction strength or any of the seven common shou lder PROM scores we evaluated. There was statistically significant albeit weak correlation between MRI- derived fatty infiltration and shoulder external rotation strength DISCUSSION Contrary to our hypothesis, high -grade supraspinatus fatty infiltration is largely unrelated to and should not be considered predictive of handgrip strength, shoulder strength or common shoulder PROM scores For more information please contact: Steve Engels , BSN (316) 268-5463 sengels@kumc.edu 18 Poster ID: ku mcwv-47 Category: Human Subjects Research Level: KU Resident Department: Pharmacy Assessing Adolescent Vaccination Rates after Pharmacist Provided Personalized Vaccine Recommendation Adrianna Herrman, Medical Center -Kansas City, 2Balls Food Stores/University of Kansas School of Pharmacy INTRODUCTION The COVID -19 vaccin ation approval for adolescents presented an opportunity for community pharmacists to address gaps in adolescent immunization schedules. The objectives of this research were to identify adolescent immunization gaps, identify number of patients receiving rec ommended vaccination(s) at the community pharmacy, determine how many vaccinations are administered, identify COVID -19 vaccine hesitations and how they were overcome. METHODS Three pharmacies conducted the prospecitve intervention. Adolescents 11 -17 years old completing the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccination series were eligible to receive a personalized vaccination recommendation. State immunization databases were assessed after dose one to create the recommendation(s) and reassesed two months afterwards for acc epted recommendations. Additionally, caregivers completed a COVID -19 vaccine hesitancy survey. Patient demographics and number of vaccinations administered were assessed using descriptive statistics. Data was evaluated using SPSS v.27 with an a-priori alph a of 0.05. RESULTS Of 225 adolescents who received COVID -19 vaccine dose one, 74.7%, 75.1%, and 83.1% were indicated to receive Tdap, Menactra, or Gardasil respectively. Of these 225 adolescents, 180 returned to the same location for dose two and received a recommendation. Forty -two caregivers reported their adolescent previously received one or more of the recommended vaccinations; therefore, databases were inaccurate. Two months after the recommendation, ten vaccinations had been administered. On the vaccine hesitancy survey, caregivers reported side effects (4.3%) most frequently. DISCUSSION Pharmacist provided recommendations may encourage timely administration of vaccinations for adolescents. A majority of adolescents presenting for a COVID -19 vaccine were indicated to receive another vaccination; however, according to caregiver input, datab ases may lead to inaccurate recommendations.

However, weight loss interventions are often time -intensive, thus increasing the need for more attainable interventions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a four -week weight loss intervention that encouraged lifestyle modification. METHODS Overweight (BMI 25 - 24.9) or obese (BMI 30) patients participated in a four -week in-office weight loss intervention using MyPlate dietary guidelines combined with 150 minutes of weekly physical activity. Participants recorded daily intake and activity. Participants were provided education on estimating calories. RESULTS Thirty-four patients participated, 62% (n = 21) of whom were female. The average age was 62 years. Most were Caucasian (71%, n = 24), 26% (n = 9) were African American, and 3% (n = 1) were Asian American. About half (53%, n = 18) reported incomes between $20,000 and $89,999. Half (50%, n = 17) reported having at least some college education, and 20% (n = 7) reported graduate level. At baseline, the average weight was 225 pounds, and the average BMI was 37.4. More than half (56%) of the participants completed th e four -week intervention. 47% remained consistent with meal recordings, and 35% met the weekly physical activity requirement. The mean percentage of weight loss progressively increased from 0.5% in the second week to 0.8% in the third week and 2% in the fo urth week. DISCUSSION This study suggests that short real -world interventions can be feasible for promoting weight loss in obese and overweight patients.

Some studies have suggested that proximity to maternal care may impact maternal experiences. The purpose of this project was to examine the relationship between maternity care satisfaction and distance traveled for care in rural Kansas. METHODS Surveys were distributed across 15 rural communities. Adult women residing and delivering in rural Kansas counties were eligible. Primary outcomes of interest included maternity satisfaction and distance traveled for maternity care. Secondary outcomes included maternal age and delivery provider. Maternity satisfaction was measured using a Likert scale on a 12 -item survey. A series of t-tests and Pearson correlation coefficients were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Of the 80 participants who met inclusion criteria, 50 traveled less than 20 miles and 30 traveled more than 20 miles for maternity care. We found no significant correlation in maternity care satisfaction between women traveling shorter versus longer distances (less than 20 miles versus more than 20 miles; t = 1.213; p = .229). No difference was found in satisfaction between women whose babies were delivered by a Family Physician (N = 34) versus OB -GYN (N = 43) (t = .408; p = .684). Patient age was significantly correlated with maternal satisfaction (Pearson r = .271; p = .015). DISCUSSION These findings suggest that distance traveled for maternity care services in rural Kansas do es not significantly affect maternity care satisfaction although a larger cohort would be more conclusive.

In 2007, the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommended evaluation of the HER2 marker as a prognostic factor in breast cancer work -up; however, it is unusual to see HER2 overexpression in men. This study sought to evaluate the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of HER2 positive (HER2+) MaBC. MET HODS This study included males, 18 years of age or older, with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer from January 2010 through December 2017. Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Research Plus dataset titled, \"Incide nce - SEER Research Plus Data. 18 Registries. Nov 2019.\" RESULTS Of the 4,062 cases of MaBC within the dataset, 462 were HER2+. Those with HER2+ MaBC were younger than those with HER2 negative cancer at the time of diagnosis, had more poorly differentiate d cancer, larger mean tumor size, and greater number of positive lymph nodes. Those with HER2+ MaBC were more often diagnosed with distal disease and had shorter survival. Treatment of HER2+ cancer was more likely to include chemotherapy and/or systemic th erapy both before and after surgery. Lastly, men with HER2+ cancer had a higher rate of cancer -related mortality. DISCUSSION MaBC is rare, and HER2+ MaBC is even more so, occurring in only 11.4% of MaBC patients. Our study suggests that men who were diagn osed with HER2+ MaBC had more advanced disease at diagnosis and worse outcomes despite increased utilization of systemic therapy.

Pandemic Innovation of a Closed Loop O2 Flow -Modulator for Supplemental Oxygen Delivery Shiv Dalla, MS -3, Tanner Dean, D.O., Brent Duran, D.O. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODUCTION The pandemic has led to an increased number of patients requiring supplemental oxygen. Due to the constraints on staff, titration of supplemental oxygen may not occur expediently. The Improving Oxygen Therapy Acute-illness (IOTA) systematic review showed blood oxygen saturation levels (SpO2%) greater than 94% may increase mortality without added benefits. This project details an oxy gen delivery device that is automated to respond to patients' SpO2% or manually adjusted through the Internet -of-Things (IoT). METHODS The device was created using an ESP32 -microcontroller, flow -meter, proportional valve, and 3D printed case. The microcontroller receives input from providers (via WiFi on Blynk.io IoT platform) or patient, and a closed -loop -feedback from the flow -meter. Using these parameters, it changes output to the valve to achieve a desired oxygen flow (liters/min) or SpO2%. These parameters are then fed back to Blynk.io and displayed. RESULTS The device is not yet able to be tested with patients due to lack of precedence or approval. However, the device was validated using standard hospital oxygen supply as well as an oxygen fl ow-meter to verify delivery of the correct flow. There is some deviation between desired flow and output at higher flow rates, but this may be due to the need for calibration. DISCUSSION This non -FDA approved device could be used to decrease the manual labor of supplemental oxygen titration in hospitalized patients. More responsive supplemental oxygen titration can help mitigate oxygen toxicity in-line with the IOTA findings. This device requires further validation before being used in patient care.

The purpose of this study was to identify and evaluate factors associated with telemedicine utilization in rural Kansas. METHODS Patients in rural Kansas responded to a self -administered questionnaire. Adults ages 18 and older seeking medical care in STORM preceptors' clinics between June 7th, 2021, and July 31, 2021, were eligible for inclusion in this cross -sectional, mixed methods study. Our primary outcome of interest was whether a patient had used telemedicine services over the previous 12 months. Additional outcomes of interest were factors associated with patient participation in telehealth. RESULTS There were 59 survey respondents; 44 completed the survey and were included in the analysis. Of those, 17 (38.6%) had a telemedicine appointment in the past 12 months, and 27 (61.4%) did not. 100% of telemedicine patients and 96.3% of non -telemedicine patients had internet access, and all had access to at least one electronic device. 41.2% of telemedicine and 25.9% of non -telemedicine patients disagreed or strongly disagreed that cost was a factor in scheduling a telemedicine appointment. Both telemedicine and non- telemedicine patients reported willingness to participate in fut ure telemedicine services, 94.1%, and 70.4% respectively. About 29% of each group worried about the quality of care received. DISCUSSION While internet and devices are not factors, rural providers may need to consider the role of cost and quality in patient decision-making. This data is a starting point for identifying factors related to telehealth services in rural Kansas.

The increases in access to and advancements in telemedicine have led to redu ced costs, a wider scope of care, and improved health outcomes in rural populations. However, more research is needed on how rural Kansas populations are responding to the increased use of telehealth appointments. The purpose of this study was to explore patients' perspectives on telemedicine, assess the longevity of telemedicine use, and identify ways telemedicine could be improved. METHODS We distributed an electronic survey to patients of rural primary care practices that participated in the STORM program from June -July 2021. The survey used open- and closed -ended questions. RESULTS Among the 44 participants , 17 (38.6%) had a telemedicine appointment within the past year. Of those, 17/17 (100%) identified as white, 11/17 (64.7%) were female, 9/17 had an annual income 50k-99k, and 17/17 (100%) had insurance with 7/17 (41.2%) having state sponsored and 11/17(64.7%) having employee sponsored insurance. A majority (12/17, 70.6%) were very satisfied with their appointment. Patients reported negative telemedicine experiences as being \"glitchy\" and \"a little impersonal.\" Participants reported \"no travel time\" and \"convenient\" as positive experiences. DISCUSSION Our study showed rural Kansas populations were satisfied with telemedicine appointments and are willing to continue using telemedicine services in the future. This study is a starting point for rural primary care clinics to further investigate their patients' perspectives, discover areas of improvement, increase access to care, and advocate for greater access to reliable internet.

This study aimed to determine if there were differences in prescribing practices based on the postoperative day opioid prescriptions were written, and before and after the publication of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee Opinion 742. METHODS This retrospective chart review study included women who had a live birth via cesarean at a single institution from July 1, 2017, to February 28, 2021, and excluded patients with chorioamnionitis or discharged after more than four days. Opioids were converted to oral morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for comparison, and total MME was calculated for each prescription. Patient s were grouped based on date of delivery in comparison to the publication of ACOG Committee Opinion 742 (July 2018). IRB approval was obtained for this study. RESULTS Out of 411 patients, 93.9% (n = 386) had opioids prescribed at discharge, 85.5% of whom (330/386) received a prescription written on the day of discharge. There was no difference in the quantity of MMEs in discharge prescriptions between those written on the day of discharge and those written on a prior day. Patients delivering after the new ACOG Opinion (63.9%, n = 263) received discharge prescriptions with fewer average MMEs (159.53\u00b161.64) than those who delivered before the publication (36%, n = 148) (187.35\u00b153.42), x2 (1, N = 411) = 17.71, p < 0.001. DISCUSSION Patients delivering via cesarean after the published ACOG Committee Opinion 742 received discharge prescriptions with fewer MMEs. There was no difference between prescriptions written the day of versus before discharge.

Failure to attend regular appointments in a cleft and craniofacial clinic can hinder the delivery of proper care. We sought to understand the main causes of missed appointments and reasons for loss to follow -up at the Kansas Cleft and Craniofacial Center. METHODS A retrospective chart review of patients with cleft and craniofacial difference was conducted at the Kansas Cleft and Craniofacial Center from 2017 to 2022. Our database was comprised of 183 patients. Our primary outcome variable was missed appointments and loss to follow -up. Then, a regression model was used to determine which demographics, diagnoses, cleft -related condi tions, distance from clinic, and other variables impacted the likelihood of missed appointments. RESULTS Our missed appointment rate was 50%. The loss to follow -up (LTF) rate was 37%, with LTF defined as two or more years without a clinic appointment. Fewer cleft -related conditions, such as hypernasality, malocclusion, nasal deformity and others, were statistically significant predictors of missed appointments (p = 0.0006). Distance to clinic, insurance type, age, and type of diagnosis did not appear to im pact likelihood of a missed appointment. DISCUSSION Patients who do not have many cleft -related conditions may not perceive the need to attend their cleft clinic appointments. Early and frequent education on the need for regular evaluation in a multidisci plinary setting may be critical to decreasing number of missed appointments.

Effectiveness of Ultrasound-Guided Ten don Fenestration and Injection Procedures to Treat Tendinosis of Medicine-Wichita, 2Via Christi Regional Medical Center INTRODUCTION Tendinosis causes chronic pain and dysfunction. For cases of ten dinosis resistant to conservative management, ultrasound -guided ten don fenestration (e.g. dry needling, tenotomy) or injection (e.g. prolotherapy, autologous whole blood injection) are treatment options. This research sought to compare the effectiveness of these treatments for pain improvement and ability to return to activity for patients with tendinosis. METHODS Patients 15 years or older who underwent at least one procedure with dry needling, needle tenotomy, prolotherapy, or autologous whole blood inje ction for treatment of tendinosis at a local sports medicine clinic between January 1, 2014 and April 17, 2019, were included. RESULTS Of the 56% of procedures that had a follow-up (n = 334), 80% of patients reported diminished pain, and 2% reported incre ased pain. Significantly more who underwent prolotherapy (81%, n = 17), autologous whole blood injections (80%, n = 113), or dry needling (69%, n = 135) reported improved pain at follow - up than those who underwent needle tenotomy (43%, n = 3). Additionally, significantly more patients who underwent autologous whole blood injections (61%, n = 85) were able to return to activity than those who underwent dry needling (41%, n = 79) or prolotherapy (38%, n = 8). DISCUSSION Tendo n fenestration and injection procedures can be effective treatment options for tendinosis, with a low likelihood of increased patient pain. Autologous whole blood injection may have a better likelihood of decreasing patient pain and allow patients to return to activity more than dry needl ing, needle tenotomy, or prolotherapy.

The purpo se of our study was to evaluate the expression of uterine natural killer cells and cytotoxic T -lymphocytes in endo metrial tissue from women with non-structural AUB and evaluate the localization of granulysin. METHODS Endometrial biopsies were obtained fro m 30 subjects with (N = 15) and without (N = 15) AUB during the secretory stage of the menstrual cycle. Uterine natural killer cell (uNK) and cytotoxic T -lymphocyte (CTL) content were assessed by immunohistochemical localization and expressed as the percentage of cells expressing CD56 (uNK), CD8 (CTL) or granulysin. Granulysin expression was CD56 or CD8) while granulysin mRNA levels were quantitated in portions of the same sections subjected to immunolocalization by qRT -PCR. RESULTS The number of uNK cells was significantly greater in en dometrial biopsy tissue from women with abnormal uterine bleeding compared to controls (41% +/ - 6.3% vs. 18% both cell types express granulysin, we quantitated its expression in en dometrial biopsies from the same patient population. In accord with increased expression of uNK and CTL cells, granulysin expression was significan tly greater in en dometrial biopsies from AUB patients +/ - and CD8 (CTLs). Therefore, granulysin is preD.O. minantly expressed in both uNK and CTLs and may play a role in the pathophysiology of AUB.

While sex -based outcomes for hip arthroscopy are often recorded, no studies have been dedicated to analyzing the literature as a whole. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate whether sex is a predictor of outcome in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for FAI. METHODS A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Databases used included: Pubmed, Embase, Chochrane, Ovid, and Pubmed Central. The search terms were used as fo llows: (\"Hip Arthroscopy\") AND \"Male\" OR \"Female\"). mHHS (Modified Harris Hip Score) and rate of RTS (Return to Sport) were reported due to their prevalence. RESULTS There were 12,466 stu dies after the initial search. Of these, 38 were included due to meeting eligibility criteria. Twelve of the 38 (32%) studies included in the systematic review concluded that female sex was a negative predictor of post-operative outcomes, while 4 of the 38 (10%) found female sex to be positive predictor. The remaining studies (58%) found there to be no difference in post -operative outcomes between the sexes. DISCUSSION Our study illustrates an insufficiency of high level evidence evaluating sex specific outcomes following hip arthroscopy. Both mHHS scores and RTS data were too heterogenous to appropriately pool together and analyze. Further studies with more standardized measures are needed to evaluate the difference in post -operative outcomes reg arding sex.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of COVID -19 on trauma case characteristics. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of all adult trauma patients presenting to a hospital from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 (n = 1,132) and March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021 (n = 1,030), with sub - analysis conducted according to four phases of the Kansas state Ad Astra plan: stay at home order through the end of Phase 2. Case characteristics from before and during COVID -19 were compared. RESULTS Patients had a median age of 50 year s, were mostly White, Level 2 trauma, and male, with more males seen during the pandemic (63.3 vs. 67.9%, p = 0.030). Shorter ICU stays (2.5 vs. 2 days, p = 0 .006), hospital stays ( three vs. two days, p = 0.007), and work -related incidents (6.2% vs. 4.0%, p = 0.023) occurred during COVID -19. Penetrating trauma increased (9.1 % vs. 12.5%) and MVCs decreased (34.6% vs. 30.5%; p = 0.036) during COVID -19. These differences were significant when the stay at home order began and during Phase 2. There was also a decrease in patients discharged to inpatient rehab and skilled nursing facilities with an increase in discharges to home and LATCH (p = 0.005). There was no significant change in number of OR procedures during any phase. DISCUSSION The strictest phases of lock down had the most impact on mechanism of injury, but no significant change in other characteristics . More changes were seen throughout the first year of the pandemic.

With depression as a major risk factor for suicide in ado lescent, this study examined depressive symptoms and electronic cigarette dependence in this age group. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective patient chart review at a pediatric clinic in the Midwestern United States, from May 2021 to September 2021. The clinic used the adapted Penn State Nicotine Dependency Index to evaluate the patients' electronic cigarette dependence and the PH Q-9 modified for adolescents to screen for depressive symptoms of the patients. Charts on 69 patients were reviewed for this study. The authors used standard descriptive statistics and a generalized linear mixed model to analyze the data on the 69 a dolesce nts. RESULTS The mean age of the a dolescents was 17.6 (SD = 2.3), 46.4% (n = 32) were female, and 53.6% (n = 37) were male. Approximately 30% (20 of 69) of the a dolescent screened positive for depression and more than 88% (n = 61) met criteria for high el ectronic cigarette dependence. Findings of the mixed model analyses indicated that there was not a significant association between electronic cigarette dependence and depressive symptoms (OR = 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-1.23; p = 0.0365). DISCUSSION Our finding shows that while a third of a dolescents screened positive for depression and majority (88%) depended on electronic cigarettes, there was no association between the outcomes. Future larger studies are needed to better understand the association between electronic cigarettes dependence and depressive symptoms as reported in the literature .

However, it is unknown when a post -operative PT protocol is optimally initiated. This study sought to compare lengths of stay between patients on a day zero PT protocol and those on a day one PT protocol. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted for patients who underwent lumbar spinal sur gery at a large midwestern tertiary medical center between January 1, 2018 and April 30, 2019. Patients were stratified by having started postoperative PT on the same day as surgery (day zero) or having started postoperative PT on the day following surgery (day one). The outcome of interest was the length of hospital stay (LOS) following surgery. RESULTS A total of 165 patients were included in the study, 69 in the day zero group and 96 patients in the day one group. Most patients were female (59%, n = 98), and the average age was 62 years (SD = 13). Average LOS was 60 hours (SD = 20) for the day zero cohort and 75 hours (SD = 32) for the day one cohort. There was no significant difference between the day zero and day one groups regarding gender, body mass index, Oswestry disability index, or pre-operative visual analog scale for pain scores. DISCUSSION This study suggests that a post -operative physical therapy protocol initiated on day zero is associated with patients experiencing a shorter length of hospital stay compared to a similar PT protocol initiated on day one post -operatively.

It has been speculated th at high rates of burnout may be due to oversensitivity to the construct, but no consensus has been reached. We examined the association of staff response rates and reported rates of work stress and engagement. METHODS Panel study. We included 133 English acute and combined Trusts participating in the National Health Service (NHS) Staff Surveys for the year 2019. We measured response rates, workforce engagement, and work stress using the NHS Staff Survey. Regression analysis was performed of response rates for predicting rates of work stress and engagement. RESULTS The overall response rate was 46% (range: 27% to 76%). In univariable regression, increased response rate correlated with lower rates of work stress. On the contrary, increased response rate posi tively correlated with rates of engagement. Both associations were statistically significant with p-values of 0.001 and 0.002, respectively. The contribution of the response rate to variance as measured by R2 was 6.9% and 6.3%, respectively. Across the ran ge of response rates, predicted rates of engagement ranged from 73% to 77% while predicted rates of stress ranged from 42% to 37%. DISCUSSION Higher response rates correlated with lower reports of work stress and higher reports of engagement. Surveyors sh ould consider response rates when interpreting rates of well-being as reported across sites or over time in their organizations.

Deficiency in Vitamin D in children has correlated with increased rates of COVID -19 infection as well as more severe s ymptoms. As Vitamin D supplementation in deficient patients has been beneficial in treatment of upper respiratory infections, more data is needed to provide recommendations on Vitamin D levels in children to prevent or lessen the morbidity and mortality of COVID -19 infection in pediatric patients. METHODS A Level 3 meta -analysis was conducted using a PubMed search. Keywords for searches included \"Covid and vitamin D,\" \"Covid + vitamin D + children,\" and \"Covid + Vitamin D + pediatrics.\" RESULTS A total of 53 research studies with an n of 389 pediatric patients. Results indicated that children were at risk of COVID -19 dependent upon two main variables: socioeconomic status (categorized by insurance pay type) and age. Vitamin D Deficiency was classified at 1 3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7%-12% ).

The FDA granted EUA for the first of several IV monoclonal antibody infusion(s) on November 21, 2020 and our Taskforce was formed a week later. B ASELINE The purpose of this quality improvement study was to evaluate the use of infusions on rates of hospital admission and mortality. D ESIGN Veteran patients from the VA Medical Center Clinic who tested positive for COVID -19 were evaluated by the Taskforce. The first clinic patient was infused on December 18, 2020 with three separate neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. RES ULTS By November 22, 2021 a total of 767 clinic patients had tested positive; of those, 170 were infused. Patients who received the neutralizing antibody infusion were less likely to be admitted to the hospital than those who did not: 4.7% vs 29.9%; OR = 0.116, 95% CI (0.056, 0.242); p<0.001. The mortality rate for those infused was significantly less than those who were not: 0.6% vs 6%; OR = p = 0.007. Three non-severe adverse events were reported during infusion. C ONCLUSION Infusion with three separate neutralizing monoclonal antibodies appears to reduce the odds of COVID - 19 related hospitalization or death amongst the veteran patient population. Compared to the general patient population, veterans tend to be older and have more comorbidities. Maximizing these therapies may be an effective tool to minimize hospital surges of admissions during the pandemic.

Naloxone, an opioid - receptor antagonist, can be used emergently to reverse the effects of overdose. It is simple to administer and can potentially save a person's life in the event of an opioid overdose. Naloxone prescribing rates have increased, but it is difficult to predict how well patients understand the medication and how to utilize it. B ASELINE The purpose of this study is to identify if patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy will learn and recall information about opioid overdose and naloxone administration if trained in a standardized model. D ESIGN In this study, chronic pain patients (defined by the CDC as use of opiates on most days for > 3 months) were given a baseline survey to assess their understanding of naloxone, its purpose, and administration techniques. Following the baseline questionnaire, patients were given printed and oral naloxone education by their provider. An identical survey was readministered to assess for im provement in understanding. Additionally, a survey was administered again 30 days later to assess for information retention. RES ULTS Providing in -person oral and printed naloxone education resulted in significant immediate learning and prolonged recall at one month post- training. C ONCLUSION Results indicate that by providing standardized naloxone education to chronic pain patients, we can increase understanding of this potentially life -saving drug.

P atient- and Family -Centered Rounds at Wesley Children's Hospital: A Longitudinal QI Project Daniel Yassa, M.D., Paul Teran, M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita P ROBLEM Patient- and family -centered rounds (PFCR) include family members as key members of the healthcar e team and improves patient safety and hospital outcomes. B ASELINE The Patient - and Family -Centered Care (PFCC) Workgroup, a multidisciplinary collaboration of healthcare workers and family advocates, created the project and served as the quality improvem ent team. Successful PFCR encounters were defined as having the medical team (attending, resident, medical student), bedside nurse, and patient's family engaged in the encounter. Outcome measure was the rate of PFCR encounters. Progress measures were the rates of involvement of the medical team, nurse and family. Balancing measures include efficiency metrics and educational quality. D ESIGN Plan-Do -Study -Act (PDSA) cycles included education for healthcare workers, utilization of secure messaging to notify nurses of rounds, implementing of rounding checklist and the creation of a family information packet. RES ULTS Data period includes February 2020 to February 2022 and three PDSA cycles. Baseline PFCR rate was 0%. Mean PFCR rates steadily increased t o > 40% including nurse participation of >50%, family participation of > 75% and pharmacist participation of > 90%. PFCR rates experienced significant variation and special cause variation. No significant change was found in balancing measures. C ONCLUSION This multidisciplinary collaboration between pediatric hospital physicians, nurses, and staff with guidance by family advocates brought dramatic improvement in the PFCR rate by developing processes to improve communication between physicians, trainees, nu rses and families. Improved PFCR rate can lead to improved overall teamwork as well as improved patient safety, satisfaction, and outcomes.

At t his time, there is no standardized education in addressing or education parents in this at risk category. B ASELINE The aim of this Quality Improvement (QI) Project was to develop a standardized process that trains physicians to educate caregivers on how to recognize the early symptoms of ADSS. D ESIGN Educational materials were developed for staff and for caregivers. Patients at risk were identified soon after birth when maternal health history with use of antidepressants during pregnancy was noted. Caregivers completed a brief 10 question survey regarding satisfaction with the education received prior to discharge RES ULTS Of the 18 caregivers who completed the satisfaction survey, a majority (n = 17, 96%) Agree or Strongly Agree the education received from the physician was beneficial. All (n = 19, 100%) Agree or Strongly Agree the handout material was effective informing on signs and symptoms of ADS, intervention, and when to seek medical care. Additionally, serving as the indicator of need for this QI Project, less than half (n = 5, 28%) noted that they were made aware that ADS could be a concern post -delivery during their prenatal care. C ONCLUSION Less than half of the caregivers surveyed were notified that ADS might be a concern prio r to delivery. Our results imply that the implementation of provider and patient ADS education is effective. It is our jobs as newborn hospitalists to ensure caregivers are educated before discharged.

B ASELINE This retrospective study examines CII-CIV opioid prescriptions prescribed for acute treatment three months pre- and post- EPCS state mandate implemented on July 1, 2021. D ESIGN Kansas and Colorado prescription fill data will be extracted from two regional divisions of a large community -based pharmacy chain. Prescribing patterns are assessed via percent changes of quantity filled, day supply, daily morphine milligram equiva lent (MME), and prescribing method. Opioid prescriptions are converted to MME to allow for comparison. Acute treatment is defined as receiving opioid treatment for less than three consecutive months. The change between prescribing methods will be evaluated (electronic versus alternative methods). Patient geographical locations will be assessed for prescribing methods. Likewise, the relationship of opioids prescribed between insurance types are evaluated. Data excluded will be patients less than 18 years old, prescriptions containing buprenorphine, or prescribed by dentists and veterinarians. Data will be evaluated by Chi -Square or Mann -Whitney U, with an a -priori alpha of 0.05. This study has been exempted by the University of Kansas Medical Center Institutional Review Board. RES ULTS Preliminary data showed electronic prescribing increased 17% after the EPCS state mandate between both states, from 55.2% to 72.2%. Patient demographics gathered pre- EPCS state mandate were 64.3% of prescriptions were from Colorado versus post -mandate was 65.3%. With gender, 65.5% were composed of females pre- mandate versus post -mandate 69.5% were females. F or more information please contact: Reagan Nguyen, Pharm.D.

The primary risk factor is smoking, especially in adults under age 65. The CDC recommends one lifetime dose of the pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax). However, less than 5% of vaccinations take place during hospitalizations, poising Family Medicine clinics as a better option due to counseling provided by physicians. B ASELINE The goal was to increase the percentage of Pneumovax vaccination from 3% to 25% in adult patients who smo ke by November 2021. D ESIGN A chart review was conducted to identify patients ages 18 to 65 who smoked tobacco, had received care in the family medicine center from January 2021 to April 2021, and had not received the Pneumovax vaccination. A letter was t hen sent to those patients encouraging them to schedule an appointment. Their physicians were also notified to follow -up, as appropriate. RES ULTS Of 91 eligible patients, three (3.2%) received the Pneumovax by November 2021. While lower than the goal, the clinic will continue to reach out to eligible patients. C ONCLUSION Vaccinations are a required component of preventive patient care. While overall completion rates were not high, it is hoped that more physicians and patients will have conversations about vaccines. Key lessons are the importance of frequently notifying patients of outstanding vaccinations and educating them as to their purpose, as well as the difficulties related to asking patients to get a vaccine that is not discussed frequently for their age group, especially in the midst of a pandemic.

In coordinating physical therapy (PT) plans, which is recommended by both the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Physical Therapy Association, physicians and physical therapists develop the best plan for each patient. Changes rely on timely monitoring of patient response and progress made toward achieving goals and outcomes. B ASELINE The goal is to increase the comfort of family medicine residents in coordinating PT plans for patients from 5% to 25% by April 2022. D ESIGN Residents attended two didactics sessions, one with a physical therapist explaining how physicians can help coordinate PT and a second regarding h ow best to create a \"physical therapy prescription\". After each didactics session, attendees were given a survey to measure comfort and barriers in coordinating patient PT plans. Data was collected in November 2021 and will be collected again in March 2022 . RES ULTS Of 27 residents eligible, twelve have attended both didactic sessions as of February 2022 (44.4%). Five have indicated comfort with PT referrals (18.5%). Barriers to change included lack of knowledge of what physical therapists need for referral, multiple or conflicting guidelines, and lack of education regarding coordination with PT. C ONCLUSION Family physicians should understand modalities used by physical therapists. Best practices should include collaboration between patients, physicians, and physical therapists. Key lessons include the difficulty of coordinating PT care plans when healthcare clinicians are uncomfortable in doing so. Physical therapists and physicians will need to work together to ensure appropriate care is provided to patien ts.

B ASELINE This created a process to transition of patients from pediatric to internal medicine care which previously was non -existent. D ESIGN This process sent KU Pediatrics patients to the KU IM clinic using a QR code attached to a R EDCap form which then sent an alert to the KU IM clinic to schedule them. RES ULTS Seven pediatric patients referred and four patients were scheduled and seen in the KU IM clinic. At least two of the successful referrals required a second referral/intervention. Given the low number of patients transferred, statistical analysis was not done. C ONCLUSION There were several complications with the created process. First, providers needed to learn and remember how to refer patients to KU IM. Secondly, three referrals were not scheduled for the first appointment with KU IM. Thirdly, there was no process to easily track all patient referrals to adult care (not just KU IM). Furthermore, due to the pandemic, well visits for this population were delayed which further lowered the number of potential referrals. The next PDSA cycle will be implementing the adult medicine referral process using the existing EHR system to send referrals to all adult clinics including KU IM to achieve a more sustaina ble process. Additionally, we will be able to track all referrals to adult clinics for further PDSA cycles.

Failure of chronic disease management despite effective available therapies signals there is room for impro vement of the UKP IM clinic practice. This study sought to understand the rate of pharmacy referral of patients with uncontrolled hypertension and the barriers to a completed appointment. B ASELINE Chart review was performed on 360 patients to evaluate if they had ever been referred to the pharmacy for their hypertension. D ESIGN A patient referred to pharmacy has an in-depth visit with a median time between 30 -40 minutes focused solely on barriers to adherence to the prescribed regimen. The pharmacist and patient collaborate to overcome barriers of regular access, insurance coverage, pill burden, scheduling, home blood pressure monitoring, and psychology. This strategy is successful. In a separate study at the pharmacy, systolic BP (n = 24) was lowered from 164.3 (SD = 22.4) to 137.8 (SD = 12.8). This change was statistically significant with a p < 0 .0001. While sample size is limited, these data are encouraging. RES ULTS Of the 360 patients reviewed, 13 were referred to pharmacy. Of those 13 patients, only six completed appointments. C ONCLUSION The next step is a survey to determine provider perceptions around pharmacy referral for hypertension management. Gathering data on physician attitudes and preferences will be necessary to design interventions and education that alleviate real and perceived barriers to referral.

Ro tation -Specific Guidebooks Help Decrease Stress and Increase Preparedness in Orthopaedic Residents Faith Mi Ge Kim, MS-3, Joshua Rogers, M.D., Ben Lancaster, M.D., Kevin Hofer, M.D., Michael Blankespoor, M.D., Bernard Hearon, M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita PROBLEM Burnout is characterized by emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. One factor contributing to burnout is stress associated with the perception of being clinically inexperienced which is amplified at the beginning of a new clinical rotation. Residents are vulnerable due to the overwhelming amount of new information they are expected to know. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to decrease stress and increase preparedness at the beginning of a new rotation by creating rotation- specific guidebooks. B ASELINE Prior to implementing use of the guidebooks, 19 residents (95%) identified being somewhat stressed, 12 (60%) were somewhat unprepared, and 14 (70%) were either very unconfident or somewhat unconfident about knowing the expectations of the rotation. D ESIGN The intervention was performed within the University of Kansas School of Medicine - Wichita orthoapedic surgery residency program. A survey was administered to all orthopaedic residents to estimate stress and preparedness at the start of a new rotation. Rotation-specific guidebooks were created, a nd a dedicated transition day was designated in the educational calendar at the start of each clinical rotation. After residents used the guidebooks for two rotations, a new survey was administered to assess efficacy. RES ULTS Post -implementation, 17 residents (85%) reported having either almost no stress or no stress. Nineteen (95%) were either very prepared or somewhat prepared. Fifteen (75%) reported being very confident understanding expectations of the rotation. C ONCLUSION Use of rotation -specific guidebooks with a designated rotation transition period was successful decreasing stress and increasing the perception of preparedness in orthopaedic residents.

Neo or Sugammadex: Which Drug to Use with Minimal Rocuronium Blockade Mitch Kerr, School of Kansas Medical Center -Kansas City P ROBLEM Sugammadex is an effective and easy to use drug for reversing neuromuscular blockade (NMB) due to its fast onset. However, it's more expensive than neostigmine and has risk of anaphylaxis. Neostigmine effectively reverses NMB when the train-of -four ratio after surgery (TOFR -afsx) is 10% have no comorbidities (NCo) . The obje ctives of this prospective observational study were to understand why anesthesia providers at Kansas University Medical Center (KUMC) chose neostigmine or sugammadex, and if sugammadex was administered in scenarios where neostigmine has been shown effectiv e. B ASELINE There are few guidelines standardizing NMB reversal practices. D ESIGN The KUMC electronic medical record was used to identify surgical cases requiring NMB, collect demographic data and case parameters. Anesthesia providers were asked pre-determined surveys using Voalte\u00ae to understand why they selected a reversal agent. RES ULTS NMB reversal data was complete in N = 492 cases: neostigmine N = 50, sugammadex N = 442. Provider surveys were complete in 51.4% (n = 253) of cases. Sugammadex was chosen for its efficacy in 90% of cases. Reversal drug selection was discussed with attending anesthesiologists in 26.4% of cases. In 10% (n = 44) of sugammadex cases, patients had NCo and a TOFR -afsx 10%. Time -to-extubation (TTE) was not significantly faster in patients with NCo and a TOFR -afsx 10% for sugammadex vs. neostigmine (mean SD = 7.23) vs. 13.7 ( SD = 6.67) minutes respectively, p = 0.203). C ONCLUSION The use of reversal drugs at KUMC could be more standardized, decreasing risk of anaphylaxis, and lead to drug cost reduction for the health system.

Imp lementation of Transition of Care Planning in the KU Wichita Pediatric Clinic Joshua Kaseff, MS -4, Aimee Nguyen, M.D., Julian Dedeaux, e, M.S., Fatima Rahman, M.S., Gretchen Homan, M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita P ROBLEM The AAP and ACP endorsed national recommendations from Gottransition.org recommends transition of care from pediatric care to adult care beginning with a conversation at age 12 with the goal to transfer out of pediatric care between 18 to 21 years old. B ASELINE There was no systemic assessment or tracking of transition readiness to adult care in the KU Pediatrics clinic. D ESIGN We designe d a QI project to improve the clinic's transition of teenage patients based on these guidelines. This project introduced a validated survey, STARx, to measure transition readiness in parents and patients 15 years and older and to prompt practitioners to di scuss transition of care. RES ULTS Chart review of 814 encounters from the KU Wichita Pediatric clinic aged 15 and older was performed over a seven month period, of which 313 were annual visits. Both STARx and transition discussions were completed in 13 of these encounters (4.2%) . However, transition was discussed without completion of STARx in 50 (15.9%) and the STARx was completed without transition discussed in 17 encounters (5.4%). There was insufficient data to analyze by month, age, or practitioner. C ONCLUSION Transition of care remains under -discussed in the KU Wichita Pediatric clinic even with the template prompt. The length of the STARx was a significant barrier to its use, limiting its ability to be used as a long-term solution. This project was hampered by limited annual visits due to the pandemic. Future PDSA cycles will work to create a new template in patients 18 years and older and a shorter questionnaire.

However, the breath hold duration may be challenging for women with certain underlying medical conditions. B ASEL INE This study compares three different radiotherapy techniques - manually -planned Field-in- Field (FiF), automated FiF using EZFluence, and automated flattening filter -free (FFF) tangent fields - with the goal of determining if FFF plans, using a higher do se rate 2.5-4 times greater, can deliver the prescribed dose faster than conventionally -used flattened tangents while yielding a desirable treatment plan. D ESIGN Our retrospective study involved 20 previously treated, early-stage breast cancer patients. A ll patients were planned for a Varian TrueBeam using Eclipse Treatment Planning Software and EZFluence, an automated planning module. Manual FiF, EZFluence FiF, and FFF tangent plans were generated for each patient. Dosimetric data for all plans was tabulated and compared. RES ULTS FFF tangents averaged 14% and 6% faster than FiF and EZFluence tangents, respectively, with an average beam time of 25.3 seconds. All patient plans were then anonymized and scored by two Radiation Oncologists; the three types of plans were ranked from best to worst for each patient. Per the Radiation Oncologist plan reviewers, FFF tangent plans were ranked last for more than half of the patient plans (13/20), while EZFluence plans ranked the highest. C ONCLUSION While FFF tangents provide faster treatment delivery on average, this technique did not yield the desired homogenous plans as frequently as traditional delivery techniques, negating the proposed benefit of this treatment technique.

E lder Abuse in the S etting of Major Neurocognitive Disorder Delusions Danielle Jones, M.D., Sandhya Mainali, M.D., Alex Beugelsdjik, M.D., Mary Johnson, M.D., Rachna Kalia, M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTR ODUCTION Elder abuse frequently occurs comorbidly in patients with cognitive decline, which often impede s patient care and positive outcomes. C ASE DESCRIPTION A patient with no psychiatric history came to the inpatient psychiatric unit after a suicide attempt due to a delusion of being unable to help his kidnapped spouse and child. In the process of trying to treat the patient's depression and understand the depth of the delusion, it was revealed that the patient was the subject of a scam that resulted in significant financial loss. The patient received neuropsychiatric testing and a Kohlman Evaluation for L iving Skill assessment. The patient met criteria for unspecified neurocognitive disorder and major depressive disorder . The patient required 24 -hour supervision due to his inability to manage his finances and desire to kill himself. Due to the patient's medical requirements and aggressive behaviors, the patient could not be placed at an accepting facility and was instead discharged to a shelter.

Cat atonia Associated with Report Rachna Kalia, M.D., Cassie Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTR ODUCTION There is increasing recognition of an association between the use of cannabis and subsequent development of psychotic symptoms. However, scant literature exists regarding the ability of cannabis to precipitate catatonia not associated with prior underlying psychiatric disease. C ASE DESCRIPTION A 23-year-old man with no known prior psychiatric or medical history was admitted to inpatient psychiatric unit due to acute onset self -care failure. The patient had reported auditory hallucinations two weeks prior to hospitalization, and per family had a history of unknown substance use of which only cannabis could be confirmed. During his hospital stay, he was minimally responsive during daytime but would occasionall y eat or briefly express needs at night. Laboratory and neuroimaging workup were unremarkable except for urine drug screen positive for cannabis. He responded to lorazepam challenge and was started on lorazepam with some improvement in symptoms. He gradually improved and no longer exhibited catatonic symptoms at time of discharge. D ISCUSSION Cannabis may induce catatonia even in patients who have no prior psychiatric history. Given that catatonia can lead to severe medical complications including in some c ases death, it is important to maintain a high degree of suspicion in our clinical practice.

A Case of Unusual Hearing Loss John Netherton, D.O., Kennedy Kirkpatrick, MS -4, Rachna Kalia, M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTR ODUCTION This report presents a rare case of a young patient who developed toxic leukoencephalopathy and transient hearing loss after a presumed synthetic opioid overdose. The purpose of this case r eport is to draw attention to these less common complications and provide a review of the literature. C ASE DESCRIPTION A 19-year-old male with history of substance use disorder presented to the emergency room with severely altered mentation following ingestion of an unknown substance. Urine drug screen on admission was positive for cannabis. Other labs, including CBC, CMP, urinalysis, lumbar puncture, and CT scan the brain were unremarkable. MRI of the brain showed symmetric bilateral diffusi on restriction with FLAIR abnormality in the centrum semiovale, lobes, and splenium callosum consistent with anoxic brain injury. The patient's mental status gradually returned to baseline but was noted to have continued significant sen sorineural hearing loss bilaterally. A diagnosis of toxic leukoencephalopathy likely caused by an overdose on a synthetic opioid such as fentanyl was established. D ISCUSSION This case revealed two rare complications of synthetic opioid overdose that should be kept on the differential diagnosis for patients who present with altered mental status, especially younger patients with history of substance abuse. We propose that both toxic leukoencephalopathy and hearing loss likely are underreported phenomena ass ociated with synthetic opioid overdose and suggest additional case reports and epidemiological studies be done to further elicit their rate of incidence.

According to the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS -R), the estimated lifetime prevalence of Conduct Disorder in the United States is 9.5%, with a lifetime prevalence o f 12% for males and 7.1% for females. Even if symptoms of Conduct Disorder emerge during the preschool years, onset usually occurs in middle childhood through mid-adolescence. Risk factors of Conduct Disorder can be genetic, environmental, and physiologica l. C ASE DESCRIPTION Our report illustrates the case of a 13-year-old female patient who presented to the hospital's emergency department after she reportedly attempted to strangle her roommate. The patient had a history of shooting and killing her stepsister at the age of 12 for which has a pending second degree murder charge. The patient spent one month in a Juvenile Detention Center and later entered the foster care system, with eventual placement in a group home. After interviewing the patient and obtaining collateral data from multiple informants, the patient was diagnosed with Conduct Disorder, adolescent - onset type, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder in the setting of childhood trauma. During her hospital stay, she was prescribe d Zoloft 25 mg BID to target her anxiety symptoms and trazodone 50 mg at bedtime for insomnia.

Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality and are affected by the hemodynamic changes of pregnancy dur ing delivery. For pregnant MFS patients, these hemodynamic changes are paramount in the management of pregnancy and delivery. C ASE DESCRIPTION This case describes a parturient with untreated dilated aortic root secondary to MFS presenting for management of third trimester pregnancy and delivery. A multidisciplinary team decided to proceed with a preterm, scheduled, low transverse cesarean section under neuraxial anesthesia with cardiothoracic surgery on standby to perform an emergency sternotomy with placement on cardiopulmonary bypass if needed. She was stable upon discharge and underwent replacement of her ascending aorta four months postpartum. D ISCUSSION Complexity of management centers around controlling maternal blood pressure to keep aor tic root growth at a minimum and balancing anesthetic techniques to maintain hemodynamic stability while considering maternal and fetal safety. Management of hypertension in a parturient with MFS using beta -blockers has a reported decreased risk of the rate of aortic root growth. Multidisciplinary approaches are vital in management of pregnancy and route of delivery for patients with MFS. Preexisting cardiovascular complications, such as the rate of growth and diameter of the aortic root, must be considered when planning for delivery and postpartum management. Anesthetic management during delivery must consider the hemodynamic changes in pregnancy and severity of MFS cardiovascular involvement in the parturient as well as neonatal risks.

S CAD Requiring Surgical Revascularization Despite Conservative and Interventional Management Hassan Farhoud, Ryan Beard, M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTR ODUCTION Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), especially in young women, that is not associated with trauma or atherosclerosis. Although conservative therapy is preferred in most SCAD cases, optimal management is uncertain due to a lack of randomized trials comparing medical therapy and revascularization strategies. C ASE DESCRIPTION A 50-year-old female presented with chest pain. Presenting EKG and troponin were normal. Subsequent EKG showed ST elevation in V1-V4. She was given Tenecteplase, DAPT, and heparin. Coronary angiogram revealed SCAD in the mid Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD). D ISCUSSION A diagnosis of SCAD was made and the patient was conservatively managed with DAPT and heparin. Three days later, the patient had a return of chest pain and underwent a repeat angiogram. Residual stenosis of mid LAD was found. A DES was placed and IVUS performed to ensure that it was well apposed and no obvious dissection flaps remained. There was loss of flow to the distal segment. Balloon angioplasty was performed distally and blood flow was restored suggesting distal embolization. Patient remained asymptomatic until one month later when she developed recurrent chest pain. Angiogram showed the occluded stent and she underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD. This case highlights a rare cause of ACS and the role of different therapeutic strategies in the management of SCAD.

U nique Coagulation Studies in a Cirrhotic Patient : A Challenging Presentation of Acquired Hemophilia Maluki Radford, MS -3, Alex Adkins, MS -4, Dennis Moore, M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTR ODUCTION Acquired hemophilia (AH) is an autoimmune phenomenon in which autoantibodies are formed to target specific coagulation factors, with most of the cases targeting Factor VIII. The clinical presentation of AH is unique in that although it causes a deficiency in secondary hemostasis, it is characterized by a bleeding profile more characteristi c of primary hemostasis disorders. Treatment of this condition involves Factor VIII bypassing agents to control acute bleeds as well as immunosuppressants to promote eradication of the autoantibody. C ASE DESCRIPTION A 61-year-old-male with a history of decompensated cirrhosis presented to the ED with persistent bleeding that was oozing from gums and multiple skin wounds. An original diagnosis of acute blood loss anemia secondary to liver disease was made, but the patient's condition did not im prove with treatment. After PTT mixing study, Factor VIII, and Factor VIII inhibitor assays were performed, a diagnosis of Acquired Factor VIII inhibitor of an exceptionally high titer (~3000) was established. He responded poorly to several agents but clinically improved with recombinant Factor VIIa. Despite his PTT being critically elevated, Factor VIII level measuring at zero, and Factor VIII inhibiter titer > 100 Bethesda units, his bleeding stopped. D ISCUSSION This case demonstrates the importance of interpreting coagulation studies and recognizing the potential for concomitant bleeding disorders that may be exacerbated or hidden by underlying disease. Additionally, a multidisciplinary approach utilizing the consultation of specialists leads to earlier diagnosis and better prognosis in these potentially life-threatening conditions.

This study's ob jective was to determine how patients who had previously been diagnosed with breast cancer preferred to receive their biopsy results, including preferences for communication methods, type of medical professional who delivered the results, and wait time to receive results. Finally, we evaluated how health literacy may affect these preferences. M ETHODS English -speaking/reading female patients who had previously been diagnosed with breast cancer were surveyed at a Midwestern breast surgery clinic. The survey included the Brief Health Literacy Screen (BHLS), how participants received their biopsy results, and preferences for receiving results. Participants were classified as having adequate or inadequate literacy based on their BHLS responses and a scoring system used in previous research. RES ULTS One-hundred -one participants were included in the study. Most reported they would prefer in -person communication (64%), from their primary care physician (40%), or surgeon (36%), within 24 hours (56%). There was no difference in preferences between participants with adequate and inadequate health literacy. D ISCUSSION Most participants preferred to receive results in- person, regardless of their health literacy. This suggests that a cancer diagnosis may alter t he patient's initial perception that a phone call is sufficient to receive their biopsy results. Phone calls may be acceptable for benign results, but according to this survey, it is best to have an in -person discussion when the biopsy results in a cancer diagnosis.

M ETHODS The Ascension Via Christi Saint Francis Hospital (AVCH) trauma registry and electronic medical records were used to identify patients 18 years or older who presented after an attempted or completed suicide and underwent a trauma evaluation between March 3, 2020 and March 3, 2021. RES ULTS Twenty -eight patients were included in the study. Most patients (61%, n = 17) had a pr eviously diagnosed mental illness, most notably substance use disorder (43%, n = 12). Nearly one- third (29%, n = 8)h ad previously attempted suicide. An alcohol test was completed for 86% (n = 24) of patients, 58% (n = 14) of whom tested positive. The most frequent mechanism of injury was the use of a firearm (39%, n = 11). Twenty -nine percent (n = 8) of patients died from their injuries. Of those who survived to discharge, most (60%, n = 12) were discharged to an inpatient behavioral health facility. D ISCUSSION The current study suggests a high proportion of fatalities and severe head injuries from gunshot wounds as well as a high proportion of alcohol use among those who attempted suicide during the COVID -19 pandemic. These findings point to the need for interventions aimed at preventing suicide and substance abuse during pandemic situations.

M ETHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients 65 years or older presenting to a Level-I Trauma Center for traumatic fall(s) during COVID -19 (March 3, 2020 through March 3, 2021) and/or pre- pandemic (February 1, 2019 through February 1, 2020). RES ULTS Approximately 50.5% of patients (n = 807) present ed during the COVID -19 period (cases) and 49.5% (n = 791) p resented pre -pandemic (controls). Cases were less likely to have fallen in rural areas (28.6% versus 34.1%, p = 0.018) or be transferred from outside hospitals (32.1% versus 38.2%, p = 0.011). More case s exp erienced alcohol (4.6% versus 2.4%, p = 0.017) and substance use disorders (1.36% versus 0.38%, p = 0.029). Among cases, there were fewer subdural hemorrhages (11.8% versus p = = erienced no complications (79.7% versus 54.3%, p < 0.001), while more cases experienced acute respiratory failure (2.0% versus 0.0%, p < 0.001), sepsis (0.9% versus 0.1%, p = 0.026). Fewer cases were discharged to skilled nursing facilities (50.8% versus 57.3%, p = 0.009) and more to home with services (13.1% versus 8.3%, p = 0.002). There were no differences in terms of mean hospital length of stay, readmission frequency, or mortality. D ISCUSSION Older adults with fall-related injuries during COVID -19 experienced differences in presenting comorbidities, injury patterns, complications, and discharge locations compared to pre-pandemic. The differences in transfers and discharge to home could be related to bed availability in hospital and skilled nursing facilities, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of elevated alkaline phosphatase levels among post -operative bariatric surgery patients. M ETHODS This was a retrospective study of patients 18 years or older, who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) at the Ascension V ia Christi (AVC) Weight Management Clinic in Wichita, Kansas between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2020. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), weight, body mass index and parathyroid hormone (PTH) calcitriol, calcitonin were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. Status of taking vitamin D and multivitamin was also collected. RES ULTS Two -hundred -thirty patients with mean age of 47 years and average BMI of 44.6 were included. ALP was elevated relative to baseline for 36.1% of patients (n = 52) at 3 month follow-up, for 42.4% of patients (n = 56) at 6 months, and for 43.3% of patients (n = 45) at 12 months (p<0.001). There were six cases of cholelithiasis, all unassociated with anti- gallstone medications (UDCA). DI SCUSSION A significant proportion of the study participants experienced elevations in alkaline phosphatase relative to baseline. The prevalence of elevated out -of-range alkaline phosphatase, however, was extremely low.

In June 2021, 52% of Americans, 48% of Kansans, and 42% of Sedgwick County residents had received only one vaccine dose, placing unnecessary burden on the healthcare system. Preventive behaviors have been shown to reduce the spread of COVID -19. This study sought to determine if there was a relationship among various preventive behavioral health strategies and no vaccination intent. M ETHODS Residents mainly located in the South Central Kansas region were eligible to complete a novel questionnaire which assessed vaccine hesitancy and the degree to which practicing preventive health measures was taken, such as hand washing and mask wearing. RES ULTS In total, 4,170 surveys were analyzed. Those who reported infrequently wearing a mask were more than 16 times more likely to report no intent to get vaccinated (95% CI: 11.672 -23.292). Those who reported being Black or African American were four times more likely than White respondents to report no vaccination intent (95% CI: 1.131-14.675), and those who reported having a high school or college degree were two to three times more likely to report no vaccination intent than those with a graduate degree (95% CI: 1.465-4.349). D ISCUSSION This study suggests that certain preventive health measures are predictive of vaccination intent. Those who do not regularly practice in behavioral health prevention strategies are less likely to be vaccinated.

This study investigated the history of TBS, why they are so popular, and their methods. M ETHODS From a list of TBS from four states in South India, a purposive and convenience sampling method identified participants. One lead TBS from each state was interviewed. With recommendations from these TBS, a total of six participants were interviewed on Zoom in their native dialect and these interviews were transcribed into English. The data were analyzed using a constant comparative method which included several iterations to refine common themes and determine counterfactual and specific focal points from each interview. RES ULTS Six overarching themes emerged: history of traditional bone setters, occupations outside bone setting, education and training, patient characteristics, approach to diagnosis and treatment, limitations, challenges, and social relevance. D ISCUSSION The history of traditiona l bone setting is thousands of years old and passed down within families generationally. In rural India, where a large part of the population lives in poverty and without access to modern medicine, traditional healers provide a much -needed service, often without charge, and consequently, the income is not sufficient without other occupations such as farming. They follow a similar approach to diagnosis and treatment of simple fractures and dislocations as modern medical practitioners. Most would like to shar e their knowledge and collaborate with ayurvedic and allopathic practitioners and simply want to be respected and supported.

This project characterizes rural caregivers' interactions with sources of early childhood nutritional information for the first time since widespread internet/social media usage. M ETHODS Fifty-five adult caregivers of children (< 24 months) recruited via rural Midwest healthcare clinics were surveyed regarding use, perceived influence and trustworthiness, and emotions associated with 10 potential sources of early childhood nutritional information. Descriptives were used to describe responses, and chi -square analyses ex amined differences in behavior. RES ULTS Participants most frequently reported acquisition of childhood nutritional information from healthcare professionals (50/55; 90.9%) and family (31/55; 56.4%). While healthcare professionals (42/50; 84%) and .org web sites (10/13; 76.9%) influenced the greatest percent of users, healthcare professionals (42/55; 76.4%) and family (16/55; 29.1%) influenced the most participants. Participants considered healthcare professionals (54/55; 98.2%), family (38/55; 69.1%), and .gov websites (32/55; 58.2%) most trustworthy and both audiovisual sources and social media least trustworthy (7/55; 12.7%). Significant differences existed between healthcare professionals and family in use (p < 0.0001), trust (p < 0.0001), and influence ( p < 0.0001). Positive emotions predominated for all sources except social media, which elicited frustration in 31.6% (6/19) of users and confusion in 36.8% (7/19). D ISCUSSION Interpersonal sources featured prominently in rural caregivers' information -seek ing behaviors, with healthcare professionals significantly more influential to childhood nutritional decisions than any other source. Source usage did not trend with trust or emotion, particularly for social media, which ranked fourth of ten in utilization despite being least trusted and most associated with negative emotions.
