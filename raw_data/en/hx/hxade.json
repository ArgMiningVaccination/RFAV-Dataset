INTRODUCTION 2 Consulting Other Specialists You may be sent to specialists in other departments at the UCSF Medical Center and clinic, so you need to keep a record of the provider's name in each department in order to make an appointment. Keep a list of these provid-ers and their departments for future reference. Your primary care provider may refer you to specialists within your insurance plan. Include these providers on your list for future reference as well. Providers in Other Departments Cardiologist (Heart) Dentist (Teeth) Dermatologist (Skin) Endocrinologist (Diabetes) ENT (Ear/Nose/Throat) Ophthalmologist (Eye) Gynecologist (Women's health) Orthopedist (Bone) Primary Care/Internal medicine Other LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 3 All UCSF Adult Clinic Phone Numbers are in the (415) Area Code Dental ....................................

Although we are here to help you, it is your responsibility to learn how to take care of yourself and your new liver. You are the most important person in your health care team so you need to know your medications, lab values, and the routine follow-up care needed. In the hospital, your nurses will begin to teach you promptly. At frst it may seem like a lot of information, but it will get easier. It's normal to have questions after you are discharged from the hospital. This handbook is a quick reference guide and a \"starting point\" for answering your questions. Always ask your nurse or the transplant team any questions you might have. We are here to help you. Write your questions down so you do not forget them. There is space to write your questions at the end of this handbook. Your Local Health Care Provider, The Transplant Team and Your Insurance Your local health care providers and the transplant team are committed to providing care for you in the best way possible. This commitment includes providing care within the guidelines outlined by your insurance company. After the frst hospital discharge and follow-up appointment, you may need to get pre-authorization from your primary care provider for clinic visits or procedures with the transplant team. It is your responsibility to get any necessary authorizations that have been requested and obtain these from your primary care physician or you may be billed for some charges. You may be able to have some testing such as labs and liver biopsies done and imaging studies (CTs/CAT, etc.) are done in your local area. Know as much as you can about the pre-authorization requirements of your insurance company, as well as any special features about your coverage. Examples: When do you need a pre-authorization? Which pharmacies are \"preferred\" within your insurance system? Which labs are \"preferred\" within your insurance system? INTRODUCTION 6 Medications and Diagnostic Tests General Information You will take several medications after your liver transplant for the rest of your life. Each medication has been individually prescribed for you, and it is very important that you take your medications as you are instructed. We want you to be responsible for taking your own medications. We also want children to be involved in taking their own medications. There is more information about these medications later in this chapter. Self-Medication Schedule After your transplant, your nurse will set up a medication schedule for you. This medication schedule is set up to help you learn about the medications you are taking, when to take them, what they look like, how much to take, what they are for, and their side effects. When you begin to take your own medicine after surgery, your nurse must always check your pills before you take them. When you go home from the hospital you may be taking 10-14 different medications. These include medications you will take for the rest of your life and other medica-tions that will stop in weeks to months. Your Medicine Schedule You will be given a copy of your medicine schedule with a list of all your medications to keep at your bedside. Record any changes on this schedule in pencil. Never follow the directions on the bottle as these directions may change. Write any dosage changes, medication changes, or new medicines on your schedule. Remember to bring your medicine schedule when you come to the clinic or to the hospital. Also bring the medication bottles if you have any questions; for pediatric patients, always bring medication bottles in addi-tion to your schedule. Never take any new medications without letting the UCSF Liver Transplant Offce know. Many medications change the effects of your immunosuppressive medications. These include but are John's Wort or Echinacea . LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 7 Medicine Times You must take your pills at the same time every day. In the hospital, we use standard times of 9am, 12 noon, 6pm, and bedtime. When you go home, you should use times that ft your lifestyle but the medications should be taken at the same time each day. Your Tacrolimus or Cyclosporine should be taken 12 hours apart from each other, for example 9 AM and 9 PM. Your nurses will help you set up a system. Warnings About Medications Never: Never change or stop any immunosuppressive medication the transplant team has prescribed without checking with us frst. You must never forget to take your medications. Never take Motrin, Ibuprofen, Advil, Naproxen, Aleve, and other Non-Steroidal Anti-infammatory NSAIDS), as the combined effect with Tacrolimus (Prograf) or Cyclosporine (Neoral, Gengraf) can cause kidney damage. Drugs included in this category may be found in over the counter common cold rem-edies. Please check labeling to ensure that you use a product that does not contain these medications. Always: Use acetaminophen (example: Tylenol\u00ae) only for headache or pain (maximum dose 2000 mg/day). Parents should be sure the dose is correct for their child's weight. Remember, Tylenol is also in some narcotics, for example Vicodin and Norco. The total maximum dose of 2000 mg/day includes prescription and over the counter medication. Check with your pharmacist or transplant team if you have any questions about any of your medications. Store your medicine out of the reach of small children. Remember that your medicine could be deadly if ac- cidentally taken by a child. Pharmacies put all prescriptions in child proof containers. If you do not want child proof containers, ask your pharmacist for regular containers. Plan ahead: always call for prescription reflls at least 1-2 weeks before you run out of medication. Call 1-800-LIVER TX (1-800 548-3789) with any questions you have about medications. We make all attempts to get back to you within 24 hours. Offce hours: Monday-Friday, 8 AM-5 PM . MEDICATIONS AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 8 Immunosuppressive Medications Because your new liver is \"foreign\" to your body, your immune system will try to reject it. Therefore, it is neces- sary to suppress your immune system to protect your new liver. The drugs described in this chapter prevent and/ or treat rejection of your new liver. Immediately after your transplant, when you are most likely to reject your new liver, you will be taking very high doses of these medications. As the risk of rejection decreases, the doses will be reduced. When the doses are high, you may experience some side effects. Remember that not every patient experiences all of these side effects, but they occur often enough that you should know about them. Do not hesitate to tell the transplant team about any side effects or pr oblems you may have. We can often help to lessen the side effects. the immunosuppressive drugs prescribed to prevent rejection of your transplanted liver. You will be on a combination of these drugs at different times after your transplant. The drug or the dose of each of these drugs may change depending on your particular condition. Your transplant team will help you with changes in your medications while you are in the hospital. After you leave the hospital, you will receive phone calls to adjust the dosages based on your lab results. Write these changes on your medication schedule immediately along with the date of the change. Tacrolimus Prograf\u00ae Purpose Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant medication that helps prevent or treat rejection. Dose The tablets ar e available in 0 .5 mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg strengths; liquid is 0.5 mg/ml . The liquid must be specially made by your pharmacist. The dose is adjusted by your laboratory values. It is very important to have your labs drawn 12 hours after your last Tacr olimus dose and before you take your morning medications for proper adjustment of this medication. When to Take AM Dose: take with your breakfast, after your lab work is completed (usually around 9am). PM Dose: 12 hours after your AM dose (usually ar ound 9pm).

MEDICATIONS AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 18 Diagnostic Tests The list below describes the purposes of a variety of diagnostic procedures you may undergo after you have had your liver transplant. Ultrasound This is sometimes done the day after transplant to make sure the main blood vessels leading to the liver are functioning normally. An ultrasound can also be used to check for abnormal fuid collection (blood, bile) in the abdomen and to localize position for biopsies in children. A gel is applied on your abdomen and a transducer (a wand-like instrument) is passed over the abdomen. Images of your liver will appear on a monitor. CT Scan A type of x-ray that looks at your liver from several angles to check for infection or fuid collections. After you drink a liquid dye, pictures are taken while you lay still. Children are usually given something to relax them before this procedure is performed. ERCP/PTC There are different types of x-rays that check bile ducts for leaks, blockages, or other potential problems. ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram) is done by placing a tube down your throat through which a catheter is inserted into a bile duct. PTC (percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram) is done by inserting a needle into the liver through the abdomen, then placing the catheter in the bile ducts. You will be given medication to relax you before the ERCP or PTC. Children usually have these tests done under anesthesia. Liver Biopsy A liver biopsy checks for rejection, hepatitis, and other possible problems. You may need a liver biopsy if your liver numbers from labs go up. The right side of the abdomen is numbed, a biopsy needle is inserted, and a small piece of liver tissue will be removed. You must lay down on your right side for at least 1 hour and stay in bed for 4 hours after this procedure. You may not take food or fuids during this time. You must have transportation arranged by a friend or relative. Public transportation (cabs, buses) is not allowed. Your procedure will be cancelled if you do not have adequate supervised transportation. You must be off blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin or Ibuprofen prior to the biopsy. See page 23 for guidelines. Infants and children are given mild sedation during the biopsy and are admitted to the hospital for the procedure. LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 19 When You Go Home Outpatient Care Guidelines Call the Transplant Emergency phone number, (415) 353-1888, or your local healthcare provider for temperatures over 100 .4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). The most important thing you can do to ensure your long term health is to recognize and report any changes in the way you are feeling. Please do not try to \"self-diagnose.\" Because of your antirejection or immunosuppressive medications, symptoms may need urgent treatment. Pediatric patients should call 415-476-5892. Liver Transplant Clinic You will be followed by a Transplant Center for the rest of your life. You will be seen on a regular basis in the Liver Transplant clinic. Children will be followed in the Pediatric GI/Transplant clinic. Please bring your medicine schedule and medications for the entire day with you. Remember to check in at the clinic desk when you arrive. Follow-up appointments may be made at the desk when you leave or you may call 415-353-9130. Pediatric patients can call 415-353-2813. Labs You need to have your blood drawn twice weekly the frst month after your transplant and once weekly the next month following your transplant. After that you will probably have your labs done twice a month, then once a month. You can have your blood drawn at a local laboratory who will fax your lab results to the Liver Transplant Offce. Fax for adults: 415-353-8917. Fax for children: 415-476-1343. Adult Clinic The adult Liver Transplant Clinic is on the 7th foor of the Ambulatory Care Center (ACC) and meets every Tues-day from 8am-12pm and Thursday afternoon from 1:30pm-3:30pm.

Outreach Clinic UCSF has monthly adult outreach clinics in Fresno and Modesto, and a bimonthly outreach clinic in Walnut Creek. To schedule an appointment at any of the UCSF outreach clinics, please call 415-353-2156. WHEN YOU GO HOME 20 Pediatric Clinic The Pediatric GI/Liver Clinic is at the Mission Bay Campus/Benioff Children's Hospital on the 6th foor of the Gateway Medical Building and meets Thursdays from 8am-12pm. Call 415-353-2813 to make appointments at the pediatric clinic. Outpatient Liver Biopsy The frequency of outpatient liver biopsies will depend on what types of problems you have. Biopsies may be done to evaluate for rejection or hepatitis. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight before the biopsy, except for your medications. You must have a current set of labs drawn one week prior to your biopsy. You will be instructed to stop taking aspirin (also don't take Motrin, Advil or Ibuprofen) 5 days before and 5 days after your biopsy. If you are taking any other blood thinner such as warfarin (Coumadin) your biopsy will require careful co-ordination. Be sure to take your morning medications the day of the biopsy. If you are diabetic, ask about adjust-ing your insulin dosage for that morning. You will stay in the surgery center for about 6 hours after the biopsy is performed. You must have transportation arranged by a friend or relative. Public transportation (cabs, buses) is not allowed. Your procedure will be cancelled if you do not have adequate supervised transportation. Infants and small children may have liquids up until 4 hours before the biopsy. Infants and small children are always admitted to the hospital for this procedure. Check with your physician or transplant nurse practitioner for questions. Location Adult outpatient liver biopsies: These are performed at the PPU (Peri-Procedural Unit), 505 Parnassus, 6th foor. You should report there at 7:30am the morning of your biopsy. Your local gastroenterologist may perform this procedure at your local hospital and the slides will be sent to our pathology department for review. Pediatric liver biopsies are generally done at the Benioff Children's Hospital. Most children are admitted in the morning of the procedure and spend the night. If rejection is seen on the biopsy, children may remain hospitalized for a few days to a week, depending on the treatment. An ultrasound is performed to mark the spot for biopsy prior to the procedure. Be sure to check with your transplant provider for arrival time and additional instructions. After the frst few months, your local gastroenterologist may perform this procedure at your local hospital and the slides will be sent to us for review. LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 21 Adult Liver Biopsy Info Where: Please check in to the Admitting Offce - 505 Parnassus Avenue, Ground Floor, room M140. Once checked in, you will be directed to the Peri-Procedural Unit. Take the Mofftt elevators up to the 6th foor. Follow the signs for the Peri-Procedural Unit, and check in at the nurses' station on 6 East. Peri-Procedural Unit phone number: 415-353-9123. Time: 7:30am check in Instructions: No Food or Drink after Midnight. Little water to take medications. No Aspirin or Coumadin or NSAIDS 1 week prior to appointment. Do standing order and additional labs 1 week prior to appointment. WHEN YOU GO HOME 22 Daily Routine Follow a daily routine similar to the one outlined below after you go home. Mornings 1. Weigh yourself each morning after going to the bathroom. Record your weight in your handbook. 2. Take and record your temperature. 3. Take and record your blood pressure if you are taking anti-hypertensive medications. 4. Take your morning medications, except as described in number \"5\" below. 5. Bring your Cyclosporine (Gengraf\u00ae or Neoral\u00ae) or Tacrolimus (Prograf\u00ae) or Sirolimus (Rapamune\u00ae) with you to the lab on the days you have your Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus, or Sirolimus level drawn; then take your morning Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus, or Sirolimus dose after your blood is drawn. Noon 6. Take your medications as ordered by the Transplant Team. Nights (between 7-9pm): 7. Take your bedtime medications. 8. Set out your medications for the next day. Use of a multi-chambered plastic pill box may be helpful. Routine Follow-up Care The frst 60-90 days after your transplant are the time of highest risk for rejection and infection. You will need to have frequent blood tests. Your vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature) must be checked often during the frst three months, and after this time your vital signs can be checked as needed. The risk of rejection usu-ally decreases after the frst 60-90 days. The frequency of blood tests and vital signs can also be reduced. Your transplant providers will let you know when you can decrease the frequency of your laboratory tests. Be sure to keep the Transplant Offce informed of your correct address and phone number(s), and any changes in your health care provider's name, address, or phone number(s). It is also important to tell us whom to contact in case of an emergency. You will be given a form to complete. Be sure to return the completed form to us. LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 23 If you are an outpatient and need urgent medical care or need to see a health care provider at UCSF, call 415-353-1888 (days, evenings, and holidays) or go to your local emergency room. Pediatric patients should call 415-476-5892. Do not come to the Patient Care Unit or Clinic unless told to do so by the Transplant Team. Your Local Health Care Provider's Role Your local health care provider may be the one who took care of you before you came to UCSF for your liver transplant, or who referred you to us. Your visit to this provider is very important and should occur no later than one month after you return home. You should also continue seeing those specialists who were involved in your care before you received a liver transplant. For example: your pediatrician for children, your cardiologist for heart disease, your gynecologist for women, your ophthalmologist for eye care, and/or your family provider for general health care needs, etc. After the immediate post transplant period (in other words, more than 6-12 weeks after your release from the hospital), your frst contact for illnesses should be with your local provider. After he or she has seen you, your provider should contact the Transplant Offce with any questions. Remember - Contact the Transplant office during business hours if a new medication is prescribed by your local health care provider. Many medications can have significant interactions with your antirejec-tion or immunosuppressive medications. Inform the Transplant Office of any changes in your health care provider's name, address, or phone number(s). Laboratory Tests and Lab Letters Blood tests need to be done frequently for about 90 days after your transplant. They are done every day while you are hospitalized and twice weekly after you go home. Preferred lab locations are Kaiser, Lab Corp or Quest labs as we receive these results promptly. Infants and small children are often discharged after transplant with a central line for blood draws. The central line is an intravenous catheter placed at the time of transplant in the front of the chest. Your nurse will show you how to take care of it before you go home, and you might have a home health nurse checking in with you after you are discharged from the hospital. When blood draws are decreased to once a week, the central line is typically removed. This requires a \"come and go\" outpatient surgical procedure. Regular laboratory days after you go home are Mondays and Thursdays. You will take home a laboratory order that lists all the tests that need to be done and how often. Give this order to your laboratory. Your lab should fax results to the Transplant Offce and to your local provider. If you would like a copy of your laboratory results, please ask your laboratory for these. Lab results should be faxed to the Transplant Offce at 415-353-8917 (adult) or 415-476-1343 (pediatrics).

Do not take your morning dose of medication before your labs. Bring your Tacrolimus, Cyclosporine, Everolimus, or Siro- limus with you to the lab and take your morning dose after your blood is drawn. WHEN YOU GO HOME 32 LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 33 Immunization and Immune Protection It is extremely important for pediatric liver transplant patients and children of transplant recipients to receive ap- propriate immunizations to prevent disease. However, after transplant the recipient's immune system is compro-mised due to the immunosuppressive medications that must be taken to prevent rejection. Therefore, liver transplant patients should not receive any live virus vaccines, such as measles, mumps, ru-bella (MMR), small pox, chicken pox, shingles (Zostavax \u00ae), nasal fu mist, and oral polio vaccine (OPV). Transplant patients can receive other vaccines such as diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, pertussis (DPT), and inactive polio virus vaccine (IPV), or human papilloma virus (HPV). The following highlights important information about immunizations and the liver transplant patient and family. Tuberculosis (TB) testing using purified protein derivative (PPD) TB testing using PPD may be performed on liver transplant patients and household members. Immunizations If you are planning a trip to a foreign country that requires any immunizations, you may need to have your health care provider write a letter to the Passport Bureau stating that you cannot receive certain vaccines. If you have questions about vaccinations or precautions to take, ask your primary care provider. You may be referred to a travel clinic. Another resource you may contact is the Overseas Medical Center, phone 415-982-8380. Inactivated Vaccines: (These are OK to take) Pneumonia Vaccine Flu Vaccine Inactive virus: Transplant patients and household members may receive vaccine. Never receive the nasal fu mist\u2014this is a live vaccine. Diphtheria/tetanus toxoid/pertussis vaccine (DPT or Tdap) Inactive virus: Transplant patients and household members may receive vaccine. Tetanus Toxoid: Generally given every 10 years. Liver transplant patients and household members may receive tetanus shots. IMMUNIZATION AND IMMUNE PROTECTION 34 Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Inactive Virus: Transplant patients and household members may receive vaccine. Hemophilus B (HIB) Polysaccharide: Transplant patients and household members may receive HIB. Hepatitis A (Hep A) Inactive virus: Transplant patients and household members may receive Hep A. Hepatitis B (Hep B) Inactive virus: Transplant patients and household members may receive Hep B. Inactive Polio Virus Vaccine (IPV) Inactive virus: Transplant patients and household members may receive IPV instead of OPV (oral polio vaccine). Live (attenuated) Vaccines: (should NOT be taken after transplant) Varicella Zoster (Shingles) Live virus: Transplant patients should not receive this vaccine. Family members may receive the vaccine. Varicella (Chicken Pox) If the family member breaks out with vesicles (pox), the transplant patient should not touch them. Rarely, a child who has received the vaccine may break out with a few vesicles. If this occurs, the pox should be covered with a band-aid and contact the transplant team for further guidance. Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Live Virus: Liver transplant patients should NEVER receive MMR after transplant. It may be given to siblings and other household members. Oral Polio Virus Vaccine (OPV) Live virus: Transplant patients and household contacts with patients should not receive OPV. Vaccine strains are transmissible. Because OPV is shed in the stool, it is recommended that IPV be given instead to transplant patients and those in frequent contact with them. Transplant patients should not change diapers of children given OPV!

As with any surgery, adequate calories, pro- tein, vitamins, and minerals are needed for wound healing. Also, your nutrient and diet needs may change if you have complications and/or side effects from your medications after your transplant. Once you have successfully recovered from the early stage after transplant (for example: your appetite is back to normal, your weight is stable, and your wounds are healing well), then you should change to a diet that is low in saturated fat and high in fber, fruits, and vegetables. This type of diet will help reduce risks for other chronic diseases including heart disease and diabetes. Always discuss your individual dietary needs and concerns with your dietitian or transplant provider (NP , PA, or doctor). It is important to maintain a healthy weight. Obesity, gaining an unhealthy amount of excess fat, increases your risk of chronic diseases and can damage your new liver. Short Term Nutrition Management In the frst month after your liver transplant, you will be recovering from the stress of surgery. It is important to take in enough protein, calories, vitamins and minerals to help your wounds heal and prevent muscle loss. Limit concentrated sweets or foods high in salt to reduce stress on your recovering body functions. If you have nausea, poor appetite or abnormal bowel functions, ask your health care team for suggestions. It is common for patients to feel full after eating a portion of the meal. If this happens, you should try eating smaller portions 6 times a day rather than larger portions 3 times per day. Calories You should eat enough calories to prevent muscle wasting and allow for gradual regaining of lean body weight that is often lost with severe illness before transplant and during hospitalization (bed-rest) after transplant. Choose nutrient-rich foods (dairy, whole grains, plant foods) instead of foods considered \"empty calories\" (for example: sodas, candy). If you have a poor appetite, broaden your scope of food choices to allow for food preferences. Fruits and vegetables need to be a part of your diet to provide enough vitamins and minerals. LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 37 Protein Protein is important to promote healing and muscle gain. Extra protein is needed to overcome muscle breakdown caused by the high doses of prednisone given right after transplant . Every day you should eat some foods that are highest in protein. Meats and fsh have the highest concentrations of pr oteins, but many vegetarian sources are also excellent healthy choices that can add variety. Animal-based products high in Protein Plant-based products high in Protein Fish Poultry (chicken, turkey) Egg whites (egg substitute) Eggs (no more than 4 yolks per week) Dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt) Red meat (beef, pork, veal) Unsalted nuts Peanut butter (or other nut butters) Soy products (tofu, soy milk, tempeh) Dried beans, lentils (split peas, kidney, black, pinto, navy beans, etc.) Seitan (wheat gluten) Choose lean protein foods more often and prepare them using lean cooking methods (for example, grill or bake meats rather than frying). Sugar Prednisone can decrease the uptake of sugar from your blood into your body's cells. This may cause your blood sugar (glucose) level to rise. This condition is called \"hyperglycemia\" (high blood sugar) or \"steroidinduced diabe-tes\". You can help manage this side effect by avoiding foods that are concentrated with carbohydrate (sugars). Foods High in Simple Sugars and should be limited: Sugar Molasses Doughnuts, pastries, sweet rolls Pies, cakes, cookies Candy, chocolate candy Ice cream, frozen yogurt, sherbet Honey Syrups (corn, maple, etc.) Jam, jelly, marmalade (small amounts OK) Soft drinks (diet sodas OK) Other sweetened beverages (fruit juices, teas: diet OK) Jell-O NUTRITION FOLLOWING LIVER TRANSPLANTATION 38 If you develop high blood sugar, your diet may need to include the following guidelines: Eat at least three meals each day at regular, evenly spaced times. Avoid skipping meals. Each meal and snack should include some high quality protein. For example, a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread with salad. A snack could be 1/2 cup of 1% cottage cheese with fresh fruit or berries. Carbohydrate foods should be high in fber. Choose to eat more whole grain products, legumes, and veg-etables instead of refned white breads and cereals. Limit fruit to one serving per meal. One serving = 1/2 cup of chopped or canned fruit, or one mediumsized piece of fruit. Read food labels. Avoid foods with added sugars listed in the ingredients. Different names for sugars include: fructose, maltose, dextrose, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, honey, raw sugar, brown sugar, etc. There are many resources available to learn how to best manage blood sugar. Ask your dietitian or healthcare provider for reading and education materials. Many healthcare providers or insurance plans provide diabetes management classes. Ask if they may appropriate for you. Sodium (salt) Surgery and medications such as prednisone can cause your body to \"hold on to\" (retain) sodium and water. This can then cause increased blood pressure. To help avoid this, it is best to restrict salt intake. The \"No Added Salt\" diet, which is usually recommended, suggests eating less than 3000 mg of sodium each day. To follow these recommendations, you should: 1. Limit salt when cooking. Use herbs and spices for favor. 2. Do not add salt after food is prepared. 3. Avoid or limit the following foods: High salt soups Most canned, dehydrated, and bullion soups are high in salt. Read labels to choose those lowest in salts. Many popular brands now carry low sodium versions of soups. Processed meats Ham, bacon, sausage, frankfurters, cold cuts (bologna, salami, pastrami), corned beef, smoked or dried meat or fsh, canned meat (unless labeled \"no salt added\"), salt pork. Processed / canned food products Cheese, packaged meals /dinner, most canned foods (except those labeled \"no salt added\"), frozen vegetables with sauces, pickles, sauerkraut, canned vegetable juice. LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 39 Restaurant items Average amount of sodium per entree is 3000 mg. Salted snacks Salted crackers, pretzels, potato chips, corn chips, tortilla chips, popcorn, nuts, seeds, etc. Condiments and miscellaneous: Use in moderation: catsup, prepared MSG (monosodium glutamate), soy sauce, meat tenderizers, pickle relish, olives, garlic salt, onion salt, salad dressings . Note: salt substitutes are high in potassium and should only be used with your healthcare provider's permission. Potassium Some drugs such as Cyclosporine or Tacrolimus can increase your blood potassium levels. Other drugs such as Furosemide (Lasix\u00ae) can decrease blood potassium. Abnormal blood potassium levels can cause problems with muscle and heart function. Your health care team may change your medications and/or diet to help manage your blood potassium levels. Below is a list of common foods high in potassium. You may be asked to either increase or decrease your intake of these foods. Remember that these ar e general guidelines and do not include all foods that contain potassium. If your diet needs to be stricter, ask your dietitian for a more complete list. Fruits Vegetables Juices Other Foods Apricots Avocados Bananas Dried fruit Melons Nectarines Oranges Peaches Leafy greens Pumpkins Potatoes Split peas Dried beans Lentils Tomatoes Orange juice Prune juice Tomato juice V-8 juice Milk and dairy Peanut Butter Nuts Chocolate NUTRITION FOLLOWING LIVER TRANSPLANTATION 40 Nutrition for Pediatric Patients Following Liver Transplant Children and adolescents who receive liver transplantation may have had weight loss or delayed weight gain and growth before surgery. You probably had to make adjustments in your child's diet to reduce the complications or discomfort of chronic liver disease. After surgery, however, the emphasis is to provide enough calories, protein, and other essential nutrients to promote healing, weight gain and growth. Encourage your child to eat a variety of foods and try to limit the amount of dietary restrictions you put on your child. However, your child's diet should be somewhat low in sodium (salt) and concentrated sweets to reduce the body's stress from medications and recovery from surgery. The dietitian will work with you and your child to identify wholesome and tasty foods that are easily tolerated and good substitutes for fast food. Some infants and children may need tube feedings after transplant for normal growth and development. If nasogastric tube feeds are necessary, your healthcare provider will prescribe them and you will receive instructions on how to manage the feedings at home. Long Term Nutritional Management Transplant patients have increased risk for excessive weight gain, heart disease, diabetes, and low bone mineral density (osteopenia or osteoporosis) in the months and years after surgery. Some medications can be involved in the development of these complications, but researchers and healthcare providers believe diet and activity behaviors are very important. Risks can be reduced by adopting a low fat, low saturated fat, low choles-terol, high fber \"Heart Healthy\" diet as outlined: Foods Choose more often Choose less often Vegetables Minimum 3 servings each day. Try fresh or frozen that are prepared plain or with small amounts of unsaturated fats. Vegetables prepared with butter, cheese or cream sauce. Fruits Minimum 2 servings each day. Fresh, frozen, canned, or dried. Fruit juice; fruit served with butter or cream sauce. Breads, Cereals, Grains, Dry Peas, Beans, and Soy Whole grain bread, cereals, pasta and rice; dried peas, beans; baked goods made with unsaturated oil or margarine; soy foods. Refned, white breads, cereals and baked good; white rice; dried peas or beans made with cream, butter, or cheese sauce. Eggs and Dairy Products Egg whites and substitutes; skim or 1% milk, yogurt and cottage cheese. Egg yolks; whole or 2% milk, yogurt and cheese. Meat and Poultry Lean cuts with fat trimmed; turkey or chicken without skin; lean luncheon meat; cooking methods to help reduce fat. Fatty cuts of meat; bacon and sau-sage; organ meats; any fried meat; high fat luncheon meat (salami) Fish and Shellfsh All, cooked using low-fat methods. Fish and shellfsh cooked with butter, cheese or cream sauces. LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 41 Foods Choose more often Choose less often Fats and Oils Limit all fats to <30% of total calories. Margarine (made fr om unsaturated oils), including reduced- or mayonnaise); liquid cooking acids (hydr oge- nated fats); butter, lard, bacon fat, shortening, full fat salad dressings; coconut. Sweets and Snacks *Remember that while some of these products are low in fat, they still contain calories, mostly from sugars. Low- or non- fat frozen desserts and baked goods; favor ed gelatins; candy such as gum drops; low salt pretzels and baked snack chips; air-popped popcorn. Candy and baked goods made with butter , cream or tropical oils; high fat ice cream and frozen desserts; doughnuts; regular snack chips. An easy way to think of this is to eat lots of vegetable/plant foods (whole grains, fruit, vegetables) and fsh. Limit the amount of high fat animal foods. Read food labels car efully to avoid unnecessary fats and sugars. It is also important to get enough calcium in your diet. Adults after transplant should have approximately 1200 mg of calcium (but less than 2000 mg) each day . This amount may be diffcult to achieve if you don't eat dairy foods. Talk with your healthcare provider or dietitian about adding calcium supplements if you feel your dietary calcium is low. Low-Fat Cooking Tips Microwave, broil, grill, or steam without adding fat. Use nonstick sprays or cookware. Trim all visible fat off meat and remove skin from poultry. (It is OK to remove skin after cooking) Experiment with reducing the amount of oil you use in baking. (Often recipes will taste just as good with less oil.) There are many books and magazines devoted to health and nutrition. Enjoy trying new low fat, healthy recipes for the whole family . NUTRITION FOLLOWING LIVER TRANSPLANTATION 42 Food Safety After Transplant You are on medications that lower your immune system to prevent rejection of your transplanted liver. These medications increase your risk for foodborne illness. The following food safety tips can help when preparing, handling, and consuming foods. Wash hands and surfaces often. Avoid cross-contamination by washing cutting boards, utensils, dishes, and countertops often while prepar- ing food. Wash all produce under running water, including those with inedible skins. Refrigerate foods promptly. Toss any foods that smell or appear spoiled. Cook to safe temperatures. Foods are safely cooked when they are heated to the USDA-FDA recommended safe minimum internal temperatur es as noted below: USDA-FDA recommended safe minimum internal temperatures USDA-FDA recommended safe minimum internal temperatures Steaks/Roasts, Pork or Lamb Chops Fish Ground Beef, Pork, Lamb Egg Dishes Turkey, Chicken & Duck (whole or ground) 145\u00b0F 145\u00b0F 160\u00b0F 160\u00b0F 165\u00b0F Food High risk foods to AVOID Lower risk foods to choose Seafood Raw or undercooked fsh or shellfsh, (for example, oysters) Well-cooked seafood or fsh (should be frm and faky) Red meat and poultry Raw or undercooked red meat and poultry Well-cooked red meat or poultry Milk Unpasteurized dairy Pasteurized milk Eggs Raw or undercooked eggs or food con-taining them Well-cooked eggs (frm yolks and whites), pasteurized eggs/egg products Cheese Soft cheeses made fr om unpasteurized milk (for example: moldy cheeses such as brie or camembert) Hard cheeses, processed cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella, or soft cheese labeled \"made fr om pasteurized milk\" Hot dogs and deli meats Hot dogs and deli meats that have not been reheated Hot dogs and deli meats r eheated to steaming hot Vegetables Unwashed fresh vegetables Washed fresh vegetables and cooked vegetables See the USDA-FDA website (fda.gov) for further information on food safety for transplant recipients. LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 43 Fitness For Life At UCSF, we strongly feel that regular physical activity is necessary after transplant for you to become as healthy and physically ft as possible. Everything you do to improve your overall health increases your chances of having a long life with your transplant. With the increasing shortage of organs available for transplant, it is a good idea to make healthy lifestyle choices . . . . a second transplant may not come easily . There is enough scientifc evidence to say that regular physical activity: Decreases risk of death from heart disease. Prevents or delays the development of high blood pressure. Reduces blood pressure in people who already have high blood pressure. Keeps muscles and joints strong and functioning. Helps bones develop during childhood and helps adults prevent osteoporosis (thinning of the bones). Special Importance of Physical Activity for Transplant Recipients Long periods of inactivity and/or bed rest causes loss of muscle mass and strength (including strength of the heart) and limits your ability to perform exercise. A successful transplant does not automatically return you to nor-mal physical activity. For muscles to regain their function and strength, they must be used regularly. Many people after transplant have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and gain fat weight. All of these increase your risk of heart attacks or stroke. You may resume physical activity 6 weeks post liver transplant. You can discuss with your transplant NP/PA or your local MD. The weight gain following transplant is not due to prednisone. The weight gain is a result of the balance between how much and what types of foods are eaten and how many calories are burned through physical activity and your resting metabolism, which decreases with age. How to Start an Exercise Program When you decide to start your exercise or physical activity program, you should consider several things: type of exercise how often you will exercise (number of times per week) how long you will exercise each session (minutes per session) how you will continue to develop your program how har d you need to work or exert yourself FITNESS FOR LIFE 44 The key is to start slowly and increase gradually. That way your body will adapt to the exercise so you will feel comfortable and not get discouraged. You will defnitely see progress as long as you stick with a program. TYPE of Activity: The best activities use large muscle groups in a rhythmic manner: walking, aerobics, cycling, swimming, jogging, machines such as climbers, stationary cycles, and ski machines. Choose an activity that is convenient and fun for you. There are no activities that are restricted for transplant patients. If you have problems with your joints, an activity that supports your body weight and is not jarring will be best for you (such as cycling). If, after starting you feel discomfort in your joints, you may want to change your activity to one that is 'easier' on the joints such as swimming. Walking is easy, requires no special equipment other than comfortable, supportive shoes, and may be done anywhere, anytime. FREQUENCY of Activity: You should try to schedule your activity so you are doing something at least 5 days per week. Planning activity into your daily schedule will help you stay with it on regular basis. There is no time of day that is better for exer-cise . . . it all depends on what works for you and when you will be able to do it regularly. DURATION of Activity: Start with your activity for 10 minutes and gradually increase by 5 minutes every week to a goal of 30 or more minutes per session. If you are working to reduce or control your weight you will need to burn more calories, which means that you must exercise for a longer duration each session . . . the longer you exercise, the more calories you will burn. INTENSITY of Activity: The question is \"how hard must I work myself when I exercise?\" You should work hard enough to: make your heart beat faster allow you to breathe in a way that you can talk with someone during your session make you feel warm (perspiration is ok) feel that the exercise is \"somewhat hard\" for you The increased effort can be worked in for short times during your exercise session. For example: climb hills and then walk down, or walk much faster for a block or two then walking slower for a block or two, etc. This will add variety to your session as well as further improve your ftness. LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 45 PROGRESSION of Activity: It is best to start slowly and increase gradually. Start with a short duration of activity and gradually increase the time of each session. Start with a comfortable, lower level of intensity (work) and gradually increase the exertion level as you get used to the exercise. People may have problems, such as injuries, when they do too much exer-cise too soon. Gradual progression will prevent those kinds of problems. Resistance (Weight) Training Exercises that can easily be done at home to strengthen muscles include: climbing stairs standing up and sitting down into a chair (repeat 10-15 times, using your hands as little as possible so your legs do the work) lifting soup cans push-ups against the wall or from a counter As you become stronger, you may want to use free weights or weight machines at a gym. Start with a low weight that you can comfortably lift 10-12 times. Remember that the weight being lifted will increase the stress on the joint (such as elbow or shoulder), so if the weight is too heavy or the exercise is not performed correctly you may hurt yourself. Don't hold your breath when lifting weights. The CHALLENGE = Sticking with it!! 1. You must work hard enough with your body (heart, lungs, muscles, etc.) so that changes can happen. 2. You must stay with the program. The fact is: increased physical activity is a personal commitment. No one else can do it for you and your health over time is dependent on being physically active on a regular basis. U.S. Transplant Games The U .S. Transplant Games is a wonderful celebration open to all recipients of solid organ and bone marrow transplants in the United States. All transplant recipients are welcome, whether or not they are athletes. The Games provide competition for those interested in challenging themselves and is also a chance to meet others from all over the country who have the similar experience of transplantation. At the frst event in 1990, there were 400 recipients, and it has grown to over 5,000 recipients, family and friends. It is an exciting, inspirational event for everyone. The UCSF Transplant Service encourages anyone who is interested in participating. The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) organizes the U.S. Transplant Games every 2 years. All transplant recipi-ents (heart, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, and bone marrow) of all ages and all athletic abilities are welcome and encouraged to participate. This is your time to show your family, friends, donors, and donor families that you're not \"just\" alive, but living life, too! Events include both team and individual races, swimming, golf, tennis, table tennis, bicycling, bowling and more. FITNESS FOR LIFE 46 There are also social events: opening and closing ceremonies, parties, workshops for donors, and a special tribute to all organ and tissue donors. For more information about the Transplant Games, please visit the National Kidney Foundation ( www .kidney .org ) or call the Northern California Chapter of the Kidney Foundation, 800-622-9010. Contact the American Liver Foundation for liver walks ( www.liverfoundation.org) 800-GO LIVER. LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 47 Health Maintenance Skin Cancer Transplant patients have an added risk of cancer, especially skin and lip cancers. This risk increases with time due to long term immunosuppression (anti-rejection medications). Immunosuppressive drugs make your skin sensitive to the sun causing you to burn easier, faster, and to a much greater degree than before your transplant. Prolonged, repeated exposure to the sun produces permanent skin changes and damage. Remember that you can burn even if your skin is dark because your medications may make you more sensitive to the sun. Your risk of developing skin cancers increases with time after transplant. These cancers are ten times more com-mon in transplant patients than in the general population. Therefore it is essential that you limit your exposure to the sun and that you protect yourself when you are outside. Warning signs of skin cancers are any sores that bleed, scab, grow, or do not go away in a few weeks. Such sores are most likely to appear on the exposed parts of your body\u2014face, neck, head (especially if you are bald), and your hands and arms. A mole that bleeds or changes color or size must be examined immediately. You must contact your local provider to be evaluated by a dermatologist. You should see a dermatologist yearly or more frequently if indicated. You may need to be referred to a \"high risk\" dermatologist. Contact your Transplant pro-vider for more information. The rays of the sun that are responsible for skin cancers are ultraviolet rays (UV rays) which are present even on cloudy days and in shady areas. We advise you to always protect your skin from exposure to these rays. Avoid the mid-day sun (10am-3pm) when ultraviolet rays are strongest. For extra protection from the sun wear sun-screen with SPF of least 30, lip balm, broad brimmed hats, long sleeves, and slacks every time when you go outdoors. Some studies have shown that Vitamin B3 can decrease the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma. If you want, you can take it. It is ok to take Vitamin B complex daily. Routine Self Examination Cancers are more common when people are on immunosuppressive medications. Because of this, we recom-mend a monthly self-examination (ask your primary care provider if you need instruction how to do breast or testicular self-examination) and routine medical checkups. PAP smears and breast exams should be done every year. Reports should be sent to the Transplant Offce. Your local physician can perform these tests. Acne Prednisone may cause acne on your face, chest, shoulders, or back. Cyclosporine can make your skin oily in these areas. HEALTH MAINTENANCE 48 If your skin becomes excessively dry, temporarily stop using soaps on these areas to allow the skin to recover its natural moisture. You may use over the counter preparations (such as Oxy-5 or Oxy-10) to treat acne. We recom-mend that you do not use Retin-A (a powerful acid form of Vitamin A). It causes increased sun sensitivity which should be avoided. If acne remains a problem, tell us about it. Severe or infected acne must be treated by a dermatologist. Dry Skin If you have problems with dry skin, use a mild soap and apply body lotion after bathing. For severe dry, scaly skin you may need a good body lotion. There are many good products available from your local drug store without a prescription. Cuts and Scratches Keep minor cuts and scratches clean and dry by washing daily with soap and water. If you wish, you may apply an antiseptic such as Betadine solution. For large cuts, dog bites, etc., contact your doctor immediately. You will not need any special skin care unless you have problems with acne or dry skin. You should take a bath or shower as often as necessary (daily or every other day) to keep your skin clean. Use any soap that you prefer. IMPORTANT: Any persistent skin problem requires an evaluation by a dermatologist. Increased Hair Growth This problem is caused by Cyclosporine and is especially annoying to women. You can remove hair with a hair removal cream. There are several creams on the market made especially for your face. Be sure to follow bottle directions concerning testing. Hair removal cream causes severe irritation to the eyes, mucous membranes, and lips so apply carefully. A safer way to diminish the look of excessive hair is to bleach the extra hair growth with 50% peroxide solution. When your Prednisone dose is less than 20 mg per day, you may want to consider wax-ing or electrolysis for permanent hair removal. Caution: Parents should be particularly careful when using these products on infants and young children since their skin tends to be more sensitive. Hair Loss Tacrolimus\u00ae (Prograf) can cause hair loss. This usually stops or slows down as you have your dose lowered. Hair Care Prednisone often affects the condition of your hair because it makes your hair weaker. Permanent wave lotion, tints, dyes, and bleaching may cause your hair to break. We recommend that you wait until your Prednisone dose is less than 20 mg per day to have a perm or to color your hair. LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 49 Dental Care Routine dental work should be done six months after your transplant. This includes having your teeth cleaned. However, if you have tooth or gum pain you should see your dentist immediately. You will not need to take an antibiotic when you have dental work done, unless your dentist deems neces-sary due to a possible infection. We follow the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for prophylaxis. Your local healthcare provider and dentist are aware of these guidelines and should refer to them should they have questions regarding antibiotics for dental work in transplant patients. It is extremely important that you practice good mouth care after your transplant to maintain healthy gums and teeth, as well as to avoid infection. Brush your teeth once or twice a day. Floss your teeth once a day; be gentle if you notice any bleeding. Contact your dentist or dental hygienist if your gums continue to bleed with fossing. If your dental work was not completed before transplantation, you must see your dentist for evaluation within the frst few weeks after you return home. Follow the procedure outlined below when you visit the dentist: Make an appointment. Inform the dental offce that you have had your transplant. The Transplant Center will fax or mail a dental clearance letter as requested by the dentist or by you. See sample dental letter on the next page. Prednisone Dose and Routine Dental Care Your Prednisone dose should be 5 mg once/day (or less) when dental work is done to reduce the possibility of in-fection and bleeding, and to increase the healing process. But, do not avoid dental care if your Prednisone dose is high and you have tooth or gum pain. It is better to have healthy teeth and gums than to allow them to become infected. If your dentist has any questions or if you have any questions, contact the Liver Transplant Offce for further infor-mation. HEALTH MAINTENANCE 50 Date ________________ __________________.

You stopped smoking (or were supposed to) prior to transplant. Now there are even more reasons not to smoke. Smoking damages the lungs, putting you at great risk for lung infections including bronchitis, emphysema, and pneumonia. It also incr eases your risk of head & neck and lung cancer (especially after transplant). Smoking lessens the ability of your red blood cells to carry oxygen, so less oxygen goes to all of your tissues decr easing your ability to heal. Smoking narrows your blood vessels, especially those in your legs, arms, and heart. Smoking also increases acid in your stomach that can delay or prevent the healing of any ulcers that may occur. All of these problems are more serious in someone taking immunosuppressive medications. Talk with your primary care provider about short term medications or smoking cessation programs that may be available if you need help to stop smoking. Alcohol and Illegal drugs Do not drink alcoholic beverages or take drugs, including marijuana. This includes non-alcoholic beers and wines. (They still contain small amounts of alcohol). Alcohol is metabolized (broken down) by the liver and causes liver damage as well as liver failure. Almost all medications are metabolized by the liver. The combination of these medications with alcohol could seriously harm your liver. Smoking marijuana exposes your lungs to harmful fungi that can lead to life threatening infections. If you are having trouble living without alcohol or drugs, you need to know that this can be a life threatening prob- lem. Help is available. Contact your local primary car e physician, your transplant provider, or the transplant social worker for help. Sexuality You may resume sexual activity when you feel like it. Remember to always practice safe sex if you are not in a monogamous relationship. Contact the transplant team to review immunosuppressive medications before be-coming pregnant or fathering children. Contact your gynecologist to discuss methods of birth control. Some of your immunosuppression may cause birth defects; therefore, your medications may need adjustment before you become pregnant or before you father a child. Family Planning Some people want to have children after they have had a liver transplant. For many women this is possible, but there are also risks to the mother and fetus. It is important to discuss these risks with the Transplant HEALTH MAINTENANCE 52 Team so that you can make the right decision for you and your family. Male transplant recipients should also re- view medications with the transplant team before fathering children. Some immunosuppressive medications may need to be changed or discontinued before pregnancy to protect the baby from potential birth defects. Return to work/school/disability: frequently asked questions 1. When can I return to work / school? Most patients are able to return to work 3-6 months after transplant with no restrictions. Generally, there are no weight lifting or activity limits appr oximately 3 months after transplant. Most people start planning about a month after transplant for their return to work. Of course, this depends on your particular recovery. Children may be ready to return to school approximately 2-3 months after transplant. We will write a letter to your child' s school that will include the following, as well as any special needs for your child: No P .E. for at least 3 months after transplant. Contact sports like American football, karate and wrestling, ar e prohibited Recess is encouraged Need for frequent lab work and clinic appointments 2. How long will I be on disability? Disability benefts depend on your physical condition. If you were on disability at the time of your transplant, your continued eligibility for benefts will be r eviewed some time after your surgery. The timing of this review will depend on your particular disability plan. If your liver function is good and your condition is stable, the liver transplant team will not be able to say that you continue to be disabled. Generally, by 6 months after trans-plant, patients are no longer disabled because of transplantation. 3. What should I do with disability forms? The transplant team will be able to complete your disability forms within the frst 3 months after transplant. Y ou may bring the forms to your clinic appointments or mail them to your transplant provider. Generally, after 3 months, your primary care provider will be seeing you more often than the transplant team and is the appropri-ate person to complete any disability forms. 4. What if I don't have a job? If you have been off from work prior to transplant, there is help available to assist you in fnding a job. The De-partment of V ocational Rehabilitation can help you identify your skills and options. They can also help you with job fnding skills, re-training or schooling. Call the transplant social worker for more information. Call 1-800-LIVER TX (548-3789) with non urgent questions, or messages for the transplant team. Messages m ay be left 24 hours a day. Your message will be returned within one business day. LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 53 Travel There are no travel restrictions after transplant if your condition is stable. See page 33 for additional informa- tion about immunizations. Contact your local health care provider or travel clinic for questions. When traveling, remember to plan to take enough medication plus extra so you will be prepared if you have unexpected changes in plans. Always carry medication on board rather than checking with your luggage. More information can be found at www.cdc.gov . Remember that you may NOT receive live vaccines. (Please review pages 34 and 35 of this book.) HEALTH MAINTENANCE 54 Other Health Care Concerns Illness and Infection You need to protect yourself from infection because your immune system is suppressed. Wash your hands with soap and water often to wash away bacteria and viruses. Keep your hands away from your face and mouth. Wash hands after using the bathroom and before eating. Avoid sick people. Ask sick friends to visit when they are well. If you have a wound and do your own dressing changes, wash your hands before and after you change the dressing. When you cough or sneeze, use tissues, discard them in the trash, then wash your hands. Even when taking all possible precautions, there are times when you may get an infection anyway. If you have a fever over 100.4\u00b0 F (38\u00b0 C) or you do not feel well, see your local healthcare provider and call the transplant offce. You may need to have blood drawn and a chest x-ray. You will be prescribed an antibiotic if you have a bacterial infection. Sometimes you may need to be admitted to the hospital for treatment. Remember that stomach pains, problems with your heart, problems with breathing, or fevers cannot be diag-nosed over the phone. See your own healthcare provider for any treatment. You may call us at 415-353-1888 for urgent questions about your care. Providers for pediatric patients should call 415-476-5892. Call 1-800-LIVER TX (548-3789) with non urgent questions, or messages for the transplant team. Messages may be left 24 hours a day. Your message will be returned within one business day. Colds and Flu You will get colds and fu. If you get a cold, you may take over the counter medications (ex: Sudafed, Dimetapp, etc.). Avoid cold remedies that contain aspirin and Ibuprofen. Limit Tylenol (acetaminophen) to 2000 mg per day. Read labels and prescriptions-Tylenol is contained in many medications. If you have a cough, you may take cough medicine (ex: Robitussin). However, if your cough becomes productive (with green phlegm or sputum) and you run a fever, call your local healthcare provider. You may need a chest xray and antibiotics. For Children: Please check with your pediatrician. Inform the Transplant Offce whenever you are exposed to any communicable disease that you have not previ-ously had. This is particularly important for liver transplant children. 1-800-LIVER Zoster (Shingles) Shingles appear as a rash or small water blisters usually on the chest, back or hip. They may also occur on other areas. The rash may or may not be painful. You should notify your primary care provider and transplant provider if this rash appears. (For vaccine questions, see page 34) Persistent Headaches Tacrolimus and Cyclosporine can cause headaches. Please inform your transplant provider for adjustments. If they become persistent you may need to see a neurologist. Skin Eruptions If you develop warts, persistent sores, or moles you must see a physician, preferably a dermatologist. If a skin eruption requires medical treatment, have your health care provider call the transplant offce 1-800-LIVER TX to discuss the treatment. Pediatric patients should call 415-476-5892. Thrush This is an infection caused by fungus that usually affects the mouth. It can also affect the esophagus (the tube from your mouth to your stomach), the vagina in women or the diaper area in infants. With oral thrush, your mouth may be very tender and you may notice that your tongue is covered by a white flm. Mycelex Troche or Nystatin (a yellow liquid) can help clear up this infection. It is helpful to eat soft foods or drink liquids. With vaginal thrush, you will notice an increase in vaginal discharge and possibly a change in its color. Your genital area may also itch. Vaginal creams and other medicines are available. Talk with your primary care provider or the Transplant Team if you think you have thrush. Do not take oral antifungals (fuconazole) without checking with your transplant team frst. Antifungals can cause a drastic elevation in your tacrolimus or cyclosporine blood levels. Chicken Pox, Measles, and Mumps: Chicken pox is a virus that causes a mild fever and small red bumps on the skin and can be very itchy. It is spread by coming in contact with another person infected with the virus. Being in the same room with an infected person can transmit the virus. If you had chicken pox as a child, you most likely will not get it again. However, if you have not had chicken pox or you are not sure, let the Transplant Team know. This is a relatively mild disease in children. In adults chicken pox is more severe\u2014especially in immuno compromised adults. If you suspect you have been exposed to chicken pox, call the Transplant Team immediately. Emergency Medical Identifcation You should wear a medical identifcation bracelet or necklace at all times after your transplant. You may obtain a form to order one at your local pharmacy. Indicate on the form that you have had a liver transplant, and are \"im-munosuppressed.\" Include the 24 hour hotline number 415-353-1888 (for pediatric patients: 415-476-5892) to be printed on the tag. HEALTH MAINTENANCE 56 It is a good idea to also have your local health care provider's phone number printed on the tag. If the transplant patient is a child, you may want to print the parents' frst names and home phone number(s) as well. Guidelines for Visiting Transplant Children We support and encourage parents or guardians to stay with their child. Most patient rooms have sleeping accommodations for one family member to stay overnight. Our family resource coordinator can assist with local housing for longer stays. Siblings of all ages are encouraged to visit. All parents, family members, and visitors must check in at the hospital information desk in the lobby. A brief security and health screening will be conducted. Visitors with any signs or symptoms of infection or illness, such as fever, cold, cough, sore throat, runny nose, diarrhea, vomiting, or any other cold or fu symptoms, are asked to postpone their visit. All children must wash their hands thoroughly before entering the patient's room. No children visitors may receive treatments or medications of any kind while they are visiting. As there is no care available for visiting children, please make arrangements for their supervision. The staff may ask visiting children to leave if they are unsupervised or disruptive. There are no accommodations for visiting children to spend the night. If there are any falls, bumps, cuts or accidents, a parent must notify the nurse promptly. You may be asked to take the visitor to the emergency room for treatment. Visiting children must leave the Pediatric foor immediately when the visit is over. Thank you for being careful and following these guidelines. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask any of the nurses. RESOURCES LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 57 This page is intentionally left blank. INTRODUCTION 58 Resources Getting Back Into Life! A serious illness can create many personal and family stresses. After your transplant, there will be different types of adjustments. You and your family can expect some ups and downs related to your physical condition as well as emotional reactions to this new phase in your life. For example, you may feel somewhat anxious when you get your labs drawn or when you need to have tests if your lab values change. You or your caregivers may have mixed feelings as you become more independent and responsible for your own care. These are normal reactions. If you have been sick for a long time, you may have had to give up some of your normal life such as child care, work, and activities with friends. You and people close to you may have some ups and downs as you get back to your normal activities and roles. Your illness may also have changed your relationship with your signifcant other. Sometimes it may help to talk to someone else who knows what you are going through. In most communities, there are transplant support groups. The transplant social worker is available to talk with you about these transi-tions. The social worker also has lists of the community support groups and other resources which may help you. If you had a sudden, unexpected transplant, you may experience some sadness or depression as you start to feel physically better. Remember, you did not have a chance to plan or prepare for the changes in your life and you will need to do that as you recover. Again, please speak with the transplant social worker or the transplant team if you are having diffculty. No one can predict exactly what your recovery will be like. Complications, minor and serious, may occur any time. Remember that the transplant team will work with your primary health care providers and you to take care of you. There may also be some practical problems after transplant such as insurance or fnancial issues. Your medical care following transplantation is very expensive. Therefore, you must keep current with your insurance. Know what it covers, how it works, and what your responsibilities are. You must check with your insurance company to fnd out which laboratories and pharmacies you may use with your plan. Most insurance companies will only pay when you use the health care providers they approve. Remember, it is your responsibility to make sure any visits to UCSF have been approved (authorized) by your insurance. If your insurance coverage changes, please call 1-800-LIVER TX (548-3789) to update your records. Some people, as they recover after transplant, lose eligibility for disability based insurances like Medi-Care and Medi-Cal. If you think you are going to lose your insurance, talk with either the fnancial counselor or transplant social worker about what other coverage may be available. Do not wait to call until you have no insurance. You must plan ahead. LIVER TRANSPLANT HANDBOOK 59 Other practical issues that you should continue to keep updated include advance directives, wills, and power of attorney, especially if you have no legal next of kin. There is light at the end of the tunnel!! Life after transplant can be a real roller coaster ride for patients, families, and friends. The goal of transplantation is to help you return to good health and your usual lifestyle. Most patients are able to return to work, raise fami-lies, and lead full, physically active lives after transplantation. Your transplant team looks forward to helping you in whatever way we can. Talk to us. Adult Support Group The Liver Transplant Support Group is held on Tuesdays after the adult Transplant Clinic on 9 Long in the Solari-um from 1-2pm. It is open to all present and future liver transplant recipients and their families and friends. Caregiver Support Group The Caregiver Support Group is held on the frst Friday of the month at 9 Long in the Solarium from 1-2pm. It is open to all caregivers only, no patients.
