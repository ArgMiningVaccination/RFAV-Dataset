Self Awareness Some people who meditate focus on recognizing thoughts that are harmful or self-defeating. This helps them train their thoughts toward positivity when the negative thoughts emerge. Increase Focus Training your thinking can increase your attention span for better focus. This benefit of meditation can also help individuals fight an addiction.

Shilah is an aromatherapist for Simply Earth and uses meditation to calm anxiety and help her focus. Here's Shilah's thoughts on meditation: Hey everyone. I wanted to pop in really quick to tell you how meditation (along with yoga) has helped me out so much! I have found that mediating a few times a week for 10 minutes or less at a time, along with doing some yoga really helps quiet my mind, and helps level out anxious thoughts. My thoughts can be racing around 1,000 times a minute, but after I do some quiet meditating I can finally think clearly. I highly suggest learning how to meditate, even if it's just 5 minutes a week!
