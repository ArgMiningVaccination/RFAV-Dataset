Homeopathy is a two-hundred-year-old medical science which uses naturally occurring substances in minute doses to stimulate the body's deep healing capacities. Samuel Hahnemann, a late 18th century German physician discovered this new type of treatment while exploring ways to remove toxicity from the existing medicines of that time. In this novel approach of preparing medicines, Hahnemann started a profound healing method which has continued to grow and flourish throughout the world to this day. Hahnemann viewed disease as a pattern of limitation in the vital force, a living physiologic intelligence which maintains our health and equilibrium in the face of changing and demanding conditions. The role of the homeopath is to restore optimal health by looking at the whole person and finding the pattern of limitation in their vital force, then giving the homeopathic medicine that specifically corresponds to that particular pattern. At this time we have over 3000 different medicines to choose from, each corresponding to a particular pattern of human illness. The process of finding the best medicine involves carefully studying the whole constellation of physical, mental and emotional symptoms in a person, not just looking at a single organ or part. Each homeopathic medicine is chosen for the whole person, not for the disease. "}
