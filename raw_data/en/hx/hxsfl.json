In Aphorism 19 of the Organon of Medicine, when a person falls ill, they will display symptoms as this is the (vital force) body's normal response to attempting to regain health. For example, when a person has a cold or flu their body's natural (vital force) response is to expel mucous get rid of bacteria/viruses, cough to help move infection out of the lungs, and will develop a fever as it's harder for bacteria and viruses to survive.
