Your digestive tract communicates with the rest of your body, and the healthiness of your gut has a huge impact on your overall wellbeing! Over 90 percent of your serotonin, the hormone that regulates things like mood and sleep, is produced in the gut. It's important to maintain a healthy digestive system if you want to feel happy, energized, and well-rested. Millions of people across the country struggle with their digestion and don't know where to seek help. Additionally, most people don't want to take medications that have high costs and long lists of side effects. Dedham Acupuncture aims to treat people naturally. Traditional Chinese Medicine can provide amazing benefits for a wide range of digestive issues. Read on to find out how TCM can aid your digestive issues! Symptoms of Digestive Issues Digestive issues can prevent themselves in a lot of unpleasant ways. It's not always an obvious stomach ache or episode of acid reflux. Poor digestion can result in things like chronic pain, vitamin deficiencies, and malaise. Some symptoms of an irregulated digestive system are: - Headaches and migraines - Inflammation - Cold or hot sweats - Fatigue - Mood swings - Bloating and gas - Trouble sleeping - Weight gain or weight loss - Nausea Digestion is a very complex process. Traditional Chinese Medicine looks at the person and their diet from a holistic perspective to get a full understanding of what could be impacting their digestion. Everything from your diet to your metabolism, to your food choices, can your body's processes. Following some basic guidelines, though, can help build up your gut microbiome, and aid any issues that show up. Eat With the Seasons In TCM, eating with the seasons is important to stay balanced with the environment. So in the fall and winter, focusing on cooked seasonal foods like meat, soups, and stews can help aid your digestion. Winter is associated with kidney energy and consuming warm, nourishing, bitter foods like asparagus, kale, and vinegar can help your kidney function improve. In the spring and summer, more vegetables and fruits are in season. They're tasty, versatile, and provide an extra dose of hydration! Watermelon, strawberries, and cucumbers are great summer food options. Mind the Temperatures Have you ever heard the term \"digestive fire\"? Your digestive system essentially cooks down food with acid, bile, and enzymes and transforms it into vital energy. In Chinese Medicine, the temperature of your food and liquids will influence this digestive process greatly. Foods can be generally grouped into three categories: - Warming - Cooling - Neutral Cooked and room temperate foods (warming) is best all around, especially when trying to eat with the seasons. Raw, cooling foods can help regulate the body during times of extreme heat, both physically and emotionally. In general, though, raw foods tend to slow down the metabolism and can be pretty tough on the digestive system. In general, cooked foods aid the metabolism and are easier on digestion. The same goes for liquids. Tea, soups, broths, and warm temperature water are all beneficial for warming the digestive system. Cold and icy liquids can be shocking to the system and lead to issues. Hydration is Key Hydration is so important, especially in the winter. And no, coffee doesn't count! Many health concerns are exacerbated by dehydration. Avoid unnecessary health and digestion issues by consuming water throughout the day. For a lot of people, staying hydrated is a challenge. Water isn't flavorful and it starts to feel like a chore. Avoid using sugary flavor packets and try out these healthy tips instead: - Spice up your room temperature water with \u00bd lemon and a one-inch slice of ginger. (Ginger is a warming food that is perfect for the fall and winter!). - Place water in all the places you would usually be throughout the day (n your car, at your desk, in the living room, etc). That way, it's already there and the extra step of going to our a glass doesn't stop you from hydrating. - Have a water bottle filled with your water intake for the first half of your day. Set a goal to finish it by 12 pm, then refill it for the second half of your day. - Mix in fresh fruit like strawberries, blueberries, and lemons for all-natural flavored water!
