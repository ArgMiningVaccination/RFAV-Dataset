Agricultural potential is limited by the fact that only 18-20 percent of this mainly mountainous country is arable and there is a relatively short growing season between severe winters. This economic situation has limited the ability to produce or import fertiliser and pesticides. The reduced agricultural production is further aggravated by recurring adverse natural disasters which has also limited the ability of the country to import food to close the resulting substantial food import gap. Efforts to increase the area under cultivation result in the degradation of hillside slopes, further aggravated by deforestation by exporting timber to earn foreign exchange. The environmental degradation has led to an increase in the incidence and severity of floods. Even though the 1998 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Food Programme (WFP) Crop and Food Supply Assessment mission estimates a modest recovery in cereal production in 1998, it forecasts a large food deficit for 1999. The mission identifies an overall cereal import requirement of 1.354 million metric tonnes (MTs), of which it is expected that 300,000 MTs will be covered by commercial imports, and recommends the balance to be met through targeted and programme food aid. The public health sector has been affected by the economic conditions in a similar way. The shortage of essential drugs and medical equipment has led to the re-emergence of diseases that were previously controlled. Lack of inputs and depreciated plants have restricted the ability to provide potable water to the population and sanitation. The overall result is that the severe food crisis and its effects on the vulnerable groups are far from over and are inter-linked with deteriorating public health, unsafe water supply and poor sanitation systems. The results of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), WFP/European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) nutrition survey confirms very serious wasting and stunting amongst the surveyed under-seven-years age group. Serious nutritional problems have been observed in other intended target groups who did not receive food aid. The high level of stunting particularly amongst the older children, reconfirmed by the survey, indicates longer-term deprivation. Malnutrition weakens immunity to diseases, particularly in the young and the elderly. At the same time, diarrhoeal diseases from poor sanitary conditions contribute to malnutrition, creating a vicious cycle. Food insecurity at the household and national levels has led to foraging for alternative foods and to the production of processed alternative foods, but which have little nutritive value and can actually contribute to malnutrition in the young and elderly by its high fibre content and indigestibility. The existence of a considerable security tension in the country due to the absence of a peace agreement since the end of the Korean War, makes the implementation of humanitarian activities especially difficult. Verifiable information is not easy to obtain, access is restricted and the ability to meaningfully monitor assistance remains constrained. Nevertheless, agencies resident in the DPRK are confident that the intended beneficiaries in accessible areas are receiving and benefitting from the assistance. Much hardships and sufferings are evident, and whilst factual information is not easily available, the results of the UNICEF / WFP / ECHO inter-agency scientifically conducted nutrition survey, UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and the joint FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission have contributed valuable hard data to assist in the analysis of the situation and the assessment of needs. Description of the Common Humanitarian Action Plan Formulation Process Central to drawing up this Appeal has been the development of the common humanitarian action plan (CHAP). To arrive at a consensus for the CHAP, a working group was formed, representing the key parties. The working group consisted of the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) [also representing FAO, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)], WFP, UNICEF, World Health Organization (WHO), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), a representative of the donor community and a representative of the NGOs. In addition, there were observers serving in their personal capacity from the European Union (DG Vlll and ECHO). This group met on several occasions during the latter part of 1998 to arrive at agreed strategic objectives and to ensure coordination of programmes. From the middle of September, a facilitation team arrived from OCHA Headquarters to guide the working group to produce a CHAP to achieve the objectives. Long-Term Goals The long-term goals are to strengthen local capacity and promote self-reliance in the areas of food security, public health services, and disaster mitigation and prevention. The cost of providing food aid can be reduced by the provision of fertiliser and other agricultural inputs to restore agricultural productivity, within the scope of cost-effectiveness and sustainability and strengthening household-based initiatives. Such initiatives could include joint training of local institutions in household food security and nutrition, which would also ensure complementarity of local food security and health activities. Short-term Goals and Operational Objectives (For the Period of the Appeal) As food insecurity and health are interlinked, priority areas for the 1999 CAP are to: 1) address food insecurity through targeted food aid which will provide a safety net to prevent famine amongst the most vulnerable; 2) provide support for agricultural rehabilitation: 3) support health service requirements in terms of immediate and re-emerging public health needs of the population; 4) provide educational support to children in need of special protection and support to other emergency-affected population groups concerning food and nutrition related information; 5) provide water supplies and sanitation; 6) support national capacity-building in the areas of disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness. These goals will be pursued in the framework of sustained commitment to humanitarian principles. Relationship with Other Humanitarian and Development Programmes In May 1998, at the first Round table Meeting in Geneva, an Agricultural Recovery and Environment Protection (AREP) was launched under the auspices of UNDP. Care has been taken in the preparation of this Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP) to ensure that, wherever relevant, the short-term goals of the CAP programmes support the longer-term objectives of the AREP, and that the AREP complements the CAP. These mutually supporting inter-agency initiatives are an integral part of the sustained and coordinated effort to try to re-establish food security, while addressing the persisting short-term humanitarian needs at the same time. The CHAP programme therefore includes the \"Double Cropping and Crop Diversification Programme\" to meet the needs for immediate food increase during 1999, and thus, responding partly to the overall immediate needs of the AREP Plan, Phase 1 - Emergency Needs. A Food Aid Liaison Unit (FALU) has been established within the WFP Country Office for the purpose of coordinating, programming, monitoring and reporting the food aid inputs of non-resident NGOs. Information is collected and disseminated on food imports, including known trade and barter, bilateral and NGO food aid. Monitoring Plan Given the special circumstances in DPRK and following the Statement of Humanitarian Principles that aims to guide the development of the Common Humanitarian Action Plan, OCHA in collaboration with UN Agencies and NGOs present in DPRK, will strengthen its reporting capacity by initiating a monitoring plan that sets out operational indicators for each sector. These sectors include key areas such as food aid and food security; health; capacity-building and coordination. The purpose of the monitoring plan will be fourfold: 1) to ensure continued relevance of the CHAP; 2) to allow agencies and the international community involved in DPRK to track sectors of particular interest; 3) to provide OCHA with a better understanding of a coordinated programme of interventions based on an agreed strategy designed to achieve shared goals as described by the CHAP under Indicators for Assessing Sectoral Objectives (see page 17); and, 4) to provide regular information on the quality of movement and access to programme activity areas. Total Budget Requirements by Sector The gross budget for the 1999 Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea amount to US$ 376,112,894. This amount includes food assistance worth US$ 101,358,000 which has already been pledged and in the pipeline. The Appeal thus requests a net amount of $274,754,894. About 89 percent of this, or approximately US$ 243 million, is for food assistance and the promotion of food security. Projects in the health sector amount to over US$ 28 million and the remaining US$ 3 million are requested to support education, capacity-building and coordination. PREVIOUS CAP IN REVIEW Financial Overview Requirements under the 1998 Appeal amounted to US$ 383,242,336 of which US$ 345,801,900 (or 90 percent) was for food assistance. The remainder was for food security, health, water and sanitation, coordination and education. As of mid-November 1998, contributions pledged reached 57 percent of the total requirements. Food assistance, however, amounted to 99.6 percent of the total requirements in that sector in tonnage terms, due to the fact that a substantial amount of lower value commodities were pledged in lieu of the foreseen high value commodities. Towards the latter part of the year, a very substantial new food aid contribution resulted in full resourcing of the cereal component of the food appeal. Consequences of Under-Funding The overall impact of initial under-funding of the Appeal for food aid has been the exclusion of certain beneficiary groups which has led to an observed increase in nutritional problems among those groups. Up until the third quarter of 1998, 60.5 percent of food aid requirements had been pledged against the Appeal. As a result, the food availability was sufficient only for the most vulnerable of the originally identified beneficiary groups and food-for-work (FFW) rehabilitation activities. Within the food sector the size of the target group had to be reduced from 7.47 million to 4.3 million. Thus, food aid was primarily reserved for children aged 6 months to 6 years at nurseries and kindergartens. Observations indicate that this safety net has worked and that the well-being of these children has been preserved. Very little food aid was available for other target groups, including primary and secondary children, hospital patients, and nursing and lactating mothers. As a result, increased nutritional problems have been observed amongst children in the 7 to 12 -year-age group and even amongst older children school attendance has decreased. Attendance at hospitals has decreased as the hospitals are unable to provide food to patients. Inadequate availability of essential drugs, equipment at (ri) village, county and in the specialised hospitals has adverse effects on health delivery. In addition, health surveillance, epidemic and tuberculosis control and prevention activities could be initiated only on a limited scale. Capacity-building of community-based doctors has been limited to nutritional rehabilitation. During the 1998 agricultural year, experience demonstrated that AREP objectives were achievable. In areas where fertiliser and related inputs were made available, in particular through the Double Cropping Programme, maize and paddy production levels generally returned to pre-calamity levels. In spite of limited fertiliser application, cereal production is estimated to have been revived in 1998, reversing the decline experienced in previous years. Substantive Overview The main objectives of the 1998 Appeal were to prevent famine among the wider population and in particular, prevent malnutrition among children through provision of food aid and increase food production; and, to support the health system to deal with immediate public health problems and control and prevent the outbreak of re-emerging diseases, i.e. tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, malaria, cholera and other water-borne diseases, pertussis, etc. Strategies adopted to achieve the objectives were: - to increase access to more areas of the country in order to deliver assistance and reach a greater number of people in need; - to encourage an increased number of NGOs to establish a presence in the DPRK and to introduce priority programmes; - to promote more effective collaboration and coordination within the international community by strengthening coordination mechanisms; - to strengthen relations with Government both at the national and provincial levels. Progress Made Averting Famine and Malnutrition Supported by the findings of the nutrition survey, it is believed that support rendered by the international community has, to a great extent, averted a famine amongst the six-months six years -age-group who received food aid. However, nutritional problems have been observed in other intended target groups who did not receive food aid as a result of under-funding, particularly in children aged seven years and above. It is believed that hunger continues to prevail (and may be worse than available evidence would suggest) but the extent is still unclear, especially amongst the adult population. The results of the joint Government/UNICEF/ WFP/European Union (EU) nutrition survey indicate that serious levels of malnutrition and stunting continue to affect children. Health Polio vaccinations have been administered to 2.13 million children and measles campaigns have been carried out. There are regular coordination meetings chaired by UNICEF, with technical sub-group coordination meetings chaired by WHO. Information sharing and disease surveillance procedures have been developed and are under implementation. Essential medical supplies, and support to peripheral level health structures have been undertaken and responsibilities shared among NGOs, IFRC and UN Agencies. Tuberculosis (TB) control programmes have started in seven counties in three provinces (out of a total of 12 provinces). Laboratory reagents and chemicals are available on a limited scale. There has, however, been a deterioration in the DPRK's health delivery capacity including medicine production. Although general medical supplies appear to be available at both ri and county levels due to the interventions of UN Agencies, IFRC and NGOs and priorities established by the Government, there is a lack of supplies at the provincial hospital level which has serious consequences for more complicated cases that cannot be treated at the county level and need to be referred to the provincial level. There is also an inability to maintain the cold-chain and diseases, such as tuberculosis and poliomyelitis, appear to be re-emerging. Although the Government is taking necessary preventive measure during the current emergency situation, the possibility of the emergence of other diseases such as malaria and other water-borne diseases can not be ruled out. Food Production Overall capacity for food production has decreased due to lack of fuel, fertiliser and pesticides and other inputs; deteriorating soil fertility; depreciating agricultural machinery; and, unsustainable agricultural practices. This has been aggravated by continuing natural calamities. Innovations such as double-cropping have, however, created added capacity and increased the food supply during 1998. The implementation of the Double Cropping Programme during 1998, over an area of approximately 65,000 ha, resulted in an additional production of about 150,000 MTs of barley at the end of June. Thereby, food shortage was alleviated at the lean period. In addition, supply of agricultural inputs (fertiliser and pesticide) for the main summer crops, contributed to an increased production. The support to the autumn/winter wheat production, which started in September 1998, is also expected to increase food supply in 1999. Food-for-Work (FFW) rural infrastructure rehabilitation has contributed to increased agricultural production (including disaster mitigation activities, i.e. dyke repair and embankment reconstruction). Gaining Access The special security situation resulting from the absence of any peace agreement since the end of the Korean War has affected access. Nevertheless, considerable progress has been made since relief operations began in 1995, with increased understanding and confidence of the Government counterpart agency (FDRC - Flood Damage Rehabilitation Committee, NCC - National Coordinating Committee). Increased access has meant greater staff mobility in an increased number of counties. In May 1998, 171 counties out of a total number of 211 were accessible, compared to 159 in May 1997. Another example of increased access was the establishment of five WFP sub-offices throughout the country. However, access to provinces tended to fluctuate and was reduced during the latter part of 1998. Monitors were not permitted to conduct unscheduled, unsupervised visits. The lack of access - that was not pre-determined - to conduct assessments, monitoring and impact analysis, combined with the lack of adequate data results in conclusions that were based more on observation and inference than statistical information. However, the cooperation of the Government (FDRC) in the national Food and Crop Assessment and the unprecedented access provided during the Nutritional Survey and MICS (Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey), were positive steps towards improving accessibility to information and enhancing collaborative efforts with the Government in improving the UN system's understanding of the humanitarian situation in the DPRK. Increase in NGO Presence At the beginning of 1998, there were five resident NGOs present in country. The number peaked to 11 in mid-1998 and then dropped to 8 in September. This was attributed to various factors including inability to have direct access to the population, inability for certain NGOs to fulfil their mandates and a lack of sustained donor funding. This downward trend is likely to continue if active steps are not taken. One of such steps is a joint EU/WFP proposed commitment to channel ten percent of food aid through European NGOs resident in DPRK. At the same time, some of the remaining NGOs significantly achieved greater access in areas where they operate. Collaboration/Coordination Within the International Community The appointment of a Humanitarian Coordinator and establishment of the OCHA field office in DPRK greatly improved coordination within the international community. This is expected to be further strengthened with the implementation of the Common Humanitarian Action Plan. Increased Port Handling Capacity The capacity of the ports to handle large volumes of food aid increased through the provision of spare parts for the rehabilitation of cranes and other equipment, including fork lifts and generators to ensure power supply to the ports. Strengthened Relations with the Government Relations with Government generally improved during the latter part of 1998. Evidence of increased Government support includes the establishment of WFP sub-offices and the organisation of workshops with agency and Government participation. Another example was the visit of the flood-affected areas during August jointly undertaken by several agencies. Similarly, the joint Agency Nutritional Survey and UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey was permitted to proceed as planned, as was the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply and Crop Assessment Mission. Monitoring of the Double-Cropping Programme and support to the summer main crops were conducted through several missions by technical experts of FAO. Lessons Learned - Hunger continues to prevail, but the status and trends of mortality rates attributable to hunger are unclear. The assessment missions have shed more light on the humanitarian situation and prognosis for the future. Although the humanitarian organisations working in the DPRK are trying to gather as much information as possible, the data available are far less than that normally required in justifying a humanitarian operation of the present magnitude. Nevertheless, there is a consensus within the international community that the humanitarian situation in the DPRK warrants significant assistance - both relief aimed at preventing a famine situation and longer-term assistance aimed at promoting self-reliance. - As food security and health are inter-linked, it is essential that programmes in both these sectors continue to be addressed in a complementary manner. - Access remains vital to accurate assessment, monitoring and impact analysis. - Coordination at both national and local levels are equally important and needs to be further developed. - Although great strides forward have been made in building confidence with the Government since 1995 (and the quality of information improved with the completion of the food supply and crop assessment mission, nutrition and multiple indicator surveys), the data on which basis informed decisions can be made by the international community continues to be incomplete. There is a need for deeper engagement at the technical levels, including data-gathering and analysis. More information on the situation of adults is needed. There are significant limitations in monitoring which lead to imprecise conclusions. - Given the special circumstances in the DPRK, the UN, NGO and donor community have established a set of agreed upon humanitarian principles that they are committed to support in order to achieve a better understanding of the humanitarian situation and accountability for the assistance provided. HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT Political, Economic, Security and Constraints Analysis The Government of DPRK remains committed to continue its policy of self-reliance (Juche) and maintain a socialist approach to political, security and economic policies. DPRK has a limited number of trading partners and is not in a position to access international financial institutions. The present state of the economy reflects a growing need to upgrade infrastructural requirements, particularly in the industrial and agricultural sectors; continuing energy and fuel shortages; limited ability to import food and other essentials; and deterioration of public health systems. The latest figures from UNDP indicate that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has dropped by almost half in four years, i.e. from US$ 20.8bn in 1992 to US$ 10.6bn in 1996. A concomitant growth in population reduced income per capita from US$ 1,005 in 1992 to US$ 481, reflecting a sharp economic drop which has serious implications for the humanitarian context. The above conditions act as constraining factors. Thus, the absence of a peace accord has led to special security circumstances resulting in restrictions on access to certain parts of the country. This influences donor response and interest in engaging in DPRK over the long-term. While certain donors are prepared to provide relief/rehabilitation but not development assistance, others are prepared to provide rehabilitation and not relief assistance. Additionally, these constraints have critical implications for adequate access to assess, monitor and conduct impact analysis and improve the level of information and data on the humanitarian situation in DPRK. Likewise, security and operational constraints impair transportation and communications for the majority of aid workers which in turn can affect the health and safety of personnel. Problem Analysis, Response and Prospects The decline of industrial and agricultural output and successive natural disasters over the past several years, have exacerbated severe food shortages and further complicated the economic problems in DPRK. This has led to large-scale food import and agricultural input requirements, health inputs and technical support. Whereas, DPRK plans to be food self-sufficient in the year 2001, in the interim, the Government will continue to rely on aid and commercial imports. In response to this situation, humanitarian assistance in the food and public health sectors is required, including a combination of emergency and rehabilitation assistance and capacity-building inputs together with disaster prevention and mitigation. Nutrition survey: (See Annex II for full details) A joint Government/UNICEF/WFP/ECHO Nutrition Survey was carried out during September and October 1998. The Survey was designed to assess the nutritional status of a representative sample of children from six months to under seven years and reveals that the nutritional status of children in the DPRK is still critical. On the basis of the findings, the following conclusions and recommendations are presented: - Rates of current malnutrition (wasting), both moderate and severe, suggest that the children of the DPRK continue to suffer from food shortage. Those who are severely malnourished should go under a therapeutic feeding programme. Those who are moderately malnourished should go under supplementary feeding programmes. - Intervention programmes have to focus on the most vulnerable groups of young children. Male children in the second and third year of life are at higher risk. Distribution systems have to ensure benefit to those in greatest need. - The high rate of oedema, seen at community level, indicates the presence of severe protein-energy malnutrition. Those children have to be identified for hospitalisation and therapeutic treatment. - Factors contributing to malnutrition, other than food deficits, should be studied. And accordingly, intervention programmes could be applied. - Continuous assessment for nutritional status is essential, especially to evaluate the implemented nutritional programmes. COMMON HUMANITARIAN ACTION PLAN The Objective of the Common Humanitarian Action Plan (CHAP) The objective of the Common Humanitarian Action Plan (CHAP) is to establish a clear overall strategy and direction for the humanitarian programme, to build a common sense of purpose among the main humanitarian and development actors thereby facilitating coordination, to assist in the process of prioritisation, and to learn from effective resource mobilisation and implementation, including impact assessment, of humanitarian activities in DPRK. Possible Scenarios In order to demonstrate effective programming, the humanitarian community has agreed to pursue a strategy that ensures systematic monitoring against particular activities. In that context, 'access' and 'mobility' of international aid workers are considered as critical factors in measuring the success of the CHAP. One scenario indicates gradual improvement in access both in terms of quality of access and the mobility of international staff in the field. Another scenario is one that indicates a deterioration of mobility and access. This would have negative implications for the nature of future programming and resource mobilisation. The CHAP assumes that access will improve and includes as one of its short-term goals the implementation of humanitarian principles that include, inter alia, access for assessment, monitoring and evaluation. If, on the other hand, the first scenario prevails, and access deteriorates or does not improve, then the CHAP will be modified accordingly. Current Competencies The main sectors covered by this Appeal are food security, public health and coordination. WFP, FAO, UNICEF, UNDP, NGOs, bilateral donors and Government are involved in the food security sector, while UNICEF, WHO, IFRC, NGOs, bilateral donors and Government are involved in the health sector. The Government (Flood Damage Rehabilitation Committee - FDRC, National Coordinating Committee - NCC) and OCHA are responsible for ensuring coordination. Needed Competencies These include: - Improved facilities for health, safety and communications for international personnel; - Coordination of and linkages during the implementation phase between Agricultural Recovery and Environmental Protection (AREP) and the Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP); - Strengthening the institutional capacity of national and local implementing partners; - Development and enhancing collaborative arrangements among UN, IFRC and NGO partners, e.g. through joint programming of UN activities, sharing of information, increased use of NGOs as implementing partners by the UN. Statement of Humanitarian Principles In order to ensure the successful implementation of the common humanitarian action plan, the organisations participating in this Appeal will support the following principles: 1. Knowledge about the overall humanitarian situation in the country according to assessed needs; 2. Assurance that humanitarian assistance reaches sectors of the population in greatest need; 3. Access for assessment, monitoring and evaluation; 4. Distribution of assistance only to areas where access is granted; 5. Protection of the humanitarian interests of the population; 6. Support to local capacity-building; 7. Beneficiary participation in programme planning and implementation; 8. Adequate capacity in terms of international staff; 9. Meet the health and safety needs of the international humanitarian organisations. Efforts will be made to ensure these humanitarian principles are respected by all agencies assisting DPRK. Long-Term Goals Improved capacity of DPRK to provide its population with adequate food and health services: - through a combination of food aid and agricultural rehabilitation; - through health inputs including the supply of essential drugs, while strengthening the capacity of health institutions and provision of basic equipment where appropriate. Adequate local capacity for emergency preparedness and response: - through workshops and seminars organised by the UN and IFRC to improve management and establish a trained manpower network at the local level within the DPRK Red Cross and provide for early warning systems; - through stockpiling of in-country emergency stocks in strategic areas and improved transportation capacity to strengthen the overall emergency response capacity. Reduced dependence on international aid: - improvement in the overall food and health situation will strengthen and restore agricultural productivity and thereby alleviate the need for increased volumes of food aid. Short-Term Goals Lives saved and human suffering alleviated: - provision of food aid to vulnerable groups; - support to health services; - health training; - provision of water supply and sanitation. Agricultural rehabilitation: - increased food production by supporting innovations such as seed production and intensification of cereal production; - upland cultivation; - double-cropping; - rehabilitation of embankments, dykes and irrigation systems. National capacity-building in the areas of nutritional and agricultural rehabilitation, as well as public health for disease prevention: - workshops/seminars held with national counterparts; - training held at provincial level for national counterparts; - appropriate measures taken to ensure emergency preparedness needs are met within the international humanitarian community by raising awareness of issues through training. Phase-out of emergency assistance to rehabilitation assistance programmes: - ensure that emergency needs are no longer required; - promote better understanding of long-term needs among national partners; - prepare donors for shift from relief to rehabilitation and development. Sustained commitment to humanitarian principles: - sustained implementation of the humanitarian action plan; - ensure all partners are committed to upholding the humanitarian principles; - monitor how effectively the humanitarian principles are respected by all partners, including Government; - ensure the effectiveness of operational objectives developed to measure the humanitarian action plan. Sectors to be Addressed and Operational Objectives by Sector FOOD SECURITY In view of the country's need to increase urgently the food availability for 1999, this section of the Appeal focuses on food aid, as well as emergency assistance to selected agricultural sectors in order to increase cereal and other food crop production in 1999. Programme food aid: to meet an uncovered cereal import gap identified by the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission of 1.05 million MTs, donors are encouraged to provide programme food aid of 574,000 MTs through bilateral contributions, in addition to targeted project food aid of 180,790 MTs through this Consolidated Appeal. Operational Objective: Relief food aid to vulnerable groups (WFP/FALU NGOs): - WFP will continue to provide full rations to children aged six months to six years in nurseries and kindergartens, to hospitals at the central, provincial and county levels, to pregnant and nursing women, and supplementary school snacks to school children aged seven to ten years in primary schools. - WFP will coordinate allocations and coverage with other programmes, including NGOs providing assistance using the FALU coordination mechanism. Operational Objective: Food for Work for rehabilitation of the agricultural sector (WFP/FAO/UNDP/IFAD) WFP will continue to invest in the agricultural sector with food to support labour inputs. WFP will work collaboratively with FAO technical assistance, with UNDP AREP initiatives and with IFAD endeavours. These programmes will support various Government efforts to rehabilitate damage from floods, construct productive assets such as irrigation structures to increase agricultural potential, support environmental restoration and protection initiatives such as forestry, agro-forestry, check dams and bunds and support other innovative local initiatives for increasing agricultural diversity and resilience. Operational Objective: Nutritional rehabilitation of severely malnourished children (WFP/UNICEF/NGOs) WFP will continue to provide food to prevent severe malnutrition among children and to support nutritional rehabilitation of those who become severely malnourished. UNICEF will continue to provide related materials such as growth monitoring equipment, cooking and feeding utensils. Local production of blended foods will be enhanced through a dedicated blended food factory provided by WFP, with WFP providing required basic foods and UNICEF providing required micro-nutrients. A number of agencies, including NGOs, are involved in the provision of therapeutic feeding and supplementary nutrition in specialised institutions including paediatric/county hospitals, nurseries and kindergartens. In the past, Medicins du (MDM) and Medicins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) together with UNICEF were lead agencies in providing therapeutic feeding for malnourished children. With their departure in the fall of 1998, UNICEF, WFP and certain NGOs (Cooperazione e Sviluppo - CESVI and Action Contre La Faim -ACF) are presently undertaking this activity and will continued to do so during 1999 - within a limited geographic focus. Operational Objective: Increased food production, double-cropping, rural credit, recovery/protection of agricultural land (FAO/WFP/UNDP) Given the county's limited agricultural land and short growing season, increase in food production can only be obtained through the intensification of agricultural production. Arable land is limited to 15 percent of the total land area and the growing season is relatively short. The emphasis on food grain production, particularly after the 1995-96 floods coupled with the worst drought experienced in decades, in 1997, led to extensive maize cultivation on relatively steep hills increasing flooding risks in the future. While weather conditions had been favourable until the middle of 1998 and spring temperatures milder than usual, floods hit several cropping areas during the summer of 1998, further crippling the agriculture sector and its ability to adequately support the population*s food requirements. As stated earlier, several years of economic stagnation have led to reduced agricultural productivity and thereby food availability. Sufficient amounts of essential inputs such as energy, seed, pesticides and fertiliser can no longer be supplied to service intensive agricultural production, while low foreign reserves inhibit food imports. Consequently, the country relies heavily on international food assistance. To enhance food security, it is equally important that support be given to short and medium-term measures to promote agricultural recovery. The double-cropping programme constitutes an important element of the Government's strategy for diversification of crops and agricultural recovery which will need continued international support for the next two years. The Government's double-cropping initiative will continue to be supported with seed, fertilisers and related inputs such as plastic and technical assistance. As other exploratory, innovative and promising initiatives for increased local production emerge, these will be supported with FFW and technical assistance. The FAO/WFP/UNDP appeal for double-cropping and crop diversification for the spring/summer crops 1999, has already been launched in view of the need for inputs to be in-country by February 1999 at the latest. This programme would increase agricultural production by by 247,000 MTs of cereals in 1999, plus additional supply of pulses and vegetables. In addition, an expansion of the Double-Cropping Programme is planned through the Autumn/Winter Double-Cropping Programme 1999 whereby winter wheat production will further increase the food supply by mid-2000. This programme evolves into the agricultural diversification and intensification programme in the framework of the AREP strategy. Based upon the experience gained through the IFAD loan from crop production, UNDP are appealing for funding for agricultural inputs in 1999 through rural credit to ten selected provinces, which would enable 3.5 MTs per hectare of maize and rice. HEALTH Public Health Issues DPR Korea had one of the highest standards and achievements in health care and health indicators amongst developing nations. In addition to a solid base of scientific knowledge, there is a legacy of community participation in health care provision, based on sound traditional medicine practices. However, the calamities and economic difficulties in recent years have seriously threatened these achievements. Due to unavailability of health information, though it is difficult to appreciate the exact health situation in the country, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and international agencies report increases in communicable diseases such as diarrhoea and dysentery, acute respiratory infections, tuberculosis and vaccine-preventable diseases. In addition, the prevalence of increase in malnutrition and concomitant diseases particularly among vulnerable groups like women and children is ongoing concern. Limitation of existing health delivery system In recent years, serious shortage of essential drugs and equipment, frequent power cuts and communication problems all have had adverse effects on health infrastructure. Most of the health institutions have sufficient manpower. However, most of the medical equipment are old and outdated and need replacement along with appropriate training. Operational Objectives Health concerns are addressed at two levels: provision of medical supplies/supply of equipment and technical support to contain the threat of re-emerging diseases. UNICEF has a particular focus on improving the health care for women and children in DPRK. As such, the programme strategy is to ensure adequate supplies and equipment and capacity-building for service delivery for the health of women and children, emphasising five components: - Essential drugs; - Immunisation; - Acute Respiratory Infection / Control of Diarrhoeal diseases; - Safe Motherhood; and - Community-based first-aid (CBFA). The technical support is provided primarily through WHO, which also provides medical supplies and equipment for specialised diseases such as TB and malaria. Secondly, WHO, which works in close collaboration with the MoPH and UNICEF, has prepared a plan of action to control and prevent communicable diseases. The Plan of Action consists of the national policy and strategy, improvement in the national capacity in disease surveillance, proper reporting/notification of communicable diseases, establishment/development of early warning systems, enhancement of capacity of public health laboratories and improved management of communicable diseases of high priority given by the Government of DPRK like malaria, integrated management of childhood diseases, TB prevention and control, Japanese encephalitis control, meningococcal disease control, epidemic diarrhoeal diseases and relevant zoonotic diseases. The UNICEF and WHO jointly work on vaccine preventable diseases and immunisation campaigns (polio). Operational areas of responsibility: - Emergency assistance/rehabilitation; provision of essential drugs is undertaken by UNICEF, IFRC, Capanumur. - WHO and UNICEF jointly undertake expanded programme of Immunisation (EPI). - Mother and child health and rehabilitation of health institutions is the responsibility of UNICEF, WHO, IFRC and Capanumur. - Control of diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections is the joint responsibility of UNICEF, WHO and IFRC. - UNICEF, IFRC and Oxfam address water and environmental sanitation. - Health education in hospitals is addressed by UNICEF, WHO, IFRC, Capanumur and CESVI. - Addressing problem of re-emerging diseases e.g. TB, Polio and other water-borne diseases, etc., is mainly the responsibility of WHO. EDUCATION Access to formal education is ensured, by law, for children from kindergarten through secondary level. This includes all children between 5 and 16 years of age. The country had achieved high standards in education, that could be compared with those of developed nations. However, recent and continuing natural calamities have seriously affected the capacity of the nation to provide basic school supplies, production of textbooks, access to schooling, etc. DPRK has extended its primary and, to a lesser degree, its secondary education to branch schools in remote mountain and coastal island areas. A total of 65,600 students attend the 1,600 branch schools at primary level and 1,800 attend 26 schools at the secondary level. UNICEF's education programme aims to: (i) support children and adolescents in accessible boarding schools with essential health care, education, stimulation and a sound environment through provision of basic materials; (ii) secure primary education in selected branch schools in remote and disaster affected areas through provision of basic educational materials; and, (iii) secure printing of textbooks for primary school children in boarding schools and branch schools. The programme will consist of three projects: (i) Support to 14 Children's Centres ; (ii) Support for 200 Branch Schools; (iii) Provision of paper for printing of textbooks. CAPACITY-BUILDING Following the decision of the Crisis Committee in March 1998, UNDP is presently preparing the Disaster Management Training Programme (DMTP), in cooperation with IFRC and FAO. DMTP will: 1) facilitate an effective and comprehensive framework for national disaster data bases and information systems; 2) provide and review the disaster response operations in the country and based on this review, design tools, techniques and develop a methodology, indicating the sources of principle data and information systems and 3) set up a pilot project in the country. The IFRC has together with the DPRK Red Cross outlined a three-year Disaster Preparedness (DP) project aimed at establishing a comprehensive Emergency Response capacity within the DPRK Red Cross, coordinated with the national emergency functions. The Red Cross project consists of the following components: a two-year-DP training programme; construction of a National DP Centre, including training facilities and a warehouse in Pyongyang; establishment of seven regional warehouses for stockpiling of emergency stocks; establishment of a vehicle fleet for DP operations and creation of emergency funds for immediate use in disaster situations. The DP Project has been given high priority for the capacity-building of the DPRK Red Cross. Food-for-Work (FFW) WFP will work in ways that enhance national capacities. In both the vulnerable group feeding and the FFW programmes, there will be continued attempts to hold joint planning, training, and evaluation missions and workshops. WFP will continue to seek engagement at the working level from the various line ministries, which could lead to national institutions taking increasing responsibility for planning, managing, and reporting on the various programmes. Efforts will be made to build on existing systems of DPRK record-keeping, management, and reporting, with WFP seeking to enhance current systems and capabilities. WFP will continue to cooperate with NGOs, both those who choose to work through FALU and those who establish operational offices in the DPRK; this will enhance DPRK exposure and experience with the diversity of NGO approaches and orientations. Training Through Workshops All agencies will continue to promote workshops and training both inside and outside the country. In particular, emphasis will be placed on joint government/agency seminars to strengthen collaborative activities with the Government in particular sectors. Agriculture The Double-Cropping and Crop Diversification Programme for the spring and autumn season will contribute to local capacity-building through the provision of technical assistance to organisations involved in the programme and training of counterpart staff. Health WHO has been assigned the responsibilities of providing required support for problems of preparedness and response to epidemics and important communicable diseases such as TB. This includes strengthening of the existing capacity of health delivery system in terms of technical support, as well as required medical supplies and equipment. As part of the strategy, and with WHO technical support, the National Experts in the MoPH have prepared a plan of action and orientation/training programmes to control and prevent communicable diseases. The Plan of Action consists of improvement in the national capacity in disease surveillance: proper reporting/notification of communicable diseases; establishment/ development of early warning systems; enhancement of capacity of public health laboratories and improved management of communicable diseases of high priority given by the Government of DPRK. As the part of replacement of health delivery tools, WHO is engaged in strengthening of the laboratories at ri and county levels which includes supplies of reagents and chemicals, anti-tuberculosis and anti-malarial drugs and vaccines and equipment for immunisation to eradicate polio by year 2000. COORDINATION The UN Humanitarian Coordinator (HC), currently also the WFP Representative, coordinates all humanitarian assistance provided through the UN system and in addition, ensures coordination with assistance provided through NGOs and bilateral donors. Close collaboration exists between OCHA, UN Agencies and NGOs through participation in coordination meetings which include a weekly Inter-Agency Meeting headed by the HC attended by all UN Agencies, bilateral donors, FALU and resident NGOs. Sectoral coordination is achieved through bi-weekly sectoral meetings in food aid, health and agriculture, monthly meetings between the HC and resident NGOs to address issues specific to NGOs. Monthly Updates, Special Quarterly Bulletins and maps charting humanitarian agency presence in DPRK are issued to update the humanitarian community on agency activities and other developments occurring in DPRK. The Consolidated Appeal Process this year included the involvement of UN Agencies, NGO partners, Government and donors, to ensure a coordinated approach. This group jointly agreed to a set of humanitarian principles, which have been set out above, and a common humanitarian action plan (CHAP). The HC will establish benchmarks to monitor the progress of the CHAP and adherence to the humanitarian principles. Support and collaboration with the international NGO community has also been achieved through the OCHA/SIDA bridge funding mechanism whereby NGOs are assisted to meet immediate needs for ongoing or new projects that are in the pipeline to receive larger amounts of funding. Strengthening relations with the DPRK Government has included their participation in workshops such as the CAP Workshop, a FFW Workshop and a WFP/FDRC (Flood Damage Rehabilitation Committee) Retreat. In addition, in collaboration with Government, the HC led a Flood Damage Assessment team to flood-affected areas and prepared a joint agency report on their findings. Operational Objectives: - Further improvement of coordination within the UN system, implementation of humanitarian principles, establishment of benchmarks, monitoring of strategy and achievements; - Enhance relationship with Government; - Establish procedures to ensure health and safety of humanitarian personnel; - Strengthen OCHA capacity to facilitate coordination (including UN, NGO and donor liaison, development of CHAP monitoring system, information sharing and impact assessment); - Enhance relationship/coordination with NGOs, increased use of NGOs as implementing partners, implementation of humanitarian principles; - Strengthen the Food Aid Liaison Unit (FALU). Criteria for Prioritisation The criteria for the selection of projects and programmes reflected in the Consolidated Appeal are as follows: - Life-saving activities for those at greatest risk; - Directly related to sector-based objectives (e.g. food security, health, etc.); - Achievable targets during the appeal period; - High probability of sustainability (natural resources, acceptance/access of international presence in DPRK); - Competencies and capacities that allow for successful implementation of the programmes; - Complementarity with other related activities outside the Common Humanitarian Action Plan; - Ability to monitor delivery and impact of assistance; - Proximity to beneficiaries with minimum of intermediaries. Relationship with Other Assistance Programmes CAP/AREP: The Consolidated Appeal (CA) covers a one year period and is focused on meeting the immediate requirements for emergency, as well as initiating agricultural rehabilitation. However, longer-term solutions are needed to improve the nutritional level in DPRK. UNDP has formulated the AREP programme covering a period of three years. This programme focuses on longer-term requirements and comprises a number of projects related to food security and the environment. Given the absorptive capacity within the country and the potential for restoring agricultural productivity, the need for increasing volumes of food aid will be reduced. Cost-effectiveness and sustainability are added advantages of interventions in the agricultural sector and the environment with cooperative farm involvement to ensure full beneficiary participation in planning and management and strengthening rural institutions. However, food aid will still be required, primarily for FFW reforestation and environmental protection activities. These mutually supporting inter-agency initiatives are an integral part of the sustained and coordinated effort to establish food security while at the same time addressing the persistent short-term humanitarian needs. Thus, the humanitarian programme will continue at the same time as agricultural recovery programmes are implemented. Given that certain activities aimed at agricultural recovery need to be implemented as an immediate basis in order to meet food aid requirements in 1999, i.e. double-cropping/fertiliser package, these will be reflected both in the CA and the AREP. The reason that these requirements also appear in the AREP is that they are expected to continue beyond the Appeal period. Contributions made towards such activities under the CA will be deducted from the shortfall in the AREP. There will be close consultation among participating organisations to ensure coordination and complementarity. The main objectives of the AREP are: - restoring food grain production to 6.2 million MTs by the year 2001; and - strengthening a framework of sustainable food production. The objectives of the AREP plan are to be achieved through five programmes in the agricultural sector: - Rehabilitation and modernisation of the productive capacity; - Enhancing appropriate land used and crop diversification; - Strengthening rural institutions; - Increasing sideline production and farmer income; - Promoting a more sustainable use of natural resources. There are two implementation phases: Phase 1 - immediate assistance for the 1998-99 agricultural year: The immediate inputs aim at increasing cereal production by some 30 percent, i.e. to 4.8 million tons and increasing food supply through crop intensification and diversification. In addition, there is an urgent need for infrastructure rehabilitation and capacity-building to improve local production capacities. Phase 2 - Agricultural rehabilitation and development during 1998-2000: During this phase, medium-term agricultural investment projects are to be identified on the basis of ecological, social and financial conditions for sustained development in DPRK. Description of Relationship With Other Players in the DPRK: Multilateral contributions to DPRK include UN Agencies (UNDP/FAO/IFAD, UNICEF, WHO, WFP). Information about humanitarian inputs are shared among the various agencies, particularly in sectors such as agricultural rehabilitation (UNDP/FAO/WFP), food aid (WFP) and health (WHO/UNICEF). Bilateral contributions of food aid to DPRK channelled outside regular multilateral institutions (e.g. WFP) include countries such as China, Republic of Korea, Russia, Poland, Syria, Pakistan, Poland, Mongolia, Hungary and Switzerland. NGO contributions in food aid and other items (medicines, clothing, fuel, technical support etc.) to DPRK include all resident NGOs who participate in the weekly inter-agency coordination meetings and sub-group meetings. Non-resident NGOs largely contribute through the FALU. Steps will be taken to strengthen information gathering and tracking, particularly of health inputs, of non-resident NGO contributions. Donors are advised to channel funds directly to those NGOs appealing for funds through this Appeal. Commercial data on contributions to DPRK is difficult to assess. Information is regularly sought from the DPRK authorities and neighbouring countries regarding commercial imports. Two notable suppliers based in South Korea are Hyundai and Nestle Corporation. Data on trade with China is updated regularly. Contact with Resident and Non-resident Foreign Missions (donors) is maintained on a regular basis. Donors attend the weekly inter-agency meeting and are called upon to assist with issues related to humanitarian activities when required. In addition, the UN-HC maintains regular contact with donors based in Beijing, China. Indicators for Assessing Sectoral Objectives In order to assist with making the Common Humanitarian Action Plan operational indicators have been developed to monitor and assess progress on the CHAP. Input, output and impact indicators have been identified for each sector and are tracked and reported on during the process of implementation. | | SERIAL | | SECTOR | | INPUT | | OUTPUT | | IMPACT | | 1 |Food Security|| | \"Quantity resourced \"Agriculture inputs | | | | \"Nutritional status \"Assets created \"Health/vitality \"Increased food availability \"Improved preparedness, prevention and mitigation | | 2 |Health|| | \"Therapeutic feeding \"Drugs & equipment \"Training \"Treatment | | #patients treated # disease outbreaks # trained personnel # clean H2O | | \"Health related data \"Control of epidemics | | 3 |Capacity- building|| | \"Training \"Early warning system | | #trained early warning | | \"Increased innovation \"Improved preparedness and mitigation | | 4 |Coordination|| | \"Sector coordination meetings \"Information \"Liaison | | \"CHAP monitoring \"Knowledge of humanitarian situation \"Impact assessment | | \"Duplication avoided and gaps filled \"Improved programming TABLE OF CONTENTS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PREVIOUS CAP IN REVIEW COMMON HUMANITARIAN ACTION PLAN - Food Security - Health - Education - Capacity-Building - Coordination PROJECT SUMMARIES - Food Security - Health - Capacity-Building - Coordination ANNEX I.
