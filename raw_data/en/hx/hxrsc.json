Health Sector Pe rformance 1. Bhutan's Constitution has a provision for free health services for all Bhutanese citizens : \"The State shall provide free access to basic public health services in both modern and traditional medicines.\"1 Comprehensive services are provided to citizens at different levels of care, including treatment abroad if the service is not available in the country. Health services in the country are provided through a three -tier structure: (i) regional and national referral hospitals at the tertiary level, (ii) district or general hospitals at the secondary level, and (iii) primary health care (PHC) centers , sub-posts , and outreach clinics which are off -shoots of PHCs supervised by Health Assistants with essential supplies at the primary level . Traditional and allopathic medicine services are fully integrated and delivered under one roof. At the grassroots level, village health workers play a key role in health promotion and act as a bridge between health services and the community.2 2. Bhutan recognizes health as a prerequisite for socioeconomic development, poverty reduction, and gross national happiness.3 The country has made significant investments to develop its health system from a low base and has achieved remarkable progress in key health outcomes during 1994 -2020 . Health indicators have vastly improved , from being among the poorest in the world to achieving most of t he Millennium Development Goals and good progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. From 1994 to 2020, the percentage of deliveries attended by skilled health personnel improved from 10.9% to 99.3%, and the maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births improved from 380 to 86 deaths (2012). The infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births dropped from 102 .0 in 1984 to 15.1 in 2017.4 This is m ainly beca use of the highly successful expanded immunization program implemented by the Government of Bhutan since its launch in 1979 , which continued even amid the coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic with routine immunization services to ensure the health of mothers and children across the country . Bhutan achieved immunization coverage ab ove 95 % in 2020 , on a par with the coverage it has sustained since 2010 .5 Life expectancy improved from 37 .0 years in 1960 to 70.2 years in 2017. Health care coverage is now extensive , with 87.7% of the population living within a 2-hour walk of the nearest health facility, which is a considerable feat given the challenges of dispersed populations and difficult terrain.6 Bhutan's health expenditure is predominantly financed by the government , and private out -of-pocket expenditure is relatively low, implying a fair level of equity and financial protection. The government spent 4 .0% of gross domestic product ( GDP ) on health expenditure in fiscal year FY2019 , which increased to 4.5% of GDP during FY2020.7 B. Health Se ctor Cha llenges 3. Systemic challenges. Despite impressive gains in key health outcomes in recent decades , Bhutan's health sector performance still needs improving. Critical attention must be 1Government of Bhutan. 2008. The Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan . Thimphu. Article 9, Section 21. 2S. Thinley et al . 2017.

Thimphu.2 given to the long -term sustainability of health care financing in the face of tightened public spending, increasing demands from the population , and the planned introduc tion of new technologies and services. Regional disparities in health outcomes persist , e.g., the under -five mortality rate per 1,000 live births: 40.8 in rural areas and 25.3 in urban areas ; and the service coverage varies across distric ts (footnote 4). The sector also needs to evolve to deal effectively with growing health security threats from pandemics such as the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic , emerging epidemiological and demographic changes, the increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) , and rapid urbanization caused Emerg ence of nonco mmunic able disease s. NCDs are emerging as a major challenge for the sector and a serious health concern for people beca use of sedentary lifestyles coupled with higher disposable income s among the urban population. Some 53% of all deaths in the country are due to NCD s.8 The prevalence of NCDs is attributed to modifiable risk factors such as the use o f tobacco, alcohol , an unhealthy diet (low fruit and vegetable intake) , and being physically inactive of the adult population .9 Among deaths caused by NCDs, cardiovascular diseases are responsible for most cases (28%), followed by cancer (9%), respiratory diseases (6%) , and diabetes (2%). The health system has limited capacity to provide advanced tertiary care, and refers cases requiring specialist care for diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, organ transplant , and cancer treatment complications to India. The number of referral cases and costs have increased significantly , from 529 patients and a cost of Nu81 million in FY2007 to 1,478 patients and Nu1 98.23 million in FY2017.10 The share of health sector current expenditure spent on NCDs increased from 34% in FY 2019 to 41% in FY 2020 (footnote 7) . 5. COVID -19 case trends and magnitude . The burden of the COVID-19 pand emic is severely affecting Bhutan's health sector and economy . Since the emergence of the COVID -19 pandemic at the end of 2019, confirmed cases have reached 59,497 with 21 deaths as of 8 May 2022 and are growing daily .11 The cases spiked 54 times from May 2021 to May 2022 , with the latest spike being the highest to date \u2014attributed to the BA.2 Omicron variant , which has been the most difficult to contain and the most potent , infect ing more people than the three previous outbreaks . 6. In the recent surge in COVID -19 cases, the 19-65 age group account ed for 77% of the cases. However, the most worrying aspect is that children aged under 12 were the next highest group affected by the virus , and the vaccination of children aged 5-11 years was only completed in mid-April 2022 . If the current surge continues unabated before the two-dose regimen of pediatric vaccine is completed , they will be the most exposed group to the virus. The completion of pediatric vaccination will allow the government to assess and adopt different strategies to manage the pandemic and avoid having to resort to strict lockdowns.12 7. Financing challenges and fiscal sustainability. The stringent preventive measures implemented to contain the pandemic have placed significant fiscal pressure on the government. Domestic revenue declined by 1 1.1% in FY2020 and 14.0% in FY2021 because of foregone 8 G. Sithey et al. 2021.

Economic growth in FY2019 was 5.8% , which contracted by 10.1% in 2020 and revived sl owly by 3.5% in 2021.14 8. Impact of COVID -19 on health sector expenditure and budget provisions . The COVID -19 pandemic has had a significant impact on health sector expenditure and budget provisions. Current health sector expenditure has increased by 23% with the onset of the pandemic in the FY2020. This increase was adjusted from the capital expenditure to remain within the total budget (Figure 1). Figure 1: Trends in Total Health Expenditure Source : Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Health . 202 1. National Health Accounts 2021 . Thimphu . 9. The health sector budget increased by 12% during FY2021 to combat the spread of COVID -19 (Figu re 2). Containment measures included develop ing the Druk Trace app to enable fast and easy contact tracing ; procur ing medicines, personal protective equipment , and medical equipment to last up to 6 months ; and improvin g the health infrastructur e. With the pandemic continuing, the health sector budget provision for FY2022 was increased by 43% to facilitate preparations to combat the pandemic in advance by procuring vaccines and vaccinating 94% of the eligible population with the Oxfo rd/AstraZeneca vaccine ; and to continue surveillance, early detection, control, prevention, response , and recovery from the outbreak. The budget also included a provision to procure a second dose of vaccines and to put in place effective containment measur es to mitigate the risk of community transmission.

In summary, despite the severe fiscal constraints caused by the pandemic since FY2020 , the government provides for more than 80% of health sector expenditure , with the balance 13 ADB. 2022 .

Impact of COVID -19 on the health system. The COVID -19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of Bhutan's health system in terms of its capacity for surveillance and diagnosis , service delivery , infection prevention and control , and health financing protection. For example, the long -lasting health service accessibility issue in hard -to-reach areas due to the lack of quality road infra structure worsened during the pandemic because of strict containment measures imposed across the country, which interrupted essential health care services such as prenatal, postnatal, and routine immunization services. Another critical gaps in the health care provision is the lack of tertiary and specialized care capacity , as patients need to be referred abroad for treatment. The incremental number of confirmed cases of COVID -19 patients from the ongoing Omicron infection wave has been overwhelm ing Bhutan's resource limited health system. Existing health human resource s constraint s have been worsened by the incremental workload of COVID -19 testing and treatment, which has interrupted the provision of routine health care services su ch as routine immunization ; maternal and child health se rvices ; and treatment of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, tuberculosis, and HIV. The accessibility of essential health care services to patients who live in districts demarcated as hig h-risk zones of COVID -19 local transmission has also been severely hindered by frequent lockdowns. The impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on health sector expenditure and budget provisions has also been significant. The health sector budget increased by 12% during FY2021 to combat the spread of COVID -19. Current health sector expenditure increased by 23% with the onset of the pandemic in FY2020 . C. Gover nment's Health Sector Strategy Toward COVID-19 12. COVID-19 response and surveillance . Bhutan reported its first positive COVID -19 case on 6 March 2020 \u2014a tourist who arrived in the country on 3 March 2020. The government immediately activated the National Preparedness and Response Plan for Outbreak of COVID -19 (NPRP), a comprehensive plan to enhance the health sector's capacity in surveillance, early detection, control and prevention, response, and recovery.15 In implement ing the NPRP, the government undertook stringent preventive and containment measures , includ ing prohibiting the arrival of foreign visitors to the country, clos ing the land borders, restricting public gatherings, closing schools and educational institutions, performing rigorous testing, and imposing a 21 -day mandatory quarantine for all incoming tra velers since March 2020. Several nationwide lockdown s have been imposed intermittently since August 2020 to prevent community transmission . The latest lockdown has been imposed in the capital city Thimphu and 14 other districts since 15 January 2022. 13. To facilitate effective surveillance and diagnosis to contain the spread of COVID -19, Bhutan has a national early warning alert and response surveillance system and a COVID -19 integrated influenza surveillance system established by the Royal Center for Diseas e Control . It also has 54 flu clinics and seven RT-PCR testing machines in five laboratories located in critical locations. The surveillance system was enhanced with the development of the Druk Trace app, Stay Home app, and the government COVID -19 portal . Testing facilities were initially inadequate , as samples had to be taken to one of the four regional RT -PCR testing laboratories and it took a long time to obtain the test results. Th is issue appears to have been resolv ed, as 15 Government of Bhutan. 2020. National Preparedness and Response Plan for Outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19). Thimphu. 5 the government establish ed additional RT -PCR testing laboratories with machines in January 2022 , but more such facilities may be required if the current rate and spike of infections continue. 14. Governance COVID-19 response and vaccination mecha nism. The governance mechanism to deal with COVID -19 has three tiers (Figure 3). At the national level, it comprises the national COVID -19 task force chaired by the Prime Minister, three regional COVID -19 task forces headed b y secretaries , and 20 district COVID -19 task forces head ed by the respective district administrators. The national COVID -19 task force is the overall national coordinating body for both the management and control of the pandemic situation and vaccination , advised by the National Technical Advisory Group (NIT AG). The NIT AG is an independent technical advisory committee for the Ministry of Health (MOH) to advi se on the immunization program ; it also advises the national COVID -19 task force on the technical aspects of COVID -19 and vaccines.

COVID-19 vaccine, procurement, and vaccination system. Bhutan depends on the COVID -19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX ) facility and bilateral donors for the supply of COVID -19 vaccines. The vaccines in use in Bhut an are AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer , and Sinopharm. India donated 550,000 doses of Covishield in March 2021 , with which all the eligible adult population received their first dose. For the second do se, the United States provided 500,000 doses of Moderna through COVAX. Denmark donated 250,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Other countries (e.g., Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, and Croatia ) donated additional doses of the AstraZeneca, Pfize r, and Sinopharm vaccines.

Additionally, the Unites States donated 500,000 doses Moderna and 95,940 doses of Pfizer to Bhutan. As of 9 May 2022, Bhutan has administered 1,90 7,509 doses of vaccines fully vaccinating all eligible adult population and also children in the age group of 5 -11 and 12 -17 years. 16. The COVID -19 vaccination system was launched using the well -developed structure of the immunization program , which has sustained high routine immunization coverage in the country . Building on this sound foundation, Bhutan has introduced several new vaccines in recent years , including the HPV vaccine in 2020, mumps in 2016, Pneumococcal vaccine in 2018 , and flu vaccination s for high-risk groups in 2019 and 2020 covering 13% and 65% of the population. With these experiences , Bhutan successfully rolled out the first and second doses of the COVID -19 vaccines in 2021 and planned booster doses for all the eligible population from 2022 onward .16 17. Regulatory pathway for COVID -19 vaccines. The Drug Regulatory Authority (DRA) of Bhutan developed Regulatory Preparedness Document for Deploy ment of COVID -19 Vaccines , outlining expedited regulatory pathway s, procedures, requirements , and turnaround time for the market authorization, importation , and lot release of COVI D-19 vaccines. The DRA has considered regulatory flexibility, reliance , and recognition mechanisms to enable rapid access to the vaccine . It has also id entifie d and prepared step-by-step pathways for regulatory preparedness: (i) marketing authorization, (ii) import authorization, (iii) lot release, and (iv) post - marketing surveillance for COVID -19 vaccines . It takes about 11 working days from the assessment of application s for marketing authorization to the lot release of vaccines. 18. National Vaccina tion Deployment Pl an and vaccination status. The latest version of the National COVID -19 Vaccine Deployment Plan ( NVDP ), updated by the MOH in December 2021 , detail s the plan, programs , and actions for the deployment and vaccination of all the eligible adult population , as well as children under 12 years. The updated vaccination plan and strategy is based on the lessons learned in carrying out the routine immunization program , which was widely considered successful. Hence , the country was able to carry out the deployment and vaccina tion of the first and second doses of the COVID -19 vaccines in 2021 within 2 weeks. As of 8 May 2022, 90.0% of the total population ( 680,887 persons, including 91.3% of girls and women) have received the first two doses , and 72.3% of the total population (546,559 persons, including 74.0% of girls and women ) have received the first extra dose of the vaccine in addition to the original two -dose regimen .17 Since early March 2022, the COVID -19 vaccination program has been expanded to cover children aged 5 -11 years . It will be expanded to children aged under five once regulatory approval is granted. 19. Vaccine cold storage and delivery . Bhutan is u sing its vaccine cold chain delivery system , in place under its long -standing national immunization program , to store and deliver COVID -19 vaccines . The country's overall vaccine cold chain capacity has expanded significantly, from 92,000 liters in 2020 to 437,884 liters in 2021 , for quality vaccine storage at different temperature ranges with the support of Gavi , the Vaccine Alliance and the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ). The total cold storage capacity currently ava ilable at both the national and district levels is 281,938 liters at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, 47,819 liters at -15\u00b0C to -25\u00b0C, and 4,148 liters at -70\u00b0C. The Royal Centre for Disease Control has also been equipped with a -20\u00b0C walk -in freezer with a 20,000 -liter capacity. The expanded vaccine cold chain capacity is fully capable of storing vaccines r equiring ultra -cold chain storage temperature s in phases 16 Government of Bhutan, MOH . National COVID -19 Vaccine Deployment Government of Bhuta n, MOH . Bhutan Vaccine System (accessed 8 May 2022). 7 following the vaccination schedule indicated in the government's vaccination program for 2022 - 2024. Upon reach ing Paro International A irport , COVID -19 vaccines are transported using refrigerated vans to the central expanded immunization program c old store in Thimphu. From Thimphu, vaccines are distributed to the central, western, and eastern expanded immuniza tion program cold stores using refrigerated vans. The vaccines are then distributed via cold boxes and vaccine carriers to the vaccination sites. Vaccines requiring ultra -cold chain storage temperature s will be kept at -70\u00b0C upon arrival in Bhutan until being transported from regional stores via refrigerated vans (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) to primary health care centers and vaccination sites to avoid wastage in the last mile . Royal Bhutan H elicopter Services is supporting the deliver y of vaccines requiring ultra-cold chain storage temperature s to all strategic locations and hard -to- reach areas across the country . 20. cine ation. The NVDP 2021 provides comprehensive guidance on communication about COVID -19 vaccines ; the associated risks ; messages to be delivered and actions to be taken before, during , and after vaccination ; management of adverse event s following immunization (AEFI) cases ; and injection safety.

The MOH has a national guideline on infection control and medical waste management that deals with vaccine -related medical waste. It defines and refers to the medical waste, in general, as \"all categories of waste generated from health facilities, clinics, animal husbandries, veterinary hospitals , and other clinical laboratories , and home -based treatment of patients .\" Specifically, the guideline states that \"vaccines should 8 be treated as infectious waste and disposed accordingly. \"18 The guideline a lso provide s adequately for the management, recording, reporting, monitoring and supervision of infection control , and medical waste management for infection control. As vaccines relate to pharmaceutical and infectious waste, the guideline underline s the p rocess of segregation, collection, transportation , and safe disposal to prevent leaks and contamination. 22. Remaining gaps . The latest COVID -19 vaccine introduction readiness assessment ,19 conducted in December 2021 (Table 1), indicated that Bhutan's readiness to implement its national COVID -19 vaccination program is high. This can mainly be attributed to the country's impressive and efficient COVID -19 vaccine rollout in 2021 . The major remaining gap identified is resource constraints to finan ce an adequate quantity of vaccines for fully vaccinating the newly eligible age cohorts and administering additional doses of vaccin es to the entire eligible population to sustain Bhutan's herd immunity . D. ADB Sec tor Expe rience and Assistance Prog rams 23. The Asian Development Bank ( ADB) has extensive experience in support ing Bhutan 's health sector , along with other development partners such as Danida, the Government of India, the World Bank, and United Nations agencies. Through the ongoing Health Sector Development Program,20 ADB has improved and strengthened the sustainability of the fund with a $10 million capital grant ; and the proceeds of the fund fully met the cost of the normal vaccine and essential drug requirement s before the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020. 24. With the outbreak of COVID -19 in the country, ADB has committed $1.17 million to Bhutan for the procurement of medical supplies and personal protective equipment , under regional technical assistance21 to manage the pandemic and potential outbreaks of other communicable diseases. This was complemented by a $20 million budget support loan , through the COVID -19 Pandemic Response Option , to help the government implement the economic contingenc y plan, and an Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund grant totaling $2 million was approved on 16 July 2020 and committed on 22 July 2020 to enhance the government's capacity to meet ongoing lifesaving needs and to upscale the emergency response to anticipat e additional requirements as the pandemic evolves.22 ADB is also expediting medical supply procurement packages totaling $400,000 to strengthen the capacity for the COVID -19 response under the ongoing Health Sector Development Program.23 25. The implementat ion of the COVID -19 response programs, grants , and technical assistance is ongoing . Additionally, subprogram s 2 and 3 of the Financial Market Development Project (policy -based loan)24 in 2020 and 2021 ensure reforms that promote a sustainable 18 Government of Bhutan, MOH. 2014.

The COVID -19 Pandemic Response Option policy -based loan achieved three of the four design and monitoring framework indicators. Likewise, the implementation of the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund grant has been completed and liquidat ed. ADB aims to continue to deliver COVID -19 support in a timely manner. Potential delays in project processi ng beca use of the lockdown and movement restrictions were mitigated by adopting new ways of doing business , such as conducting virtual fact -finding missions. 26. The proposed project builds on the value and experience of ADB's previous support to Bhutan's he alth sector to meet the country's needs in manag ing the pandemic more successfully , in cooperation with other development partners. 10 Table 1: Summary of Vaccination Readiness Findings from the latest COVID -19 Vaccine Introduction Readiness Assessment Tool (VIRAT/VRAF 2.0 ) Assessment (completed in December 2021) Readiness Domain Readiness of Government Key Gaps to Address Before Deployment Planning and coordination Phase -wise vaccination of different population groups is proposed in approved NVDP .
