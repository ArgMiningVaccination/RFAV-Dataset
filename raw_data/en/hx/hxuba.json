They can cause various symptoms, including sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes. While many medications are available to help with [allergy symptoms](https://acaai.org/allergies/symptoms/), some people prefer to try natural remedies. In this article, we will explore whether natural treatments for allergy relief really work. We will cover allergies, common natural medications for allergy relief, and the scientific evidence supporting them. [Allergies](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/allergies-and-the-immune-system) occur when your body's natural defenses react to a foreign substance that is not harmful to the body. Examples of these substances are [pollen](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/pollen), dust, or certain [foods](https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/food/). When your immune system detects these substances, it releases histamine. [Histamine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557790/) causes the symptoms of an allergic reaction. Allergies can be triggered by a range of substances, including: Many people prefer natural medicine for allergies as it can have fewer side effects than medications. Additionally, natural remedies can be less expensive and more accessible for some individuals. People use many natural ways to cure allergies to help alleviate the symptoms. While not all holistic remedies for allergies work for everyone, some of the most popular options include the following: Local honey has been used for centuries for its medicinal properties. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6074882/) says that regular local honey consumption (high dose) can help reduce allergy symptoms as it may contain small amounts of pollen. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts. They are suitable for your health, especially your digestive system. Some [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8064452/) suggest that probiotics reduce the morbidity of individuals with allergy symptoms. Vitamin C has antioxidant properties that protect cells from damage. Intravenous vitamin C may help reduce allergy symptoms, as per [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6136002/) by the National Institute of Health. The study says that preclinical and clinical data show diminished oxidative stress and inflammation by vitamin C benefit patients with allergic diseases. Quercetin is a plant pigment in many foods, including apples, onions, and berries. [Researchers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6273625/) suggested that taking quercetin may help reduce allergy symptoms. Quercetin has high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Its anti-allergic mechanism of action via the inhibition of enzymes and inflammatory mediators makes it ideal for treating allergic reactions. Nettle Leaf is a natural antihistamine and anti-inflammatory herb (herbal allergy remedy). Some [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5963652/) have suggested that nettle leaves show positive results against allergies, as confirmed by the [sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-22)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3977600/). Butterbur is a plant used for centuries for its medicinal properties. Some [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC64514/#:~:text=Our%20randomised%2C%20double%20blind%20study,was%20well%20tolerated%20by%20patients.) have suggested that butterbur extracts help reduce allergy symptoms like hay fever. Researchers confirmed that butterbur has similar effects to cetirizine. Acupuncture for allergy is an ancient Chinese medical practice. It involves inserting needles into the skin at specific points on the body. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4479426/) say that acupuncture may help reduce allergic reactions due to cytokine profile regulation. Nasal rinsing involves flushing out the nasal passages with a saline solution. This can help reduce congestion and other allergy symptoms. It efficiently removes irritants and allergens from your nasal passages. Apple cider vinegar has been [suggested](https://nationaleczema.org/blog/get-the-facts-acv/#:~:text=Mix%20a%20solution%20with%201,for%203%20hours%20or%20overnight.) by medical experts to have many health benefits, including reducing allergy symptoms, especially for atopic dermatitis. Add one cup of warm water and one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and apply the solution to the affected area. Leave overnight for best results. Overall, natural remedies can be a helpful addition to allergy treatment for some individuals. Many people find they help reduce allergy symptoms. However, not all remedies work for everyone, and results may vary. If you are considering trying a natural remedy for allergy relief, talk to your doctor first to ensure it is safe.
