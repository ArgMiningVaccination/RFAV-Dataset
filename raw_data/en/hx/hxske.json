[Over half of the US population](https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/conditions/periodontal-disease.html) above 30 experiences some level of gum recession. It can also start as early as your teens. Thankfully, there are many easy remedies to reverse your receding gums naturally. Receding gums isn't something you should ignore. Don't wait until it becomes a [dental emergency](https://www.authoritydental.org/emergency-dentist/nearme). As soon notice its symptoms, schedule an appointment with your dentist. However, natural remedies can also help, especially if it's a mild case. You can also use them to keep the recession from worsening while you wait for your dental appointment. First, what are receding gums? What Are Receding Gums? Receding gums happen when the gum around the teeth pulls back below its margin or wears off. It is also called gingival recession and can expose more of the teeth and roots to bacteria and injury. Gum recession leaves gaps between the teeth and gums which bacteria can easily live in. It may be difficult to know whether you're experiencing a gum recession. This is because it happens gradually. However, tooth sensitivity is one of the first signs of gum recession. So, watch out for this symptom. How Can You Rebuild Your Gums Naturally? Gum recession is a slow process, but it's also a dangerous disease. It can lead to severe problems like tooth loss and periodontal disease. You can rebuild your receding gums with ingredients you already have at home. These remedies do not substitute for a dentist's appointment. But they can help you stop the symptoms and prevent the recession from getting worse. Here are 10 natural remedies to help you reverse or rebuild receding gums: 1. Oil Pulling Oil pulling is a popular age-long practice for removing plaques and other food particles from the mouth with natural oils. What's more, it's [an effective natural remedy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19336860/) for receding gums and gingivitis. To practice oil pulling, you'll need sesame oil or high-quality coconut oil. Simply swish a spoonful of oil in your mouth while pulling the oil between your teeth as well. Do this for 20 minutes and spit it out. Rinse your mouth with warm water or add some salt for an antibacterial effect. Finally, brush your teeth. 2. Salt Water Saltwater isn't just an easy-to-make natural oral rinse. It is antibacterial and can kill bacteria that cause receding gums. Saltwater can also [soothe painful and swollen gums](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159843). To make a saltwater rinse, mix 1 teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water. Rinse your mouth with this mixture for 30 seconds and spit it out - don't swallow it. Repeat this process 2 or 3 times daily to rebuild receding gums naturally. 3. Eucalyptus Oil According to [this study](https://aap.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1902/jop.2008.070622), eucalyptus oil can effectively treat receding gums and promotes tissue growth.

Ensure you use a toothbrush with soft or medium textured bristles. More importantly, brush gently. You don't want to contribute to wearing away your gum tissue by brushing aggressively. 5. Peppermint Essential Oil Peppermint essential doesn't just smell nice. It also [prevents microorganism growth](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4054083/) in your mouth that could cause serious damage like gum recession.

Don't add sugar or any other flavoring that bacteria can feed on. Doing this can defeat the antibacterial property of green tea and worsen receding gums. 7. Flossing Regularly Flossing removes plaques containing harmful bacteria from tough-to-reach places your toothbrush can't get to. These bacteria can cause receding gums and other dental problems. Flossing at least twice daily is the easiest way to keep gum recession at bay. 8. Hydrogen Peroxide Hydrogen peroxide isn't just great for first aid.

Aloe Vera Aloe vera is one of the most effective natural remedies for any inflammation. In the case of receding gums, [injecting medicinal aloe vera gel](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3200013/) into gum inflammation can help improve your gum tissue. However, only a trained dental professional should perform this if this method is truly their recommendation. 10. Septilin [Septilin](https://www.ayurtimes.com/septilin-tablets-syrup-benefits-uses-dosage-side-effects/) is a herbal mixture consisting of licorice, guggul, and guduchi. So, it's rich in natural substances that are great for fighting gum recession-causing bacteria. It comes in both tablets and syrups. To use it as a gum recession remedy, adults can take two tablets twice a day or two spoonfuls of syrup three times a day. 11. Turmeric Gel Turmeric gel contains antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This makes it an excellent [treatment for gingivitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4668736/). Since gum recession starts with gingivitis, turmeric gel is an effective way to stop it from happening at all. 12. Tea Tree Oil This [2013 article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4054083/) links tea tree essential oil to reducing harmful bacteria growth in the mouth. By stopping bacteria from wreaking havoc on your gums, you can stop gum recession too. This makes tea tree oil a natural remedy for receding gums. 13. Omega-3 Fatty Acids You can use omega-3 fatty acids to heal or prevent receding gums naturally in two ways: - Eating food that contains omega-3 fatty acids like certain fish, seeds, and nuts - Taking omega-3 supplements Also, a [clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945394/) shows that taking 300 milligrams of omega-3 fatty acids for 12 weeks reduces gum swelling and helps receding gums heal naturally. 14. Thyme Essential Oil Like other essential oils mentioned before, [thyme oil](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/blog/spotlight-thyme-oil) has similar benefits. It's a great home remedy to reverse receding gums naturally. 15.

This makes it an effective natural remedy against gum recession-causing bacteria. Be careful not to use it too often. Its acidic properties can harm your enamel. So, it's best to use it once a week - and not every day. Surgical Solutions to Reverse Receding Gums The most effective way to stop receding gums and regenerate gum tissue happens at a dentist's. If your gum recession is severe, the natural remedies above will not suffice. You'll have to see a dentist immediately. Your dentist may recommend one of the following procedures to treat your receding gums and restore them: Flap Surgery Flap surgery is a deep tissue cleaning of the gums. During this procedure, the dentist lifts your gums up and cleans out the gum recession-causing bacteria from underneath them. Then, they place it back on your teeth. After flap surgery, your gum line may appear even shorter than before because it fits more closely to your teeth. Tissue Graft In severe cases, a gum tissue graft may be the best remedy for gum recession. In this oral surgery, the dentist takes tissue from the roof of your mouth and attaches it to your gum line. The goal here is to cover the exposed roots of your teeth to protect them from harm. By the end of the tissue graft surgery, you'll have stitches in two places in your mouth. When they heal, your gum line will be at a healthy level. Bone Regeneration If a significant portion of the gum has receded and affected the jaw and teeth bone, you might need a bone regeneration. During this process, your dentist simply applies a protein that will stimulate your body to regrow the lost tissues. LANAP [LANAP is a laser treatment](https://advanceddentalartsnyc.com/everything-about-lanap/) that promotes natural tissue regeneration. It's a painless procedure but all the more effective. During your procedure, your dentist will use a laser to treat the receding gums. One of the best reasons to get LANAP is the quick recovery time. Because it doesn't involve cutting your gum or placing stitches anywhere, you'll see the results of the procedure much faster.
