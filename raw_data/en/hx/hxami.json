Your Reference Committee, 19 therefore, recommends adoption of Board of Trustees Report 7. 20 21 (2) RESOLUTION 213 CMMI PAYMENT REFORM 22 MODELS 23 24 RECOMMENDATION: 25 26 Resolution 213 be adopted. 27 28 HOD ACTION: Resolution 213 adopted 29 30 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association continue to advocate against 31 mandatory CMMI demonstration projects (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 32 33 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate that CMS seek innovative payment and care 34 delivery model ideas from physicians and groups such as medical specialty societies to 35 guide recommendation of the PTAC and work of the CMMI to propose demonstration 36 projects that are voluntary and can be appropriately tested (Directive to Take Action); 37 and be it 38 39 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate that CMMI focus on the development of multiple 40 pilot projects in many specialties, which are voluntary and tailored to the needs of local 41 communities and the needs of different specialties. (Directive to Take Action) 42 43 Your Reference Committee heard how Resolution 213 addresses efforts to advocate 44 against mandatory Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Center 45 (CMMI ) demonstration projects and to further advocate for CMS to seek innovative 46 payment and care delivery models from physician groups to help guide the work of 47 CMMI as they propose voluntary demonstration projects that can be appropriately tested 48 and advocate for CMMI to focus on the development of multiple pilot projects across 49 many specialties, which are voluntary and tailored to the needs of local communities . 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 4 of 37 Your Reference Committee heard that this resolution is consistent with existing AMA 1 policy and advocates that CMS work with Physician -Focused Payment Model Technical 2 Advisory Committee (PTAC ) to gu ide CMMI to develop physician- designed models that 3 could benefit Medicare and Medicaid patients. Your Reference Committee heard how 4 our AMA is actively engaged with the physician community and has worked extensively 5 with medical specialty societies, other physician groups, and Congress to support the 6 development of well -designed Alternative Payment Model (APM) proposals that are 7 consistent with the goals of the Medicare and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) 8 passed in 2015. Moreover, your Reference Committee heard how our AMA developed 9 recommendations for the new A dministration to consider that address issues with the 10 implementation of APMs. Therefore, your Reference Committee recommends that 11 Resolution 213 be adopted. 12 13 (3) RESOLUTION 216 OPPOSITION TO FEDERAL BAN 14 ON SNAP BENEFITS FOR PERSONS CONVICTED OF 15 DRUG RELATED FELONIES 16 17 RECOMMENDATION: 18 19 Resolution 216 be adopted. 20 21 HOD ACTION: Resolution 216 adopted 22 23 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association oppose any lifetime ban on SNAP 24 benefits imposed on individuals convicted of drug -related felonies. (New HOD Policy) 25 26 Your Reference Committee heard testimony strongly in support of Resolution 216. Your 27 Reference Committee heard that under current federal law, any individual convic ted of a 28 drug- related felony is not eligible for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition 29 Assistance Program (SNAP) . Your Reference Committee heard that t his provision was 30 originally part of a much larger welfare -reform package passed in 1996 to deter 31 individuals from drug- related crimes and decrease use of the welfare system. Further 32 testimony was provided that successful reentry into society from the criminal justice 33 system requires being able to meet basic needs such as food and denying access to 34 basic needs programs such as SNAP makes it harder for people with drug- related felony 35 convictions to get back on their feet. Others testified that this resolution is consistent with 36 existing AMA policy supporting SNAP and supporting a public health and medical 37 approach to treating individuals with substance use disorders rather than a punitive 38 approach. Your Reference Committee also heard testimony that AMA policy opposes 39 requiring SNAP applicants or beneficiaries to disclose medical information, including 40 former drug use and treatment history, and opposes denying assistance from these 41 programs based on drug-related felony status . However, your Reference Committee 42 heard that AMA policy does not address the impact of current federal law regarding 43 criminal drug off enses and subsequent access to SNAP benefits. Further , your 44 Reference Committee heard that , in light of the substance use epidemic, which has only 45 grown worse during the COVID -19 pandemic, and the potential for serious negative 46 health and social consequenc es to those individuals who were convicted of drug -related 47 felonies, this resolution should be adopted. Therefore, your Reference Committee 48 recommends that Resolution 216 be adopted. 49 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 5 of 37 (4) RESOLUTION 217 AMENDING H- 150.962, QUALITY 1 OF SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM TO ADVOCATE FOR 2 THE EXPANSION AND SUSTAINABILITY OF 3 NUTRITIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS DURING 4 COVID -19 5 6 RECOMMENDATION: 7 8 Resolution 217 be adopted. 9 10 HOD ACTION: Resolution 217 adopted 11 12 RESOLVED,ThatourAmerican Medical Associationamend policy H -150.962, \"Quality of 13 School Lunch Program,\"by addition as follows: 14 15 Quality of School Lunch Program H -150.962 16 17 1. Our AMA recommends to the National School Lunch Program that school meals 18 be congruent with current U.S. Department of Agriculture/Department of HHS 19 Dietary Guidelines. 20 2. Our AMA opposes legislation and regulatory initiatives that reduce or eliminate 21 access to federal child nutrition programs. 22 3. Our AMAsupport adoption and funding of alternative nutrition and meal 23 assistance programs during a national crisis, such as a pandemic.(Modify 24 Current HOD Policy) 25 26 Your Reference Committee heard testim ony in support of Resolution 217. Your 27 Reference Committee heard some testimony that highlighted the critical importance of 28 these federal nutrition programs for vulnerable populations, further amplified by the 29 disproportionate economic impact as a result o f the COVID -19 public health emergency. 30 Your Reference Committee also heard that the current Administration is working to 31 strengthen and expand these nutritional assistance programs with actions such as 32 requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to conti nue reimbursing schools and 33 childcare centers for free meals to all students regardless of their income through the 34 2021- 22 school year. Your Reference Committee heard testimony that questioned 35 whether such additions were necessary to meet the goals of thi s resolution or if this was 36 sufficiently covered by current policy. Your Reference Committee heard that the asks of 37 this resolution were in line with our AMA's larger goal of addressing social determinants 38 of health and combatting inequities faced by margi nalized and minoritized communities. 39 Your Reference Committee heard that the proposed amendment to AMA Policy H - 40 150.962 by this resolution would address a gap in policy. Accordingly, your Reference 41 Committee recommends that Resolution 217 be adopted. 42 43 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 6 of 37 (5) RESO LUTION 232 PREVENTING INAPPROPRIATE 1 USE OF PATIENT PROTECTED MEDICAL 2 INFORMATION IN THE VACCINATION PROCESS 3 4 RECOMMENDATION: 5 6 Resolution 232 be adopted. 7 8 RESOLVED, That our AMA oppose the sale or transfer of 9 medical history data and contact information accumulated 10 through the scheduling or provision of government -funded 11 vaccinations to third parties for use in marketing or 12 advertising (New HOD Policy). 13 14 HOD ACTION: Resolution 232 adopted as amended 15 16 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association advocate to prohibit the use of 17 patient/customer information collected by retail pharmacies for COVID -19 vaccination 18 scheduling and/or the vaccine administration process for commercial marketing or future 19 patient recruiting purposes, especially any targeting based on medical history or 20 conditions (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 21 22 RESOLVED, That our AMA oppose the sale of medical history data and contact 23 information accumulated through the scheduling or provision of government -funded 24 vaccinations to third parties for use in marketing or advertising (New HOD Policy). 25 26 Your Reference Committee heard overwhelming testimony in support of Resolution 232. 27 Your Reference Committee heard testimony that our AMA has been actively advocating 28 to ensure that as health information is shared\u2014 particularly outside of the health care 29 system \u2014patients have meaningful controls over and a clear understanding of how their 30 data is being used and with whom it is being shared; and that above all, patients feel 31 confident that their health information will remain private. Your Reference Committee 32 heard testimony that our AMA has been vocal in discussions with current and previous 33 Administration officials on proposed rules, regulations, and guidance documents to 34 ensure that patient privacy is at the forefront of any federal policy decisions. Therefore, 35 your Reference Committee recommends that Resolution 232 be adopted. 36 37 (6) RESOLUTION 233 NON -PHYSICIAN TITLE 38 MISAPPROPRIATION 39 40 RECOMMENDATION: 41 42 Resolution 233 be adopted. 43 44 HOD ACTION: Resolution 233 adopted 45 46 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association actively oppose the American 47 Academy of Physician Assistants' (AAPA's) recent move to change the official title of the 48 profession from \"Physician Assistant\" to \"Physician Associate\" (Directive to Take Action); 49 and be it further 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 7 of 37 1 RESOLVED, That our AMA actively advocate that the stand- alone title \"Physician\" be 2 used only to refer to doctors of allopathic medicine (MDs) and doctors of osteopathic 3 medicine (DOs), and not be used in ways that have the potential to mislead patients 4 about the level of training and credentials of non -physician health care workers. 5 (Directive to Take Action) 6 7 Your Reference Committee heard extensive and near unanimous testimony in strong 8 support of Resolution 233. Your Reference Committee heard multiple examples of how 9 Resolution 233 directly aligns with our AMA's statement issued on July 3, 2021 opposing 10 the AAPA's recent title change and our extensive policy supporting strong truth in 11 advertising laws . You r Reference Committee also heard of the importance of limiting the 12 title \"physician\" to MDs and DOs. Additionally, your Reference Committee heard that 13 Resolution 233 aligns with our ongoing commitment to opposing inappropriate 14 expansions of scope of practice and support ing our Truth in Advertising campaign. 15 Therefore, your Reference Committee recommends that Resolution 233 be adopted. 16 17 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 8 of 37 RECOMMENDED FOR ADOPTION AS AMENDED OR 1 SUBSTITUTED 2 3 (7) BOT 14 PHARMACEUTICAL ADVERTISING IN 4 ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEMS 5 6 RECOMMENDATION A: 7 8 Recommendation in Board of Trustees Report 14 be 9 amended by addition of a fourth and fifth clause to 10 read as follows: 11 12 Our AMA: ( 1) opposes direct -to-prescriber pharmaceutical and promotional 13 content in electronic health records (EHR); and (2) opposes direct -to- 14 prescriber pharmaceutical and promotional content in medical reference 15 and e- prescribing software, unless such content complies with a ll 16 provisions in Direct -to-Consumer Advertising (DTCA) of Prescription Drugs 17 and Implantable Devices (H -105.988); and (3) encourages the federal 18 government to study of the effects of direct -to physician prescriber 19 advertising at the point of care, including advertising in Electronic Health 20 Record Systems ( EHRs ), on physician prescribing, patient safety, data 21 privacy, health care costs, and EHR access for small physician practices .; 22 and (2) will study the prevalence and ethics of direct -to-physician 23 advertising at the point of care, including advertising in EHRs. and (4) 24 opposes the preferential placement of brand name medications in e - 25 prescription search results or listings; and ( 5) will encourage e- presc ribing 26 and EHR companies to ensure that the generic medication name will 27 appear first in e-prescription search results and listings. 28 29 RECOMMENDATION B: 30 31 Recommendation in Board of Trustees Report 14 be 32 adopted as amended and the remainder of the report 33 be filed. 34 35 HOD ACTION: Board of Trustees Report 14 adopted as 36 amended and the remainder of the report filed 37 38 The Board of Trustees recommends that Policy D -478.961 be amended as follows and 39 the remainder of the report be fi led: 40 41 Our AMA: ( 1) opposes direct -to-prescriber pharmaceutical and promotional content in 42 electronic health records (EHR); and (2) opposes direct -to-prescriber pharmaceutical 43 and promotional content in medical reference and e- prescribing software, unless such 44 content complies with all provisions in Direct -to-Consumer Advertising (DTCA) of 45 Prescription Drugs and Implantable Devices (H -105.988); and (3) encourages the 46 federal government to study of the effects of direct -to physician prescriber advertising at 47 the point of care, including advertising in Electronic Health Record Systems ( EHRs ), on 48 physician prescribing, patient safety, data privacy, health care costs, and EHR access 49 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 9 of 37 for small physician practices .; and (2) will study the prevalence and ethics of direct -to- 1 physician advertising at the point of care, including advertising in EHRs. 2 3 Your Reference Committee heard overwhelming support for BOT Report 14. Your 4 Reference Committee heard testimony that pharmaceutical companies have a long 5 history of marketing to physicians in the clinical setting and that in recent years access to 6 physicians has become more challenging for these companies. Your Reference 7 Committee also heard testimony that nearly half of physicians restrict visits from 8 pharmaceutical sales representatives leading to increased spending on advertising in 9 digital channels such as search engines and social media platforms in order to reach 10 physicians. Additionally, your Reference Committee heard significant concerns from 11 several delegations that EHR systems have become an opportunity for abuse by 12 pharmaceutical companies to directly provide information about prescription drugs to 13 prescribers, which raises significant patient safety concerns and jeopardizes the integrity 14 of patient care. You r Reference Committee was presented with compelling testimony 15 surrounding the use of the preferential placement of name brand drugs over generic 16 medications when utilizing the search action of an EHR as a more subtle form of 17 preferential advertising intended to influence the prescribing decisions of physicians . 18 Your Reference Committee heard that an amendment was needed to directly address 19 inappropriate influence of the relative placement of medication listings in E -Prescription 20 tools. Your Reference Commit tee was offered an amendment that would address this 21 issue of bias within the EHR E -prescribing tool which was favorably received by several 22 delegations. Your Reference Committee is recommending adoption of this amendment 23 with additional language to apply to e-prescription search results and listings . Therefore, 24 your Reference Committee recommends that BOT Report 14 be adopted as amended 25 and the remainder of the report filed. 26 27 (8) BOT 18 DIGITAL VACCINE CREDENTIAL SYSTEMS 28 AND VACCINE MANDATES IN COVID -19 29 RESOLUTION 230 CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMMUNITY 30 CREDENTIALS DURING PANDEMICS AND EPIDEMICS 31 32 RECOMMENDATION A: 33 34 Recommendations in Board of Trustees Report 18 be 35 amended by addition of a fourth recommendation to 36 read as follows: 37 38 4. Recommends that vaccination credentials not be provided on the 39 basis of natural immunity or prior SARS -CoV-2 infection. 40 41 RECOMMENDATION B: 42 43 Recommendations in Board of Trustees Report 18 be 44 adopted as amended in lieu of Resolution 230 and the 45 remainder of the report be filed . 46 47 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 10 of 37 HOD ACTION: Board of Trustees Report 18 adopted as 1 amended in lieu of Resolution 230 and the remainder of the 2 report filed. Amendment B3 as amended referred for 3 decision 4 5 Amendment B3 as amended: 6 Recommends that vaccine credentials are not used to 7 prevent immigration or voluntary repatriation, that 8 vaccines be offered upon arrival in the US, and that 9 vaccine mandates are uniformly applied regardless of 10 citizenship. 11 12 Board of Trustees Report 18 13 In light of the foregoing, the Board of Trustees recommends that the following be 14 adopted and the remainder of this report be filed: 15 16 COVID -19 and COVID -19 vaccines raise unique challenges. To meet these challenges, 17 our AMA: 18 1. Encourages the development of clear, strong, universal, and enforceable federal 19 guidelines for the design and deployment of digital vaccination credentialing 20 services (DVCS), and that before decisions are taken to implement use of 21 vaccine credentials 22 a. vaccine is widely accessi ble; 23 b. equity -centered privacy protections are in place to safeguard data collected from 24 individuals; 25 c. provisions are in place to ensure that vaccine credentials do not exacerbate 26 inequities; and 27 d. credentials address the situation of individuals for whom vaccine is medically 28 contraindicated (New HOD Policy) 29 2. Recommends that decisions to mandate COVID -19 vaccination be made only: 30 a. After a vaccine has received full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug 31 Administration through a Biological Licenses Application; 32 b. In keeping with recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization 33 Practices for use in the population subject to the mandate as approved by the 34 Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 35 c. When individuals subject to the mandate have been given meaningful opportunity 36 to voluntarily accept vaccination; and 37 d. Implementation of the mandate minimizes the potential to exacerbate inequities 38 or adversely affect already marginalized or minoritized populations. ( New HOD 39 Policy) 40 3. Encourages the use of well -designed education and outreach efforts to promote 41 vaccination to protect both public health and public trust. (New HOD Policy) 42 43 Resolution 230 44 RESOLVED, That ourAMA: 45 (1) oppose the implementation of natural immunity credentials, which give an individual 46 differential privilege on the basis of natural immunity after non- vaccine exposure status 47 to a pathogen, and 48 49 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 11 of 37 (2) caution that any implementation of vaccine- induced immunity credentials, which give 1 anindividual differential privilege on the basis of acquired immunity after receiving a 2 vaccine, must strongly consider potential consequences on social inequity, including, but 3 not limited to, 4 i. continued marginalization of communities historically harmed or ignored by 5 thehealthcare system, 6 ii. isolation of populations who may be ineligible for or unable to access vaccines, 7 iii. barriers preventing immigration or travel from countries with low access to 8 vaccinesand the need to of fer a vaccine upon arrival to anyone entering the US 9 fromanothercountry, and 10 iv. privacy of and accessibility to any systems used to implement vaccine- induced 11 immunity passports 12 13 Your Reference Committee heard overwhelming testimony in support of BOT Report 18 14 and mixed testimony regarding Resolution 230. Your Reference Committee heard 15 testimony that BOT 18 provides a cautionary analysis of two widely popular approaches 16 for responding to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic. Your Reference Committee heard 17 that both vaccine credentials and mandatory vaccination strategies serve compelling 18 public interests : protecting the health of the community while allowing individuals 19 expanded opportunities for social and economic int eraction. Your Reference Committee 20 heard testimony that both strategies also pose ethical and practical challenges, notably 21 to confidentiality and autonomy, and have the potential to adversely and 22 disproportionately affect members of marginalized and minor itized communities. Your 23 Reference Committee heard testimony that Resolution 230 addresses the same issues 24 as BOT 18 and includes a recommendation about natural immunity credentials that 25 should be added as a fourth recommendation in BOT 18 to enhance our A MA's 26 policy.Therefore, your Reference Committee recommends that BOT 18 be amended by 27 addition of a fourth recommendation that addresses the goal of Resolution 230 with 28 regards to natural immunity. Your Reference Committee further recommends that BOT 29 18 as amended be adopted in lieu of Resolution 230 and the remainder of the report be 30 adopted and filed. 31 32 (9) RESOLUTION 206 REDEFINING THE DEFINITION OF 33 HARM 34 RESOLUTION 212 ONC'S INFORMATION BLOCKING 35 REGULATIONS 36 37 RECOMMENDATION A: 38 39 Resolution 206 be amended by addition and deletion 40 to read as follows: 41 42 RESOLVED,Thatour American Medical Association advocate to the Office 43 of Civil Rights Office for Civil Rights to revise the definition of harm to 44 include mental and emotional distress. Such a revision would allow 45 additional flexibility for clinicians under the Preventing Harm Exception, 46 based on their professional judgement, to withhold sensitive information 47 they believe could cause physical,mentalor emotional harm to the patient 48 (Directive toTake Action); and be itfurther 49 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 12 of 37 RESOLVED, that our AMA advocate that the Office of Civil Rights Office for 1 Civil Rights assemble a commission of medical professionals to help the 2 office review the definition of harm and provide scientific evidence 3 demonstrating that mental and emotional health is intertwined with 4 physical health. 5 6 RESOLVED, Our AMA continue to urge the Department of Health and 7 Human Services (HHS)'s Office of the National Coordinator for Health 8 Information Technology ( ONC) and its Office of Inspector General ( OIG) to 9 leverage their enforcement discretion that would afford small and medium - 10 sized medical practices additional compliance flexibilities given their lack 11 of resources. 12 13 RESOLVED, That our AMA urge the ONC to earnestly consult with relevant 14 stakeholders about unintended or unforeseen consequences that may 15 arise from the information blocking regulations. 16 17 RECOMMENDATION B: 18 19 Resolution 206 be adopted as amended in lieu of 20 Resolution 212. 21 22 HOD ACTION: Resolution 206 adopted as amended in lieu 23 of Resolution 212 24 25 Resolution 206 26 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association advocate to the Office of Civil 27 Rights to revise the definition of harm to include mental and emotional distress. Such a 28 revision would allow additional flexibility for clinicians under the Preventing Harm 29 Exception, based on their professional judgement, to withhold sensitive information they 30 believe could cause physical, mental or emotional harm to the patient (Directive to Take 31 Action); and be it further 32 33 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate that the Office of Civil Rights assemble a 34 commission of medical professionals to help the office review the definition of harm and 35 provide scientific evidence demonstrating that mental and emotional health is intertwined 36 with physical health. (Directive to Take Action) 37 38 Resolution 212 39 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association advocate for additional time and 40 complia nce leeway for physicians by urging the Office of the National Coordinator for 41 Health Information Technology (ONC) to broaden and relax their current regulatory 42 requirements based on the following critical enumerated requests: 43 44 a. Urge the ONC to strike the right balance between the demands and distress 45 caused by the COVID -19 public health emergency (PHE) and its interoperability 46 rule objectives. 47 b. Urge the ONC to earnestly consult with relevant stakeholders about unintended 48 or unforeseen consequences that may arise from the information blocking 49 regulations. 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 13 of 37 c. Urge the ONC, through an interim final rule moratorium, to delay the current 1 applicability date of information blocking provisions until 12 months after the PHE 2 is officially declared over, aff ording small and medium -sized medical practices 3 time to recover and prepare. 4 d. Urge the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)'s ONC and their OIG 5 to propose future enforcement discretion that would afford small and medium - 6 sized medical practices further compliance flexibilities given their lack of 7 resources. 8 e. Call on the H HS's ONC and OIG in future enforcement rulemaking to propose 9 corrective action and further technical guidance rather than imposing fines or 10 penalties. 11 f. Urge the ONC to broaden and relax its Patient Harm Exception through 12 subregulatory revisions that would include patients' emotional and mental 13 distress to the current and narrow definition of this exception. 14 g. Call on the ONC to develop and offer more meaningful educational guidance, 15 practical resources, and technical assistance to physician practices to help them 16 meet their compliance efforts, patient care obligations and documentation 17 requirements. (Directive to Take Action) 18 19 Your Reference Committee heard testimony primarily in favor of adopting Resolution 20 206 and mixed testimony regarding Resoluti on 212. Your Reference Committee heard 21 that, while HIPAA requires covered entities to provide access to personal health 22 information (PHI) to individuals and their personal representatives, disclosures to other 23 parties are permissive, not required.Your Reference Committee also heard testimony 24 thatnew information blocking regulations from the Office of the National Coordinator for 25 Health Information Technology (ONC) require physicians to make available avariety of 26 medical information(e.g., lab tests, clinical notes, medications, etc.) to not only the 27 individual/personal representative, but also any other entity or individual requesting 28 information for or on behalf of the patient.Your Reference Committee also heard 29 testimony that while patients accessing their medical information is an important part of 30 patient -centered care and ourAMA strongly supports patient access and engagement, 31 there are a v ariety of ethical, professional, and practical concerns with automatically and 32 immediately releasing all reports and office notes.Your Reference Committee also heard 33 testimony that theONC has createdeight exceptionsoutlining reasonable and necessary 34 practices physicians may take to withhold information, including theHarm 35 Exceptionwhichallows a physician to withhold the release of information only in cases of 36 anticipatedphysicalharm to the patient or another individual.Your Reference Committee 37 heard testimony that this guidance is based on aninterpretation by the Office for Civil 38 Rightst hat \"harm\" is defined only as physical, not mental or emotional.Your Reference 39 Committee also heard testimony that ,under current regulation, physicians must still 40 release health information even when, in their professional judgement, they believe that 41 doing so could emotionally or psychologically harm their patient.Your Reference 42 Committee heard testimony that Resolution 206 needs a minor technical amendment to 43 change the \"Office of Civil Rights \" to the \"Office for Civil Rights. \" Your Reference 44 Committee also heard testimony that the goal of Resolution 212 can be captured with 45 the addition of a third R esolved to Resolution 206 that urges ONC and the H HS OIG to 46 leverage enforcement discretion that would afford small and medium -sized medical 47 practices addit ional compliance flexibilities. Therefore, your Reference Committee 48 recommends that Resolution 206 beadopted, as amended, in lieu of Resolution 212. 49 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 14 of 37 (10) RESOLUTION 210 RANSOMWARE AND ELECTRONIC 1 HEALTH RECORDS 2 3 RECOMMENDATION A: 4 5 Resolution 210 be a mended by addition and deletion 6 to read as follows: 7 8 RESOLVED,Thatour American Medical Association adopt policy 9 acknowledging that healthcare data interruptions are especially harmful 10 due to potential physical harm to patients andcalling for prosecuti on to the 11 fullest extentof the law for perpetrators of ransomware and any other 12 malware on independent physicians and their practices, healthcare 13 organizations, or other medical entities involved in providing direct and 14 indirect care to patients (New HOD Policy); and be itfurther 15 16 RESOLVED,Thatour AMA advocate for seek to introduce federal 17 legislation which provides for the prosecution of perpetrators of 18 ransomware and any other malware onany and allhealthcare entities, 19 involved in direct and indir ect patient care, to the fullest extent of the law. 20 (Directive toTake Action) 21 22 RESOLVED, That our AMA encourage health care facilities and integrated 23 networks that are under threat of ransomware attacks to upgrade their 24 cybersecurity and to back up dat a in a robust and timely fashion. 25 26 RESOLVED , That our AMA advocate that the security of protected 27 healthcare information be considered as an integral part of national 28 cybersecurity protection, and be it further 29 30 RESOLVED , That our AMA seek inclusion of federal cybersecurity 31 resources allocated to physician practices, hospitals, and health care 32 entities sufficient to protect the security of the patients they serve, as part 33 of infrastructure legislation. 34 35 RECOMMENDATION B: 36 37 Resolution 210 be adopted as amended. 38 39 HOD ACTION: Resolution 210 adopted as amended 40 41 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association adopt policy acknowledging that 42 healthcare data interruptions are especially harmful due to potential physical harm to 43 patients and calling for prosecution to the fullest extent of the law for perpetrators of 44 ransomware and any other malware on independent physicians and their practices, 45 healthcare organizations, or other medical entities involved in providing direct and 46 indirect care to patients (New HOD Policy); and be it further 47 48 RESOLVED, That our AMA seek to introduce federal legislation which provides for the 49 prosecution of perpetrators of ransomware and any other malware on any and all 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 15 of 37 healthcare entities, involved in direct and indirect patient care, to the fullest extent of the 1 law. (Direct ive to Take Action) 2 3 Your Reference Committee heard testimony in support of Resolution 210.Your 4 Reference Committee heard testimony that our AMA has actively been working on 5 cybersecurity preparedness, education, and resilience for many years. Your Reference 6 Committee heard testimony that our AMA has led the field in framing cybersecurity as a 7 patient safety issue, and as a result, is better situated to monitor and support efforts to 8 promote these concepts in federal legislative and regulatory settings t han it is to 9 introduce legislation contemplating possible criminal and civil prosecutions and 10 accordingly your Reference Committee heard an amendment was needed to support 11 this work. Your Reference Committee heard an amendment concerning the importance 12 of ensuring that health care facilities and integrated networks upgrade their cybersecurity 13 and back up data in a robust and timely fashion to guarantee that patient data is 14 adequately protected. Your Reference Committee heard multiple testimonies in support 15 of the amendment on upgrading security and heard how this fills a gap in current AMA 16 Policy. Therefore, your Reference Committee recommends that Resolution 210 be 17 adopted as amended. 18 19 (11) RESOLUTION 215 EXEMPTIONS TO WORK 20 REQUIREMENTS AND ELIGIBILITY EXPANSIONS IN 21 PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS 22 23 RECOMMENDATION A: 24 25 The first Resolve of Resolution 215 be amended by 26 addition and deletion to read as follows: 27 28 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support reduction and 29 elimination of work requirements applied to the used as eligibility criteria in 30 public assistance programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition 31 Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Temporary Assistance for Needy 32 Families Program (TANF) (New HOD Policy); and be it further 33 34 RECOMMENDATION B: 35 36 Resolution 215 be amended by the addition of a third 37 Resolve. 38 39 RESOLVED, That our AMA work with state medical societies to encourage 40 states to establish express lane eligibility (ELE) programs that use 41 eligibility data from the maximum number of Express Lane Agencies 42 (ELAs) feasible, which include SNAP, TANF, and other programs as 43 described by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, to facilitate 44 enrollment in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program 45 (CHIP) . (New HOD Policy) 46 47 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 16 of 37 RECOMMENDATION C: 1 2 Resolution 215 be adopted as amended . 3 4 HOD ACTION: Resolution 215 adopted as amended 5 6 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support reduction and elimination 7 of work requirements applied to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) 8 and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program (TANF) (New HOD Policy); 9 and be i t further 10 11 RESOLVED, That our AMA support states' ability to expand eligibility for public 12 assistance programs beyond federal standards, including automatically qualifying 13 individuals for a public assistance program based on their eligibility for another program. 14 (New HOD Policy) 15 16 Your Reference Committee heard overwhelmingly positive testimony in support of 17 Resolution 215 and the amendment offered on Resolution 215. Your Reference 18 Committee heard that the economic crisis caused by the pandemic has hi ghlighted the 19 need for a strong safety net programs, including SNAP and TANF. Your Reference 20 Committee heard that existing AMA policy opposes work requirements in the Medicaid 21 program and that adoption of Resolution 215 would build on policy that is suppor tive of 22 assistance programs for low -income individuals and families. Your Reference Committee 23 heard supporting testimony for an additional resolved that would call on our AMA to work 24 with state medical societies to encourage states to establish ELE program s that use 25 eligibility data to facilitate enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP . Therefore, your Reference 26 Committee recommends adoption of Resolution 215 as amended. 27 28 (12) RESOLUTION 226 INTEREST -BASED DEBT BURDEN 29 ON MEDICAL STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS 30 31 RECOMMENDATION A: 32 33 Resolution 22 6 be amended by addition and deletion 34 to read as follows: 35 36 RESOLVED: That our AMA strongly advocate for the passage of legislation 37 to allow borrowers medical students, residents and fellows who have 38 education loans to qualify for interest -free deferment on their student loans 39 while serving in a medical or dental internship, residency, or fellowship 40 program, as well as permitting the conversation of currently unsubsidized 41 Stafford and Graduate Plus loans to interest free status for the duration of 42 undergraduate and graduate medical education. (Directive to Take Action) 43 44 RECOMMENDATION B: 45 46 Resolution 226 be adopted as amended. 47 48 HOD ACTION: Resolution 226 adopted as amended 49 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 17 of 37 RESOLVED,Thatour American Medical Association strongly advocate for the passage 1 of legislation to allow borrowers to qualify for interest -free deferment on their student 2 loans while serving in a medical or dental internship, residency, or f ellowship program, 3 as well as permitting the conversion of currently unsubsidized Stafford and Graduate 4 Plus loans to interest free status for the duration of undergraduate and graduate medical 5 education. (Directive toTake Action) 6 7 Your Reference Commit tee heard overwhelming testimony in support of Resolution 226. 8 Your Reference Committee heard that although our AMA has extensive policy 9 surrounding student loans and mitigating the harm of these loans on physicians and 10 medical students, Resolution 226 fil ls a gap in current policy that would specify the 11 deferment of student loan interest accruement during internship, residency, or fellowship 12 program s, as well as permitting the conversation of currently unsubsidized Stafford and 13 Graduate Plus loans to inter est free status for the duration of undergraduate and 14 graduate medical education. Your Reference Committee heard that this proposed policy 15 change falls in line with our current advocacy efforts, including our AMA's support of the 16 \"Resident Education Deferr ed Interest Act\" introduced during the 116th Congress. Your 17 Reference Committee also heard compelling testimony from our members regarding 18 their personal experiences with struggling to pay off their student loan debt, which was 19 compounded by large amounts of interest. Your Reference Committee also heard 20 testimony from multiple delegations that the language of this resolution could be 21 specified even further to support medical students, residents, and fellows who have 22 education loans during their undergraduat e and graduate medical education. As such, 23 your Reference Committee recommends that Resolution 226 be adopted as amended. 24 25 (13) RESOLUTION 227 AUDIO -ONLY TELEHEALTH FOR 26 RISK ADJUSTED PAYMENT MODELS 27 28 RECOMMENDATION A: 29 30 Resolution 227 be amended by addition and deletion 31 to read as follows: 32 33 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association advocate that 34 diagnoses coded for audio- only telehealth encounters diagnoses be 35 included in risk adjusted payment models. 36 37 RECOMMENDATION B: 38 39 Resolution 227 be amended by addition of a second 40 Resolve to read as follows: 41 42 RESOLVED , Our AMA advocate for coverage and payment of audio- only 43 services in appropriate circumstances to e nsure equitable coverage for 44 patients who need access to telecommunication services but who do not 45 have access to two -way audio -visual technology. (Directive to Take Action) 46 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 18 of 37 1 RECOMMENDATION C: 2 3 Resolution 227 be adopted as amended. 4 5 HOD ACTION: Resolution 227 adopted as amended 6 7 RESOLVED , That our AMA advocate that audio- only telehealth encounter diagnoses be 8 included in risk adjusted payment models. (Directive to Take Action) 9 10 Your Reference Committee heard testimony in support of Resolution 227. Your 11 Reference Committee heard testimony from multiple delegations expressing that the 12 expanded use of audio- visual telehealth services during the pandemic has made it clear 13 that requiring the use of a video connection inappropri ately limits the number of patients 14 who can benefit from telecommunications -supported services. Your Reference 15 Committee heard testimony on the equity implications related to differences in the 16 accessibility of telehealth resources for patients, particular ly lower -income patients and 17 those residing in rural and other areas with limited broadband access. Your Reference 18 Committee heard extensive testimony that physicians should continue to be able to 19 deliver appropriate services by telephone, including E/M services, to patients who need 20 a telecommunications -based service but who do not have access to a video connection 21 or cannot successfully use one. Your Reference Committee also heard testimony that 22 the resolution would benefit from an amendment addressing coverage and payment for 23 audio- only services in appropriate circumstances in risk -adjusted plans like Medicare 24 Advantage and that this amendment is critical to ensuring equity is prioritized in policy 25 surrounding the development and delivery of telehealth services. Your Reference 26 Committee was proffered an amendment that would address the concerns surrounding 27 coverage and payment for audio- only services in appropriate care settings which would 28 further extend care to all patients regardless of income status. T herefore, your 29 Reference Committee recommends that Resolution 227 be adopted as amended. 30 31 (14) RESOLUTION 228 COVID -19 VACCINATION 32 ROLLOUT TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND 33 URGENT CARE FACILITIES 34 35 RECOMMENDATION A: 36 37 Resolution 228 be amended by addition and deletion 38 to read as follows: 39 40 RESOLVED, That our AMA acknowledge that our nation's COVID -19 41 vaccine rollout is not yet optimized, and we have a duty to vaccinate as 42 many people in an effective manner; and be it further 43 44 RESOLVED, That our AMA work with other relevant organizations and 45 stakeholders to lobby the current Administration for the distribution of 46 COVID -19 vaccinations to our nation's emergency departments and urgent 47 care facilities during the COVID -19 public health emergency. ; and be it 48 furthe r 49 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 19 of 37 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for additional funding to be directed 1 towards increasing COVID -19 vaccine ambassador programs in emergency 2 departments and urgent care facilities. 3 4 RECOMMENDATION B: 5 6 Resolution 228 be adopted as amended. 7 8 RECOMMENDATION C: 9 10 AMA Policies D-440.921 and H -440.875 be reaffirmed. 11 12 HOD ACTION: Resolution 228 adopted as amended 13 Policies D -440.921 and H -440.875 reaffirmed 14 15 RESOLVED, That our AMA acknowledge that our nation's COVID -19 vaccine rollout is 16 not yet optimized, and we have a duty to vaccinate as many people in an effective 17 manner; and be it 18 further 19 20 RESOLVED, That our AMA work with other relevant organizations and stakeholders to 21 lobby the current Administration for the distribution of COVID -19 vaccinations to our 22 nation's emergency departments and urgent care facilities; and be it further 23 24 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for additional funding to be directed towards 25 increasing COVID -19 vaccine ambassador programs in emergency departments and 26 urgent care facilities. 27 28 Your Reference Committee heard mixed testimony on Resolution228. Your Reference 29 Committee was presented with concerns regarding the ability of emergency departments 30 and urgent care centers to acquire COVID -19 vaccine doses or otherw ise participate in 31 vaccination campaigns throughout the COVID -19 public health emergency. However, 32 your Reference Committee also heard testimony that our AMA already strongly 33 advocates for the inclusion of physicians in all COVID -19 vaccination campaigns and for 34 COVID -19 vaccinations to be available in all circumstances. Additionally, your Reference 35 Committee heard testimony that our AMA has already adopted timely and robust policy 36 regarding COVID -19 vaccine efforts, most recently at the November 2020 speci al 37 meeting. Therefore, your Reference Committee recommends adoption of Resolution 228 38 as amended. Your Reference Committee also recommends reaffirmation of existing 39 policies D- 440.921 and H -440.875 in lieu of resolved one and three. 40 41 An Urgent Initiative to Support COVID -19 Vaccination Programs D -440.921 42 43 Our AMA will institute a program to promote the integrity of a COVID -19 44 vaccination program by: (1) educating physicians on speaking with patient s about 45 COVID -19 vaccination, bearing in mind the historical context of \"experimentation\" 46 with vaccines and other medication in communities of color, and providing 47 physicians with culturally appropriate patient education materials; (2) educating 48 the public about the safety and efficacy of COVID -19 vaccines, by countering 49 misinformation and building public confidence; (3) forming a coalition of health 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 20 of 37 care and public health organizations inclusive of those respected in communities 1 of color committed to devel oping and implementing a joint public education 2 program promoting the facts about, promoting the need for, and encouraging the 3 acceptance of COVID -19 vaccination; and (4) supporting ongoing monitoring of 4 COVID -19 vaccines to ensure that the evidence continues to support safe and 5 effective use of vaccines among recommended populations. 6 7 Assuring Access to ACIP/AAFP/AAP -Recommended Vaccines H -440.875 8 9 1. It is AMA policy that all persons, regardless of economic and insurance status, 10 receive all Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) -recommended 11 vaccines as soon as possible following publication of these recommendations in 12 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality 13 Weekly Report (MMWR). 14 15 2. Our AMA will cont inue to work with the federal government, Congress, and 16 other stakeholders to improve liability protection for vaccine manufacturers and 17 health care professionals who provide immunization services and to examine and 18 improve compensation mechanisms for pati ents who were legitimately injured by 19 a vaccine. 20 21 3. Our AMA will continue to work with the federal government, Congress, and 22 other appropriate stakeholders to enhance public opinion of vaccines and to 23 monitor and ensure the continued safety of existing and newly approved 24 vaccines (including providing adequate resources for post -approval surveillance) 25 so as to maintain and improve public confidence in the safety of vaccines. 26 27 4. Our AMA will work with appropriate stakeholders, including vaccine 28 manufacturers, vaccine distributors, the federal government, medical specialty 29 societies, and third party payers, to guarantee a robust vaccine delivery 30 infrastructure (including but not limited to, the research and development of new 31 vaccines, the ability to track the real -time supply status of ACIP -recommended 32 vaccines, and the timely distribution of ACIP -recommended vaccines to 33 providers). 34 35 5. Our AMA will work with appropriate feder al and state agencies and private 36 sector entities to ensure that state Medicaid agencies and private insurance 37 plans pay health care professionals at least the approved Relative Value Unit 38 (RVU) administration Medicare rates for payment when they administer ACIP - 39 recommended vaccines. 40 41 6. Our AMA will work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 42 (CMS) to address barriers associated with Medicare recipients receiving live 43 zoster vaccine and the routine boosters Td and Tdap in physicians' offices . 44 45 7. Our AMA will work through appropriate state entities to ensure all health 46 insurance plans rapidly include newly ACIP -recommended vaccines in their list of 47 covered benefits, and to pay health care professionals fairly for the purchase and 48 administra tion of ACIP -recommended vaccines. 49 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 21 of 37 8. Our AMA will urge Medicare to include Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Acellular 1 Pertussis) under Medicare Part B as a national public health measure to help 2 prevent the spread of Pertussis. 3 4 9. Until compliance of AMA Policy H- 440.875(6) is actualized to the AMA's 5 satisfaction regarding the tetanus vaccine, our AMA will aggressively petition 6 CMS to include tetanus and Tdap at both the \"Welcome to Medicare\" and Annual 7 Medicare Wellness visits, and other clinically approp riate encounters, as 8 additional \"triggering event codes\" (using the AT or another modifier) that allow 9 for coverage and payment of vaccines to Medicare recipients. 10 11 10. Our AMA will aggressively petition CMS to include coverage and payment for 12 any vaccin ations administered to Medicare patients that are recommended by 13 the ACIP, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), or based on 14 prevailing preventive clinical health guidelines. 15 16 (15) RESOLUTION 229 CLASSIFICATION AND 17 SURVEILLANCE OF MATERNAL MORTALI TY 18 19 RECOMMENDATION A: 20 21 Resolution 229 be amended by addition and deletion 22 to read as follows: 23 24 RESOLVED,Thatour AMAadvocate for an annual release of the national 25 maternal mortality rate in the United States; and be it further 26 27 RESOLVED,Thatour AMA will collaborate with relevant stakeholders to 28 advocate for a reliable, accurate, and standardized definition of maternal 29 mortality that will be implemented across states for tracking data on 30 maternal mortality; and be itfurther 31 32 RESOLVED,Thatour AMA encourage research efforts to characterize the 33 health needs for pregnant inmates, including efforts that utilize data 34 acquisition directly from pregnant inmates while ensuring appropriate 35 nondiscrimination and privacy safeguards ; and be itfurther 36 37 RESOLVED,Thatour AMA support legislation requiring all correctional 38 facilities, including those that are privately- owned, to collect and publicly 39 report pregnancy -related healthcare statistics with transparency in the data 40 collection pr ocess while ensuring appropriate nondiscrimination and 41 privacy safeguards . 42 43 RECOMMENDATION B: 44 45 Resolution 229 be adopted as amended. 46 47 48 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 22 of 37 RECOMMENDATION C: 1 2 AMA Policies D -420.993, H -430.986, H -315.983, and H - 3 60.909 be reaffirmed . 4 5 HOD ACTION: Resolution 229 adopted as amended. 6 Policies D -420.993, H -430.986, H -315.983, and H -60.909 7 reaffirmed 8 9 RESOLVED,Thatour AMAadvocate for an annual release of the national maternal 10 mortality rate in the United States; and be it further 11 12 RESOLVED,Thatour AMA will collaborate with relevant stakeholders to advocate for a 13 reliable, accurate, and standardized definition of maternal mortality that will be 14 implemented across states for tracking data on maternal mortality; and be itfurther 15 16 RESOLVED,Thatour AMA encourage research efforts to characterize the health needs 17 for pregnant inmates, including efforts that utilize data acquisition directly from pregnant 18 inmates; and be itfurther 19 20 RESOLVED,Thatour AMA support legislation requiring all correctional facilities, 21 including those that are privately -owned, to collect and publicly report pregnancy -related 22 healthcare statistics with transparency in the data collection process. 23 24 Your Reference Committee heard mixed testimony that while more com prehensive 25 maternal mortality and morbidity data is needed, Resolution 229 does not completely 26 achieve this goal. Your Reference Committee heard testimony that our AMA has existing 27 policy, State Maternal Mortality Review Committees H -60.909 , which touches on the 28 issues related to data collection related to maternal mortality highlighted in Resolution 29 229. Additionally, your Reference Committee heard testimony that our AMA has been 30 strongly advocating for increased funding and technical assistance by the federal 31 government so that all states and territories may develop their own State Maternal 32 Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs). Your Reference Committee was presented with 33 testimony highlighting that our AMA's Council on Medical Service and the Council on 34 Science and Public Health are currently drafting a joint report, in the first in an 35 anticipated series of reports, focused on improving maternal health. Your Reference 36 Committee heard testimony that MMRCs provide more comprehensive and robust data 37 because loc al health care providers actually meet to discuss these deaths on a case- by- 38 case basis and do not simply use the vital statistics or death records through Pregnancy 39 Mortality Surveillance System (PMSS). Your Reference Committee heard testimony that 40 the Cen ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has worked to develop and utilize 41 the Maternal Mortality Review Information Application (MMRIA, or \"Maria\"), a data 42 system designed to facilitate MMRC functions through a common data language, and 43 that the CDC, in partnership with users from the committees and other subject matter 44 experts, developed the system, which is available to all MMRCs as an option to increase 45 access to national data. Moreover, your Reference Committee heard testimony that the 46 CDC and the National Center for Health Statistics released a report on maternal 47 mortality last year, the first of its kind since 2007. 48 49 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 23 of 37 Your Reference Committee heard testimony that while obtaining more pregnant inmate 1 data is a laudable goal for our organization, o ur AMA also has policy protecting the 2 privacy of such individuals from discrimination due to the use of such data by U.S. 3 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or other agencies, and therefore any policy 4 surrounding data collection, particularly surrounding vulnerable populations, must have 5 robust privacy protections. Therefore, your Reference Committee recommends that D - 6 420.993, H-430.986, H -315.983 and H -60.909 be reaffirmed in lieu of R esolved 1 and 2 7 of Resolution 229; and that Resolved 3 and 4 be a dopted as amended. 8 9 Disparities in Maternal Mortality D -420.993 10 11 Our AMA: (1) will ask the Commission to End Health Care Disparities to evaluate 12 the issue of health disparities in maternal mortality and offer recommendations to 13 address existing disparities in the rates of maternal mortality in the United States; 14 (2) will work with the CDC, HHS, state and county health departments to 15 decrease maternal mortality rates in the US; (3) encourages and promotes to all 16 state and county health departments to develop a maternal mortality surveillance 17 system; and (4) will work with stakeholders to encourage research on identifying 18 barriers and developing strategies toward the implementation of evidence- based 19 practices to prevent disease conditions that contribute to poor obstetric 20 outcomes, maternal morbidity and maternal mortality in racial and ethnic 21 minorities. 22 23 Health Care While Incarcerated H -430.986 24 25 1. Our AMA advocates for adequate payment to health care providers, including 26 primary care and mental health, and addiction treatment professionals, to 27 encourage improved access to comprehensive physical and behavioral health 28 care services to juveniles and adults throughout the incarceration process from 29 intake to re -entry into the community. 30 31 2. Our AMA supports pa rtnerships and information sharing between correctional 32 systems, community health systems and state insurance programs to provide 33 access to a continuum of health care services for juveniles and adults in the 34 correctional system. 35 36 3. Our AMA encourages stat e Medicaid agencies to accept and process 37 Medicaid applications from juveniles and adults who are incarcerated. 38 39 4. That our AMA encourage state Medicaid agencies to work with their local 40 departments of corrections, prisons, and jails to assist incarcerated juveniles and 41 adults who may not have been enrolled in Medicaid at the time of their 42 incarceration to apply and receive an eligibility determination for Medicaid. 43 44 5. Our AMA encourages states to suspend rather than terminate Medicaid 45 eligibility of juve niles and adults upon intake into the criminal justice system and 46 throughout the incarceration process, and to reinstate coverage when the 47 individual transitions back into the community. 48 49 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 24 of 37 6. Our AMA urges Congress, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Servi ces 1 (CMS), and state Medicaid agencies to provide Medicaid coverage for health 2 care, care coordination activities and linkages to care delivered to patients up to 3 30 days before the anticipated release from adult and juvenile correctional 4 facilities in ord er to help establish coverage effective upon release, assist with 5 transition to care in the community, and help reduce recidivism. 6 7 7. Our AMA advocates for necessary programs and staff training to address the 8 distinctive health care needs of incarcerated women and adolescent females, 9 including gynecological care and obstetrics care for pregnant and postpartum 10 women. 11 8. Our AMA will collaborate with state medical societies and federal regulators to 12 emphasize the importance of hygiene and health literacy information sessions for 13 both inmates and staff in correctional facilities. 14 15 9. Our AMA supports: (a) linkage of those incarcerated to community clinics upon 16 release in order to accelerate access to comprehensive health care, including 17 mental health and substance abuse disorder services, and improve health 18 outcomes among this vulnerable patient population, as well as adequate funding; 19 and (b) the collaboration of correctional health workers and community health 20 care providers for those transitioni ng from a correctional institution to the 21 community. 22 23 Patient Privacy and Confidentiality H -315.983 24 25 1. Our AMA affirms the following key principles that should be consistently 26 implemented to evaluate any proposal regarding patient privacy and the 27 confidentiality of medical information: (a) That there exists a basic right of 28 patients to privacy of their medical information and records, and that this right 29 should be explicitly acknowledged; (b) That patients' privacy should be honored 30 unless waived by the patient in a meaningful way or in rare instances when 31 strong countervailing interests in public health or safety justify invasions of 32 patient privacy or breaches of confidentiality, and then only when such invasions 33 or breaches are subject to stringent safeguards enforced by appropriate 34 standards of accountability; (c) That patients' privacy should be honored in the 35 context of gathering and disclosing information for clinical research and quality 36 improvement activities, and that any necessary departures from the preferred 37 practices of obtaining patients' informed consent and of de -identifying all data be 38 strictly controlled; (d) That any information disclosed should be limited to that 39 information, portion of the medical record, or abstract necessary to fulfill the 40 immediate and specific purpose of disclosure; and (e) That the Health Insurance 41 Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) be the minimal standard for 42 protecting clinician- patient privilege, regardless of where care is received. 43 44 2. Our AMA af firms: (a) that physicians and medical students who are patients 45 are entitled to the same right to privacy and confidentiality of personal medical 46 information and medical records as other patients, (b) that when patients 47 exercise their right to keep their personal medical histories confidential, such 48 action should not be regarded as fraudulent or inappropriate concealment, and 49 (c) that physicians and medical students should not be required to report any 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 25 of 37 aspects of their patients' medical history to governmental agencies or other 1 entities, beyond that which would be required by law. 2 3 3. Employers and insurers should be barred from unconsented access to 4 identifiable medical information lest knowledge of sensitive facts form the basis of 5 adverse decisions agai nst individuals. (a) Release forms that authorize access 6 should be explicit about to whom access is being granted and for what purpose, 7 and should be as narrowly tailored as possible. (b) Patients, physicians, and 8 medical students should be educated about the consequences of signing overly - 9 broad consent forms. (c) Employers and insurers should adopt explicit and public 10 policies to assure the security and confidentiality of patients' medical information. 11 (d) A patient's ability to join or a physician's parti cipation in an insurance plan 12 should not be contingent on signing a broad and indefinite consent for release 13 and disclosure. 14 15 4. Whenever possible, medical records should be de- identified for purposes of 16 use in connection with utilization review, panel cr edentialing, quality assurance, 17 and peer review. 18 19 5. The fundamental values and duties that guide the safekeeping of medical 20 information should remain constant in this era of computerization. Whether they 21 are in computerized or paper form, it is critical that medical information be 22 accurate, secure, and free from unauthorized access and improper use. 23 24 6. Our AMA recommends that the confidentiality of data collected by race and 25 ethnicity as part of the medical record, be maintained. 26 27 7. Genetic informatio n should be kept confidential and should not be disclosed to 28 third parties without the explicit informed consent of the tested individual. 29 30 8. When breaches of confidentiality are compelled by concerns for public health 31 and safety, those breaches must be as narrow in scope and content as possible, 32 must contain the least identifiable and sensitive information possible, and must 33 be disclosed to the fewest possible to achieve the necessary end. 34 35 9. Law enforcement agencies requesting private medical informat ion should be 36 given access to such information only through a court order. This court order for 37 disclosure should be granted only if the law enforcement entity has shown, by 38 clear and convincing evidence, that the information sought is necessary to a 39 legitimate law enforcement inquiry; that the needs of the law enforcement 40 authority cannot be satisfied by non -identifiable health information or by any 41 other information; and that the law enforcement need for the information 42 outweighs the privacy interest of t he individual to whom the information pertains. 43 These records should be subject to stringent security measures. 44 45 10. Our AMA must guard against the imposition of unduly restrictive barriers to 46 patient records that would impede or prevent access to data needed for medical 47 or public health research or quality improvement and accreditation activities. 48 Whenever possible, de -identified data should be used for these purposes. In 49 those contexts where personal identification is essential for the collation of data, 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 26 of 37 review of identifiable data should not take place without an institutional review 1 board (IRB) approved justification for the retention of identifiers and the consent 2 of the patient. In those cases where obtaining patient consent for disclosure is 3 impracti cable, our AMA endorses the oversight and accountability provided by an 4 IRB. 5 6 11. Marketing and commercial uses of identifiable patients' medical information 7 may violate principles of informed consent and patient confidentiality. Patients 8 divulge informat ion to their physicians only for purposes of diagnosis and 9 treatment. If other uses are to be made of the information, patients must first give 10 their uncoerced permission after being fully informed about the purpose of such 11 disclosures 12 13 12. Our AMA, in collaboration with other professional organizations, patient 14 advocacy groups and the public health community, should continue its advocacy 15 for privacy and confidentiality regulations, including: (a) The establishment of 16 rules allocating liability for disclosure of identifiable patient medical information 17 between physicians and the health plans of which they are a part, and securing 18 appropriate physicians' control over the disposition of information from their 19 patients' medical records. (b) The establishment of rules to prevent disclosure of 20 identifiable patient medical information for commercial and marketing purposes; 21 and (c) The establishment of penalties for negligent or deliberate breach of 22 confidentiality or violation of patient privacy rights. 23 24 13. Ou r AMA will pursue an aggressive agenda to educate patients, the public, 25 physicians and policymakers at all levels of government about concerns and 26 complexities of patient privacy and confidentiality in the variety of contexts 27 mentioned. 28 29 14. Disclosure of personally identifiable patient information to public health 30 physicians and departments is appropriate for the purpose of addressing public 31 health emergencies or to comply with laws regarding public health reporting for 32 the purpose of disease surveillance. 33 34 15. In the event of the sale or discontinuation of a medical practice, patients 35 should be notified whenever possible and asked for authorization to transfer the 36 medical record to a new physician or care provider. Only de- identified and/or 37 aggregate dat a should be used for \"business decisions,\" including sales, 38 mergers, and similar business transactions when ownership or control of medical 39 records changes hands. 40 41 16. The most appropriate jurisdiction for considering physician breaches of 42 patient confidentiality is the relevant state medical practice act. Knowing and 43 intentional breaches of patient confidentiality, particularly under false pretenses, 44 for malicious harm, or for monetary gain, represents a violation of the 45 professional practice of medicine. 46 47 17. Our AMA Board of Trustees will actively monitor and support legislation at the 48 federal level that will afford patients protection against discrimination on the basis 49 of genetic testing. 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 27 of 37 1 18. Our AMA supports privacy standards that would require pharmacies to obtain 2 a prior written and signed consent from patients to use their personal data for 3 marketing purposes. 4 5 19. Our AMA supports privacy standards that require pharmacies and drug store 6 chains to disclose the source of financial support for drug mailings or phone calls. 7 8 20. Our AMA supports privacy standards that would prohibit pharmacies from 9 using prescription refill reminders or disease management programs as an 10 opportunity for marketing purposes. 11 12 21. Our AMA will draft model state legislation requiring consent of all parties to 13 the recording of a physician- patient conversation. 14 15 State Maternal Mortality Review Committees H -60.909 16 17 Our AMA supports: (1) the important work of maternal mortality review 18 committees; (2) work with state and specialty medical societies to advocate for 19 state and federal legislation establishing Maternal Mortality Review Committees; 20 and (3) work with state and specialty medical societies to secure funding from 21 state and federal governments that fully supports the s tart-up and ongoing work 22 of state Maternal Mortality Review Committees. 23 24 25 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 28 of 37 RECOMMENDED FOR REAFFIRMATION IN LIEU OF 1 2 (16) RESOLUTION 219 OPPOSE TRACKING OF PEOPLE 3 WHO PURCHASE NALOXONE 4 5 RECOMMENDATION: 6 7 That AMA Policies H -315.983, H -440.813, and H -95.932 8 be reaffirmed in lieu of Resolution 219. 9 10 RESOLVED, That our AMA oppose any policies, regulations, or laws that 11 require personally identifiable information associated with naloxone 12 prescriptions or purchases to be tracked, monitored, or utilized for non - 13 clinical or non- public health care purposes; and be it further 14 15 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for availability of naloxone as an over - 16 the-counter medication. (New HOD Policy) 17 18 HOD ACTION: Resolution 219 adopted as amended. 19 Policies H -315.983, H -440.813, and H -95.932 reaffirmed 20 21 RESOLVED, That ourAmerican Medical Associationoppose any policies that require 22 personally identifiable information associated with naloxone prescriptions or purchases 23 to be tracked or monitored by non -health care providers.(New HOD Policy) 24 25 Your Reference Committee heard testimony in strong support of the intent of Resolution 26 219. Your Reference Committee heard testimony supportive regarding the overall need 27 to increase access to and safeguard patient privacy and confidentiality with respect to a 28 prescription for naloxone. Your Reference Committee agrees that an individual should 29 not be discriminated against because his or her prescription history includes a 30 prescription for naloxone. Your Reference Committee further agrees that naloxone 31 shoul d be available over -the-counter (OTC) to help increase access to naloxone. 32 33 Your Reference Committee heard that our AMA is deeply engaged in each of these 34 issues. Your Reference Committee heard testimony that , while utilizing our current policy 35 on safeguarding patient privacy and confidentiality (H -315.983 Patient Privacy and 36 Confidentiality), our AMA has been able to advocate to the National Association of 37 Insurance Commissioners that a prescription for naloxone should never be tracked or 38 used by itself t o adversely affect an individual in any line of insurance. Your Reference 39 Committee heard that Massachusetts and Colorado are two states that have issued 40 bulletins based on AMA advocacy, making this point clear to all insurance carriers in 41 those states. Your Reference Committee heard that our AMA will take similar action in 42 any other state where this becomes an issue. Your Reference Committee agrees that a 43 naloxone prescription\u2014 by itself \u2014is not indicative whether an individual is at risk of an 44 opioid- related overdose. 45 46 Your Reference Committee heard that our AMA continues to advocate for 47 comprehensive public health and data surveillance on multiple aspects of the nation's 48 drug overdose epidemics, actions which include hosting broad, national stakeholder 49 meetings to identify best practices, advocate for standardization, and urging states to 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 29 of 37 use de- identified non- fatal and fatal overdose data to identify areas where targeted 1 prevention, treatment and harm reduction resources are needed. Your Reference 2 Committe e heard that current policy H -440.813, Public Health Surveillance, has been 3 utilized to advocate on issues of public health and data surveillance issues to groups 4 ranging from the National Governors Association to the National Association of 5 Attorneys General and the Pew Charitable Trusts. 6 7 Your Reference Committee heard that the position of our AMA on the accessibility of 8 naloxone over the counter, current policy H -95.932, Increasing Availability of Naloxone, 9 makes clear that \"Our AMA encourages manufacturers or other qualified sponsors to 10 pursue the application process for over the counter approval of naloxone with the Food 11 and Drug Administration.\" Your Reference Committee considered that our AMA has 12 supported and promoted FDA's actions to create labeling and other information to 13 support manufacturers to submit over the counter applications. 14 15 Your Reference Committee heard testimony in support of increasing access to naloxone, 16 reducing stigma and helping save lives from overdose. Your Reference Committee 17 heard that our AMA has engaged in ongoing efforts to accomplish the intent of the 18 resolution and much more, including helping enact laws that increase access in all 50 19 states, protect patient confidentiality in prescription drug monitoring programs, remov e 20 inappropriate insurance company actions concerning naloxone, support increased 21 distribution of naloxone and many other efforts. Therefore, your Reference Committee 22 recommends reaffirmation of H -315.983, H -440.813, and H -95.932 in lieu of Resolution 23 219. 24 25 Patient Privacy and Confidentiality H -315.983 26 27 1. Our AMA affirms the following key principles that should be consistently 28 implemented to evaluate any proposal regarding patient privacy and the 29 confidentiality of medical information: (a) That there exists a basic right of 30 patients to privacy of their medical information and records, and that this right 31 should be explicitly acknowledged; (b) That patients' privacy should be honored 32 unless waived by the patient in a meaningful way or in rare inst ances when 33 strong countervailing interests in public health or safety justify invasions of 34 patient privacy or breaches of confidentiality, and then only when such invasions 35 or breaches are subject to stringent safeguards enforced by appropriate 36 standards of accountability; (c) That patients' privacy should be honored in the 37 context of gathering and disclosing information for clinical research and quality 38 improvement activities, and that any necessary departures from the preferred 39 practices of obtaining pati ents' informed consent and of de -identifying all data be 40 strictly controlled; (d) That any information disclosed should be limited to that 41 information, portion of the medical record, or abstract necessary to fulfill the 42 immediate and specific purpose of di sclosure; and (e) That the Health Insurance 43 Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) be the minimal standard for 44 protecting clinician- patient privilege, regardless of where care is received. 45 46 2. Our AMA affirms: (a) that physicians and medical st udents who are patients 47 are entitled to the same right to privacy and confidentiality of personal medical 48 information and medical records as other patients, (b) that when patients 49 exercise their right to keep their personal medical histories confidential, such 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 30 of 37 action should not be regarded as fraudulent or inappropriate concealment, and 1 (c) that physicians and medical students should not be required to report any 2 aspects of their patients' medical history to governmental agencies or other 3 entities, beyond t hat which would be required by law. 4 5 3. Employers and insurers should be barred from unconsented access to 6 identifiable medical information lest knowledge of sensitive facts form the basis of 7 adverse decisions against individuals. (a) Release forms that authorize access 8 should be explicit about to whom access is being granted and for what purpose, 9 and should be as narrowly tailored as possible. (b) Patients, physicians, and 10 medical students should be educated about the consequences of signing overly - 11 broad consent forms. (c) Employers and insurers should adopt explicit and public 12 policies to assure the security and confidentiality of patients' medical information. 13 (d) A patient's ability to join or a physician's participation in an insurance plan 14 should not be contingent on signing a broad and indefinite consent for release 15 and disclosure. 16 17 4. Whenever possible, medical records should be de- identified for purposes of 18 use in connection with utilization review, panel credentialing, quality assurance, 19 and peer review. 20 21 5. The fundamental values and duties that guide the safekeeping of medical 22 information should remain constant in this era of computerization. Whether they 23 are in computerized or paper form, it is critical that medical information be 24 accurate, sec ure, and free from unauthorized access and improper use. 25 26 6. Our AMA recommends that the confidentiality of data collected by race and 27 ethnicity as part of the medical record, be maintained. 28 29 7. Genetic information should be kept confidential and should not be disclosed to 30 third parties without the explicit informed consent of the tested individual. 31 32 8. When breaches of confidentiality are compelled by concerns for public health 33 and safety, those breaches must be as narrow in scope and content as possibl e, 34 must contain the least identifiable and sensitive information possible, and must 35 be disclosed to the fewest possible to achieve the necessary end. 36 37 9. Law enforcement agencies requesting private medical information should be 38 given access to such inform ation only through a court order. This court order for 39 disclosure should be granted only if the law enforcement entity has shown, by 40 clear and convincing evidence, that the information sought is necessary to a 41 legitimate law enforcement inquiry; that the needs of the law enforcement 42 authority cannot be satisfied by non -identifiable health information or by any 43 other information; and that the law enforcement need for the information 44 outweighs the privacy interest of the individual to whom the information per tains. 45 These records should be subject to stringent security measures. 46 47 10. Our AMA must guard against the imposition of unduly restrictive barriers to 48 patient records that would impede or prevent access to data needed for medical 49 or public health researc h or quality improvement and accreditation activities. 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 31 of 37 Whenever possible, de -identified data should be used for these purposes. In 1 those contexts where personal identification is essential for the collation of data, 2 review of identifiable data should not t ake place without an institutional review 3 board (IRB) approved justification for the retention of identifiers and the consent 4 of the patient. In those cases where obtaining patient consent for disclosure is 5 impracticable, our AMA endorses the oversight and accountability provided by an 6 IRB. 7 8 11. Marketing and commercial uses of identifiable patients' medical information 9 may violate principles of informed consent and patient confidentiality. Patients 10 divulge information to their physicians only for purposes of diagnosis and 11 treatment. If other uses are to be made of the information, patients must first give 12 their uncoerced permission after being fully informed about the purpose of such 13 disclosures 14 15 12. Our AMA, in collaboration with other professional organizations, patient 16 advocacy groups and the public health community, should continue its advocacy 17 for privacy and confidentiality regulations, including: (a) The establishment of 18 rules allocating liability for disclosure of identifiable patient medical infor mation 19 between physicians and the health plans of which they are a part, and securing 20 appropriate physicians' control over the disposition of information from their 21 patients' medical records. (b) The establishment of rules to prevent disclosure of 22 identifi able patient medical information for commercial and marketing purposes; 23 and (c) The establishment of penalties for negligent or deliberate breach of 24 confidentiality or violation of patient privacy rights. 25 26 13. Our AMA will pursue an aggressive agenda to educate patients, the public, 27 physicians and policymakers at all levels of government about concerns and 28 complexities of patient privacy and confidentiality in the variety of contexts 29 mentioned. 30 31 14. Disclosure of personally identifiable patient information to public health 32 physicians and departments is appropriate for the purpose of addressing public 33 health emergencies or to comply with laws regarding public health reporting for 34 the purpose of disease surveillance. 35 36 15.

Knowing and 45 intentional breaches of patient confidentiality, particularly under false pretenses, 46 for malicious harm, or for monetary gain, represents a violation of the 47 professional practice of medicine. 48 49 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 32 of 37 17. Our AMA Board of Trustees will actively monitor and support legislation at the 1 federal level that will afford patients protection against discrimination on the basis 2 of genetic testing. 3 4 18. Our AMA supports privacy standards that would require pharmacies to obtain 5 a prior writt en and signed consent from patients to use their personal data for 6 marketing purposes. 7 8 19. Our AMA supports privacy standards that require pharmacies and drug store 9 chains to disclose the source of financial support for drug mailings or phone calls. 10 11 20. Our AMA supports privacy standards that would prohibit pharmacies from 12 using prescription refill reminders or disease management programs as an 13 opportunity for marketing purposes. 14 15 21. Our AMA will draft model state legislation requiring consent of all p arties to 16 the recording of a physician- patient conversation. 17 18 Public Health Surveillance H -440.813 19 20 Our AMA: (1) recognizes public health surveillance as a core public health 21 function that is essential to inform decision making, identify underlying causes 22 and etiologies, and respond to acute, chronic, and emerging health threats; (2) 23 recognizes the important role that physicians play in public health surveillance 24 through reporting diseases and conditions to public health authorities; (3) 25 encourages state legislatures to engage relevant state and national medical 26 specialty societies as well as public health agencies when proposing mandatory 27 reporting requirements to ensure they are based on scientific evidence and meet 28 the needs of population health; (4) recognizes the need for increased federal, 29 state, and local funding to modernize our nation's public health data systems to 30 improve the quality and timeliness of data; (5) supports electronic case reporting, 31 which alleviates the burden of case reporting on phy sicians through the 32 automatic generation and transmission of case reports from electronic health 33 records to public health agencies for review and action in accordance with 34 applicable health care privacy and public health reporting laws; (6) will share 35 updates with physicians and medical societies on public health surveillance and 36 the progress made toward implementing electronic case reporting. 37 38 Increasing Availability of Naloxone H -95.932 39 40 1. Our AMA supports legislative, regulatory, and national advocacy e fforts to 41 increase access to affordable naloxone, including but not limited to collaborative 42 practice agreements with pharmacists and standing orders for pharmacies and, 43 where permitted by law, community -based organizations, law enforcement 44 agencies, correctional settings, schools, and other locations that do not restrict 45 the route of administration for naloxone delivery. 46 47 2. Our AMA supports efforts that enable law enforcement agencies to carry and 48 administer naloxone. 49 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 33 of 37 3. Our AMA encourages physicians to co -prescribe naloxone to patients at risk of 1 overdose and, where permitted by law, to the friends and family members of 2 such patients. 3 4 4. Our AMA encourages private and public payers to include all forms of 5 naloxone on their preferred drug l ists and formularies with minimal or no cost 6 sharing. 7 8 5. Our AMA supports liability protections for physicians and other health care 9 professionals and others who are authorized to prescribe, dispense and/or 10 administer naloxone pursuant to state law. 11 6. Ou r AMA supports efforts to encourage individuals who are authorized to 12 administer naloxone to receive appropriate education to enable them to do so 13 effectively. 14 15 7. Our AMA encourages manufacturers or other qualified sponsors to pursue the 16 application process for over the counter approval of naloxone with the Food and 17 Drug Administration. 18 19 8. Our AMA supports the widespread implementation of easily accessible 20 Naloxone rescue stations (public availability of Naloxone through wall -mounted 21 display/storage units that also include instructions) throughout the country 22 following distribution and legislative edicts similar to those for Automated 23 External Defibrillators. 24 25 9. Our AMA supports the legal access to and use of naloxone in all public spaces 26 regardless of whether the individual holds a prescription. 27 28 29 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 34 of 37 RECOMMENDED FOR ADOPTION IN LIEU OF 1 2 (17) RESOLUTION 201 ENSURING CONTINUED 3 ENHANCED ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE VIA 4 TELEMEDICINE AND TELEPHONIC COMMUNICATION 5 6 RECOMMENDATION: 7 8 Alternat e Resolution 201 be adopted in lieu of 9 Resolution 201 to read as follows: 10 11 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association advocate that the 12 HIPAA enforcement moratorium for telehealth services be extended by 13 at least 365 days after the end of the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency, 14 during which time physicians and other affected parties shall not be 15 subject to HIPAA audits and other HIPAA enforcement activity relative to 16 telehealth . 17 18 HOD ACTION: Alternate Resolution 201 adopted in lieu of 19 Resolution 201 20 21 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association address the importance of at least 22 a 365- day waiting period after the COVID -19 public health crisis is over before 23 commencement of audits aimed at discovering the use of non- HIPAA compliant modes 24 and platform s of telemedicine by physicians. (Directive to Take Action) 25 26 Your Reference Committee heard positive testimony on the spirit of Resolution 201. 27 Your Reference Committee heard that our AMA has advocated in support of a transition 28 period to allow providers to come into compliance with HIPAA after the end of the public 29 health emergency without penalty. Your Reference Committee also heard that our AMA 30 does not have established policy on whether it should advocate for a transition period at 31 the close of the public health emergency. Your Reference Committee heard positive 32 testimony on the importance of delaying potential audits and the need to ensur e a 33 transition period so that telehealth services can continue for patients who do not have 34 access to HIPAA complia nt platforms. Testimony was offered in support of alternate 35 language that would further clarify our AMA's goal of allowing physicians time to 36 transition to HIPAA compliant platforms without the threat of HIPAA audits or other 37 HIPAA enforcement activity . While y our Reference Committee heard additional 38 testimony in support of language that would not specify a minim um time for the transition 39 period, your Reference Committee agrees with the testimony offered in support of the 40 365-day minimum transition period in Resolution 201. Your Reference Committee 41 determined that an alternate resolution would better reflect the intent of the original 42 resolution while addressing additional testimony calling on our AMA to continue 43 advocating that physicians are not subject to HIPAA audits and other HIPAA 44 enforcement activity during the transition period. Therefore, your Reference Committee 45 recommends adoption of alternat e Resolution 201 in lieu of Resolution 201. 46 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 35 of 37 (18) RESOLUTION 218 ADVOCATING FOR 1 ALTERNAT IVES TO IMMIGRANT DETENTION 2 CENTERS THAT RESPECT HUMAN DIGNITY 3 4 RECOMMENDATION A: 5 6 AMA Policy H -350.955 be amended by addition of a 7 fifth clause to read as follows: 8 9 1. Our AMA recognizes the negative health consequences of the detention 10 of families seeking safe haven. 11 12 2. Due to the negative health consequences of detention, our AMA opposes 13 the expansion of family immigration detention in the United States. 14 15 3. Ou r AMA opposes the separation of parents from their children who are 16 detained while seeking safe haven. 17 18 4. Our AMA will advocate for access to health care for women and children 19 in immigration detention. 20 21 5. Our AMA will advocate for the preferential use of Alternatives to 22 Detention programs that respect the human dignity of immigrants, 23 migrants, and asylum seekers who are in the custody of federal agencies. 24 (Directive to Take Action) 25 26 RECOMMENDATION B: 27 28 Policy H -350.955 be adopted as amended in lieu of 29 Resolution 218. 30 31 RECOMMENDATION C: 32 33 Title of Policy H -350.955 be changed to read as 34 follows: 35 36 Care of Women and Children in Family Policy Regarding Immigration 37 Detention 38 39 HOD ACTION: Policy H -350.955 adopted as amended with 40 change in title in lieu of Resolution 218 41 42 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association advocate for the preferential use of 43 Alternatives to Detention programs that respect the human dignity of immigrants, 44 migrants, and asylum seekers who are in the custody of federal agencies. (Directive to 45 Take Action) 46 47 Your Reference Committee heard that Resolution 218 aligns with current AMA pol icy 48 and advocacy efforts surrounding the health of immigrant populations at the border. Your 49 Reference Committee also heard that our AMA has strongly advocated in opposition to 50 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 36 of 37 family separation at ICE immigrant detention centers, detainment of undocumented 1 immigrant children, and supports finding alternatives to holding individuals within 2 detainment centers due to the negative health consequences of being held in detention. 3 Your Reference Committee heard individual testimony that noted this issue may be 4 better evaluated through a formal report ; however , several delegates noted that our AMA 5 is already active in issues related to immigration and our policy would benefit from this 6 addition. Your Reference Committee also heard testimony that there was relevant AMA 7 policy that could be amended to include the proposed language of this resolution. As 8 such, your Reference Committee recommends that , to consolidate policy, Resolution 9 218 be incorporated into current AMA Policy H -350.955. Additionally, your Re ference 10 Committee recommends that AMA P olicy H- 350.955 be adopted as amended with a 11 change of title that reflects the policy's broader application. 12 13 Reference Committee B (JUN- 21) Page 37 of 37 Mister Speaker, this concludes the report of Reference Committee B .
