The law provides an exemption for students signing a waiver that reviews the dangers of meningococcal disease and indicates that the vaccination has been declined. To qualify for this exemption, you are required to review the information below an d sign the waiver at the end of this document. Please note, if a student is under 18 years of age, a parent or legal guardian must be given a copy of this document and must sign the waiver. What is meningococcal disease? Meningococcal disease is caused b y infection with bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis . These bacteria can infect the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord called the \"meninges\" and cause meningitis, or they can infect the blood or other body organs. In the US, about 1,000 -1,200 people get meningococcal disease each year and 10 -15% die despite receiving antibiotic treatment. Of those who live, another 11-19% lose their arms or legs, become hard of hearing or deaf, have problems with their nervous systems, including long term neurologic problems , or suffer seizures or strokes. How is meningococcal disease spread? These bacteria are passed from person -to-person through saliva (spit). You must be in close contact with an infected person's saliva in order for the bacteria to spread. Close contact includes activities such as kissing, sharing water bottles, sharing eating/drinking utensils or sharing cigarettes with someone who is infected; or being within 3 -6 feet of someone who is infected and is coughing or sneezing. Who is most at risk for getting meningococcal disease? High-risk groups include anyone with a damaged spleen or whose spleen has been removed, those with persistent complement component deficiency (an inherited immune disorder), HIV infection, those trave ling to countries where meningococcal disease is very common, microbiologists and people who may have been exposed to meningococcal disease during an outbreak. People who live in certain settings such as college freshmen living in dormitories and military recruits are also at greater risk of disease from some of the serogroups . Are some students in college and secondary schools at risk for meningococcal disease? College freshmen living in residence halls or dormitories are at an increased risk for menin gococcal disease caused by some of the serotypes contained in the quadrivalent v accine, as compared to individuals of the same age not attending college. The setting, combined with risk behaviors (such as alcohol consumption, exposure to cigarette smoke, s haring food or beverages, and activities involving the exchange of saliva), may be what puts college students at a greater risk for infection. There is insufficient information about whether new students in other congregate living situations (e.g., residen tial schools) may also be at increased risk for meningococcal disease. But, the similarity in their environments and some behaviors may increase their risk. The risk of meningococcal disease for other college students, in particular older students and students who do not live in congregate housing, is not increased. However, quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine is a safe and effective way to reduce their risk of contracting this disease. In general, the risk of invasive meningococcal B disease is not incr eased among college students relative to others of the same age not attending college. However, outbreaks of meningococcal B disease do occur , though rarely, at college s and universit ies. Vaccination of students with meningococcal B vaccine may be recommended during outbreaks . Is there a vaccine against meningococcal disease? Yes, there are 3 different vaccine (Menactra and Menveo ) protects against 4 serotypes (A, C, W and Y) of meningococcal disease. Meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (Bexsero polysaccharide vaccine (Menomune) is recommende d for people age 56 and older with certain high -risk conditions. MDPH strongly recommends two doses of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine : a first dose at age 11 through 12 years and a second dose at 16 years. Individuals in certain high risk gro ups may also need to receive 1 or more of these vaccines based on their doctor's recommendations . In addition, adolescents and young adults (16 -23 years of age) may be vaccinated with meningococcal B vaccine, preferably at 16 -18 years of age, to provide short -term protection for most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Is the meningococcal vaccine safe? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems such as severe allergic reactions. Getting meningococcal vaccine is much safer than getting the disease. Some people who get meningococcal vaccine have mild side effects, such as redness or pain where the sh ot was given. These symptoms usually last for 1 -2 days. A small percentage of people who receive the vaccine develop a fever. The vaccine can be given to pregnant women. Is it mandatory for students to receive meningococcal vaccine for entry into seconda ry schools or colleges that provide or license housing? Massachusetts law (MGL Ch. 76, s.15D) requires newly enrolled full -time students attending a secondary school (those schools with grades 9 -12) or postsecondary institution (e.g., colleges) who will b e living in a dormitory or other congregate housing licensed or approved by the secondary school or institution to receive a dose of quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine. At affected secondary schools , the requirements apply to all new full -time residential students, regardless of grade (including grades pre -K through 8) and year of study. All students must provide documentation of having received a dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine at any time in the past (or a dose of quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine within the last 5 years), unless they qualify for one of the exemptions allowed by the law. Whenever possible, immunizations should be obtained prior to enrollment or r egistration. However, students may be enrolled or registered provided that the required immunizations are obtained within 30 days of registration. Meningococcal B vaccines are not required and do not fulfill the requirement for receipt of meningococcal vac cine. Students may begin classes without a certificate of immunization against meningococcal disease if: 1) the student has a letter from a physician stating that there is a medical reason why he/she can't receive the vaccine; 2) the student (or the stude nt's parent or legal guardian, if the student is a minor) presents a statement in writing that such vaccination is against his/her sincere religious belief; or 3) the student (or the student's parent or legal guardian, if the student is a minor) si gns the waiver below stating that the student has received information about the dangers of meningococcal disease, reviewed the information provided and elected to decline the vaccine . While not required, MDPH strongly recommends that anyone up to 21 years of age who is entering college receive a second dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine if their first dose was received before their 16th birthday, particularly if they are new residential students. College student s who do not live in campus -related housing and want to reduce their risk for meningococcal disease may also choose to be vaccinated, though it is not required. Adolescents and young adults (16 through 23 years of age) may also be vaccinated with a serogro up B meningococcal vaccine, preferably at 16 through 18 years of age, to provide short term protection for most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Talk with your doctor about which meningococcal vaccines you should receive. Where can a student get vaccinated? Students and their parents should contact their healthcare provider and make an appointment to discuss meningococcal disease, the benefits and risks of vaccination, and the availability of th ese vaccine s. Schools and college health service s are not required to provide you with this vaccine. Where can I get more information? Your healthcare provider The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Division of Epidemiology and Immunization at (617) 983 -6800 or www.mass.gov/dph/imm and www.mass.gov/dph/epi Your local health department (listed in the phone book under government) Waiver for Meningococcal Vaccination Requirement I have received and reviewed the information provided on the risks of meningococcal disease and the risks and benefits of quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine. I understand that Massachusetts' law requires newly enrolled full -time students at secondary schoo ls, colleges and universities who are living in a dormitory or congregate living arrangement licensed or approved by the secondary school or postsecondary institution to receive meningococcal vaccinations, unless the students provide a signed waiver of the vaccination or otherwise qualify for one of the exemptions specified in the law. After reviewing the materials above on the dangers of meningococcal disease, I choose to waive receipt of meningococcal vaccine.
