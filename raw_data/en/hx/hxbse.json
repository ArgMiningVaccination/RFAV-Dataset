One of the most effective ways to cleanse the body of harmful toxins and substances is through the feet. An ionic foot bath is a natural way to detox the body of heavy metals, toxins, and other unhealthy matter, while still providing a relaxing experience. Our feet handle way more stress that we realize and pampering our feet is a great way to help relax the entire body. Detoxification originated over 5000 years ago from the Eastern Indian traditions of Ayur Vedic medicine. To draw out impurities of the body, they used concentrated sea salt baths. Founded by this principle, we have developed the process of electrolysis to increase toxin detox results in a shorter amount of time. Electrolysis is the process of charging purified water with both positive and negative ions. Since toxins are also charged particles, they move through the blood in the feet. During an ionic foot bath, the toxins are naturally drawn to their opposite charge and then neutralized in the bath. The color change that you see in the foot bath correlates to what area of the body that the toxins are from. Once you start an ionic foot bath, you will begin to see the water change color. The colors show what specific organ/tissue is congested with toxins. For example, a yellow-green color would indicate toxins from bladder, female reproductive, kidneys, prostate, or urinary. Black flakes would indicate heavy metals, such as cadmium, cobalt, lead, tin, or vanadium. White foam would mean toxins in the lymphatic system or the lymph nodes. Ionic foot bath detoxification can also alleviate toxic congestion in the body, constipation, headaches, fatigue, kidney and bladder problems, skin conditions, and lung issues. After experiencing a few ionic foot baths, you will start noticing that the water becomes less discolored and remains more clear. This is a sign of being detoxed of toxic build-up in the body. You will experience increased energy, enhanced sense of calmness, clearer thought processes, etc. [Schedule](https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=14284582) your appointment today to cleanse your body and better your overall health!
