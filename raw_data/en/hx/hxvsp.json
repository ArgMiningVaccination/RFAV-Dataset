CM provides a care management/coordination team that helps increase member engagement, offers resources to fill gaps in care and develops personalized health goals using evidence-based clinical guidelines. This approach is essential to improving the health and well-being of the individuals, families and communities UnitedHealthcare Community Plan serves. CM provides: Market-specific care management encompassing medical, behavioral and social care. An extended care team including primary care provider (PCP), pharmacist, medical and behavioral director, and peer specialist. Options that engage members, connecting them to needed resources, care and services. Individualized and multidisciplinary care plans. Assistance with appointments with PCP and coordinating appointments. The Clinical Health Advocate (CHA) refers members to a Registered Nurse (RN), Behavioral Health Advocate (BHA) or other specialists as required for complex needs. Education and support with complex conditions. Tools for helping members engage with providers, such as appointment reminders and help with transportation. Foundation to build trust and relationships with hard- to-engage members. The CM goals are to: Lower avoidable admissions and unnecessary emergency room (ER) visits, measured outcomes by inpatient (IP) admission and ER rates. Improve access to PCP and other needed services, measured by number of PCP visit rates within identified time frames. Identify and discuss behavioral health (BH) needs, measured by number of behavioral health care provider visits within identified time frames. Improve access to pharmacy. Identify and remove social and environmental barriers to care. Improve health outcomes, measured by improved Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS\u00ae). Empower the member to manage their complex/ chronic illness or problem and care transitions. Improve coordination of care through dedicated staff resources and to meet unique needs. Engage community care and care provider networks to help ensure access to affordable care and the appropriate use of services.

You may only direct the member to another care provider type if that illness or condition may be better treated by someone else. Communication between care providers and members The UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Agreement is not intended to interfere with your relationship with members as patients or with UnitedHealthcare Community Plan's ability to administer its quality improvement, utilization management (UM) or credentialing programs.

Share findings of history and physical exams. 3. Discuss options (without regard to plan coverage), treatment side effects and symptoms management. This includes any self-administered alternative or information that may help them make care decisions. 4. Recognize members (and/or their representatives) have the right to choose the final course of action among treatment options. 5. Collaborate with the plan care manager in developing a specific care plan for members enrolled in High Risk Care Management.

The CA Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) requires members be assigned to PCPs. We encourage members to develop a relationship with a PCP who can maintain all their medical records and provide overall medical management. These relationships help coordinate care and provide the member a \"medical home.\" The PCP plays a vital role as a case manager in the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan system by improving health care delivery in four critical areas: access, coordination, continuity and prevention. As such, the PCP manages initial and basic care to members, makes recommendations for specialty and ancillary care, and coordinates all primary care services delivered to our members. The PCP must provide 24 hours a day, seven days a week coverage and backup coverage when they are not available. Medical doctors (M.D.s), doctors of osteopathy (DOs), nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) from any of the following practice areas can be PCPs: General practice Internal medicine Family practice Pediatrics Obstetrics/gynecology NPs may enroll with the state as solo providers, but PAs cannot. They must be part of a group practice. Members may change their assigned PCP by contacting Member Services at any time during the month. Customer Service is available 7 a.m. - 7 p.m., Monday through Friday. We ask members who don't select a PCP during enrollment to select one. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan may auto-assign a PCP to complete the enrollment process. Direct access for women's health care services Females have direct access (without a referral or authorization) to any OB/GYNs, midwives, PAs, or NPs for women's health care services and any non-women's health care issues discovered and treated in the course of receiving women's health care services. This includes access to ancillary services ordered by women's health care providers (lab, radiology, etc.) in the same way these services would be ordered by a PCP. Office hours and coverage UnitedHealthcare Community Plan works with members and care providers to help ensure all members understand, support, and benefit from the primary care case management system. The coverage will include anytime availability. During non-office hours, access by phone to a live voice (i.e., an answering service, care provider on-call, hospital switchboard, PCP's nurse triage) will immediately page an on-call medical professional so referrals can be made for non- emergency services. Recorded messages are not acceptable. Consult with other appropriate health care professionals to develop individualized treatment plans for UnitedHealthcare Community Plan members with special health care needs. Use lists supplied by the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan identifying members who appear to be due for preventive health procedures or testing. Submit all accurately coded claims or encounters timely. Provide all well-baby/well-child services. Coordinate each UnitedHealthcare Community Plan member's overall course of care. Accept UnitedHealthcare Community Plan members at your primary office location at least 20 hours a week for a one MD practice and at least 30 hours per week for a two or more MD practice. Be available to members by phone any time. Tell members about appropriate use of emergency Chapter 2: Care Provider Standards and Policies 25 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcareservices. Discuss available treatment options with members. Responsibilities of PCPs and specialists serving in PCP role Specialists include internal medicine, pediatrics, and/or obstetrician/gynecology In addition to meeting the requirements for all care providers, PCPs must: Offer office visits on a timely basis, based on the standards outlined in the Timeliness Standards for Appointment Scheduling section of this guide. Schedule member appointments directly. You are responsible for following up with members who miss appointments. Conduct a baseline examination during the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan member's first appointment. An Initial Health Assessment (IHA) must be completed within 120 days of enrollment. This consists of a history and physical examination and an Individual Health Education Behavioral Assessment (IHEBA). Follow the Staying Health Assessment (SHA) Periodicity Schedule. Find the SHA policy letter, forms, and provider training materials at dhcs.ca.gov For members younger than age 21, the California Child Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP) program's age appropriate assessment must be completed concurrently with the IHA. Be sure their immunizations are up to date. If the member requires a referral to a program such as California Child Services (CCS), Early Start or California Department of Developmental Services (DDS), perform the appropriate baseline health assessments and diagnostic evaluations to show that a member has an CCS-eligible medical condition. Treat UnitedHealthcare Community Plan members' general health care needs. Use nationally recognized clinical practice guidelines. Refer services requiring prior authorization to Provider Services or our Clinical or Pharmacy departments as appropriate. Admit UnitedHealthcare Community Plan members to the hospital when necessary. Coordinate their medical care while they are hospitalized. Respect members' advance directives. Document in a prominent place in the medical record whether a member has an advance directive form. Provide covered benefits consistently with professionally recognized standards of health care and in accordance with UnitedHealthcare Community Plan standards. Document procedures for monitoring members' missed appointments as well as outreach attempts to reschedule missed appointments. Transfer medical records upon request. Provide copies of medical records to members upon request at no charge. Allow timely access to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan member medical records per contract requirements. Purposes include medical record keeping audits, HEDIS or other quality measure reporting, and quality of care investigations. Such access does not violate HIPAA. Maintain a clean and structurally sound office that meets applicable Occupational Safety and Disabilities (ADA) standards. Complying with the CA DHCS Access and Availability standards for scheduling emergency, urgent care and routine visits. Appointment Standards are covered in Chapter 2 of this manual. Language Assistance Requirements \u2014 Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act Federal legislation requires that all limited English proficient (LEP) beneficiaries' language access needs be met for all medical appointments. To refuse an LEP beneficiary access to language services is a violation of that individual's civil rights. It also prohibits care providers from requesting a beneficiary to provide their own interpreter or rely on a staff member who is not qualified to communicate directly with the LEP individual. It is the care provider offices' responsibility to ensure that the qualified interpreter has been assessed for bilingual proficiency. Also, it is the care provider offices' responsibility to report languages spoken by care providers and/or office staff to the plan as well as any changes. Chapter 2: Care Provider Standards and Policies 26 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcareMeeting a patient's language needs requires collaboration between provider, health plan, and patient. Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act stipulates that both care provider and health plan are covered entities under the law, and therefore, we must work together to meet the language needs of our members. If you cannot identify the language needs of a member, call the plan to receive this information. Additionally, It is required that you document all interpreter services requests in the member's medical record, including refusal of services. IHA components and requirements PCPs are responsible for reviewing each member's IHA in combination with: Medical history, conditions, problems, medical/ testing results, and member concerns.

Results of the Initial Health Assessment review will be shared with you and published in the Annual Quality Management Program Evaluation. We thank you and your staff for participation in this monitoring activity. Staying Healthy Assessment (SHA) periodicity schedule Members must complete a SHA based on the following guidelines and time frames listed. Document a member's refusal to complete the SHA on the appropriate age-specific form and keep in their records. New members must complete the SHA within 120 days of the effective date of enrollment. The effective date of enrollment is the first day of the month following notification by the Medi-Cal Eligibility Data System (MEDS) that a member is eligible to receive services. Current members who have not completed an updated SHA must complete it during the next preventive care office visit, based on the SHA periodicity table. Pediatric members - Members 0 -17 years old must complete the SHA during the first scheduled preventive care office visit upon reaching a new SHA age group. PCPs must review the SHA yearly with the patient (parent/guardian or adolescent) before the patient reaches the next age group.

This helps to get accurate responses to sensitive questions. You should determine the most appropriate age, based on discussion with the parent/guardian and the family's ethnic/cultural background. Adult and senior members - There are no designated age ranges for the adult and senior assessments. It is intended for use by 18 to 55 year olds. The age at which the PCP should begin administering the senior assessment to a member should be based on the patient's health and medical status, and not exclusively on age. The adult or senior assessment must be re-administered every three to five years, at a minimum. You must review previously completed SHA questionnaires with the patient every year, except years when the assessment is re- administered.Although not required, SHA annual administration is highly recommended for the adolescent and senior groups because behavioral risk factors often change during these years.

California case management and care management Programs Enhanced Care Management and Community Supports are benefits that will replace Health Homes and elements of the WPC pilots. These offerings build on positive outcomes from those programs over the past several years. Enhanced Care Management and Community Supports are effective as of Jan. 1, 2022. To refer a member to any of the following case management programs, call the California Health Plan at 866-260-5785 . Ask for a referral to case management. Enhanced care management Enhanced Care Management is part of the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan benefits for eligible members. We connect members with complex health issues to care management services through California's Medicaid program. Enhanced Care Management offers care management services through a network of care coordination and community-based organizations. These care providers form a virtual support network for patients who have medical, mental health, substance abuse and social service needs. Care managers oversee Enhanced Care Management to provide care management, care coordination, care transition, individual and family support and social service supports. Services are available at no cost to qualified members. Members who qualify are: Individuals and families who both: - Are experiencing homelessness -Have at least one complex physical, behavioral or developmental health need and cannot take care of themselves, for whom coordination of services would likely result in improved health outcomes and/or lower utilization of high-cost services. Adults with: - 1. 5 or more ER visits in a six-month period that could have been avoided with appropriate outpatient care or improved treatment adherence; and/or -3 or more unplanned hospital and/or short-term SNF stays in a six-month period that could have been avoided with appropriate outpatient care or improved treatment adherence. Adults who: -Meet the eligibility criteria for participation in or obtaining services through: the County Specialty Mental Health (SMH) System and/or The Drug Medi-Cal Organization Delivery System (DMC-ODS) or the Drug Medi-Cal (DMC) program. And -Are experiencing at least one complex social factor influencing their health (e.g., lack of access to food, lack of access to stable housing, inability to work or engage in the community, history of ACEs, former foster youth, history of recent contacts with law enforcement related to mental health, substance use symptoms or associated behaviors); And -Meet one or more of the following criteria: High risk for institutionalization, overdose and/or suicide; Use crisis services, ERs, urgent care or inpatient stays as the sole source of care; 2 or more ED visits or hospitalizations due to SMI or SUD in the past 12 months; Pregnant and post-partum women (12 months from delivery) Community Supports Community Supports are flexible wrap-around services the Medi-Cal managed care plan will integrate into the population health management program. These services act as a substitute or help avoid utilization of other services, such as hospital or SNF admissions, discharge delays or ER use. Community Supports should be integrated with case management for members at medium-to-high levels of risk. They may fill gaps to address medical or other needs that may arise due to Chapter 4: Medical Management 46 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcaresocial determinants of health. As of Jan. 1, 2022, Community Supports includes: Housing transition navigation services Housing deposits Housing tenancy and sustaining services Respite Recuperative care (medical respite) Meals/medically tailored meals Sobering centers Case management We provide case management services to members with complex medical conditions or serious psychosocial issues.

Covered services include: Hospital emergency department room, ancillary and care provider service by in and out-of-network care providers. Medical examination. Stabilization services. Access to designated Level I and Level II trauma centers or hospitals meeting the same levels of care for emergency services. Emergency ground and air transportation. Emergency dental services, limited to broken or dislocated jaw, severe teeth damage, and cyst removal. We pay out-of-network care providers for emergency services at the current Medi-Cal Program rates at the time of service. We try to negotiate acceptable payment rates with out-of-network care providers for covered post-stabilization care services for which we must pay. Emergency room care UnitedHealthcare Community Plan members who visit an ER should be screened to determine whether a medical emergency exists. Prior authorization is not required for the medical screening. We provide coverage for these services without regard to the emergency care provider's contractual relationship with us. Emergency services, i.e. care provider and outpatient services furnished by a qualified provider necessary to treat an emergency condition, are covered both within and outside our service area. An emergency is defined as a medical or behavioral condition, which manifests itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, that a reasonable layperson possessing an average knowledge of medicine and health, could reasonably expect in the absence of immediate medical attention to result in: Placing the health of the person afflicted with such condition in serious jeopardy (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child), or in the case of a behavioral condition, perceived as placing the health of the person or others in serious jeopardy Serious impairment to such person's bodily functions Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part of such person Serious disfigurement of such person Emergency care resulting in admissions Prior authorization is not required for emergency services. Deliver emergency care without delay. Notify UnitedHealthcare Community Plan about admission within 24 hours, unless otherwise indicated.

Nurses in the Health Services Department review emergency admissions within one business day of notification. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan makes UM determinations based on appropriateness of care and benefit coverage existence using evidence-based, nationally recognized or internally-developed clinical criteria. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan does not reward you or reviewers for issuing coverage denials and does not financially incentivize Utilization Management staff to support service underutilization. Care determination criteria is available upon request by contacting Provider Services (UM Department, etc.). The criteria are available in writing upon request or by calling Provider Services . If a member meets an acute inpatient level of stay, admission starts at the time you write the order.Chapter 4: Medical Management 48 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcareFacility notification requirements Facilities are responsible for Admission Notification for the following inpatient admissions (even if an advanced notification was provided prior to the actual admission date): Planned/elective admissions for acute care Unplanned admissions for acute care SNF admissions Admissions following outpatient surgery Admissions following observation Admissions when UnitedHealthcare Community Plan pays claims Contracted facilities are accountable to provide timely notification to both the delegate and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan within 24 hours of admission for all inpatient and observation status cases. This information is needed to verify eligibility, authorize care, and initiate concurrent review and discharge planning. In maternity cases, notify vaginal delivery or C-section delivery on or before the end of the mandated period 48 hours or 96 hours, respectively. We require notification if the baby stays longer than the mother. In all cases, separate notification is required immediately when a baby is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. For emergency admissions, notification occurs once the member has been stabilized in the emergency department. Family planning Family planning services are covered when provided by care provider or practitioners to members who voluntarily choose to delay or prevent pregnancy. Covered services include the provision of accurate information and counseling to allow members to make informed decisions about specific family planning methods available.

Both the ACEs questionnaire and the PEARLS tool are acceptable for members aged 18 or 19 years. You may also use the ACEs screening portion (Part 1) of the PEARLS tool to screen adults 20 years and older. Screen members as often as deemed appropriate and medically necessary. Network care providers must attest to completing certified ACEs training on the DHCS website to continue receiving directed payments. The training is now available on acesaware.org . You will be prompted to create an account and provide Board Certification details and NPI. The training takes up to 2 hours to complete and includes a 12-minute video and multiple case studies. DHCS maintains a list of care providers who have self-attested to their completion of the training. We will use as the list to verify your attestation before processing your claims. Behavioral counseling interventions for alcohol misuse When a screening is positive, use a validated assessment tool to determine if unhealthy alcohol use or substance use disorder (SUD) is present. Validated assessment tools include: NIDA-Modified Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (NM-ASSIST) Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-20) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) For recipients with brief assessments that reveal unhealthy alcohol use, offer brief misuse counseling. You must offer appropriate referral for additional evaluation and treatment, including medications for addiction treatment, to recipients whose brief assessment demonstrates probable Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) or SUD. Alcohol and/or drug brief interventions include alcohol misuse counseling and counseling a member regarding additional treatment options, referrals or services. Brief interventions must include the following: 1. Providing feedback regarding screening and assessment results; 2. Discussing negative consequences that have occurred and the overall severity of the problem; 3. Supporting the patient in making behavioral changes; and 4. Discussing and agreeing on plans for follow-up, including referral to other treatment if indicated. Transplant services Major organ transplants are a covered benefit of the Medi-Cal program.

For any EPSDT, perform baseline health assessments and diagnostic evaluations to verify a member has a California Children's Services (CCS) eligible medical condition; work with the Local Education Agency (LEA) or Regional Center (RC) to develop an Individual Education Plan (IEP) or Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP); determine the appropriate strategies and services required based on the child's unique identified needs. Referral - Refer eligible members to the CCS program for comprehensive case management. Referral may be made by phone or same-day mail, if available. Follow the initial referral by submission of supporting medical documentation sufficient to allow for eligibility determination by the local CCS program. Only make referrals to CCS paneled providers and CCS-approved hospitals within the contracted network effective from the date of referral. Contact Information: San Diego County CCS: 619-528-4000California Children's Services (CCS) The CCS program provides diagnostic and treatment services, medical case management, and physical and occupational therapy services to children younger than 21 with CCS-eligible medical conditions.

If the local CCS program does not approve eligibility, the health plan remains responsible for the provision of all medically necessary covered services to the member. If the local CCS program denies authorization for any service, we remain responsible for obtaining the service, if it is medically necessary, and paying for the service if it has been provided. Development disability services and coordination with regional centers Developmental disabilities are severe and chronic disabilities due to a mental or physical impairment that begins before the member reaches adulthood. These disabilities include intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and disabling conditions related to intellectual disability or requiring similar treatment. The Department of Developmental Services (DDS) is responsible for a system of diagnosis, counseling, case management, and community support of persons with intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism and disabling conditions closely related to intellectual disability or requiring similar treatment. Referral - If you determine supportive services would benefit the member, refer the member to the Regional Center for approval and assignment of a Regional Center Case Manager who is responsible for scheduling an intake assessment. Determination of eligibility is the responsibility of the Regional Center Interdisciplinary Team. While the Regional Center does not provide overall case management for their clients, they must assure access to health, developmental, social and educational services from birth throughout the lifespan of an individual who has a developmental disability. Continuity of Care - The Regional Center will determine the most appropriate setting for eligible HCBS services and will coordinate these services for the member in collaboration with the PCP and health plan coordinator. The Care Coordinator and PCP continue to provide and manage primary care and medically necessary services. If the member does not meet criteria for the program or placement is not currently available, UnitedHealthcare will continue care coordination as needed to support the member's screening, preventive, medically necessary, and therapeutic covered services.First Steps program The First Steps Program is handled by the state of California and provides early intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities or developmental delays from birth to age 3 and their families. Referring a child Refer a child to First Step services if the child has a visual, hearing, or severe orthopedic impairment, or any combination of these impairments, or if the child potentially requires other developmental intervention services. The First Steps team will evaluate your request to determine eligibility, then a service coordinator will be assigned to help the child's parents through the process. The assigned coordinator from First Steps, who is employed by the state, will contact you to ensure all medically necessary covered diagnostic, preventive and treatment services are identified in the Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP). UnitedHealthcare Community Plan provides member case management and care coordination for the IFSP. If the child has complex needs, a care manager from UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will be assigned as well if we are aware of the situation. Full screening Perform a full screen. Include: Interval history Unclothed physical examination Anticipatory guidance Lab/immunizations (Lab and administration of immunizations is reimbursed separately.) Lead assessment Personal-social and language skills Fine motor/gross motor skills Hearing Mental health (Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening) Vision Dental Other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and measures as described on dhcs.ca.gov Without all these components, you cannot bill for a full screen. You may only bill for a partial screen.Chapter 5: Early, Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT)/Prevention 63 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcareInterperiodic screens Interperiodic screens are medically necessary screens outside the standard schedule that do not require the full screen. Use this screen to start expanded CCS services. Office visits and full or partial screenings happening on the same day by the same care provider are not covered unless medical necessity is noted in the member's record. Interperiodic screens are often used for school and athletic physicals. A physical exam may be needed for a certificate stating a child is physically able to take part in school athletics. This also applies for other school physicals when required as conditions for educational purposes. Lead screening/treatment United Healthcare Community Plan members shall receive Blood Lead Level (BLL) Testing at the ages of 6 months to 6 years old (i.e., 72 months). The California Department of Public Health's California Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch (CLPPB) issues guidance for all California providers based on these regulations and required blood lead standards of care, including guidance related to children enrolled in Medi-Cal. i. Provide oral, anticipatory or written guidance to the parent(s) or guardian(s) of a child that includes information that children can be harmed by exposure to lead. This includes deteriorating or disturbed lead-based paint and the dust from it, which are particularly at risk of lead poisoning from the time the child begins to crawl until age 6 (72 months of age). This information must be shared at each periodic health assessment, starting at six months of age and continuing until 6 years, or 72 months of age. ii. Order or perform BLL testing on all children based on the following: a) 12 months to 2 years (or 24 months) of age. b) When the health care provider performing a periodic health assessment becomes aware that a child 12 months to 2 years (or 24 months) of age has no documented evidence of BLL test results taken at 12 months of age or thereafter. c) When the health care provider performing a periodic health assessment becomes aware that a child 12 months to 2 years (or 24 months) of age has no documented evidence of BLL test results taken when the child was 2 years (or 24 months) of age or thereafter. iii. Whenever the health care provider performing a periodic health assessment of a child one year (or 12 months) to 6 years (or 72 months) of age becomes aware that a change in circumstances has placed the child at increased risk of lead poisoning, in the professional judgment of the provider. iv. Follow the CDC recommendations for Post-Arrival Lead Screening of Refugees contained in the CLPPB issued guidelines. v. When requested by the parent or guardian. vi. You are not required to perform BLL testing if: 1. A parent or guardian of the child, or other person with legal authority to withhold consent, refuses to consent to the screening. 2. If in your professional opinion, the risk of screening poses a greater risk to the child's health than the risk of lead poisoning. 3. You must document the reasons for not screening in the child's medical record. vii. Document in the children's medical record the reasons for not screening. You must help ensure to list the reason(s) for not performing the blood lead screening test in the child member's medical record. In cases where consent has been withheld, you must document this in the child member's medical record by obtaining a signed statement of voluntary refusal If the care provider cannot get a signed statement of voluntary refusal because the party that withheld consent declines to sign or is unable to sign (e.g., when services are provided through telehealth), document the reason for not obtaining a signed statement of voluntary refusal in the child's medical record. If you cannot get a signed statement of voluntary refusal because the party that withheld consent declines to sign or is unable to sign (e.g., when services are provided through telehealth), document the reason for not obtaining a signed statement of voluntary refusal in the child's medical record. We will identify, on at least a quarterly basis, all child members younger than 6 years who have no record of receiving a blood lead screening test Review the list of members in need, coordinate a visit to conduct the lead screening, and document required written or oral anticipatory guidance to the parent/guardian of that child. Chapter 5: Early, Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT)/Prevention 64 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcare We will continuously monitor the Lead Screening in Children HEDIS\u00ae measure specifically reporting rates of compliance with lead screening per practice, as applicable. Screenings may be conducted using either the capillary (finger stick) or venous blood sampling methods. The venous method is preferred. All confirmatory and follow- up BLL testing must be performed using the venous blood sampling method. Children identified with blood lead levels greater than () 10 micrograms per deciliter of whole blood (\u00b5g/dL) are targeted for outreach and follow-up treatment in collaboration with the CA Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) and the member's PCP to ensure the member is receiving follow-up and treatment. Follow-up activities could include referral, case management and reporting as set forth in the CLPPB guidelines. However, a provider may determine additional services that fall within the EPSDT benefit are medically necessary. Coding and reporting requirements When reporting BLL results and submitting claims, care providers must: Report EPSDT data to DHCS and the local children's preventive services using the CMS1500/UB-04 claim forms or their electronic equivalents (837-P/837-I). This must be done within 30 calendar days of the end of each month for all encounters during that month. Help ensure that blood lead screening encounters are identified using the appropriate CPT(R) codes. Electronically report all results to CLPPB. Targeted case management Targeted case management (TCM) consists of case management services for specified targeted groups to access medical, social, educational, and other services provided by a Regional Center or local governmental health program as appropriate. Identification - The five target populations include: Children younger than 21 years at risk for medical compromise Medically fragile individuals Individuals in frail health, older than 18 years and at risk of institutionalization Members in jeopardy of negative health or psychosocial outcomes Members infected with a communicable disease, including tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, or who have been exposed to communicable diseases, until the risk of exposure has passed Referral - Members who are eligible for TCM services are referred to a Regional Center or local governmental health program as appropriate for the provision of TCM services. Continuity of Care - UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is responsible for coordinating the member's health care with the TCM provider and for determining the medical necessity of diagnostic and treatment services recommended by the TCM provider that are covered services under the contract. Vaccines for Children program (VFC) The Vaccines for Children program provides immunizations. Immunizations offered in the state VFC program must be ordered from your office. We do not reimburse for the vaccine ordered from the VFC Program, but we reimburse for administering the vaccine. Vaccine administration fees are reimbursable when submitted with an appropriate CPT and modifier code. We cannot reimburse for private stock vaccines when they are available through VFC. Contact VFC if you have questions. Any child through 18 years of age who meets at least one of the following criteria is eligible for the VFC Program: Eligible for Medi-Cal. American Indian or Alaska Native, as defined by the Indian Health Services Act. Uninsured. Underinsured. (These children have health insurance, but the benefit plan does not cover immunizations. Children in this category may only receive vaccinations from an FQHC or RHC.

Medical records are generally kept for a minimum of five years unless federal requirement mandate a longer time frame (i.e., immunization and TB records required for lifetime). Quality audits We coordinate with your office to conduct Quality Audits including the Facility Site Review (FSR) and Medical Record Review (MRR). These Quality Audits are comprehensive evaluations of the facility, administration, and medical records. For an overview and forms related to these audits, go to UHCprovider.com/cacommunityplan > Quality Facility Site Review Resources . Initial medical record review (MRR) We review medical records of a new provider within 90 calendar days of the date we first assign members. We may defer that review an additional 90 calendar days only if the new care provider does not have enough assigned members to complete a review of the ten medical records. At the end of six months, if the provider still has fewer than ten assigned member records, we complete an MRR on the total number of records available and adjust the scoring based on the number of records reviewed. We conduct subsequent site reviews no later than three years after the initial MRR. We review sites more frequently per local collaborative decisions or when determined necessary based on monitoring, evaluation, or corrective action plan (CAP) follow-up issues. Care providers will notify us of a provider site relocation at least 30 days prior to the move so that Looking for something? In PDF view, click CTRL+F, then type the keyword.

However, if the provider notifies us after the move: -We complete the review within 30 days of notification of the move. -We allow assigned members to continue to see the care provider, however, new members will not be assigned to the provider until the site review is completed We review medical records to assess for format, legal protocols, and documented evidence of the provision of preventive care and coordination and continuity of care services. The medical record serves as legal proof that the patient received care. Incomplete records or lack of documentation implies the provider's failure to provide care. We review medical records using the most recent MRR Survey Tool at each provider site as part of the site review and every three years thereafter. -During any MRR, reviewers must have the option to request additional records for review. If we review additional records, we must calculate the scores accordingly. The medical record score is based on a survey standard of the ten randomly selected records per provider, consisting of five pediatric and five adult and/or obstetric records. For sites with only pediatric, only adult, or only obstetric patients, all ten records surveyed must be only in that preventive car The MRR compliance levels are as 80% Facility site review A site review is required as part of the credentialing process when both the facility and the care provider are added to our network. If a care provider is added to the network, and the facility has a current passing site review survey score, a site survey is not needed for credentialing or recredentialing. Facility site audit types 1. Initial Site Review All PCP sites serving our members must have an initial site review and receive a minimum passing score of 80% on the FSR Survey Tool. We may waive the initial site review for a pre-contracted care provider site if the care provider has documented proof that we completed a site review with a passing score within the past three years. 2. Subsequent Periodic Facility Site Review We conduct subsequent site reviews no later than three years after the initial reviews. We may review sites more frequently based on monitoring, evaluation, or CAP follow-up issues. 3. Medical Record Review See the Medical Record Review section. 4. Interim/Focused Facility Site Review This is a targeted audit of one or more specific areas of the FSR or MRR. We use focused reviews to monitor providers between site reviews to investigate problems identified through monitoring activities or to follow up on corrective actions. 5. Physical Accessibility Review Survey (PARS) This reviews the physical accessibility of provider facilities that serve a high volume of seniors and Persons with Disabilities (SPDs). These results are available to members through our websites and provider directories. FSR critical elements Sites must meet the nine critical elements: A PCP facility must correct any critical element deficiency identified during a site review, focused survey, or monitoring visit within 10 business days of the survey date. We verify the corrective actions within 30 calendar days of the survey date. The nine critical elements are: 1. Exit doors and aisles are unobstructed and escape is accessible; 2. Airway management equipment is onsite; 3. Only qualified/trained personnel retrieve, prepare or administer medications; 4. Office practice procedures are used onsite that provide timely physician review and follow-up of referrals, consultation reports and diagnostic test results;Chapter 9: Medical Records 79 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcare5.

HIPAA compliance - your responsibilities Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the United States health care system. While the Act's core goals were to maintain insurance coverage for workers and fight health care fraud and abuse, its Administrative Simplification provisions have had the greatest impact on how the health care industry works. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is a \"covered entity\" under these regulations. So are all health care providers who conduct business electronically. Transactions and code sets If you conduct business electronically, submit claims using the standard formats adopted under HIPAA. Otherwise, submit claims using a Clearinghouse. Unique identifier HIPAA also requires unique identifiers for employers, health care providers, health plans and individuals for use in standard transactions. National Provider Identifier The NPI is your standard unique identifier. It is a 10-digit number with no embedded intelligence that covered entities must accept and use in standard transactions. While HIPAA only requires you to use the NPI in electronic transactions, many state agencies require it on FFS claims and on encounter submissions. For this reason, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan requires the NPI on paper transactions. The NPI number is issued by the National Plan and Chapter 10: Quality Management (QM) Program and Compliance 84 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcareProvider Enumeration System (NPPES). Share it with all affected trading partners, such as care providers to whom you refer patients, billing companies and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Privacy of individually identifiable health information The privacy regulations limit how health plans, pharmacies, hospitals and other covered entities can use members' medical information. The regulations protect medical records and other identifiable health information. This includes electronic, paper or spoken data. They enhance consumers' rights by giving them access to their health information and controlling its inappropriate use. They also improve health care delivery by extending the privacy efforts of states and health systems to a national level. Security Covered entities must meet basic security measures: Help ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic protected health information (PHI) the covered entity creates, Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats, uses or disclosures of information not permitted or required under the Privacy Regulations, and Help ensure compliance with the security regulations by the covered entity's staff. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan expects you to comply with all HIPAA regulations. Find additional information on HIPAA regulations at cms.hhs.gov . Ethics and integrity UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is dedicated to conducting business honestly and ethically with you, members, suppliers and government officials and agencies. Making sound decisions as we interact with you, other health care providers, regulators and others is necessary for our continued success and that of our business associates. It's also the right thing to do.Compliance program UnitedHealthcare Community Plan has a compliance officer. The UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Compliance program incorporates the required seven elements of a compliance program as outlined by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines: Oversight of the Ethics and Integrity program. Development and implementation of ethical standards and business conduct policies. Creating awareness of the standards and policies by educating employees. Assessing compliance by monitoring and auditing. Responding to allegations of violations. Enforcing policies and disciplining confirmed misconduct or serious neglect of duty. Reporting mechanisms for workers to alert management and/or the Ethics and Integrity program staff to violations of law, regulations, policies and procedures, or contractual obligations. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan has compliance officers for each health plan. In addition, each health plan has a compliance committee consisting of senior managers from key organizational areas. The committee provides program direction and oversight. Reporting and auditing Report any unethical, unlawful or inappropriate activity by a UnitedHealthcare Community Plan employee to a UnitedHealthcare Community Plan senior manager or directly to the Compliance Office. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is an important part of the Compliance program. The SIU focuses on prevention, detection and investigation of potentially fraudulent and abusive acts committed by care providers and members. This department oversees coordination of anti-fraud activities. To facilitate the reporting process of questionable incidents involving members or care providers, call our Fraud and Abuse line or go to uhc.com/fraud . Please refer to the Fraud, Waste and Abuse section of this manual for additional details about the Chapter 10: Quality Management (QM) Program and Compliance 85 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcareUnitedHealthcare Community Plan Fraud, Waste and Abuse program. An important aspect of the Compliance program is assessing high-risk areas of UnitedHealthcare Community Plan operations and implementing reviews to help ensure compliance with law, regulations and policies/contracts. When informed of potentially inappropriate or fraudulent practices within the plan or by you, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will conduct an investigation. You must cooperate with the company and government authorities. This means giving access to pertinent records (as required by your applicable Provider Agreement and this manual) as well as access to office staff. If we establish activity in violation of law or regulation, we will advise appropriate governmental authorities. If you become the subject of a government inquiry or investigation, or a government agency requests documents relating to your operations (other than a routine request for documentation), you must provide UnitedHealthcare Community Plan with the details. You must also reveal what triggered the inquiry. Extrapolation audits of corporate-wide billing UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will work with the State of CA to perform \"individual and corporate extrapolation audits.\" This may affect all programs supported by dual funds (state and federal funding) as well as state-funded programs, as requested by the CA Department of Health and Human Services. Record retention, reviews and audits You must maintain an adequate record-keeping system for recording services, charges, dates and all other commonly accepted information for services rendered to our members. Records must be kept for at least 10 years from the close of the CA program agreement between the state and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan or another period as required by law. If records are under review, they must be retained until the audit is complete. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan and its affiliated entities (including OptumHealth) will request and obtain prior approval from you for the records under review or inspection. You agree to refund the state any overpayment disclosed by any such audit.If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the records has been started before the 10-year period ends, you agree to keep the records until one year after the resolution of all issues that come from it. The state may also perform financial, performance and other special audits on such records during business hours throughout your Provider Agreement. To help ensure members receive quality services, you must also comply with requests for on-site reviews conducted by the state or designee. During these reviews, the state will address your capability to meet CA program standards. You must cooperate with the state or any of its authorized representatives, the CA Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Office of Inspector General, or any other agency prior-approved by the state, at any time during your Provider Agreement. These entities may, at all reasonable times, enter your premises. You agree to allow access to and the right to audit, monitor and examine any relevant books, documents, papers and records to otherwise evaluate (including periodic information systems testing) your performance and charges. We will perform reviews and audits without delaying your work. If you refuse to allow access, this will constitute a breach of your Provider Agreement. Any referral request where the medical necessity or the proposed treatment is not clear will be discussed with the care provider. Complex cases may be brought to the UMC/medical director for further discussion. Individual(s) who can hold financial ownership interest in the organization may not influence the clinical or payment decisions. Possible request for authorization determinations include: Approved as requested - No changes. Approved as modified - Referral approved, but changed the requested care provider or treatment plan. (e.g., requested chiropractic, approved physical therapy). Office site quality UnitedHealthcare Community Plan and affiliates monitor complaints for Quality of Care/Services (QOC) Chapter 10: Quality Management (QM) Program and Compliance 86 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcareconcerning participating care providers and facilities. Complaints about you or your site are recorded and investigated. We conduct appropriate follow- up to assure that members receive care in a safe, clean and accessible environment. For this reason, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan has set Clinical Site Standards for all PCP office sites to help ensure facility quality. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan requires you and your facilities meet the following site standards: Clean and orderly overall appearance. Available handicapped parking. Handicapped accessible facility. Available adequate waiting room space Adequate exam room(s) for providing member care. Privacy in exam room(s). Clearly marked exits. Accessible fire extinguishers. Post file inspection record in the last year. Criteria for site visits The following table outlines the criteria used to require a site visit. When the threshold is met, we conduct a site visit based on UnitedHealthcare Community Plan policy. QOC Issue Criteria Threshold Issue may pose a substantive threat to patient's safetyAccess to facility in poor repair to pose a potential risk to patients Needles and other sharps exposed and accessible to patients Drug stocks accessible to patients Other issues determined to pose a risk to patient safetyOne complaint Issues with physical appearance, physical accessibility and adequacy of waiting and examination room spaceAccess to facility in poor repair to pose a potential risk to patients Needles and other sharps exposed and accessible to patients Drug stocks accessible to patients Other issues determined to pose a risk to patient safetyTwo complaints in six months Other All other complaints concerning the office facilitiesThree complaints in six months87 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcare Chapter 11: Billing and Submission Our claims process For claims, billing and payment questions, go to UHC provider.com . We follow the same claims process as UnitedHealthcare.

Also include the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments Number (CLIA) laboratory claims. General billing guidelines We only consider reimbursing claims if you meet billing and coverage requirements. Submitting an authorization does not guarantee we will pay you. Payment depends on the member's coverage on the date(s) of service, medical necessity, plan rules about limitations and exclusions, and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan policies. We don't reimburse excessive, inappropriate or non-covered charges. To comply with applicable standards, policies and law, we may adjust previous payments for services and audit claims.

Member ID card for billing The member ID card has the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan member ID number. Please use the member ID number for billing. Acceptable claim forms UnitedHealthcare Community Plan only processes claims submitted on CMS 1500 and UB-04 claim forms. Clean claims and submission requirements Complete a CMS 1500 or UB-04 form whether you submit an electronic or a paper claim. Clean claims have: A health service provided by an eligible health care provider to a covered UnitedHealthcare Community Plan member. All the required documentation, including correct diagnosis and procedure codes. The correct billed amount. We may require additional information for some services, situations or state requirements. Submit any services completed by NPs or PAs who are part of a collaborative agreement. Use their tax ID and NPI, and we will process the claims just like other physicians'. Claims and encounter data submissions You must submit a claim and/or encounter for your services. Professional and institutional encounter data is an itemized list of services provided to our Community Plan members. We encourage you to submit your encounter data at least weekly. Frequent encounter submissions allow us to support various state and federal regulatory requirements for reporting. Send encounter data using current ASC X12 format to Payer ID 87726 or check with your clearinghouse. We continuously monitor encounter data submissions for quality and quantity. Submission levels below the monthly threshold of 100% are considered non- compliant. The capitated medical group/IPA/FQHC or other submitting entity must correct any encounter errors identified by a clearinghouse or trading partner. As you are processing claims on our behalf, we expect all encounter submissions to be an accurate reflection of the original claim, paid or denied, without exception. All encounter data submitted to us is subject to state and/ or federal chart assessments on any or all of the medical group's/ IPA/FQHC's network care providers. We may review the completeness and accuracy of encounter data and ICD-10-CM and CPT coding. We notify the medical group/IPA/FQHC, in writing, of those audit results. The delegate may be subject to financial consequences if it, or another submitting entity, fails to submit or meet encounter data element requirements. In addition, they may be required to perform a complete medical record chart review of its network care providers with notice from UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Community Plan encounter data requirements We require capitated medical group/IPA/FQHCs and capitated facilities to submit timely and compliant encounter data. The capitated medical group/IPA/ FQHC, or other submitting entity, must certify the completeness and truthfulness of its encounter data submissions, as required by the state regulatory agency. The medical group/IPA/FQHC, or other submitting entity, must submit all professional and institutional encounter data for our members. Each submission must be in a HIPAA compliant format and contain the complete, accurate and valid diagnosis and procedure coding reported to the highest level Chapter 11: Billing and Submission 89 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcareof specificity utilizing industry standard code sets as required by CMS and as outlined in the technical report document for ANSI ASC X12N 837 Health Care Claims transaction implementation guide, for each date of service. Your clearinghouse provides the Payer ID for the submissions. Contact the Encounter Data Collection Team with any questions: encountercollection@ uhc.com . Care provider coding UnitedHealthcare Community Plan complies with Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) state standards based on claims data and chart review. Use the UnitedHealthcare ICD-10-CM Code Lookup Tool to find an ICD-10 code. Electronic claims submission and billing You may submit claims by electronic data interchange (EDI). EDI offers less paperwork, reduced postage, less time spent handling claims and faster turnaround. All claims are set up as \"commercial\" through the clearinghouse. Our payer ID is 87726. Clearinghouse Acknowledgment Reports and Payer- Specific Acknowledgment Reports identify claims that don't successfully transmit. We follow CMS National Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC) and National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC) guidelines for CMS 1500 and UB-04 forms. For more information, see EDI Claims . EDI companion documents UnitedHealthcare Community Plan's companion documents are intended to share information within Implementation Guides (IG) adopted by HIPAA. The companion documents identify the data content requested when it is electronically transmitted. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan uses companion documents to: Clarify data content that meets the needs of the health plan's business purposes when the IG allows multiple choices. Provide values the health plan will return in outbound transactions. Outline which situational elements the health plan requires. The companion document provides general information and specific details pertinent to each transaction. These documents should be shared with your software vendor for any programming and field requirements. The companion documents are located on UHCprovider.com/edi > Go to companion guides Additional claim submission requirements for professional claims Follow these tips for 837 claim formats: Use the 2010AA Billing Provider loop when the billing and rendering provider are the same. Use the 2310B Rendering Provider loop when the rendering and billing provider are NOT the same. Use one rendering provider per claim. Claims with multiple rendering providers will have to be formatted as separate claims using only the 2310B loop. Do not use 2420A. Clearinghouse and status reports Software vendor reports only show the claim left your office and was either accepted or rejected. They don't confirm the claim status. Acknowledgment reports confirm the information you sent has been received. Review your reports, clearinghouse acknowledgment reports and the status reports to reduce processing delays and timely filing penalties. For clearinghouse options, use our EDI at UHCprovider.com > Menu > Resource Library > Electronic Data Interchange > Clearinghouse .Chapter 11: Billing and Submission 90 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcaree-Business support Call Provider Services for help with online billing, claims, Electronic Remittance Advices (ERAs), and Electronic Funds Transfers (EFTs).

To find more information about EDI online, go to UHCprovider.com > Menu > Resource Library to find Electronic Data Interchange menu. Electronic payment solutions UnitedHealthcare has launched the replacement of paper checks with electronic payments and will no longer be sending paper checks for provider payment. You will have the option of signing up for Automated Clearing House (ACH)/direct deposit, our preferred method of payment, or to receive a Virtual Card payment (Virtual Card). The only alternative to a Virtual Card is direct deposit. Both of these options allow you to get paid quickly and securely. Why choose ACH/direct deposit? Direct deposit puts payment directly into your bank account Easy and fast way to get paid Improved financial control; no paper checks or remittance information to lose or misplace Ability to track information on online portal What does this mean to you? If your practice/healthcare organization is still receiving paper checks, you can enroll in ACH/ direct deposit for your claim payments now. If you don't elect to sign up for ACH/direct deposit, a Virtual Card will be automatically sent in place of paper checks. To sign up for the ACH/direct deposit option, go to UHCprovider.com/payment . If your practice/healthcare organization is already enrolled and receiving your claim payments through AHC/direct deposit from Optum PayTM or receiving Virtual Cards there is no action you need to take. If you do not enroll in ACH/direct deposit and currently receive your correspondence electronically, your remittance and Virtual Card statement will be available online through Document Library. Exclusions may apply in certain states or markets where paper checks will remain the primary method of payment. For more information on virtual cards and exclusions, go to UHCprovider.com/payment . All regulated entities have a Management Agreement with United HealthCare Services, Inc. (UHS), under which UHS provides a whole host of administrative services (many of which are provided to UHS by an Optum entity and then passed through to the regulated entities), including those of a financial nature. Those agreements are filed with the DOI in the regulated entity's state of domicile for approval. Completing the CMS 1500 Claim Form Companion documents for 837 transactions are on UHCprovider.com/ cacommunityplan . Look under Healthcare Providers in the EDI section. Visit the National Uniform Claim Committee website to learn how to complete the CMS 1500 form. Completing the UB-04 Form Bill all hospital inpatient, outpatient and ER services using revenue codes and the UB-04 claim form: Include ICD CM diagnosis codes. Identify other services by the CPT/HCPCS and modifiers.Chapter 11: Billing and Submission 91 | Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcareForm reminders Note the attending provider name and identifiers for the member's medical care and treatment on institutional claims for services other than non- scheduled transportation claims. Include the attending provider's NPI in the Attending Provider Name and Identifiers Fields (UB-04 FL76 or electronic equivalent) of your claims. Subrogation and coordination of benefit Our benefits contracts are subject to subrogation and coordination of benefits (COB) rules: Subrogation: DHCS may recover benefits paid for a member's treatment when a third party causes the injury or illness. COB: We coordinate benefits based on the member's benefit contract and applicable regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is the payer of last resort. Other coverage should be billed as the primary carrier. When billing UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, submit the primary payer's Explanation of Benefits or remittance advice with the claim. Skilled nursing facility billing Follow these SNF billing guidelines for custodial care: Type of bill 021X Revenue code 0160 Value code 23 to show the share of cost Value code 24 to show the accommodation code Bill accommodation codes with a Value Code 24 and billed as a cent amount. If billing a single Accommodation Code on row 1 of the claim, the dollar amount should be 0. When billing multiple accommodation codes on a single claim, the dollar amount should be associated with the line number Use value code 66 in field 41a, and enter the non- covered service (NCS) in the amount field Consistent with Johnson v. Rank, Medi-Cal recipients, not their care providers, may use their SOC funds to pay for non-covered services. If hospice is being performed in a SNF, the hospice provider should follow SNF billing guidelines. Hospital and clinic method of billing professional services Hospital and clinics must bill for professional services on a CMS 1500. The servicing provider's name is placed in box 31, and the servicing provider's group NPI number is placed in box 33a. Global days Global days include the billable period involving pre- operative visits, the procedure itself, and post-operative visits in which the care provider performs all necessary services. The visits must be performed by the same care provider or another care provider reporting the same TIN in either an inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, ambulatory surgical center (ASC), or physician's office. For reimbursement, we follow CMS guidelines and the National Physician Fee Schedule (NPFS) Relative Value File to determine global days values. To learn more about billing for global days and their values, read our global days policy on UHCprovider.com > Menu > Policies and Protocols > For Community Plans > Reimbursement Policies for Community Plan > Global Days Policy, Professional - Reimbursement Policy - UnitedHealthcare Community Plan . Correct Coding Initiative UnitedHealthcare Community Plan performs coding edit procedures based on the Correct Coding Initiative (CCI) and other nationally recognized sources. Comprehensive and component codes Comprehensive and component code combination edits apply when a code pair(s) appears to be related. These edits can be further broken down to explain the bundling rationale. Some of the most common causes for denials in this category are:Chapter 11: Billing and Submission 92 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcare Separate procedures: Only report these codes when performed independently: Most extensive procedures: You can perform some procedures with different complexities. Only report the most extensive service. With/without services: Don't report combinations where one code includes and the other excludes certain services. Medical practice standards: Services part of a larger procedure are bundled. Laboratory panels: Don't report individual components of panels or multichannel tests separately. Use of HIPAA compliant codes vs. local codes We require HIPAA compliant codes for billing of all physician and provider claims billed using the CMS 1500 format. We do not accept local codes for services billed on a CMS 1500. Payment for outpatient hospital services For consistent, accurate and compliant submissions, all participating and non-participating hospitals are encouraged to use only HIPAA compliant codes when billing for outpatient hospital services using the UB 04 format. Use of non-compliant codes may result in rejection by clearinghouses and other partners during claim submissions. For all participating hospitals with Medi-Cal based rates and for all non-participating hospitals, the following applies based on current DHCS outpatient payment methodology: Emergency Services Claims - Emergency services are defined as claims with a place of service 23 or revenue code 450. For any facility claims including a visit, the Medi-Cal rates for use of ER will apply. Other outpatient services - any local codes used by providers will be paid at Medi-Cal rates. For submission of encounters to the Department of Healthcare services, UnitedHealthcare will leverage HIPAA standard codes billed by providers. For local codes billed by providers, we will leverage diagnosis and procedure code mapping to provide HIPAA compliant codes to submit encounters to DHCS. The payment policy became effective July 31, 2019. Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments Submit your laboratory claims with the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments (CLIA) number. In box 23 of the CMS 1500 claim form, enter the 10-digit CLIA certification number for laboratory services billed by an entity performing CLIA-covered procedures. If you bill electronically, report the CLIA number in Loop 2300 or 2400, REF/X4,02. For more information about the CLIA number, contact the CMS CLIA Central Office at 410-786-3531 or go to the cms.gov . Billing multiple units When billing multiple units: If the same procedure is repeated on the same date of service, enter the procedure code once with the appropriate number of units. The total bill charge is the unit charge multiplied by the number of units. Billing guidelines for obstetrical services Follow this reporting procedure when submitting obstetrical delivery claims. Otherwise, we will deny the claim: If billing for both delivery and prenatal care, use the date of delivery. Use one unit with the appropriate charge in the charge column. Billing guidelines for transplants The fee-for-service medical program provides authorizations and payment for all medically necessary transplants. The exceptions are kidney and cornea transplants, which are the plan's responsibility. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan covers the transplant evaluation and work-ups. Claims payment requires Chapter 11: Billing and Submission 93 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcareprior authorization for the transplant evaluation. Gather all required referrals and evaluations to complete the pre-transplant evaluation process once the member is a possible candidate. Ambulance claims (emergency) Ambulance claims must include the point of origin, destination address, city, state, and ZIP. National Drug Code Claims must include: National Drug Code (NDC) and unit of measurement for the drug billed. HCPCS/CPT code and units of service for the drug billed. Actual metric decimal quantity administered. Submit the NDC on all claims with procedure codes for care provider-administered drugs in outpatient clinical settings.

Timely filing Timely filing issues may occur if members give the wrong insurance information when you treat them. This results in receiving: A denial/rejection letter from another carrier. Another carrier's explanation of benefits. A letter from another insurance carrier or employer group saying the member either has no coverage or had their coverage terminated before the date of service. The date on the other carrier's payment correspondence starts the timely filing period for submission to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. To be timely, we must receive the claim within the timely filing period from the date on the other carrier's correspondence. If we receive the claim after the timely filing period, it will not meet the criteria. You must submit within 90 calendar days of primary carrier's paid date. Timely filing limits can vary based on state requirements and contracts. If you don't know your timely filing limit, refer to your Provider Agreement. All the above must include documentation the claim is for the correct member and the correct date of service. Electronic claims A submission report alone is not considered proof of timely filing for electronic claims. They must be accompanied by an acceptance report. Paper claims Submit a screen shot from your accounting software that shows when you submitted the claim. The screen shot must show the correct: Member name. Date of service. Claim date submission (within the timely filing period). Balance billing Do not balance bill members if: The charge amount and the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan fee schedule differ. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan denies a claim for late submission, unauthorized service or as not medically necessary. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is reviewing a claim. You may balance bill the member for non-covered services if the member provides written consent prior to getting the service. If you have questions, please contact your provider advocate.95 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcare Chapter 12: Claim Reconsiderations, Appeals and Grievances There are a number of ways to work with us to resolve claims issues or disputes.

The State may impose more stringent requirements. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan and its in-network care providers may agree to more stringent requirements within care provider contracts than described in the standard process. Care provider dispute resolution process (PDR) What is it? The PDR process is available to provide a fair, fast and cost-effective resolution of care provider disputes, in accordance with state and federal regulations. We do not discriminate, retaliate against or charge you for submitting a care provider dispute. The PDR process is not a substitution for arbitration and is not deemed an arbitration. PDRs must be submitted in writing to: UnitedHealthcare Community Plan P.O. Box 31364 Salt Lake City, UT 84131-0364 When to use: If you disagree with our claim determination, you may initiate a care provider dispute. You must submit a care provider dispute, in writing, and with additional documentation for review. All disputes must be submitted within 365 calendar days following the date of the last action or inaction, unless your participation agreement or state law dictates otherwise. This time frame applies to all disputes regarding contractual issues, claims payment issues, overpayment recoveries and medical management disputes. What to submit: As the care provider of service, submit the PDR request form with the following information: Provider's name Provider's identification number Provider's contact information Member's name and health care ID number Claim number Item in dispute, detailed explanation of the issue, dates of service, procedure codes, amounts, etc. Clear rationale/reason for contesting the determination and an explanation why the claim should be paid or approved Disputes are not reviewed if the supporting documentation is not submitted with the request. Provider Dispute Resolution Form: We recommend you use the Provider Dispute Resolution Form when submitting a PDR. The form is UHCprovider. com/cacommunityplan under the Provider Dispute Resolution and Member Grievance and Appeals section. Where to submit: Mail related documents with your PDR. These may include a cover letter, medical records and additional information. In your PDR, please include any supporting information not included with your previous request. Send the PDR to: UnitedHealthcare Community Plan P.O. Box 31364 Salt Lake City, UT 84131-0364 Notes: We acknowledge receipt of paper disputes by mail within 15 business days. A written determination is issued within 45 business days. If we need more information, we return the dispute within 45 business days. We identify the information we need, in writing to resolve the dispute. You may submit an amended provider dispute within 30 working days from when you receive the returned provider dispute. Exclusions The following are examples of issues excluded from the PDR process: A member has filed an appeal, and you have filed a dispute about the same issue. In these cases, we review the member's appeal first. You can submit a care provider dispute after we make a decision on the member's appeal. If you are appealing on the member's behalf, we treat the appeal as a member appeal. An Independent Medical Review initiated by a member through the member appeal process. Any dispute you file beyond the timely filing limit applicable to you, and you fail to give \"good cause\" for the delay. Any delegated claim issue that has not been reviewed through the delegated payer's claim resolution mechanism. Any request for a dispute which has been reviewed by the delegated medical group/IPA/payer or Chapter 12: Claim Reconsiderations, Appeals and Grievances 98 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcarecapitated hospital/care provider and does not involve medical necessity or medical management. Claim management tips Do not let claim issues grow or go unresolved. Call Provider Services if you are unable to verify that a claim is on file. To avoid duplicate denials, do not resubmit claims on file unless submitting a corrected claim. File corrected claims and PDRs within contractual time requirements. If it is medically necessary to exceed the maximum daily frequency for a procedure, submit the required medical records. If you have questions, call Provider Services . As a Medi-Cal plan, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is the payer of last resort. This means we can only make payment after you bill the primary insurance and provide their EOB showing the outstanding balance. Attach the EOB to the claim when submitting to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Denial Your claim may be denied for administrative or medical necessity reasons. An administrative denial is when we didn't get notification before the service, or the notification came in too late. Denial for medical necessity means the level of care billed wasn't approved as medically necessary. If a claim is denied for these reasons, you may dispute through the PDR Process. Other top reasons for denial include: Duplicate claim - This is one of the most common reasons for denial. It means resubmitting the same claim information. This can reset the clock on the time it takes to pay a claim. Claim lacks information. Basic information is missing, such as a person's date of birth; or incorrect information, such as spelling of a name. You can resubmit this type of claim as a corrected claim with the correct information. Eligibility expired. Most practices verify coverage beforehand to avoid issues, but sometimes that doesn't happen. One of the most common claim denials involving verification is when a patient's health insurance coverage has expired and the patient and practice were unaware. Also, in a lot of cases, practices may check eligibility when an appointment is made, but between the appointment being made and the actual visit, coverage can be dropped. We recommend an eligibility check again once the patient has arrived. Claim not covered by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Benefit denials occur when a service or procedure is not covered under the member's benefit plan. Time limit expired. This is when you don't send the claim in time. Resubmitting a claim What is it? When you resubmit a claim, you create a new claim in place of a rejected one. A rejected claim has not been processed due to problems detected before processing. When to use it: Resubmit the claim if it was rejected. Common Reasons for Rejected Claims: Some claim rejections happen due to: Errors in member demographic data - name, age, date of birth, sex or address. Errors in care provider data. Wrong member insurance ID. No referring care provider ID or NPI number. How to use: To resubmit the claim, follow the same submission instructions as a new claim. To mail your resubmission, provide all claim information to: UnitedHealthcare Community Plan P.O. Box 31341 Salt Lake City, UT 84131 Corrected claim What is it? A corrected claim replaces a previously submitted claim. When to use: Submit a corrected claim to fix or void one that has already been submitted and/or processed.Chapter 12: Claim Reconsiderations, Appeals and Grievances 99 | UnitedHealthcare Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcareHow to use: Use the claims reconsideration application on the Provider Portal. To access the Provider Portal, sign in to UHCprovider.com using your One Healthcare ID. You may also submit the claim by mail with a claim reconsideration request form in selecting corrected claim as the reason for the submission. Allow up to 30 days to receive payment or response. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan P.O. Box 31341 Salt Lake City, UT 84131 Additional Information: When correcting or submitting late charges on 837 institutional claims, use bill type xx7: Replacement of Prior Claim. Do not submit corrected or additional information charges using bill type xx5: Late Charge Claim. To void a claim, use bill type xx8. Timely filing considerations What is it? Sometimes a member gives incorrect coverage information at the time of service. You have an opportunity to submit proof of timely filing after receiving a denial from a different insurance plan. This includes: A denial or rejection letter from another insurance plan. Another insurance plan's explanation of benefits. Letter from another insurance plan indicating: -Coverage termination prior to the date of service of the claim -No coverage for the member on the date of service of the claim A submission report is not considered proof of timely filing for electronic claims. It must be accompanied by an acceptance report. Timely filing denials are often upheld due to incomplete or wrong documentation submitted with a corrected claim request. You may also receive a timely filing denial when you do not submit a claim on time. How to use: Submit a corrected claim electronically, phone or mail with the following information: Electronic claims: Include the EDI acceptance report stating your claim was received timely by us or another plan. Mail corrected claims: Submit any of the documentation listed above that includes submission and acceptance of your original claim to us or another plan. Please ensure that your submission includes: -Correct member name. -Correct date of service. -Claim submission date. Additional Information: Timely filing limits can vary based on state requirements and contracts. If you do not know your timely filing limit, refer to your Provider Agreement. Questions about your appeal or need a status update? Call Provider Services . If you filed your appeal online, you should receive a confirmation email. Overpayment What is it? An overpayment happens when we overpay a claim that you do not dispute or contest. How to use: If you find an overpaid claim, send us the overpayment within the time specified in your contract. If we find an overpaid claim, we send you a written notice no later than 365 days from the date of the overpaid claim. If your payment is not received by that time, we may apply the overpayment against future claim payments based on Agreement and applicable law. If you prefer we recoup the funds from your next payment, call Provider Services .

Written consent is required.Request for Independent Medical Review (IMR) The member may request an IMR of a disputed healthcare service. A \"disputed healthcare service\" is any service eligible for coverage where payment has been denied, modified, or delayed by us or one of our contracted care providers because the service is not medically necessary. We provide the member with an IMR application form with any disposition letter that denies, modifies, or delays healthcare services. The following requirements are reviewed by the Department of Managed Health Care (DHMC) to determine if the request for an IMR is appropriate: You recommended a health care service because it is medically necessary and it is denied The member received urgent or emergency services determined to be necessary and it was denied The member was seen by a network care provider for the diagnosis or treatment of the medical condition (even if the health care service was not recommended by a network care provider) The disputed health care service is denied, changed or delayed by us based in whole or in part on a decision that the health care service is not medically necessary The member filed an appeal with us and the health care service is still denied, changed, delayed or the grievance remains unresolved after 30 days It has been six months from the date of appeal decision The DMHC submits the dispute to an IMR organization. The DMHC must provide a determination within 30 days of receipt of the application, or less or an urgent case. Processes related to reversal of our initial decision If the State Fair Hearing outcome is to not deny, limit, or delay services while the member is waiting on an appeal, then we provide the services: 1.

Find out how we follow federal and state regulations around false claims at UHCprovider.com/CAcommunityplan > Integrity of Claims, Reports, and Representations to the Government . The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) has provisions reforming Medicare and Medicaid and reducing fraud within the federal health care programs. Every entity that receives at least $5 million in annual Medicaid payments must have written policies for entity employees and contractors. They must provide detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws.

If you have a capitation agreement with us, we pay you a set amount for each member assigned to you per period. We pay you whether that person seeks care. In most instances, the capitated care provider is either a medical group or an Independent Practice Association (IPA). In a few instances, however, the capitated care provider may be an ancillary provider or hospital. The plan uses the term 'medical group/IPA' interchangeably with the term 'capitated care providers'. Capitation payment arrangements apply to participating physicians, health care providers, facilities and ancillary care providers who are capitated for certain UnitedHealthcare Community Plan products. This applies to all benefit plans for members: 1. Who have been assigned to or who have chosen a care provider who receives a capitation payment from UnitedHealthcare Community Plan for such member, and 2. Who are covered under an applicable benefit plan insured by or receiving administrative services from UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Additionally, capitated care providers may be subject to any or all delegated activities. Capitated care providers should refer to their Delegation Grids within their participation agreements to determine which delegated activities the capitated providers are performing on behalf of UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Delegating and subcontracting If you delegate or subcontract any function, the delegate or subcontractor must include all requirements of your applicable Provider Agreement and this manual.Capitation reporting We provide monthly capitation reporting of the assigned/attributed members to our participating, capitated care providers. Delegated medical management Purpose of medical management program The Medical Management Program helps determine if medical services are: Medically necessary. Covered under the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan benefit. Performed at both the appropriate place and level of care. Delegation oversight We may assign medical management to a medical group/ Independent Practice Association (IPA) with established medical management standards. We refer to the medical group/IPA as a \"delegate\". Care providers associated with these delegates may use the delegate's office and protocols for authorizations. The delegate's medical management protocols and procedures must comply with UnitedHealthcare Community Plan as well as all applicable state and federal regulatory requirements. Before assigning medical management functions, we assess the delegate. Within 90 calendar days of the Looking for something? In PDF view, click CTRL+F, then type the keyword.

We assess the delegate annually thereafter. We may also conduct an off-cycle assessment if needed. Based on the assessment findings, we may have the delegate develop and implement a corrective action plan to bring the medical group/IPA back into compliance. Delegates who do not achieve compliance within the established timeframes may undergo further corrective action. If the action is not successful, the medical management function will be withdrawn. Appeals When we review a member or care provider's adverse determination appeal from a delegate, we use Interqual as the externally licensed medical management guidelines. This happens even if the delegate used different externally licensed medical management guidelines to make the determination. Semi-annual reporting The delegate provides us with semi-annual reports as outlined in the delegation agreement. Reports must meet applicable requirements and accreditation standards. Determining medical necessity Delegates review nationally recognized criteria to determine medical necessity and appropriate level of care for services. This includes Medi-Cal coverage guidelines. For services not addressed in Medicaid coverage guidelines, delegates use our medical policies. If other nationally recognized criteria disagree with Medi-Cal coverage guidelines, delegates follow Medi-Cal coverage guidelines. Members may call the delegate's general number (or the number listed in the denial letters) to request individual eligibility and benefit criteria. They may also call our Member Services department. NCQA Accreditation standards require all health care organizations, health plans and delegates distribute a statement to members, care providers and employees who make utilization management (UM) decisions. The statement must note the following: UM decision-making is based only on appropriateness of care, service and coverage. You or others are not rewarded for issuing denials or encouraging decisions that result in under-utilization Care provider requirements Render covered services at the most appropriate level of care based on nationally recognized criteria. With few exceptions, we do not reimburse for non-covered services and those not medically necessary. We do not reimburse for the wrong procedures (e.g., notification requirements, preauthorization, verification guarantee process). Authorization receipts do not affect how payment policies determine reimbursement. We nor the member are responsible for reimbursing medical services, admissions, inappropriate facility days, and/or medically necessary services if you did not obtain required prior authorization. Regardless of the Medical Management Program determination, the decision to render medical services lies with the member and you, as the attending care provider. If you and the member decide to go forward with the medical services after UnitedHealthcare Community Plan or the delegate deny preauthorization, no care provider, facility or ancillary services will be reimbursed. The delegate's medical director can discuss the decisions and criteria with the member. The delegate also makes the medical policy decisions available upon request. Delegate training attestation UnitedHealthcare Community Plan delegates are required to provide attestation of the completion of new DHCS-required provider training. Attestation of new provider training form is available. Please contact your assigned physician advocate for the form or additional information. Second opinion Members have the right to second opinions. The delegate will provide a second opinion when either the member or a qualified health care professional requests it. Qualified health care professionals must provide the member with second opinions at no cost. There is no limitation for additional opinions.Chapter 14: Additional Information for Capitated/Delegated Care Providers 109 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcareMedical management denials/adverse determinations UnitedHealthcare Community Plan or a delegate may issue a denial when a non-covered benefit is requested but deemed not medically necessary. This may also happen when we receive insufficient information.

We or the delegate must also state the decision to delay a service based on medical necessity or benefit coverage appropriate to the member's medical condition, in accordance with the applicable state and federal law. The plan and delegates base all authorization decisions on sound clinical evidence, including medical record review, consultation with the treating care providers, and review of nationally recognized criteria.

Continuity of care Continuity of care lets members temporarily continue receiving services from a non-participating care provider. It is intended to last a short period. The delegate facilitates continuity of care for medically necessary covered services. If a member entering the health plan is receiving medically necessary services (in addition to or other than prenatal services) the day before enrollment, the health plan covers the continued costs of such services without prior approval. This is regardless of whether in-network or out-of-network care providers grant these services. The health plan provides continuation of such services for the lesser of (1) 60 calendar days or (2) until the member has transferred without disruption of care to an in-network care provider. For members eligible for care management, the new health plan provides service continuation authorized by the prior health plan for up to 60 calendar days after the member's enrollment in the new health plan. Services will not be reduced until the new health plan assesses the situation. Pregnant members may receive services from their prenatal care provider (whether in-network or out-of- network) under the continuity of care policy without prior authorization through the postpartum period (defined as 60 calendar days from date of birth). A member should not continue care with a nonparticipating care provider without formal approval by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan or the delegate. Except for emergent or urgent out-of-area (OOA) care, payment for services performed by a non-participating medical group/IPA become the member's responsibility. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan (or the delegate) reviews all requests for continuity of care. We consider the member's condition and the potential effect on the member's treatment. We also consider how changing the care provider can affect the health outcome. A member may request to continue covered services with a care provider who has terminated from UnitedHealthcare Community Plan for reasons other than cause or disciplinary action. As the care provider, you must agree in writing: To agree to the same contractual terms and conditions imposed on participating care providers, including credentialing, facility privileging, utilization review, peer review and quality assurance requirements; and To be compensated at rates and payment methods similar to those used by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan and participating care providers granting similar services that are not capitated and are practicing in the same geographic area. Authorization log and denial log submission Authorization logs for all inpatient acute, observation status and SNF cases must be accurately submitted to clinicaloperations@uhc.com . When no inpatient acute, observation statuses or SNF cases are active, the delegate must submit its weekly authorization log indicating either \"no activity\" or \"no admissions\" for each designated admission service type specified in this section and for the applicable reporting time. Authorization logs covering facility and SNF daily information includes: Member ID Member name Member date of birth Attending care provider: (Name and address, with TIN if available) Facility care provider: (Name and address, with TIN if available) Admitting diagnosis (ICD-10-CM or its successor code) Planned and actual admission dates Planned and actual discharge dates Level of care (i.e., bed type, observation status, outpatient procedures at acute facilities) Length of stay (LOS) (i.e., number of days approved, as well as the number of days denied) Procedure/surgery (CPT Code) Discharge disposition Service type Authorization number (if available)Chapter 14: Additional Information for Capitated/Delegated Care Providers 113 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan California v 63.10.2021 \u00a9 2022 UnitedHealthcareThe delegate must clearly define medical necessity and authorizing outpatient services paid as either shared risk or plan risk per the medical group/IPA contract.
