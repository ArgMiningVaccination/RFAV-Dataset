The study, conducted by researchers at Immunity Therapy Center (ITC), found that VR meditation was able to significantly reduce anxiety, stress, and fatigue in cancer patients. The study participants were randomly assigned to either a VR meditation group or a control group. The VR meditation group received 10-minute VR meditation sessions twice a week for four weeks. The control group did not receive any VR meditation sessions. At the end of the study, the VR meditation group had significantly lower levels of anxiety, stress, and fatigue than the control group. The VR meditation group also had significantly higher levels of relaxation and well-being. The results show a significant and noteworthy increase of patient reported outcomes of mental and physical health post-VR treatment vs the pre-VR treatment for the test group. \"This study provides strong evidence that VR meditation can be an effective way to reduce cancer-related anxiety, stress, and fatigue,\" said Dr. Carlos Bautista, MD, ITC's Founder and Chief Medical Officer.\"VR meditation is a safe and easy-to-use intervention that can be delivered in a clinical setting or at home.
