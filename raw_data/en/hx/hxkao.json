However the interaction and contribution of the individual constituents assayed singularly and in combination remains relatively unexplored. To investigate these possible interactions, various essentia l oil constituents (EOC's) were combined and the interactions on their antimalarial and toxicity properties determined using the tritiated hypoxanthin e incorporation and the tetrazolium-based cellular viability assays, respectively. In combination, two inactive values synergistic a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum . This interaction was comparable to that between the potent E- and Z-(\u00b1)-nerolidol (IC50 value: M) (FIC=0.01). also potentiated the toxicity ( FIC=0.001) of each molecule. A similar increase in toxicity was noted between -cymene and -terpinene, as well as E- and Z-(\u00b1)-nerolidol and ( )-pulegone. These results show that the pharmacological activities of individual EOC's can vary greatly when used in combination, and show potential as adjuvants in the elimination of malaria infections.\u00a9 2010 SAAB.

Introduction If medical science has to only rely on monotherapy alone to eradicate disease, it would implic ate a serious catastrophe to human health as parasitic resistance is in creasing at an unpr ecedented rate (Cassella et al., 2002; Cox et al., 2001 ). To counteract this increase in resistance, combination therapy has been implemented to ensuresuccessful treatment of malaria infections. In South Africa, the current antimalarials used in combination therapy includelumefantrine with artemether and q uinine with either doxycycline or clindamycin ( South African Department of Health, 2009 ). However, another concern is the possibility of increased cytotoxicity following the addition of two agents which mayinteract with each other. Similarl y, the cytotoxicity of an essential oil may be changed by the presence of other compounds, where thecompounds may potentiate each other's activity or complex together to enhance overall toxi city or alter the ir respective bioavailability such that their the rapeutic range i s exceeded. The interaction between two or more m olecules is said to be synergistic if the potency of the combination is higher than the expectedactivity of the individual molecule. However, if the potency of thecombination is lower, then the end result is defined as anantagonistic interaction ( Bell, 2005 ). It has been claimed that the most dominating constituents in the essential oil are those eliciting the activity attributed to the whole oil ( Nakatsu et al., 2000 ). Despite this fact, constituents in low concentrations are often found to be as effective as theprincipal constituent ( Cassella et al., 2002; Kaur Nakatsu et al., 2000 ). Moreover, synergistic and antagonistic effects could also be achieved by using the essential oils incombination, but also by combining the essential oils with other Corresponding author.

However, there are few published studies investigating such interactions ( Cassella et al., 2002; Kamatou et 2009b; Van Vuuren et al., 2009a ). Studies on these interactions are vital, since essential oils have great potential asadjuvants in the symptomatic management or treatment of a widerange of health problems ( Cowan, 1996; De Smet, 1997 ). Several studies have shown the antimalarial activity of essential oils isolated from plants such as Cochlospermum (Benoit-Vical et al., 1999 ),Helichrysum (Van Vuuren et al., 2006 ),Lippia (Valentin et al., 1995 ),Salvia (Kamatou et al., 2005 ),Tetradenia (Campbell et al., 1997 )a n d Virola (Lopes et al., 1999 ). Although these studies have determined the composition and biological activity of the essential oil, there has been little or nowork done with regards to which of the major and/or minorconstituents are responsible for the inhibitory activity of the malaria parasite. Since the essential oil is composed of numerous EOC's, it is likely that an interaction will existbetween two or more of the EOC's. To examine this possibility,selected EOC's with varying activity profiles were combinedand their antimalarial and toxicity properties recorded. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Essential oil constituents Selected essential oil constituents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and the purity and percentage compositionverified to the supplier's specifications by gas chromatography(minimum purity 95%). 2.2. Antimalarial activity A chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum (FCR-3) was continuously maintained in vitro according to themethod of Jensen and Trager (1976) and Van Zyl et al. (2006) and synchronised using the 5% methodologyas described by Lambros and Vanderberg (1979) . To determine the effects of the EOC's on parasite growth, the basic method oftritiated hypoxanthine uptake assay according to Desjardins et al. (1979) was modified and used to accommodate testing of select EOC's in combination. These combinations were repeated in triplicate to confirm consistency. Based on theantimalarial activity of the individual EOC's, eight combina-tions were selected as seen in Table 1 , and one of the most active EOC was combined with quinine. In this assay a parasitesuspension consisting predominantly of the ring stage, wasadjusted to 0.5% parasitaemia and 1% haematocrit and platedout with various combined ratios and concentrations of the two test compounds for 24 h. Six fixed ratios of the two EOC's or EOC and quinine were prepared such that as the concentrationof the EOC increased, the concentration of the other EOC/quinine decreased. The concentrations chosen for the ratioswere based on the concentration of the individual EOC orquinine required to inhibit 50% parasite growth (IC50 value).Positive controls containing only one compound were alsoprepared. From each of the fixed ratios, a further six 1 in 10dilutions were prepared such as to determine the IC50 value. All assays were carried out using untreated parasites and uninfectedred blood cells as controls. After 24 h, labelled 3H-hypoxan- thine was added and 24 h thereafter the3H-DNA harvested on glass fibre filter paper with a Titertek\u00ae cell harvester. The IC50 value was determined for each ratio from the log sigmoid doseresponse curve generated by the Enzfitter\u00ae software. 2.3. MTT toxicity assay The transformed human kidney epithelial (Graham) cells were continuously maintained in vitro at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO 2 according to the method of Mosmann (1983) and Van Zyl et al. (2006) . The MTT [3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazol-2yl]-2,5-diphenyl- 2H-tetrazolium bromide]-microculture cellular viability assaywas used to determine the interaction of the EOC's/controls onthe growth of human cells. The trypsinized cell suspension wasadjusted and 0.5 million cells/mL plated out with the twoEOC's/controls as described for the antimalarial combinationassay. After 44 h of incubation, 20.1 mM MTT (USB) was added to the plates and incubated for a further 4 h. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to stop the reaction and dissolvethe formazan crystals. The absorbance was read at the testwavelength of 540 nm and reference wavelength of 690 nm andthe percentage cellular viability calculated with the appropriatecontrols taken into account. The concentration that inhibited50% of cellular growth (IC50 value) was determined for eachratio from the log sigmoid dose response curve generated by the Enzfitter\u00ae software. 2.4. Data analysis The IC50 values of each ratio was determined and the type of interaction determined in two ways, namely an isobologram anddetermination of the sum fractional inhibitory concentration(FIC) value for all ratios and individual EOC's/controls. The data points for construction of the isobolograms were obtainedTable 1 The combined interaction between two essential oil constituents or an essentialoil constituent and control drug on the in vitro growth of P. falciparum and human kidney epithelial cells. EOC 1 EOC 2/control drug FIC value Interaction Antimalarial interactions Zyl et al. / South African Journal of Botany 76 (2010) 662 -667for the various ratios by plotting the IC50 (on the Y-axis). Values on the isobologram lying above the line were interpreted as being antagonistic, below assynergistic and those on or near the line as additive. It must benoted that there may be some points on the isobologramsoverlying each other and sometimes cannot be clearly seen.Secondly, to verify the interaction read from the isobologram, theFIC of the two selected EOC's (1 and 2) used in the combination was calculated for each combination according thefollowing equation: FIC\u00bc IC5012in combination IC501alone+IC5012in combination IC502alone Values from FIC calculations were interpreted as follows: b0.5 as synergistic, 0.5 -1.0 as additive, N1.0 as while that N2.0 as antagonistic ( Bell, 2005 ). Each combination was done in triplicate to confirm consistency.3. Results and discussion 3.1. Antimalarial activity of the combined essential oil cons tituents Essential oils have widely been reported to possess in vitro and in vivo antimalarial activity at relatively low concentrations(Kamatou et al., 2008b; et al., 1999; Tchoumbougnang et al., 2005; Van Zyl et al., 2006 ). However, the activity of the individual and combined effect of the EOC's has not been extensively investigated. When two EOC's were combined and assessed for their antiplasmodial activity the overall interaction between thevarious combinations were found to be synergistic, although tovarying degrees ( Table 1 ;Fig. 1 B). The combination between the least active and most active EOC's, namely, p-cymene (1528.8\u00b1 44.9M) and E-a n d Z-(\u00b1)-nerolidol (0.9\u00b10.3 M) (Van Zyl et al., 2006) displayed a pronounced s ynergistic interaction ( Fig. 1 B).E- andZ-(\u00b1)-Nerolidol with its reported mechanism of action of interfering with isopre noid biosynthesis ( G o u l a r te ta l . ,2 0 0 4 ) potentiated the antimalarial activity of p-cymene which had 0.75 1.00 1.250.000.250.500.751.001.25 E- and Z-(\u00b1)-Nerolidol -TerpineneP. falciparum 0.0 0.5 individual (-)-PulegoneHuman epithelial cellsA CDB Fig. 1.

Van Zyl et al. / South African Journal of Botany 76 (2010) 662 -667minimal activity when used indi vidually. It is possible that E-a n d Z-(\u00b1)-nerolidol might assist p-cymene to reach the site of action in the parasites, or they may have acted on the complementary targets(Aqil et al., 2007 ). This latter synergistic interaction could account for the good antimalarial activity of the volatile oils from Virola surinamensis , which predominantly consisted of ). It was reported that 100 g/ml of this oil and nerolidol inhibited 100% development of the young trophozoites to schizont stage withouthaemozoin formation over 48 h of treatment. The promisingantimalarial activity of this oil could also have been due to thepotent synergistic interaction between p-cymene with nerolidol Whereas nerolidol and -pinene (1.2\u00b10.2 M) have shown potent antimalarial activity, p-cymene, -terpinene and -pinene (318.5\u00b135.6 M) probably did not significantly contribute to the overall effect when working individually ( Van Zyl et al., 2006 ). This illustrates the importance of considering the combined effectof EOC's, even though the active constituents only represent15.5% of the essential oil. Two antagonistic interactions were observed, namely between ( )-pulegone with E- and Z-(\u00b1)-nerolidol or p-cymene (Table 1 ;Fig. 1 A). In contrast, when two active EOC's [linalyl acetate (1.4\u00b10.1 M) and (+)- -pinene] were combined, an additive interaction was observed ( Table 1 ). It may be proposed that the antagonistic interactions are due to competition of thetwo EOC's when partitioning into the red blood cell or parasiticmembranes ( Turina et al., 2006 ) or accumulating at the same site and thereby interfering with each other's inhibitory effects.This has been described for mefloquine and chloroquine, where mefloquine inhibits the ability of chloroquine to cause an accumulation of undigested haemoglobin in the parasitic foodvacuole ( Famin and Ginsburg, 2002 ). Alternatively, the two EOC's could compete with each other and thereby neutralise theirrespective parasitocidal effect. The combination of artemisininwith iron chelators has been shown to interact antagonistically;presumably due to the chelators binding iron which is essential forthe formation of C-centred radicals that are formed by the interaction of the endoperoxide bridge in artemisinin and iron (Krishna et al., 2006 ). Moreover, this study shows that when two EOC's are combined, variable interactions exist depen ding on the concentration and ratio of the agents used. Boyom et al. (2003) stated that in the case of malaria, the physical properties o f essential oil constituents namely its low density (~0.94 g/ml) and li pophilicity which facilitates rapid diffusion across cell membranes, might enhance targeting of the active components into the intrace llular malaria parasite. However, the final interaction between the two EOC's depends on theirrespective cellular targets. 3.2. Cytotoxic profile of the essential oil constituents The combined effects of various EOC's were assessed for their resultant toxic properties ( Table 1 ;Fig. 1 C, D). Essential oils consist of numerous constituents present in variable concentra-tions. Thus, to examine the interaction between some of these EOC's various combinations were assessed to determine howthey may contribute to the overall toxicity profile of the essentialoil. All tested EOC combinations potentiated each other's toxicityprofile ( Table 1 ). For example, the toxicity IC50 values of the individual EOC's, such as E-a n d Z-(\u00b1)-nerolidol and p-cymene were 5.5\u00b11.2 M and 673.6\u00b135.4 M respectively; but when combined the IC50 values decreased dramatically by more than 10 fold. Similarly, for the other combined EOC's, the combined toxic effect was more potent compared to the effects of theindividual EOC's ( Table 1 ). Thus, although the linear E- and Z-(\u00b1)-nerolidol and the monocyclic ketone, ( )-pulegone displayed very promising antimalarial activity when used individually ( Van Zyl et al., 2006 ); their antagonistic interaction voided any potential of their combined administration ( Table 1 ;Fig. 1 A). These initial results indicate that they are not ideal candidates to be used in combination therapy due to the increased toxicity profile of thetwo EOC's when used in combinations ( Fig. 1 C;Table 1 ). Thus when comparing the two latter combinations it would appear as if EOC's should not be combined for therapeuticapplication. However, when used individually they have provento be effective in increasing the transdermal permeation of drugssuch 2007; Krishnaiah et al., 2005 ). When tested in animal or human studies, the application of terpenes resulted in variable adverse effects depending on theroute of administration. But if applied topically the reactionranged from little to no skin irritation to eczema and dermatitisdepending on the dose and duration of application ( Aqil et al., 2007; Bakkali al., 2008; RIFM, 2008 ). It has been reported that cytotoxicity is associated more often with phenols, aldehydes and alcohols ( Bakkali et al., 2008 of two monoterpenes, namely -terpinene and p-cymene ( Fig. 1 D) also displayed increased toxicity towards the human kidney epithelial cells ( FIC=0.002). Likewise when the ketone, ( )-pulegone was combined with p-cymene ( Fig. 1 D), the combination had a more toxic profile ( FIC=0.306) ( Table 1 ). Thus, based on these observations of the in vitro effect of the EOC's on human kidney epithelial cells, t he route of administration and the concentration used should be carefully monitored to avoid detrimental and even fatal adverse effects. These cytotoxic effectsin the kidney could be due to a membrane or a membrane -protein interaction, since monoterpenes are known to penetrate andpartition in the monomolecular l ayers of cellular membranes ( Lawrence, 2000; al., 2006). 3.3. The combined antimalarial and cytotoxic effects of quinine and E- and Z-(\u00b1)-nerolidol The combination of a classical antimalarial drug, namely quinine with E- and Z-(\u00b1)-nerolidol displayed a synergistic interaction ( FIC value=0.01), but had a high toxicity profile (FIC=0.001) ( Table 1 ). The ability of these two agents to target separate cellular components may have contributed totheir enhanced interaction; with E-a n d Z-(\u00b1)-nerolidol665 R.L. Van Zyl et al. / South African Journal of Botany 76 (2010) 662 -667proposed to inhibit isoprenoid biosynthesis and to inhibit the isoprenylation of proteins, resulting in the interference withmitochondrial metabolic processes like pyrimidine biosynthesis(De Macedo et al., 2002; Goulart et al., 2004 ). In contrast, quinine is reported to inhibit haemozoin formation and todecrease plasmodial DNA strand Warhurst, 2001; Noedl et al., 2003 ). Thus, if a patient were to be admitted with a malaria infection and had been taking traditional aromatic phytomedicines for his fever and chills, the treatment of thepatient would not be compromised if quinine were to beadministered. In addition, nerolidol has been reported toincrease the transdermal of hydrophilic drugs(e.g. quinine) providing route of administration ( Aqil et al., 2007 ). In the absence of an effective vaccine against malaria, people rely on chemotherapeutic agents to prevent and treat an infection ( Craig et al., 2009 ). These results indicate that plant- derived or chemically synthesised EOC's have the potential tobe used in adjunct therapy with antimalarial agents. In addition,they could be used as new templates for drug design. In many chemotherapeutic regimens, drugs are used in combination to delay or overcome factors of resistance. IfEOC's were to be combined with a standard antimalarial agent, such as quinine, the combined antimalarial effect would be potentiated ( FIC=0.01). However, so would the likelihood of increased adverse effects ( FIC=0.001; Table 1 ). Thus, the interaction in an in vivo system needs to be evaluated todetermine if the adverse effects would outweigh the therapeuticefficacy of this combination. It is clear that further research needs to be conducted to determine the toxic profiles of the whole essential oils, the individual EOC's and combinations with other essential oils or \"western \"drugs. In addition, it is known that the essential oil may exert a severe effect on an individual organism or cell type, butmaybe inert to other cell types. Thus, it is essential that the in vivoeffects be determined, taking into account the metabolism of theindividual molecules and the resultant metabolites which couldalter the inhibitory properties observed in this study. From the results obtained, an inference can be drawn that some EOC's are not ideal candidates to form an integral part of the combination therapy, due to their increased toxicity profiles.Although the two more active compounds tested displayedpotent antimalarial activity; in combination, E- and Z-(\u00b1)- nerolidol with ( )-pulegone or quinine displayed high toxicity to the test cell line. Although this does indicate somecytotoxicity to mammalian cells, the complete profile andmetabolism of these terpenes need to be investigated. It can be concluded that in combination some EOC's potentiate each others' mechanisms of action which may contribute to themanagement and treatment of microorganisms resistant tostandard drugs and warrants further investigation.
