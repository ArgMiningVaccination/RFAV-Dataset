Over 800 million people are living on less than $1.25 a day (United Nations Development Programme, 2017; World Bank, 2017), and 263 million children and young people are out of school (Education Commission, 2016). The United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) outline an ambitious global agenda for ending poverty and hunger, ensuring good health and quality education, and promoting jobs and reduced inequalities. However, governments and multilateral organizations will face considerable challenges achieving these aims. In education alone, the Education Commission in 2016 estimated a funding gap of $1.8 trillion per year to ensure quality education for all children. Achieving the SDGs will require governments and multilaterals to develop and apply innovative financing tools to make the best use of existing funds. Results-based financing represents one tool that governments and multilaterals can use to ensure that funds are directed most effectively toward populations in need. Ensuring that resources are spent only on interventions that achieve desired results has the potential to better target social services and to hold funders and service providers accountable for what they deliver. Social and development impact bonds, one form of results-based financing, have the potential to shift the focus of participants to outcomes, encourage performance management and adaptability, promote learning through evaluation, and create a clear case for investing in what works. In 2015, the Brookings Institution published a report on the potential and limitations of impact bonds, which chronicled the development of the first 38 impact bonds in high-income countries and analyzed the landscape (Gustafsson-Wright et al., 2015). This report takes the field further forward, exploring the lessons learned in the development of impact bonds in low- and middle-income countries, bringing together the findings from interviews with stakeholders and research into the impact bond space conducted by the authors over the course of a year. In addition, the report draws on discussions from an intensive daylong workshop held in London in November 2016, in which impact bond practitioners from developing countries shared their experiences 7 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDand early lessons learned. The report includes a Deal Book with detailed fact sheets for all impact bonds in developing countries, featuring both the four contracted and 24 in design phases, as of August 1, 2017. The following analysis indicates the wide range of deals in design phases in developing countries, ranging in terms of country, sector, size of returns, and evaluation methodology. Emerging from the analysis, the recorded discussions in a one-day workshop with practitioners, and in-depth interviews with stakeholders from the contracted deals, we have identified five key issue areas in the design and implementation of impact bonds, which the following sections will explore. 1. Identifying appropriate interventions and service providers. 2. Managing relationships with government and donor outcome funders. 3. Identifying metrics and structuring payments. 4. Developing the operating model, structuring the vehicle, and raising capital. 5. Implementing the impact bond and measuring impact.8 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESImpact bonds blend impact investing, results-based financing, and public-private partnerships (see Figure 1). In an impact bond, private investors provide up-front capital for social services and are repaid by an outcome funder contingent on the achievement of agreed-upon results. In the case of a social impact bond (SIB), also called pay-for-success (PFS) in the United States and social benefit bonds (SBB) in Australia, the outcome funder is a government entity. In the case of a development impact bond (DIB), \"development\" referring to their primary application to low- or middle-income countries, this is usually a third party such as a donor or foundation (Center for Global Development and Social Finance, 2013). Since there are only three DIBs with operational experience, much of the analysis of this report focuses on the design and negotiation phases of the impact bond contracting process. Impact Bonds: A Confluence of Trends PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPIMPACT INVESTING PAYMENT BY RESULTS IMPACT BONDSFIGURE 1 Source: Authors' elaborationIMPACT BOND PRIMER9 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDIMPACT BOND STRUCTURE AND MECHANICS While impact bonds are structured in multiple ways, the basic mechanics can be described as in Figure 2. Most impact bonds involve three main types of actors: the investors, who provide up-front capital to the service providers to deliver social services to the population in need. Contingent on the achievement of results, the outcome funder repays the investors their principal plus an agreed-upon return on investment. Impact bonds often also involve several other key players. These include an evaluator, usually external to the service provider, who verifies or evaluates whether agreed-upon outcomes have been achieved. Other evaluations of the intervention itself may also take place in parallel, and performance management of the service provider is also typical, but the role of the evaluator is to assess whether impact metrics are achieved. An additional, but not necessary, actor can be an intermediary who often has the responsibility of raising capital and arranging negotiations among the participants. The intermediary can also support the service provider in performance management. Sometimes another entity can provide technical assistance in, for example, selection of outcome metrics and repayment terms. Legal support from lawyers who are knowledgeable in this form of contracting is almost always required. While the basic structure of impact bonds in developing countries has tended to follow the same patterns observed in high-income countries, a key difference is the greater need for a risk management element. Implementing impact bonds in low- and middle-income countries involves the development of contextual understanding about the needs of outcome payers and investors in a riskier environment than the one faced by participants in high-income countries. For SIBs in high-income countries, one of the driving forces has been the idea that the payment by government is drawn from the future cost savings provided by successful preventive interventions. In developing contexts\u2014and particularly in DIBs, in which the outcome payer is not the government\u2014quantifying the value of interventions to each organization is much more complicated, and in these cases future savings are less likely to be a driving force.10 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESVARIATIONS ON THE IMPACT BOND STRUCTURE AND MECHANICS Although each impact bond follows a unique path to development, four major stages have been identified (Gustafsson-Wright et al., 2015): a feasibility study; structuring the deal; implementation; and evaluation and repayment. Within the feasibility study, the social challenge is identified and the feasibility of using an impact bond to resolve that challenge is explored. To structure the deal, an outcome funder must agree to enter the contract, capital must be raised, the technical details such as the specific intervention and outcome metrics are decided, the service provider is procured, and contracts are finalized. After this, in FIGURE 2 Impact Bond Mechanics 2 OUTCOME FUNDERINVESTOR 1 3 SERVICE PROVIDER11 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDthe implementation stage, services are provided to the population in need, and the performance of the service provider is monitored and managed. Finally, verification of agreed-upon outcomes takes place and payment to investors occurs contingent upon their achievement. Table 1 summarizes the types of organizations that are active in each role in impact bonds in developing countries. A more comprehensive overview of the organizations working in each impact bond can be found in the Deal Book, later in the report. Some of the same types of organizations are taking on different roles in different impact bonds: For example, foundations are acting as outcome funders and investors, while international organizations are both investors and service providers. Even within the same impact bond, the same actor may play different roles, for example acting as both an investor and a service provider.

Seven outcome funds have been launched in the United Kingdom (U.K. Centre for Social Impact Bonds, n.d.): The first, launched in 2012, was the Innovation Fund, a 30 million-pound pilot program that contracted for outcomes for young people aged 14 and over (Griffiths et al., 2016); this was followed by the Youth Engagement Fund (U.K. Cabinet Office et al., 2014), launched in 2014, aimed at disadvantaged young people, and the Fair Chance Fund, also launched in 2014, for youth homelessness. The Social Outcomes Fund and Commissioning Better Outcomes Fund ran in parallel to support the development of SIBs for complex policy areas and closed to applications in 2016 (Big Lottery Fund, n.d.). A fund for preventing rough sleeping (DCLG Rough Sleeping SIB Fund) was announced in 2016, providing up to 10 million pounds in outcome funds for reducing homelessness (U.K. Department for Communities and Local Government & Prime Minister's Office, 2016). Finally, the U.K. government has committed 80 million pounds to the Life Chances Fund (U.K. Cabinet Office & Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, 2016), for prospective impact bonds. With an impact bond outcome fund, a rate card may be issued in which the outcome funder lays out the price it will pay for each outcome, and multiple service providers can be engaged to achieve different results. In the Innovation Fund rate card, the Department for Work and Pensions set maximum prices for the outcomes it wanted: For example, it was willing to pay a maximum of 700 pounds per participant for an improved attitude to school and 2,000 pounds for sustained employment (U.K. Government, n.d.). 1 Funding for SIBs was awarded after a competitive bidding process. In South Africa, two impact bonds in design for maternal and early childhood outcomes have also been designed as impact bond outcome funds (Gardiner & Gustafsson-Wright, 2016). Another outcomes fund is under discussion for India, and other outcomes funds for education and refugees are also under discussion. Some have suggested that outcome funds could be a means to reach more beneficiaries, given that the individual transactions to date have been relatively small (Bellinger et al., 2016; Rogerson & Sch\u00e4ferhoff, 2016; Sch\u00e4ferhoff 2016). 1. to approximately $1,200 and $3,300, respectively, in June 2011.13 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDFIGURE 3 Potential and Limitations of Impact Bonds INVEST IN PREVENTION REDUCE RISK FOR GOVERNMENT SUPPORT EXPERIMENTAL INTERVENTIONSDRIVE PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENTINCENTIVIZE COLLABORATION SUSTAIN IMPACTFOCUS ON OUTCOMES ACHIEVE SCALEBUILD A CULTURE OF MONITORING + EVALUATION CROWD IN PRIVATE FUNDINGDEMONSTRATED EVIDENCE LACKING EVIDENCE14 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESGLOBAL LANDSCAPE AND DEAL BOOK ANALYSIS As of August 1, 2017, there were 90 SIBs contracted around the world, with all but one (the Colombia Workforce Development SIB) in high-income countries. Three DIBs have been contracted: Educate Girls in India (Gustafsson-Wright & Gardiner, 2016), which aims to boost enrollment and learning, a DIB for improving cocoa and coffee production in Peru (Finance Contracted Impact Bonds Globally MAP 1 >30 10-30 5-10 3-5 <215 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDAlliance for Sustainable Trade, 2015) and the International Committee of the Red Cross Programme for Humanitarian Impact Investment (PHII). The Deal Book in Annex D includes the four contracted impact bonds in developing countries, as well as 24 other impact bonds currently in design. Map 1 displays the contracted impact bonds around the world as of August 1, 2017, with the darker shades of blue representing a higher number of impact bonds. The U.K., where the first impact bond was developed, has the largest number, at 36, and the United States follows with 16. The Netherlands has eight impact bonds, Australia has six, Canada four, Portugal four, Israel, France, Finland and South Korea have two each, and Austria, Belgium, Colombia, Germany, India, Japan, New Zealand, Peru, Sweden, and Switzerland have one each. The ICRC PHII is being implemented in three countries: Mali, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The 24 impact bonds in design stages in developing countries can be seen in Map 2. South Africa has the most, with four impact bonds in design, while Brazil, Cameroon, India, Palestine, and Uganda each have two. Impact Bonds in Design Process in Low- and Middle-Income Countries MAP 2 4 3 2 116 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESSECTORS IN IMPACT BONDS IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN) Of the 28 impact bonds in developing countries either contracted or in design phases, 11 are for interventions in the health sector, including the treatment of cataracts, nutritional education for prediabetic women, and improved maternity care. After this, employment (six), agriculture (five), and education (four) are the next largest sectors. Social welfare has two impact bonds. The dominance of the health sector in low- and middle-income countries contrasts with the sectors represented in currently contracted impact bonds in high-income countries, where (as of August 1, 2017) employment is the largest sector (38 impact bonds), followed by social welfare (28). These sectoral differences between high-income and developing countries likely indicate different needs and priorities. Several of the health interventions in developing countries focus on areas less likely to be needed by populations in high-income countries, such as water and sanitation or malnutrition. Moreover, the priorities in developing countries will also be driven by the priorities and strategic objectives of the HEALTHAGRICULTURE EDUCATIONEMPLOYMENT SOCIAL WELFARE115 2 46Sectors in Impact Bonds in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN)FIGURE 417 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDoutcome payers; the emphasis on health also indicates an alignment with the goals of the SDGs. However, employment appears to be a popular sector for impact bonds across both high-income and developing countries, many of which focus on young people as target beneficiaries. In the U.K., education and employability outcomes for 14- to 24-year-olds were targeted by the Innovation Fund as a means of reducing long-term dependency on the welfare state (Griffiths et al., 2016). As a sector, employment may therefore be particularly suited to the impact bond model, because of the potential for positive public and private benefits\u2014particularly if the targeted population is younger and will spend more time in the workforce. BENEFICIARIES IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN) The target populations for many of the impact bonds contracted or in design in developing countries are marginalized, or vulnerable groups that meet specific sets of criteria. Many of the impact bonds target low-income individuals, or those living in disadvantaged areas, while women and young people are also frequently targeted. Some of the impact bonds have specific criteria to target a number of these groups; for example, the Colombia Workforce Development SIB targets poor, vulnerable high school graduates displaced because of political conflict. The number of beneficiaries that the impact bonds target range from 100 for the Palestine Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) DIB to 400,000 for the India (Rajasthan) Maternal and Newborn Health DIB. Several target families or households, rather than individuals, such as the Sustainable Cocoa and Coffee Production DIB in Peru. CONTRACT LENGTH IN IMPACT BONDS IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN) The length of the impact bond contracts ranges from 10 months to five years, with an average length of 42 months. As Figure 5 indicates, for those deals for which the contract length is available, more than half are for 30 to 50 months. Two impact bonds have contracts of under two years: the cocoa and coffee DIB in Peru and the Colombia Workforce SIB, both of which have been contracted. For currently contracted impact bonds in high-income countries, short 18 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESLength of Contract of Impact Bonds in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN)FIGURE 5 LENGTH OF CONTRACT (IN MONTHS)5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 Source: Impact Bonds Deal Book19 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDcontract duration is also the norm. The average contract length is 54 months, or 4.5 years, although the median is 48 months, indicating that half of the contracts are shorter than four years. Contract lengths are likely to emerge from negotiations among stakeholders and need to be long enough to ensure that results can reasonably be expected in that time, but not too far into the future to discourage investors or to constrain the budgets of outcome funders. CAPITAL COMMITMENT IN IMPACT BONDS IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN) Many of the impact bonds in the Deal Book are still in their design phases, which means that data availability on up-front capital commitments vary among the deals: For some of the impact bonds, no figure is publicly available, while for others only a range can be reported. The up-front capital commitments for the impact bonds in the Deal Book range from an estimated $110,000 to $7.5 million, with an average commitment of $2 million. Five impact bonds have capital commitments of below $1 million, with another five between $1 million and $5 million. The remaining impact bond is above $5 million. TYPE OF INVESTOR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN) Foundations are the most prominent type of investor organization within impact bonds in developing countries: Eight of the twelve impact bonds for which investor data are available involve a foundation or philanthropist. Four impact bonds will be funded upfront by a multilateral, bilateral or an intergovernmental financial institution (IFI). As the Deal Book indicates, foundations range from major international philanthropic organizations such as UBS Optimus Foundation (UBSOF) to nationally based foundations such as Fundaci\u00f3n Corona, which works only in Colombia.20 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESTYPE OF OUTCOME FUNDER IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN) The most common type of outcome funder across the impact bonds in developing countries is government. Twelve of the 20 impact bonds with available data will be funded by some kind of government entity\u2014these include funding at different levels of government and from different departments. Nonprofits are also frequent outcome funders of the impact bonds in the Deal Book. Multilaterals, bilaterals and IFIs are also outcome funders in eight impact bonds.Investor by Number of Impact Bonds They Are Involved in (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN IN LOW AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES)FIGURE 6 Source: Impact Bonds Deal BookFOUNDATION OR PHILANTHROPIST MULTILATERAL, BILATERAL OR INTERGOVERNMENTAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (IFI) IMPACT INVESTING FIRM BANK INVESTMENT FUND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR8 421 1 121 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDRANGE OF RETURNS (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN) Only limited data are available on the maximum returns available to investors. Since many of the impact bonds in the Deal Book are still in design phases, only 11 provide values for this indicator. The maximum returns possible are defined in several ways across the impact bonds. Some provide a maximum internal rate of return (IRR), others have a maximum percentage return, and some cap the returns at a dollar figure. Both the Peru coffee DIB and the Uganda Empowering Women and Youth in the Coffee Value Chain DIB cap returns at $110,000. Impact bonds that cap returns on investment at a percentage value range from 0.05 percent, for the Mozambique Malaria DIB, to 10 percent for the Tajikistan Oxfam WASH DIB. Several impact bonds have a cap on the IRR, with India Educate Girls DIB capped at 15 percent and the two South African SIBs capped at 16 percent.Outcome Funder by Number of Impact Bonds They Are Involved in (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN IN LOW AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES)FIGURE 7 Source: Impact Bonds Deal Book4821 12FOUNDATION OR PHILANTHROPIST MULTILATERAL, BILATERAL OR INTERGOVERNMENTAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (IFI) GOVERNMENT NON-PROFIT CORPORATE GIVING INVESTMENT FUND422 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESImpact bond name Maximum returns Cameroon Cataract DIB 8% Colombia Workforce Development SIB 8% India Educate Girls DIB 15% IRR 0.05% Peru Sustainable Cocoa and Coffee Production DIB $110,000 (return of principal) South Africa ECD Impact Bond Innovation Fund - Health 16% IRR South Africa ECD Impact Bond Innovation Fund - Social Development16% IRR Tajikistan WASH SIB 10% (estimated) Uganda Empowering Women and Youth in the Coffee Value Chain DIB $110,000Maximum Returns in Impact Bonds in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN)TABLE 2 *8% annualized for UBSOF component (80% of total investment); 15% return possible for the implementation partnership investment (20%).23 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDEVALUATION METHODS IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN) Validated administrative data is the most commonly used evaluation method in developing countries, with 12 impact bonds using this type of evaluation. This method has also been the most popular among impact bonds in high-income countries. This may be unsurprising given the high cost of quasi-experimental evaluations and experimental designs, or randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two impact bonds will evaluate their results using historical comparison. Two impact bonds will use an experimental design or RCT, and two more will use an RCT in conjunction with validated administrative data (hybrid). Because of the relatively early development stage of some of the impact bonds in the Deal Book, information on evaluation methodology is available for only 18 impact bonds. 12Evaluation Methodologies in Impact Bonds in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (CONTRACTED AND IN DESIGN)FIGURE 8 Source: Impact Bonds Deal BookVALIDATED ADMINISTRATIVE DATA HYBRID HISTORICAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN (RCT)22224 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESIDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE INTERVENTIONS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS Impact bonds can address a wide range of development challenges in developing countries. As described in the previous section, most impact bonds in the design or implementation stage in developing countries have focused on interventions related to health, employment, agriculture, or education. Given the broad application of impact bonds, the process for identifying an appropriate intervention\u2014and often the service provider(s)\u2014typically depends on the \"lead\" organization. Broadly, the impact bond process in developing countries has been initiated through two main approaches: 1. Outcome funder driven: An outcome funder\u2014such as a domestic government, aid agency, or foundation\u2014interested in an impact bond selects a sector and region of its interest. This could be driven by a desire to innovate or solve a problem of scaling, effectiveness, or broad political will for a particular sector. Alternatively, sectorally focused teams or individuals within outcome funding entities explore an impact bond to solve a specific challenge (such as incentivizing results). Often a service provider that the funder is familiar with\u2014typically a previous grantee\u2014is the focus of the impact bond. This approach to service provider selection is not always possible since some outcome funders, particularly aid agencies, adhere to strict procurement policies and therefore up-front selection is not possible, even when preferable. 2. Intermediary driven: Intermediaries can also play a lead role in initiating an impact bond by identifying appropriate interventions and service providers. a. Often, the intermediary identifies the development intervention based on the priorities of potential outcome funders or investors. This approach ensures alignment 25 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDbetween these key stakeholders during the structuring phase. b. In other cases, an intermediary interested in developing an impact bond may conduct a market analysis on a specific sector or region to determine interventions and service providers that are appropriate for an impact bond before approaching key stakeholders. It is essential that practitioners take a considered approach to determining whether to pursue an impact bond. In general, the first step is to clearly define the challenge that could potentially be solved using this mechanism. Impact bonds should be considered if current approaches do not produce intended results (for example, paying for inputs is not yielding desired impact). Second, a variety of approaches or tools should be considered, including some that may not necessarily be finance-related. Some practitioners have started with the objective of structuring an impact bond without carefully considering whether the tool is appropriate. Many warn against this \"hammer looking for a nail\" approach. Several criteria for identifying an appropriate development intervention and service provider have been codified in the following sections. CRITERIA FOR AN APPROPRIATE INTERVENTION A critical first step is to understand whether any type of results-based financing will improve efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery. If paying for inputs (such as grant funding for service providers to perform a specific set of interventions) is not achieving intended development outcomes, then results-based financing, and therefore potentially impact bond mechanisms, may be an appropriate tool to finance the intervention. The rationale for using impact bond financing can vary depending on the impact bond and the actors. Some view impact bonds as having the potential to provide flexible funding for promising but unproven interventions to stretch their impact (drive more results, for example). Impact bonds benefit from a relatively flexible structure because the key metric(s) for success is the desired outcomes or impact rather than inputs. In theory, impact bonds allow service providers to refine and adapt their interventions (the inputs) during the term of the impact bond to achieve a set of agreed-upon outcomes. Under this scenario, impact bonds could be appropriate as a transition form of financing to determine the best-practice set of interventions to achieve maximum impact. Practitioners argue in this case that impact bonds should not be the steady state form of financing but rather a transition form, as they are too costly to establish and implement, among other reasons. The amount of flexibility enjoyed by service providers will depend on the 26 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESspecific nature of the deal and the demands of the investors. Investors are likely to place more emphasis on scaling up evidence-backed interventions. Other practitioners argue that impact bonds represent an approach to financing the scale-up of proven interventions. A priori, outcome funders should be willing to pay directly for the scale-up of interventions with proven impact (and even potential cost avoidance). The sweet spot for impact bonds is likely somewhere between experimentation and scale\u2014the middle phase\u2014where evidence is insufficient (or there is some potential political barrier) for outcome funders to pay but sufficient for investors to engage. Thus far, enormous scale (large number of beneficiaries) in absolute terms has not been seen in the use of impact bonds, although some target very particular populations so scale may be present in relative terms. An evidence-based theory of change is helpful in determining whether an impact bond is appropriate for the intervention since payments are tied to outputs (such as school attendance) and outcomes (such as school achievement). There is a need to have a high degree of confidence in the relationship between the intervention's proposed inputs and outputs, and desired outcomes and impact. All stakeholders\u2014investors, outcome funders, and service providers\u2014must agree that the proposed intervention (a specific curriculum, for example) will deliver the desired outcomes (improved learning progress, school completion) and impact (higher income as a result of obtaining a well-paying job). While the value of an evidence- based theory of change is clear, practitioners caution that lack of data can be a challenge in low-income countries and that scoping research\u2014such as an experimental or quasi-experimental evaluation\u2014to establish an evidence-based theory of change may be a prerequisite, while at the same time may be expensive and time-consuming. As a result, there is an important trade-off between establishing an evidence-based theory of change and keeping design costs within reason. In some situations, an evidence-based theory of change may exist for a similar intervention or the same intervention in a different region, which can be leveraged as a proxy. Regardless, it is essential to ensure that evidence is adequate to attract all stakeholders to the proposed intervention. In particular, as mentioned, an investor requires I do think there is a danger that we talk about impact bonds as if they are all the same. Rather, impact bonds can fund risky, transition interventions at one end of the spectrum and more secure and proven interventions at the other end. \u2014Impact bond practitioner27 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDenough evidence to be comfortable that investment in an intervention will result in impact and therefore repayment from the outcome funder. At the same time, if there is a very strong evidence base, outcome funders might rather fund the intervention directly, as they can be confident that the inputs will result in outcomes and impact.You can either identify an intervention that already has a strong evidence-based theory of change or invest significant time and effort into building the evidence base, but the transaction costs may get prohibitively large. \u2014Impact bond practitioner CRITERIA FOR APPROPRIATE SERVICE PROVIDER(S) A performance-oriented service provider with implementation capacity is critical to the success of an impact bond. Practitioners note that most service providers would describe themselves as performance-oriented, and therefore it is important to dig deeper into a service provider's track record and management team to ensure that this is the case. In addition to a performance culture, the service provider must have the capacity to carry out the impact bond activities: to implement performance management systems, monitor key metrics, and refine the underlying business model and approach to ensure that maximum impact is achieved. This may mean a dramatic culture shift, indicating that another key element for selecting service providers is choosing an organization that is open to change and capable of adapting to new demands, which could include, for example, changing recruitment practices and training structures. When we look at service providers, we ask three key questions: 1. What impact is the service provider having currently? 2. Do they have adequate systems in place to implement the intervention and measure impact? 3. Do they have learning systems and a habit of servicing problems in an open manner? \u2014Impact bond practitioner28 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESKEY TAKEAWAYS: There are two main approaches to identifying an appropriate development intervention for an impact bond: An outcome funder selects an intervention based on its priorities, or an intermediary selects an intervention based on the priorities of outcome funders /investors or by conducting a top-down analysis of a particular sector and region. There is debate on whether impact bonds are more appropriate for transition financing to determine the best-practice set of interventions to achieve maximum impact, or for scale financing to expand reach and impact of proven interventions. An evidence-based theory of change for the interventions under consideration is a critical component, as payments are linked to outcomes and therefore investors must be confident the intervention will drive desired impact. Service providers should be performance-driven and have the capacity to implement the intervention. The costs of designing and structuring an impact bond can be prohibitive and should be considered and managed from early in the development process.1 2 3 4 5IDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE INTERVENTIONS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS29 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDMANAGING RELATIONSHIPS WITH GOVERNMENT AND DONOR OUTCOME FUNDERS A NEW ROLE FOR OUTCOME FUNDERS The research identified several issues related to impact bonds being a very different way of doing business. Impact bonds require governments and donor organizations to adapt to a different role from that which they have held in the past. At the moment, outcome payers do not have established contracting and procurement mechanisms, meaning that negotiations are often extended and expensive, and each contract process follows its own logic, with little opportunity to learn from the experience of other deals. The relationship between outcome funders and service providers may have to change, from being more hands-on to simply setting the outcome metrics and letting service providers make decisions about the specifics of interventions. Historically grant-making institutions may have difficulty loosening control and taking a step back from frontline services; there is a sense among outcome funders that impact bonds might give them less control over their funding. This is perhaps an unexpected finding, since at the heart of the impact bond structure is the idea that outcome funders will pay only for results, and hence gain a stronger control over their finances. Although designing impact bonds requires paying considerable attention to the price of an intervention, detailed discussions about costs may actually increase an outcome funder's perceptions of risk. This is an interesting finding from discussions with impact bond practitioners, and somewhat counterintuitive, since more clarity about costs and prices should allow for more reliable budgeting and less risk. 30 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESOutcome funders may also be wary of the potential for impact bonds to damage their credibility; in particular, some critics worry about paying returns to private investors (Rosenman, 2014). Although the money paid to investors above the return of the up-front capital is intended to reflect the savings gained from intervention, governments especially have responsibilities to their electorates and will be keenly aware of the potential for negative media coverage in handing over public funds to private bodies.New is expensive relative to old, right? Any new system involves learning how to do things, learning how to write the contracts, learning how to evaluate the results, learning how to put together the coalitions. \u2014Impact bond practitionerSpectrum of Service Inputs to Outcomes INPUTS PROCESS OUTPUTS QUALITY OUTCOMES FIGURE 9 Source: Martin, 20051 2 3 4 5 Staff Facilities Equipment Supplies Material Funding Service recipients Service definitions Statements of work Measures of service volume Units of service Timeliness Reliability Conformity Tangibles Other dimensions Results Impacts Accomplishments31 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDTHE OUTCOME FUNDER PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE When an outcome funder has not driven the development of the impact bond, our research suggests that it is important to engage the outcome funder early in the design process. Since the outcome funder will be paying for the results of the impact bond, it needs to be on board with the timeline, costs, and metrics. Early engagement is particularly important when the outcome funder is going to be the government, since elected governments have the democratic legitimacy to set policy priorities, meaning government buy-in should lend credibility to the impact bond. Even if the eventual outcome funders will be donors, it is still important to engage with the domestic government in developing countries to ensure that the impact bond aligns with the administration's policy priorities. However, outcome funders may also be uncomfortable with the relatively untested nature of the impact bond product and may prefer to stick to more traditional methods of service provision. Our research with impact bond practitioners suggests that while funders may be wary about getting involved at the beginning of a project, they may be more comfortable coming on board with something that is more developed. There may therefore be a trade-off between getting early buy-in and credibility from an outcome funder, versus a higher comfort level for outcome funders in later involvement. If the outcome funder is not present from the beginning of development, other stakeholders will need to find out who cares about the issue and who is willing to pay for it. The outcome funders in currently contracted impact bonds (for which there are available data) have almost all been national or local government entities, but as Figure 7 shows, this field of outcome funders is widening as the impact model is applied in a broader range of contexts. Social impact bonds do not have to be funded by one organization; a pool of outcome funders may each contribute a share. This can provide more outcome funding, and for interventions at a larger scale, but may also add more complexity, with each additional organization bringing a new set of priorities and interests. Engaging with governments and donors means establishing not only who the outcome funder will be, but also who within an organization is the right person, or people, to engage with directly on an impact bond. Working with the right people within an organization is crucial for the success of an impact bond. One element of Engage government very early on. Even if they will not be paying for outcomes. One way or the other, all governments are there to implement a social agenda and they have the social legitimacy to set public policies. \u2014Impact bond practitioner32 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESthis is ensuring that the impact bond has a champion at a senior enough level, as well as other levels, that it can gain sufficient support and exposure. If the outcome funder is to be the government, then decisions need to be made about whether to engage with bureaucratic or political actors (or perhaps both): While politicians may have political capital and legitimacy, civil servants may have more permanence and lend the impact bond more consistency. CHALLENGES TO ENGAGEMENT 1. Aligning interests: Key to managing partnerships on impact bonds in developing countries is identifying the development challenges and social issues that stakeholders want to work on. With both governments and donors, it is necessary to understand their areas of interest and their priorities. With governments these priorities may be explicit and transparent, and can be gleaned from ministry plans or strategies. Engaging with outcome funders may also involve negotiating tensions among participants and aligning competing priorities. This may be in terms of impact metrics: For example, outcome funders may be drawn to outcomes targets, especially if there is not a clear idea of what works, while service providers and investors may prefer less risky options, such as funding outputs. Individual donors may also have multiple motivations for their participation: For example, they may seek not just specific outcomes, but also to project a certain image or secure employment opportunities. Understanding the wider priorities of the different actors is important to negotiate a process that is agreeable to all. 2. Changing circumstances: One of the main challenges to effective relationships with outcome funders is navigating the changing circumstances they face. This is particularly the case when the outcome funder is a government or a political entity. The election cycle can mean that support for impact bonds can disappear very quickly, for example after a change in government following an election, if the incoming administration does not share the commitment to impact bonds. Conversely, time constraints can also work in the other direction: In some countries and organizations, policy shifts and processes may be slow, meaning it takes time for support for impact bonds to build. 3. Instability: A wider context of political instability also creates If we did make one mistake, it was that we had somebody who wasn't senior enough championing it within the ministry. \u2014Impact bond practitioner33 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDchallenges when engaging with outcome funders, particularly if governments are unstable and future support for impact bonds cannot be guaranteed. In these situations, and perhaps specifically in developing countries, donors and foundations can play a continuity role, to facilitate working with different governments over time. If the civil service is permanent, there are also advantages to engaging with government at the bureaucratic level, because this will ensure stability for the impact bond even when political power changes hands. Even in nonpolitical contexts, personnel changes within organizations can create challenges for impact bonds. Institutional knowledge about impact bonds may leave when people change departments, creating a sense of instability and slowing down communication among actors in the impact bond. These issues emphasize the importance of intermediaries in developing country contexts and the risk management role they can play. 4. Crowding-in funding: Separating financing for impact bonds from existing funding is a key concern for outcome funders. Governments do not want to face competition for their limited funding, and charitable organizations interested in impact bonds are keen to ensure that funding is additional and that they will not be diverting money from their donor base.5. Coordinating timelines: Some donors are also unwilling, or unable, to commit to paying for outcomes so far in the future, as budgets may be done on an annual basis. There is a pressure to spend existing funds, since underspending may result in tighter budgets in future years. Governments that have previously engaged in payment by results may have an easier time. A potential solution is a special purpose vehicle (SPV): In this way money can be allocated up-front to fund the outcome payments in future years. In the case of failure to achieve outcomes, outcome funders would have to reclaim those preallocated funds. 6. Power imbalances: Another potential area of tension is specific to development impact bonds: There may be power imbalances between international investors and governments in developing countries, which could result in contracts that are disadvantageous to the government. The main challenges came when most of the people who worked on the impact bond in the beginning started moving to other departments or leaving the government. \u2014Impact bond practitioner34 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESKEY TAKEAWAYS: To identify an outcome funder, find out who cares about the issue and is willing to pay for it. Engage the outcome funder early in the process of designing an impact bond. Key to the success of an impact bond is finding a champion in the outcome funder organization who is senior enough to take the process forward. This may involve sensitizing all levels of government to the impact bond mechanism, including at the local implementation level. Outcome funders will need time to adapt to the new processes. Challenges include aligning stakeholder interests; coping with changing circumstances; institutional and funding; coordinating timelines; and stakeholder power imbalances.1 2 3 4 5MANAGING RELATIONSHIPS WITH GOVERNMENT AND DONOR OUTCOME FUNDERS 35 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDIDENTIFYING METRICS AND STRUCTURING PAYMENTS METRICS WHEN TO DISCUSS METRICS Metrics are at the heart of an impact bond, since the payment is contingent on the achievement of a specific set of results. This means the discussion of metrics will likely be lengthy and time-consuming, and will need to begin early. Centering the process on the metric could mean establishing the goal of the outcome funder and what it wants to pay for, and then planning backward from that point. CRITERIA FOR A STRONG METRIC Several criteria for selecting effective impact metrics in developing countries have been collected through practitioner experience. These include the need for metrics to be measurable, meaningful, and set at the right level over an appropriate timeframe. These criteria are similar to those found in impact bonds in high-income countries, where the key feasibility criteria were that metrics should be measurable and meaningful (Gustafsson-Wright et al., 2015). 1. Measurable: It is important for metrics to be readily captured in the process of tracking the progress of an impact bond, since the release of outcome payments will depend on whether the targets have been achieved. Certain desirable outcomes may be difficult to pin down and may therefore be less suitable for inclusion in an impact bond. A key part of this is ensuring that metrics are simple; if targets are too complicated, they will be difficult to communicate to service providers or wider audiences. Service providers should understand what they are meant to be achieving. Simplicity may also mean cutting It starts with defining the metrics. That's the heart. If you don't have the metrics, you don't have an impact bond. \u2014Impact bond practitioner36 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESdown on the number of metrics. For example, having just one headline metric can communicate the central goal of the impact bond. 2. Meaningful: The metrics should also be meaningful. They should be aligned to outcomes or changes that the outcome funder wants to see and that represent a meaningful improvement in a beneficiary's life. There may therefore be some tension between the first and second criteria, and a balance needs to be struck between selecting metrics that are easy to measure, and measuring the things that are truly valuable to resolving the development challenge at hand. 3. Set at an appropriate level: Choosing the payment threshold is integral to setting the impact metrics. If targets are set too high, service providers might hold back from making more innovative decisions, but setting the targets too low could mean paying up when impact isn't really achieved. Setting the targets at the right level is important to avoid perverse incentives, or temptations to game the system. The type of metric that is selected will also have consequences for risk-bearing within the impact bond. There needs to be a balance between selecting metrics ambitious enough to transfer some risk away from the outcome funder, but not transferring so much risk that investors are discouraged from engaging. 4. Timeframe: The timeframe for the impact metrics should be short enough to please investors, but long enough to show results.OUTPUTS OR OUTCOMES? Impact bonds are meant to shift focus from inputs to outputs or outcomes. The choice between outputs and outcomes depends on multiple factors. When outputs are not good proxies for outcome achievement, then using outcomes as the metrics for repayment in an impact bond is preferable. Identifying outcomes as success criteria can allow for more flexibility on the part of service providers. This means, for example, that if more effective ways of delivering an intervention are discovered during the project impact bond period, then delivery can be adapted. This is likely to be preferred by outcome funders when it is unclear what works to achieve the desired outcomes. If outputs are, however, a reliable measure of outcome achievement, it may be preferable to select outputs If you're setting, for example, targets way too high, it can actually be quite stifling for providers. If you are setting them way too low, you risk calling it a success and then it's really not. \u2014Impact bond practitioner The beauty of an outcome- driven payment model is that actually you're going to be ... incentivized to kind of change that around. \u2014Impact bond practitioner37 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDsince they are often easier to measure, which could streamline the evaluation process. Moreover, outputs may also be measurable over a shorter period, which is likely to be preferred by investors. A combination of outputs and outcomes may be most desirable, allowing for interim payments to be made on outputs and longer-term payments to be made on outcomes. A selection of both can also distribute risk across different types of investors or reduce overall investment risk. NEGOTIATING AMONG ACTORS Stakeholders will need to decide on what will be measured (inputs, outputs, and outcomes), as well as the specific indicators the metrics will capture. This will often mean negotiating the priorities of different actors, a process that may slow the development of the impact bond. In particular, investors may be uncomfortable with outcome metrics, perhaps because of the perception that they are more difficult to achieve and therefore that the impact bond is a more risky investment, while outcome funders will likely seek metrics that come closer to measuring outcomes or impact. Each stakeholder is situated in a specific context, which may also have consequences for the selection of metrics. Investors and donors have wider responsibilities and will have to convince their respective constituencies of the value of their involvement in the impact bond. DATA QUALITY Identifying impact metrics can be a challenge when working in contexts with low data quality, which can be a particular challenge in low-income countries. It is important to establish whether data are available on the metrics of choice or whether the necessary data can be collected during the intervention. Low data quality can exacerbate the tensions among stakeholders. In these environments, outcome funders may prefer to fund on outcomes, if there are no strong data about the relationship among outcomes, inputs, or outputs. On the other hand, lack of data may discourage investors and service providers from agreeing to outcome metrics, because they may perceive the situation as more risky. Price setting might also be inhibited by low data quality. Without quality data, it is difficult to cost out interventions and then to determine how much will be paid out for the achievement of the metrics. Gathering quality data on the costs of interventions allows governments and donors to make cost/benefit decisions and to set achievable targets for service providers. Short-term solutions to low data quality include using proxy measures, or relying on indicators that the government is collecting already. Yet The fact that we have poor data in emerging markets is exactly why [impact bonds are needed], because it drives everyone to start collecting data about things that matter, like impact. \u2014Impact bond practitioner38 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESthe low quality of data in developing countries may be exactly the reason that impact bonds are appropriate for those contexts: Impact bonds can drive a focus on the importance of data, and data collection. This emphasis has the potential to lay the groundwork for improvements in data quality. COSTS AND PRICING Identifying impact metrics cannot be disconnected from pricing outcome payments. First, this means establishing how much weight, and therefore importance, different metrics will have in the distribution of payments. An element of adaptability in the decisions around metrics and prices may be desirable in impact bond metrics. Incorporating flexibility into the design allows for learning to take place during the process, for example if prices or metrics need to be changed in light of experience. This could mean designing the impact bond such that payment triggers shift from outputs to outcomes over the course of transaction, or that metrics can be changed during the life span of the impact bond contract with the agreement of all parties. However, this type of design carries risks, such as lack of clarity about what constitutes success, and therefore safeguards to protect the various parties would be necessary. INCENTIVE STRUCTURES Designing the impact metrics includes considering the incentive structures, if any, that will be put in place for service providers. Financial incentives may not be necessary, since the reputational risk of a failed impact bond may be enough to encourage service providers to perform effectively. Indeed, financial incentives may even be undesirable if they create perverse incentives for service providers, diverting them from achieving the desired impacts. However, safeguards can be put in place to mitigate this potential risk. Impact bond practitioners report that investors have asked for service provider incentives, to drive performance and to align incentives among the actors. Financial returns to service providers could come in the form of a bonus for overdelivery of targets or as a share of the returns, or providers could put their own money at risk in the contract. Incentives can also be incorporated to target the interventions at specific groups of individuals. This could be in the form of setting [We are] thinking about how we can price metrics by incentivizing people to go after the hardest to reach. \u2014Impact bond practitionerYou can also moderate the outcome payment triggers. At the beginning they can be more output based and at the end more outcome based. \u2014Impact bond practitioner39 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDdifferent outcome payments for different groups\u2014for example, incentivizing service providers to work with the poor or marginalized. This should push service providers to serve those most in need, rather than those who might be easiest to reach. STRUCTURING PAYMENTS Once the metrics have been established, the next step is to agree on the level of payments and the payment schedule. DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF PAYMENT There are two main elements to consider when determining the level of payments. The first is the full cost (staff time, resources, and so on) of achieving the selected metrics. These costs in results-based payment structures tend to be higher than the total cost of traditional grants. Traditional grants pay only for inputs, while results-based payments pay for outcomes, which may be more expensive to achieve because, among other factors, they require monitoring and evaluation. Since this is generally a new way of doing business, outcome funders may need support to understand the reasoning behind these cost differences. Some practitioners advocate that monitoring and evaluation costs should be included in the payments, so that the service provider is responsible for its own performance management. Others advocate that monitoring and evaluation costs should fall outside of the structure. In this case, as a separate line item, these costs may be funded by someone other than the outcome funder.Second, an estimate of the value, or price that can be attributed to the set of metrics, is often estimated by the outcome funder. This value or price will have a relationship to the cost of inaction\u2014the cost that would be incurred in the absence of preventive services. These can include everything from the cost of remedial services to broader costs\u2014for example, crime and reduced labor productivity. It must be noted that few outcome funders can confidently place a price on a set of metrics. Over time, outcome funders should be in a better position to place a value on specific metrics as more of an impact bond evidence base is built in specific sectors and regions. Impact bonds may be more expensive than traditional grant-based funding in two ways. First, the cost of performance management will need to be incorporated into cost estimates. These costs will support service providers to develop tools and strategies for tracking progress and adapting to feedback. The second set of costs involves the evaluation at the end of the contract, which determines whether impact metrics have been achieved. Given potentially high costs of evaluation, whether to include evaluation costs into payments is a key consideration. One concern in determining the level 40 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESof payments, as well as the wider requirements of the impact bond structure, is whether the demands will preclude the involvement of smaller actors, which have less bandwidth than larger service providers, to engage with the changes that these deals are likely to involve. SEQUENCING AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS Payments are made to the investor as metrics are achieved. The payment schedule outlines the sequencing and timing for payments from the outcome funder to the investor, and the level of payment depends on the results achieved by the service provider. There are two approaches to structuring payments. In some cases, the outcome funder makes one bullet payment to the investor at the conclusion of the impact bond. This approach is relatively simple to structure but represents a high risk for the investor because of the length of time between the initial investment and the outcome payment. Alternatively, the outcome funder makes a series of payments to the investor. This tiered approach reduces risk for investors and is more appropriate for impact bonds with long tenors. In some cases, initial or interval payments are tied to output metrics and then graduate toward outcome and impact metrics later in the life cycle of the bond. This approach ensures that investors can be paid multiple times during the impact bond while still maintaining long-term focus on desired impact. In some impact bonds, outcome funds are then \"recycled\" to support further service provision, a process that also has the advantage of necessitating smaller up-front capital commitments. Another important consideration is to incorporate incentive payments for service providers into the payment structure. For example, some impact bonds set a maximum return for investors based on service provider performance. If the service provider performs at a high level, it receives an incentive payment directly from the outcome funder. Finally, it can be beneficial to include price adjustment mechanisms in the payment structure of an impact bond. Estimating the payment size and most efficient payment schedule during the design phase can be difficult and inaccurate: In particular, the extended design process, as well as lack of evidence on costs, can result in underpricing. Therefore, including a price adjustment mechanism in the payment structure can be useful, so that the payment size or schedule can be adapted as necessary during the impact bond. The price adjustment can either occur continuously or be re-evaluated at predetermined times (such as every 18 months) over the life of the impact bond. When you have staggered payment metrics, from outputs to intermediate outcomes, you have the opportunity to learn and see what's working. \u2014Impact bond practitioner41 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDKEY TAKEAWAYS: Criteria for a strong impact metric are that it is measurable, meaningful, and set at the appropriate level. Impact bonds are designed to shift the emphasis from inputs to outputs or outcomes. Outcomes provide more flexibility, while outputs may be easier to measure in the short term. Selecting impact metrics means negotiating priorities among stakeholders. Data quality can be a challenge for identifying impact metrics in developing countries. Incentive structures for service providers can be used to align their incentives with investors or to target marginalized populations. Determining the level of payments can be either cost based, in which the service provider estimates the total cost of achieving a set of metrics, or market based, in which the outcome funder sets a price it is willing to pay for a set of metrics. There is debate on whether to include monitoring and evaluation costs in payment amounts. Payments from the outcome funder to the investor can be a bullet payment at the end of the impact bond, or a set of interim and final payments, which can reduce investor risk. Recycling of outcome payments over the course of the bond can also reduce up-front capital commitments. It is important to create incentives for service providers through payment structures and to ensure that there are price adjustment mechanisms on a continuous basis or at set intervals.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8IDENTIFYING METRICS AND STRUCTURING PAYMENTS42 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESDEVELOPING THE OPERATING MODEL, STRUCTURING THE VEHICLE, AND RAISING CAPITAL OPERATING MODEL While implementation of impact bonds in developing countries remains too nascent to effectively draw lessons on the operating model, practitioners agree that performance management and reporting capacity are a critical part of the operating model. Effective performance management ensures that service providers track and adapt activities to achieve the greatest possible impact. Performance management of the service provider can be supported by the investor, the intermediary, or the technical assistance adviser. Further, service providers should have capacity to report interim achievements. Also, since reporting requirements for impact bonds can be burdensome, additional resources or capacity building that may be required to support back office functioning should be built into the operating model from the outset. In addition, these reporting structures need to be adapted to suit the structure of impact bonds. LEGAL STRUCTURE The legal structure is an important issue for establishing contractual relationships among key stakeholders; however, many practitioners note that the legal structure is relatively easy to determine once the other key components (such as metrics and payment structure) are in place. There are two possible models: 43 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDindividual impact bonds and impact bond funds. In an individual impact bond, there is a single outcome payment contract, while in an impact bond fund there are several payment contracts between the outcome funder and different service providers on the same social issue. As Figure 10 indicates, to date there are four types of impact bond structure, depending on which actor has the contract with the outcome funder. Further details on each structure can be found in Table 3. 1. Direct: The contract is between the outcome funder and the service provider, which conducts its own performance management. 2. Intermediated: The contract is between the outcome funder and the investors. The intermediary is still likely to play a central role, which may involve defining outcome metrics and procuring service providers. 3. Managed: The outcome funder has a contract with the intermediary, which is responsible for raising capital and overseeing performance management. 4. High-risk managed: Another potential structure, perhaps most relevant in developing countries, is the high-risk managed, where further specialist knowledge provided by the implementation manager and investor intermediary can mitigate the challenges of working in contexts with constrained data capacity and political or financial instability. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) may be created as a conduit for funds, in which case the outcome payment contract is with the SPV. In this case, contract structures depend on the contract between the outcome funder and the actor with the leadership role within the SPV. In a managed impact bond structure, the intermediary leads the SPV, which contracts with the outcome funder; in an intermediated structure, the contract is between the outcome funder and an investor-led SPV; and in a direct structure the service provider contracts directly with the outcome funder. Other entities may also take on a similar role to an SPV: For example, in the Colombia Workforce Development SIB, the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) of the IDB will channel the outcome funds of the Swiss government. Regardless of approach, the legal structure must be tailored to the specific needs of the relationship between the entities. For example, some practitioners noted that it may not be necessary to include performance management processes in the contract between the outcome funder and the investor, while it is vital to ensure that this component is included in the contract between the investor and the service provider. As can be expected, considerations around legal structure depend on the frameworks available within the specific country of implementation or chosen jurisdiction of domicile. These will vary country by country and are driven by numerous considerations. 2 2. Instiglio, with the support of several legal firms, published A legal road map for social impact bonds in developing countries in November 2014, a valuable resource for understanding the legal considerations for Colombia, Mexico, South Africa, Mauritius, India, Chile, and Brazil.44 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESImpact Bond Contracting Structures FIGURE 10 DIRECT INTERMEDIATED MANAGED HIGH-RISK MANAGED Source: Adapted LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDRole Managed Intermediated Direct High-risk managed Identify social challengeOutcome funder and/or intermediary and/or service provider and/or technical assistance providerOutcome funder and/or intermediaryOutcome funder and/or intermediaryOutcome funder and/or implementation manager Determine feasibility based on impact bond criteriaIntermediary Intermediary and/or service provider and/or outcome funderOutcome funder and/or service provider and/or investorAll parties Raise capital Intermediary Intermediary Intermediary and/or service provider and/or investorInvestor intermediary Define outcome MetricsOutcome funder and/or service provider and/or investorIntermediary and/or outcome funderOutcome funder and/or service provider and/or investorAll parties Procure service providerIntermediary and outcome funderOutcome funder and/or intermediary and/or investorOutcome funder or intermediaryImplementation manager Contract with Outcome FunderIntermediary or majority intermediary-controlled SPVIntermediary or majority intermediary-controlled SPVService provider or majority service provider-controlled SPVInvestor intermediary Provide ServicesService provider Service provider Service provider Service provider Manage performanceIntermediary Intermediary (commissioned by investors or majority investor-controlled SPV)Service provider Implementation manager Measure/Validate OutcomeAchievementEvaluator or outcome funderOutcome funder or external validatorExternal validatorActor responsible by type of impact bond structure TABLE 3 Source: adapted from Goodall (2014)46 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESGOVERNANCE STRUCTURE The governance structure is another important component of an impact bond. Investors tend to require strong governance representation, given they are invested in ensuring that service providers are performing as contracted. Long-term sustainability is one consideration in the governance structure. For example, one impact bond has a governance structure that includes representatives from institutions that are likely to be follow-on investors or outcome funders. This allows these institutions to develop a strong understanding and build a sense of ownership of the impact bond before committing funding. RAISING CAPITAL Raising capital from investors is a critical component of any impact bond. While the long-term objective of impact bonds may be to catalyze large sums of commercial private capital, to date impact bonds have relied heavily on investors that are not seeking market returns. These investors\u2014such as corporate or family foundations\u2014provide soft investment capital, which is often concessional. These investments are critical for building the evidence base for impact bonds and to demonstrate financial and social returns. Impact bonds can be both cost- and time-intensive to establish. The design can be particularly costly if extensive research or an RCT is requested to validate the impact model or theory of change, but other steps\u2014such as identifying the service provider(s) and outcome funder(s) and agreeing on the payment structure\u2014can be time-consuming and costly as well. Practitioners emphasized that it is important to consider the design costs in relation to the fundraising target. Up-front payment from the investor to the service provider can be partial or in full. Some impact bonds are structured more like debt, and others like equity. In some impact bonds, returns to investors are directly invested back into the service provider through the impact bond. This results in a much lower up-front level of commitment. HOW TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT CAPITAL Several criteria for attracting investment capital to impact There's an interesting question at the strategic-level around governance: How do you set it up in a way that provides the investors with a certain degree of control? \u2014Impact bond practitioner47 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDbonds have been collected through practitioner experience. 1. Evidence-based theory of change: Potential investors must understand and buy into the proposed intervention's theory of change. That is, each investor must accept that the proposed inputs could produce the desired metrics in a timely and efficient manner, and therefore allow the investor to understand the risk profile of the investment. This can require some education if an investor is not familiar with the sector, region, or intervention. 2. Attractive risk-return profile: Ultimately, the risk-return profile of the investment must be attractive to investors relative to other market opportunities. The investor must understand the risks involved in the investment, and returns must be commensurate to the risk. 3. Patient capital: Given the nascent state of impact bonds, there remains a need for investment capital that will tolerate limited information, difficult market conditions, and adaptation during the impact bond life. WHEN TO APPROACH INVESTORS The timing on approaching investors is important. Investors should be engaged early enough in the process to ensure that the impact bond meets their risk-return expectations, while making certain that the design process maintains focus on the desired outcomes and impact. On one hand, it can be easier to raise investment capital later in the design process, once the impact bond is structured and the outcome funder(s) is in place. Investors may have more confidence in the viability of an impact bond once all key stakeholders are engaged and key terms are defined. On the other hand, it can be more difficult to raise investment capital once the structure is finalized if the metrics and the risk-return profile of the investment do not suit investors. Alternatively, investors can be engaged early in the design process, allowing the investor to play an important role in determining the metrics and structure. There may be consequences in involving investors at this stage, such as a shift from impact metrics\u2014which are often difficult to measure\u2014to output metrics, which are more tangible and easily realizable in the short term. A compromise may be to reach out to investors to gain initial interest and approach them again once the impact bond is further along in development. The timing of engaging investors will be highly dependent on context and actors. However, the process can be lengthy, and investors may lose patience if brought on too early. We haven't finished fundraising. It's something that takes a lot of time. You have to educate many of the different players. \u2014Impact bond practitioner48 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESKEY TAKEAWAYS: Performance management and reporting capacity are a critical part of the impact bond operating model. Legal structure is relatively easy to determine once the other key components are in place. The common approach is a contractual arrangement between the investor and service provider and outcome funder and investor. Investors typically require robust governance representation given their strong interest in monitoring service provider performance; governance can also be a useful tool in attracting key stakeholders that can support the future sustainability of the impact bond. While much impact bond discussion centers on the potential of impact bonds to attract commercial private capital to development, in reality, investors often provide soft, concessional investment and aren't considered commercial investors. In theory, raising investment capital after all key pieces, particularly outcome funders, are in place is easy; in reality, however, investors often want to be involved in early-stage structuring to ensure that the risk-return profile of their investment is acceptable.1 2 3 4 5DEVELOPING THE OPERATING MODEL, STRUCTURING THE VEHICLE, AND RAISING CAPITAL49 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDIMPLEMENTING THE IMPACT BOND AND MEASURING IMPACT EVALUATION The validation of output and/or outcome achievement is crucial in impact bonds, so considerable energy will go into deciding how success will be measured. For impact bonds in high-income countries, the methods of evaluation have fallen into four categories: validated administrative data, historical comparison, quasi-experimental, and randomized controlled trials. Validated administrative data is by far the most frequently used method in high-income countries, used in over half of the currently contracted impact bonds for which evaluation methodology data are available. The choice of evaluation methodology in impact bonds depends on five considerations: what the outcome funder is seeking to achieve; contextual issues, such as the availability of data or the presence of a comparison group; the timeline of the contract and how much time there will be for data collection; the evaluation budget; and the political sensitivities around the transaction or the intervention. GOAL OF THE IMPACT BOND The most desirable method of evaluation is likely to depend on the individual impact bond, and the question that the outcome funders (other actors may have interests as well) want to answer or what they are trying to achieve. An outcome funder might have several potential goals: to achieve a set of outcomes and pay only for success; to achieve a set of outcomes at the lowest possible price; to determine if a particular intervention or service provider delivers better outcomes than a counterfactual; to compare outcomes among interventions or service providers; to determine which of a set of interventions or service providers delivers a set of outcomes for the lowest price; to determine whether the impact bond structure delivers better outcomes than funding 50 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESinputs; or to determine whether the impact bond structure delivers better outcomes than traditional results-based financing. Beyond this question, other determinants of evaluation could include data availability, measurement tool availability, evaluation costs, capacity to collect and analyze data, and the existence of comparison groups. For example, if the goal is to simply achieve a set of outcomes and pay only for success, validated administrative data can be used, but if the aim is to determine the achievement of outcomes relative to a counterfactual, an RCT may be the most appropriate methodology. For more detail, see Annex C. There is considerable concern around whether impact bonds are suitable for evaluation through an RCT. In some cases, pressure may come from stakeholders to evaluate with an RCT, because of the rigor of this method and the perception that it represents the \"gold standard\" of impact evaluation. For several reasons, however, an RCT may not be the best strategy. First, with impact bonds the focus is on results achieved, rather than on the effects of specific interventions, so there may be less value in an evaluation method that demands strict adherence to particular treatments. Moreover, if the goal is to meet a set of targets, rather than to test the causal relationship between treatments and outcomes, an expensive RCT may be less necessary for this purpose. If an RCT is desired, one option for incorporating this method could be to randomize intervention. Simply randomizing treatment, rather than insisting that everyone be treated identically, could preserve flexibility for providers. In this way, those who receive interventions, regardless of how or when they were treated, could be compared with those in a control group. Selecting the right evaluator for the impact bond is also likely to depend on the kind of evaluation the stakeholders have in mind. Part of the process will be understanding the methodologies that different evaluators plan to use and whether these suit the design of the impact bond or the demands of stakeholders. CONTEXT AND POPULATION The complexity of the populations who are often served by the interventions is a key challenge for evaluating the success of impact bonds. Dealing with this effectively might involve setting different targets by gender, socioeconomic status, or location in rural or urban areas. If baseline levels of the indicators of interest differ systematically by these groups, setting different targets, or measuring growth, may be preferable to a universal target. I'm just not sure we can do [an RCT] effectively without compromising flexibility and creating rigidities that will scare the investors. \u2014Impact bond practitioner51 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDMETRICS AND DATA AVAILABILITY Attribution is an additional challenge for evaluating impact bonds in low- and middle-income countries. If a number of different interventions are taking place on the population of interest, it will be difficult to establish how much of the change is due to the actions of one service provider. Since the focus will likely be on results, this may not be an issue for measuring the success of the impact bond, but it may be a consideration for outcome funders that would like accurate information on the price of outcomes in the future. Data limitations are a key concern for evaluating impact bonds, especially in developing countries, where data quality is often low. Effective evaluations depend on good data collection to evaluate the results achieved against the targets. COST Evaluation can be a costly part of an impact bond, and the total cost will depend on the specific requirements of the various parties. Collecting baseline data, following large samples, and organizing RCTs can be expensive and time-consuming. Who pays for the evaluation, and how it is paid for, will depend on the specific impact bond. The cost of the evaluation may be incorporated into the cost per beneficiary or be paid directly to the outcome evaluator by the outcome funder. PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT As demonstrated above, performance management is extremely important to investors whose capital is at risk. Three broad parties may take on the responsibility for partner and performance management, depending on the capacity of the service provider, the involvement of the investor, and the desire for long-term sustainability. 1. Investor-led: Donors, outcome funders, and other intermediaries are often happy to leave performance management to the service providers or the investors. Investors that are very involved in the impact bond process may take a management role given their expertise and resources in performance management. 2. Service provider-led: Many practitioners argue that performance management should be the responsibility of the service provider. Service providers are the closest to performance data, and building out performance management frameworks can contribute to the long-term sustainability of their work. A key question for this approach is whether the service providers have sufficient capability to implement effective performance management. Adding a capacity-building component to the project can assist in the transformation of a service provider into a results-focused organization. 52 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES3. Third party-led: An alternative approach is for the impact bond to be structured to include a third-party performance manager. The performance manager would serve an intermediary function, managing the relationship with the service provider. A key advantage of this approach would be providing external consultation and the ability to problem-solve in the field. This may be especially valuable in the context of developing countries, where these organizations can fulfill a confidence-building role in a risky environment. However, this requires additional capital. Effective performance management requires strong management information systems. These could comprise work planning and forecasting systems, data collection and analysis systems, and performance reports and dashboards. Each system needs to be tailored to the unique context of the underlying impact bond. Systems must be well-structured to ensure that new data can be interpreted appropriately, as well as flexible enough to adapt should data structures change. The system should also be able to handle different data types (such as service provider reports and field reports) from several organizations. These systems must effectively provide analysis on a continuous basis to monitor performance and manage it where required. On building in-house capacity for performance management, I think that's key. At some point, you are going to want this to be sustainable, and the service providers must be able to continue without an impact bond structure. \u2014Impact bond practitioner53 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDKEY TAKEAWAYS: The most desirable method of evaluation will depend on what the outcome funder is seeking to achieve by using payment by results financing. The choice of evaluation methodology may depend on contextual issues, such as the complexity of the populations served by the intervention, the availability of data, or the presence of a control group. The timeline of the contract may affect the choice of methodology, depending on how much time there will be for data collection. The evaluation budget may constrain the choice of methodology: RCTs can be expensive, and there may not be adequate funding. Political sensitivities around the contract or the intervention itself may shape the choice of evaluation, for example if there is a need to demonstrate the causal role of a particular program. Effective performance management requires strong management information systems. These could comprise work planning and forecasting systems, data collection and analysis systems, and performance reports and dashboards.1 2 3 4 5 6IMPLEMENTING THE IMPACT BOND AND MEASURING IMPACT54 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESCONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS Tackling the outsize challenges facing the developing world today will require large amounts of money, but it will also take creativity, flexibility, collaboration, and perseverance from a range of actors across the globe including the public, private, and philanthropic sectors. This report aims to capture the early learnings from one innovative tool that attempts to bring all of those components to bear. Social and development impact bonds are in their nascence globally but in particular in the developing world, with the first DIB contracted only in early 2015 and a total of three launched to date (along with one SIB in a developing country). While much remains to be learned, thus far the practitioners engaged in designing and implementing impact bonds have gathered a great deal of knowledge about what works and what does not. As this and similar tools, which tie payments to outputs or outcomes, continue to grow in their use, our hope is that their application improves with the broader goal of improving systems of social service financing and delivery and achieving the sustainable development goals set forth in 2015. LOOKING FORWARD At present, most of the impact bond transactions are small and bespoke (including those in high-income countries). For impact bonds and more traditional payment by results mechanisms to reach greater scale in terms of beneficiaries served, a number of factors will be critical. 1. EXPAND THE EVIDENCE BASE Funders want to support interventions and service providers that have a record of achieving outcomes. In impact bonds, in which investors also hope to make a financial return, this is even truer. This means that some evidence is needed to demonstrate to investors that results achievement is likely. What is tricky is that at least to date, impact bonds seem to fill a niche where there is sufficient evidence for investors to take the risk of investing but perhaps not 55 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDenough evidence for outcome funders to take the risk of scaling the intervention. Risk-averse investors may require evidence from rigorous experimental or quasi-experimental evaluations to be able to attribute outcome achievement to the intervention, while for more risk-friendly investors, historical data may be sufficient. Regardless of the rigor needed, data on program performance are crucial. For many service providers, however, the cost of data collection and evaluation is prohibitive, and others have limited capacity to collect and manage data to evaluate impact. Philanthropic funding will be critical to help service providers build their evidence base. Investments in data collection and in evaluation of programs will be money well-spent, as this is a first step in shifting the focus away from inputs to outcome achievement. Moreover, the more providers are delivering certain outcomes with some evidence behind them, the greater the potential to attract larger sums of (even potentially commercial) capital (see Point 5 \"support legislation\"). 2. BUILD CAPACITY OF SERVICE PROVIDERS Just as evidence is needed to demonstrate that an intervention or service provider is likely to deliver promised outcomes, there needs to be evidence that service providers can use data to regularly monitor performance and improve service delivery in an iterative way. To date, most service providers engaged in impact bonds globally had some experience in performance management or at least had the data available to be used in monitoring and course adjustment. In some cases, such training was provided in the lead-up to the implementation of the impact bond, and in others, capacity building in this area occurred over the course of the impact bond. Support to build capacity of service providers in data collection and performance management is imperative not only to expanding the use of impact bonds and other payment by results mechanisms, but for broader systems improvement and outcome achievement. 3. EDUCATE POTENTIAL OUTCOME FUNDERS Historically, most governments, donor agencies, and foundations have funded the delivery of services based on inputs or process, and one of the key arguments for using impact bonds is that in the past this funding has been unable to demonstrate impact effectively. Since paying for outcomes is not the norm, some education or sensitization will be key to opening the door to this manner of funding. Learning about impact bonds, and gaining experience of the complex process of negotiations, takes time and money. To develop internal expertise, organizations and governments will have to invest in learning about how impact bonds work. Outcome funders may also be concerned about the time and cost of setting up an impact bond. Negotiating among a range of stakeholders is a daunting process compared with simply funding the same intervention up-front. Tapping into potentially similar experiences 56 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIEScould be a good place to start. For example, some governments have used performance-based contracting in military contracts while others have used traditional results-based financing for social services. Examples from other countries (or the subnational level within a country) may provide useful guidance for potential outcome funders. Clear guidelines and steps to take will also facilitate this shift. Both scale and sustainability of financing based on outputs and outcomes will depend on government engagement. While DIBs may be a short-term solution providing evidence for the use of this model, SIBs, or a variation of the SIB model with government as outcome funders, will be critical. 4. EDUCATE POTENTIAL IMPACT INVESTORS As with outcome funders, impact bonds represent a new way of doing business for impact investors, even for those with experience investing in programs with social returns. Impact investors have a key part to play in the development of the impact bond field and will need educating about the nature of the contracts, the relationship with the other stakeholders, and their role in the deal. Impact investors will likely have different priorities and interests in the issues they wish to engage with, different risk profiles, and differing levels of emphasis on social versus financial returns. 5. SUPPORT LEGISLATION In some cases, legal issues may constrain the contracting of an impact bond (Instiglio, 2014; Z\u00fclow et al., 2017). There are three main legal aspects to consider. The first is related to investments and has multiple levels of complexity. For example, on the investor side, it may not be possible to transfer funds (equity or debt) to the holder of the investment funds, such as an intermediary or to a service provider before service delivery. Contracting between investors and (government) outcome funders may also be subject to legal constraints requiring, for example, public-private partnership laws. The second legal aspect is related to procurement and outcome funding. The procurement of service providers may be subject to open procurement regulations and will likely also require legal frameworks related to public-private partnerships, for example. Moreover, because payments based on outcomes are rarely the norm, rules and regulations must allow for this. This can become more complex if the monetizable savings for the provision of preventive services are distinctly located from the payments for those services. Finally, fiscal implications for the investments (debt and equity) and their dividends must be considered. Tax laws may be more or less favorable for investors engaging in these kinds of financing structures. Within each of those three categories, numerous factors related to risk must be considered. Entities interested in enabling the growth of impact bonds should consider supporting efforts to enact or modify legislation that facilitates and incentivizes such contracting.57 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELD6. ESTABLISH OUTCOME FUNDS In 2015, $153 billion was spent by donors on official development assistance (ODA) (World Bank, n.d.) to developing countries. This was in addition to the money spent by domestic governments on public services. International organizations have recognized the importance of domestic resource mobilization (DRM), as well as the challenges that developing countries face in raising taxes, including poor governance and high levels of informality (World Bank, 2016). Despite the levels of donor aid, and the encouragement of DRM, poor human development outcomes persist: 800 million people around the world are living on less than $1.25 a day (United Nations Development Programme, 2017), and 263 million children and young people are out of school (Education Commission, 2016). In the U.S., accountability and use of evaluation in foreign aid have increased in recent administrations, but more emphasis on data is still needed (Ingram, 2016). Indeed, despite high levels of ODA, results are far from guaranteed, and gaps in political will or poor governance may constrain the effectiveness of donor spending (The Economist, 2015). One way of ensuring that this money is better spent is to tie funding to the achievements of the desired results. Outcome funds, which pool donor funding, represent a mechanism for putting this into action. In the international development context, outcome funds are under discussion for education and refugees. 7. CREATE GLOBAL INVESTMENT FUNDS While spending better is critical, and in fact should be the No. 1 priority in tackling the SDGs, there is also a need for simply more capital. The annual funding gap to achieve the SDGs is estimated at $2.5 trillion (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 2014). Private capital could help to bridge this gap: In 2016, the Annual Impact Investor Survey conducted by the Global Impact Investing Network found that its respondents invested $22.1 billion in almost 8,000 impact investments and planned to increase their investments in 2017 (Global Impact Investing Network, 2017). However, the landscape for investors in impact bonds remains fragmented, and potential investors may be put off by the lengthy negotiation period and often small scale of the contracts. Investment funds, such as the Bridges Social Impact Bond Fund in the U.K., which directs private capital toward impact bonds, offer a potential solution to this challenge (Bridges Fund Management, n.d.). A global investment fund that pools the resources of impact investors with an interest in development outcomes could reduce the transaction costs of the impact bond process and increase the scale of impact investments in results-based financing.58 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESREFERENCES Bellinger, A., Terway, A., & Burnett, N.

Just under half of the outcome payment for this project is being provided by Colombia's Department for Social Prosperity, with the remaining payment made by the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), with funds provided by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). The SIB finances employment measures such as skills training, psychosocial support, and intermediation services for formal job placement and retention for 514 vulnerable individuals. With the contracts signed in March 2017, service provision began in May, and the contract will end July 31, 2018. Q: WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS SIB? A: The SIB has several interesting and unique features. First, it is the first social impact bond to be launched in an emerging market or developing country. Second, the Colombian government will pay for outcomes with co-financing from the Swiss Cooperation - SECO (paid through IDB-MIF), demonstrating a model of blending development aid and finance with government funding for outcome payments. Third, three of Colombia's largest foundations will be impact investors for the first time, serving to catalyze the market. Fourth, the SIB is part of a larger social impact bond initiative on workforce development between the MIF and the Swiss Cooperation - SECO that includes outcomes co-financing for up to three social impact bonds as well as support for market building and knowledge creation. Fifth, it is one of only two SIBs launched that include internally displaced people and victims of conflict as part of the target population. Finally, the SIB uses administrative data from the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, which was not involved in the provision of services or the outcome payment, as an innovative solution to the challenge of data availability to verify results. Q: WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE OF PLANNED TIMELINE VS. REALITY? A: The turnaround for this SIB was very quick: The design process began in July 2016, and 62 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESthe contract was signed in March 2017. The short time frame was a result of several years of building stakeholder awareness; the national government's effort to develop results-based financing instruments; and exploring the model with all the stakeholders. Q: WHAT CHALLENGES WERE FACED IN THE DESIGN OF THIS SIB? A: One of the key challenges was how to work around the government's budgeting process, which requires that funds be spent within the year. While the contract is until 2018, the government of Colombia will pay only for outcomes verified within 2017, up to a total of 1 billion Colombian pesos. Any achievements after this amount, or achieved in the second year, will be paid by the MIF, with SECO funding. Another significant challenge was the lack of information regarding price for the results sought. The stakeholders had to use a hybrid method of calculation involving the price paid by the government of Colombia for job training for vulnerable populations and price quotations from the service providers. Q: HOW DO THE OUTCOME METRICS WORK? A: For this SIB there are three outcome metrics: job placement, three-month job retention, and six-month job retention. For each individual who is placed in a job, the outcome funders will pay 50 percent of the total per capita payment, with another 50 percent if an individual retains the job for three months, for a maximum of 514 individuals. For individuals who are still in a job after six months, the MIF, with funds from the Swiss Cooperation - SECO, will pay a bonus of 10 percent in addition to the per capita outcome payment. INDIA EDUCATE GIRLS DIB CASE STUDY The India Educate Girls DIB, contracted in May 2015, aimed to boost enrollment for out-of-school girls and to improve the literacy of both boys and girls in Rajasthan state, India. The services financed by this DIB target children in 166 schools in the Bhilwara district, for a total of 15,000 children, 9,000 of whom are girls. Educate Girls trains a team of volunteers to make door-to-door visits to encourage enrollment and deliver curriculum enhancement to public school classrooms. Due to finish in May 2018, the DIB has completed two years of interventions and entered its final year. For more details on the DIB, see the Deal Book in Annex D. Q: WHY WAS THE IMPACT BOND STRUCTURE SELECTED FOR THIS INTERVENTION? A: The impact bond structure unlocked new funding streams and focused the attention of the intervention on impact. This was a way of showcasing how incentives, service provider flexibility, and the encouragement of innovation 63 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDcan pave the way to more results- focused development. Q: WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE OF PLANNED TIMELINE VS. REALITY? A: There was a reduced implementation period in the first year of the impact bond, because of delays in signing contracts, getting measurements for the independent evaluator, and signing memorandums of understanding with the government. This meant that the first year of the learning intervention, scheduled to begin in September and finish in March, in fact started in October and finished in February, resulting in an effective implementation of 60 percent for the learning intervention. Q: WHAT HAVE THE RESULTS SO FAR SHOWN? A: In the second year of the DIB, the program had reached 88 percent of the three-year enrollment target and 50 percent of the three-year outcome target. Although overall outcomes will not be calculated until 2018, from these results UBS Optimus Foundation, the investor, will have recouped 72 percent of the initial investment and 54 percent of the expected outcome payment (initial investment plus internal rate of return). Q: WHAT WERE SOME OF THE MAIN CHALLENGES TO SETTING UP A DIB? A: The first challenge was a low-quality data environment on the ground. Both historical performance data and administrative data were weak, and there was little evidence of behavior under incentives. Other challenges included the need to build a performance management system, and the capacity of staff in terms of integrating performance insights, and leading an outcomes-oriented culture. Finally, the setup of the DIB was costly, because of the need to establish new relationships, integrate new techniques and mindsets, and face high levels of public scrutiny. Q: WHAT LESSONS DID YOU LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE? A: One lesson was that setting up the DIB required the stakeholders to be resourceful; given the poor reliability of data, identifying the target population and metrics required flexibility. Moreover, the complexity of the process, and the number of stakeholders, meant that strong communication was essential. A new role for the outcome funder and investor also emerged from the process: While the funder spent more on outcomes and less on managing activities, the investor used risk management strategies from its commercial banking branch, which it had not used for other grants. Finally, the DIB has changed the way the service provider operates. Performance data is now accessed by frontline workers, helping them to identify barriers to outcomes early.64 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESPERU SUSTAINABLE COCOA AND COFFEE PRODUCTION DIB CASE STUDY The Peru Sustainable Cocoa and Coffee Production DIB, launched in January 2015, provided technical support to agricultural practices to the Ash\u00e1ninka people of the Ene River in the Peruvian Amazon. Closing in December 2015, the bond targeted 133 families, with interventions to improve collection and postharvest techniques for cocoa, restore coffee plots affected by yellow leaf rust disease, and provide marketing support to the local cooperative, Kemito Ene. For more details on the DIB, see the Deal Book in Annex D. Q: WHO INITIATED THE IMPACT BOND DISCUSSION? A: The conversation around the impact bond was initiated by the outcome funder, the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC), and the process from this point was straightforward. CFC commissioned the Rainforest Foundation U.K. (RFUK) to look into a DIB, and they presented a proposal to the investor (a California-based private foundation) as an impact investment learning opportunity. The outcomes were defined collaboratively by those three parties. Q: WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH PLANNED TIMELINE VS. REALITY? A: Despite the straightforward negotiations, there was a delay in getting the DIB off the ground, mainly due to administrative processes\u2014this was a new process for all parties. In an agriculture DIB, timing is especially crucial, since interventions are likely to be seasonal, and setbacks may mean waiting a full year before the project can move forward to coincide with the next harvest. Q: WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MAIN CHALLENGES IN SETTING UP A DIB? A: The challenges in the Peru pilot all related to the fact that this was a new instrument. First, it was challenging to set good, measurable indicators. For this project, funding was not an issue; as a pilot, the resources required were relatively small. The partners were brought together by their interest in testing the DIB concept and a commitment to putting this into practice. However, while not an issue for the initial pilot, one of the key challenges to scaling up a DIB is marketing the concept to funders, as well as getting agreement between the outcome funder and the service provider. Outcome funder organizations are not set up to make the multistakeholder decisions that are part of impact bonds: Different mechanisms need to be found to get approval, and it takes longer than a traditional grant agreement. The principals of private foundations still need to discover the benefits of paying for the results instead of paying for promises, as has been frequently the case in the past. We are still looking for effective ways to 65 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDpresent DIB opportunities to such principal decision makers, and a real test case goes a long way here. Q: WHAT LESSONS DID YOU LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE? A: One of the lessons from this DIB was the importance of flexibility. The service provider was able to change their strategy on how they spent the resources. The DIB also influenced an improvement in performance management and monitoring systems, and this learning means that in the next DIB there will be an investment in monitoring tools. Another key element was creating an impact matrix. The outcome evaluator, KIT, played an important role here by creating realistic, measurable, and achievable indicators to capture results. Each partner learned from its specific role in the DIB, which was quite a different experience to the conventional practice of each organization. \"While contracted before publication, due to time restrictions, it was not possible to incorporate a case study for the ICRC Programme for Humanitarian Impact Investment (PHII)\"66 | IMPACT BONDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIESANNEX B: GLOSSARY OF ACTORS Actor Impact bond Role Acrux Partners Argentina Youth Employment SIB Intermediary and technical assistance AEDES/IRESCO Cameroon Cataract DIB Outcome evaluator Africa Eye FoundationCameroon provider Partners Peru Climate-Smart Agriculture DIB Investor ApexHi Charitable TrustSouth Africa ECD Impact Bond Innovation Fund - Social DevelopmentOutcome funder Aravind Eye Care System Cameroon Cataract DIB Technical assistance (technical adviser) Baker McKenzie Colombia Workforce Development SIB Technical assistance (legal work) Banamex Fomento SocialMexico The Future in My Hands SIB Investor Bank of Palestine Palestine Type II Diabetes DIB Investor Bertha Centre for Social Innovation and EntrepreneurshipSouth Africa Workforce Development SIB Outcome evaluator British Asian Trust (BAT)India Education DIB Outcome Funder La FoundationICRC Programme for Humanitarian Impact Investment (PHII)Outcome funder CCMX Mexico The Future in My Hands SIB Technical assistance (advisory board) CEMEX Mexico The Future in My Hands SIB Technical assistance (advisory board) Center for Global Development (CGD)Cameroon Cataract DIB Technical assistance (thought leadership)67 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELDActor Impact bond Role Children's Investment Fund FoundationIndia Educate Girls DIB Outcome funder Coffee Heritage CompanyUganda Empowering Women and Youth in the Coffee Value Chain DIBService provider Common Fund for Commodities1.

The relatively small DIB was piloted to demonstrate a practical application of an impact bond to evaluate its effectiveness, efficiency, as well as legal, administrative and other operational aspects. DEVELOPMENT STAGE: Early-stage design Implementation Complete The Ash\u00e1ninka people of the Ene River live in remote forest villages in the Peruvian Amazon and rely on agriculture - particularly cocoa and coffee - for monetary income to support their livelihoods to cover mainly heath and education. However, much of their production is wasted due to post harvest loss, and leaf rust disease has decimated coffee plots.

The impact bond structure is used because it unlocks new funding streams and enables the stakeholders to maintain an unprecedented razor sharp focus on impact. The ultimate aim is for this DIB to serve as a proof-of-concept of the idea that introducing incentives, giving service providers discretion, and encouraging them to innovate (among other features) can drive greater impact, opening the door for a new development practice focused on results.DEVELOPMENT STAGE: Early-stage design Implementation Complete 3.7 million girls are out of school in India. Rajasthan has 9 of the 26 districts with the worst gender indicators and 40% of girls drop out before reaching fifth grade. Only 15% of children in primary school can read a simple story in Hindi. Uneducated girls in India are 3 times more likely to contract HIV, earn 10% less income, and marry 3 years earlier than educated ones.

EVALUATION METHOD: 1) Enrollment: A baseline of out-of-school girls was created through household surveys before the implementation of the program; IDinsight independently verifies the accuracy of the enrollment list by sampling a portion of the lists and conducting school and household visits to measure the percentage of out-of-school girls who are enrolled in school rosters after three years. 2) Learning: IDinsight evaluates learning outcomes through a clustered randomized control trial. The students' learning progress was measured using the ASER assessment. A baseline test was administered at the start of the trial 3 period to students in Grades 1-5 (the students that will receive the learning intervention in any given year during the life time of the project) randomly sampled from schools receiving the intervention and control schools. It measured students' starting grades on a scale of A to E for English and Math, and A+ to E for Hindi. The students are tested again at the end of every school year for three years. The evaluator will then calculate the aggregate learning gains in terms of the number of levels gained on the ASER scale by children in schools receiving Educate Girls' intervention as compared to children in control schools. PAYMENT THRESHOLD: This design does not use thresholds. Instead it links outcome payments to each additional unit of outcome that Educate Girls achieves. The proposed payment formula does not include a level of outcomes that should be observed before payment begins. This simplifies the payment formula. PAYMENT SCHEDULE AND AMOUNTS: UBSOF disburses 50% of investment principal to Educate Girls in 2015 and 50% in 2016; CIFF will disburse one outcome payment of $0-$412,000 to UBSOF in 2018 MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS OF INVESTMENT FOR INVESTORS: 100% MAXIMUM RETURN: Target IRR = 10%, max IRR = 15%; UBSOF pays incentive to Educate Girls equal to 32% of its payment above principal RESULTS TO DATE: After two-thirds of the full DIB term has elapsed, results show the program has enrolled 69% of all out-of-school girls identified in year 1 and 2, and has achieved 50% of the total target for learning progress. Based on this progress, UBSOF would have already recouped approximately 72% of the initial investment in year 2, a promising performance despite challenges in launching the intervention on time. Final results results will be available in June 2018.

The first SIB aims to achieve greater cost-effectiveness in workforce development projects for difficult-to-place populations (while also serving as a learning and knowledge development tool), by funding interventions which aim to ensure long-term employment outcomes for vulnerable populations. The impact bond structure is used because it is an innovative way of changing procurement practices from paying for activities to paying for results, maximizing the impact of social programs. The ultimate aim is to develop a market for investments in social programs which will be able to scale up the government's work and take on the risks associated with innovation. DEVELOPMENT STAGE: Early-stage design Implementation Complete Colombia is at a turning point in the history of its economic development. Since the recession of 1999-2000, Colombia's employment rate and economy have been growing steadily, positioning the country as an upper middle income country. Expanding job opportunities and creating access to formal and decent jobs for vulnerable populations in urban areas is a priority for the government. Many of these vulnerable groups, such as young people living in extreme poverty and victims of the armed conflict, are excluded from the formal economy.DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGE514 TARGET NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIESThe SIB will target unemployed vulnerable individuals who meet the following criteria used by Prosperidad Social (the sponsoring government entity): Have a SISBEN score (poverty measure) of 0 to 41.74, are registered in Red Unidos (ultra-vulnerable group) or are victims of displacement due to the armed conflict; Are between 18 and 40 years old; Are high-school graduates; Have not participated in Prosperidad Social's employment programs in the last two years.TARGET POPULATIONOVERVIEW COUNTRY COLOMBIA DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGEAgriculture Employment HealthEducation Social WelfareSECTOR:Late-stage design (higher specificity e.g., investors, funders, USD values)CITY/STATE BOGOT\u00c1, CALI, PEREIRA83 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELD This information is subject to changeCompleteTo improve quality by allowing the service provider flexibility in implementation To improve quality by establishing performance management systems To improve efficiency (maintain quality while increasing output or decreasing costs)To build service provider's capacity to operate in a Payment by Results model To build the aforementioned systems to facilitate operation at scaleTo cover a capital gap between the intervention and value to society To benefit from the involvement of investors (apart from capital) To share the risk of service performance between the government, service provider, and investor, thus aligning incentivesOther: To generate interest among other social impact investors in the country ACTOR(S) THAT RESPONDED TO IMPACT BOND RATIONALE: Government of Colombia, MIF, Swiss Cooperation-SECO, Fundaci\u00f3n Corona, InstiglioThe intervention as such is new necessitating flexibility for the intermediary to innovate and to coordinate multiple service providers.

DEVELOPMENT STAGE: Early-stage design Implementation CompleteOVERVIEW COUNTRY BRAZIL Late-stage design (higher specificity e.g., investors, outcome funders, USD values)CITY/STATE S\u00c3O PAOLO Investment in education is crucial for economic and social development. In Brazil, despite the recent progress in education indicators, access, completion, and learning rates still need to be improved. In the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, unsatisfactory indicators at secondary education include 87.2% of young people aged 15 to 17 years enrolled in school, but only 75.8% at the correct grade for their age. Failure rates are also significantly higher than state targets. Studies indicate that the main group that drop out of school and those with an age-grade gap are in situations of vulnerability and from that part of the population with the lowest income. Failure to complete high school means that young people face greater challenges in entering the labor market and, when they access it, they enter lower-paid positions.DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGEApproximately 10,000-12,000 TARGET NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIESSecondary-school students at schools in disadvantaged metropolitan areas of S\u00e3o Paolo who suffer from medium-high levels of vulnerability.

The impact bond structure is used because it provides strong incentives to test and optimize an innovative train-the-trainer KMC scaling model. It also leverages outcome funder commitments to bring in private investors' risk capital and scrutiny. The ultimate aim is for quality KMC to be integrated into Cameroon's healthcare system to ensure long-term sustainability, and be a model for scaling quality KMC in other countries. DEVELOPMENT STAGE: Early-stage design Implementation CompleteLate-stage design (higher specificity e.g., investors, outcome funders, USD values)CITY/STATELITTORAL, CENTRE, NORTH, ADAMAOUA, AND SOUTHWEST REGIONS LBW/preterm birth is the leading cause of under-five child deaths worldwide, and is also associated with longer term neurodevelopmental disabilities and cardiovascular disease later in life. KMC is backed by strong evidence in improving LBW/preterm infant health outcomes. A target in the Every Newborn Action Plan is to increase the reach of KMC to at least 50% of LBW/preterm infants globally by 2020.

During this four-year program, Village Enterprise aims to deliver quality at scale and significantly improve the life of the members of more than 18,000 households across multiple villages in rural Kenya and Uganda, and to compare DIB results to results under traditional financing to better understand the effect of flexibility and incentives in the project's impact thus contributing to the discussion of how to cost-effectively scale-up graduation.DEVELOPMENT STAGE : Early-stage design Implementation Complete Recent evidence suggests that ultra-poor graduation programs can have substantial impacts on poverty reduction. However, inconsistent performance has been observed across different programs, service providers and countries, which points to the importance of contextual factors in the achievements of outcomes. The project proposal is that, by disbursing funds with conditionality on evidence of success, providers will have flexibility and incentives to adapt the program to deliver greater impact while donors only pay in case of success.DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGEApprox. 18,000 households TARGET NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES Village Enterprise offers a 1-year graduation model to help the ultra-poor in rural Africa to escape from extreme poverty. The program is targeted at households living on less than $1.90 per day and has the following components: -Targeting: Individuals living in extreme poverty, that have no prior business experience, and are unable to provide for family's basic needs are identified and selectedINTERVENTIONUltra-poor households living in rural Kenya and Uganda.

The structure will shift the risk of performance of a relatively new and innovative intervention to socially motivated investors, seeking to increase the wellbeing of the beneficiaries and potentially create savings for the government. The ultimate aim is to validate an intervention that should scale as a public policy, as well to understand how a SIB could work in Mexico so the structure can be replicated in Jalisco and other states. Female heads of households (\"jefas\") are a vulnerable group in Mexico and throughout Latin America and the Caribbean: they are more likely to be unemployed and have lower levels of income than their male counterparts. In 2015, nearly 29% of all Mexican households were headed by jefas, and this number has been growing steadily. In the State of Jalisco, one in every three jefas lives in poverty. Many are \"trapped in poverty\" by low education, limited work experience, gender inequality in the workplace, lack of support networks and time constraints due to childcare. DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGE1,325 TARGET NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES The intervention is based on the fusion of two models that have demonstrated rigorous evidence of their effectiveness in other contexts: the BRAC/CGAP/FORD \"Graduation\" program implemented by Fundaci\u00f3n Capital and a model for economic empowerment of low income women through entrepreneurship implemented by Crea in Mexico. The program will be implemented in three rounds that would facilitate learning and a continuous improvement scheme. Basic financial literacy training using the LISTA program of Fundacion Capital, savings promotion, one-on-one mentoring, training in soft skills, child care, technical business trainings, a lump sum monetary transfer to purchase a productive asset, and tailored support to connecting to markets and servicing other needs.INTERVENTIONFemale heads of household, unemployed or self-employed, with income of less than 2.5 of the Mexican minimum wage (less than $10), with minor children, beneficiaries of the cash transfer program of the Government of Jalisco and residents in the metropolitan area of Guadalajara.TARGET POPULATIONOVERVIEW COUNTRY MEXICO DEVELOPMENT STAGE: Early-stage design Implementation CompleteLate-stage design (higher specificity e.g., investors, outcome funders, USD values)CITY/STATE METROPOLITAN AREA OF GUADALAJARA, JALISCO DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGE SECTOR:Agriculture Health Social WelfareEducation Employment99 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELD This information is subject to changeThe intervention is based on the fusion of two models that have demonstrated rigorous evidence of their effectiveness in other contexts.

A SIB will allow Jalisco to trial innovations to tackle this persistent social issue, with the risk of intervention failure largely covered by external investors. Given the pay-for-success structure, a well-designed SIB should incentivize innovation by using continuous data feedback loops to adjust the service and improve performance. Moreover, by putting in place a rigorous measurement framework, a SIB should provide actionable evidence and cost data on the model prior to its possible expansion and replication in other areas in Mexico and the region.REASON(S) EXISTING FINANCING WAS/IS INADEQUATE FINANCING OUTCOME FUNDS (USD)MXN 65,000,000.00 COSTS COVERED BY INVESTMENT CAPITALN/A UPFRONT CAPITAL COMMITMENT (USD)N/A ADDITIONAL GRANTS (USD)Impact Evaluation and Learning Evaluation CAPITAL RECYCLING N/A COSTS COVERED BY ADDITIONAL GRANTSN/A OTHER COSTS N/A To improve quality by allowing the service provider flexibility in implementation To improve quality by establishing performance management systems To improve efficiency (maintain quality while increasing output or decreasing costs)To build service provider's capacity to operate in a Payment by Results model To build the aforementioned systems to facilitate operation at scaleTo cover a capital gap between the intervention and value to society To benefit from the involvement of investors (apart from capital) To share the risk of service performance between the government, service provider, and investor, thus aligning incentivesOther: implement a evidence-based intervention; to allow government to transfer performance risk of relatively new and innovative intervention to investors.

The pilot achieved a success rate of 44% (defined as weight reduction of at least 5%), averaging 5.55% reduction among all participants. Attendance rate averaged 80% and physical activity increased by 89%. Moreover, the pilot learnings contributed to the completion of the curriculum to be used in the upcoming phase (targeting 100 women across 4 refugee camps). T2DM is a growing epidemic among Palestinians, especially women in refugee camps, and estimated to affect over 12.2% of the population (above world average of 8.5%) according to the World Health Organization. Prevalence of established risk factors is growing within the population - Palestine is recognized as one of the countries experiencing some of the largest increases in obesity globally. T2DM is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and other serious medical conditions and can reduce life expectancy by 8-10 years. The disease also has significant economic consequences. These include the reduction in number of working years for those affected by the disease and the increasing financial burden on the healthcare system.

The model will also test and refine value chain interventions with indigenous people in the Amazon through continuous data feedback loops, and should provide actionable evidence of the model to be scaled. DEVELOPMENT STAGE: Early-stage design Implementation Complete Poverty, deforestation and forest degradation: The Ash\u00e1ninkas are dependent on forest resources for their subsistence, and rely on agriculture - in particular cocoa and coffee - for monetary income to support their livelihoods and to cover heath and education costs. They are the weakest part of the value chains, as their communities are isolated, far from roads, and middle-men usually scam producers due to limited numeracy skills and low bargain power. Productivity is low and their plots have high presence of diseases.

Sex workers are simultaneously at heightened risk for HIV infection and exposed to stigma, discrimination and criminalization because of biological, behavioral and structural vulnerabilities that prevent them from accessing and staying in health services. Despite these vulnerabilities, evidence shows that antiretroviral treatment (ART) can be equally effective among sex workers as other populations when these are addressed with culturally-competent care. SANAC is leading the design of an HIV Prevention and Treatment SIB that would seek to improve uptake and adherence rates of ART and preventive measures among sex worker populations in Gauteng Province.

A successful pilot was implemented in 2014/15, in which 20,000 cattle were treated for Sleeping Sickness. The intervention model also includes a behavior change component to ensure that farmers spray their cattle effectively to prevent the spread of Sleeping Sickness and improve cattle health. Feasibility work for this project was completed in 2015, but further development and capital raise has been paused pending availability of outcome funding.DEVELOPMENT STAGE: Early-stage design Implementation CompleteLate-stage design (higher specificity e.g., investors, outcome funders, USD values) The DIB is designed to achieve both mass treatment of cattle with a trypanocidal drug, and ongoing delivery of an effective insecticide treatment. The major challenge in the past has been to consistently deploy treatment and sustain spraying, and the DIB thus introduces a results approach that relies on data-driven performance management to incentivize flexible and adaptive delivery. INTERVENTIONA key constraint to controlling sleeping sickness is poor and sporadic deployment of proven interventions. Epidemiological models predict that if initial mass treatment of cattle is combined with ongoing affordable access to insecticide spraying, the risk to humans from cattle parasites becomes insignificant.

The anticipated size of the potential contract is ~BRL 28 million ($9.1 million). Proceeds will be used to service around 2,000 patients, their carers and families over the course of 5 years, likely integrating two complementary care service delivery modalities: (i) home care service; (ii) community care service center.DEVELOPMENT STAGE: Early-stage design Implementation Complete Patients with chronic conditions are often hospitalized for long periods in the public health system, increasing the risk of infections, and putting pressure on the supply of costly hospital beds. Today, only 3% of patients in the state of Cear\u00e1 occupy over 25% of hospital bed days. With the rapid aging of population in the next 15 years, a surge in demand for hospital beds is expected. Additionally, long term hospitalization often creates adverse conditions for rehabilitation, autonomy and impairs life quality of patients and their families. The project aims to address inequalities in care access and promote more healthy lives and wellbeing for a growing aging population in Brazil. DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGEDirect Beneficiaries: over 2,000 patients, their carers and families over 5 years. Indirect Beneficiaries: 43,000 over 5 years (shorter term patients occupying beds previously occupied by long term patients treated by the program) TARGET NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIESTarget populations are socially vulnerable chronic patients hospitalized for long periods, their carers and families. The target population defined by the Government of Cear\u00e1 is around 2,000 beds (in five years representing over 20,000 patients), which are all users of public health system with chronic diseases and vulnerable social condition. Today only around 700 beds are serviced by Government (35% of target population). This means there is a deficit of over 1,300 beds and 13,000 patients over five years. The proposed contract will not solve the whole public problem but aims at creating a successful case.TARGET POPULATIONOVERVIEW Late-stage design (higher specificity e.g., investors, outcome funders, USD values)COUNTRY BRAZIL CITY/STATE STATE OF CEAR\u00c1 DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGEAgriculture Employment HealthEducation Social WelfareSECTOR:121 | EARLY LEARNINGS FROM THE FIELD This information is subject to changeCompletePublic hospital budgets are restricted for expanding or even maintaining community based services and implementing innovations to improve patients' health and wellbeing in out-of-hospital settings. Lack of rigorous evaluation and proper monitoring of patients, carers and families makes the goal of delivering effective community based alternatives for long term patients difficult to manage. The proposed pay by results contract will create an independent out-of-hospital service experiment, large enough to contain all necessary elements for a more systemic approach but still too small to allowing for testing and adapting different delivery strategies. Impact targets will incentivize operators to seek most appropriate solutions for each beneficiary treated by the program.REASON(S) EXISTING FINANCING WAS/IS INADEQUATEThe SIB aims to finance the prescription and delivery of services at home or at a community care center for patients, their carers and families, which may include the following (i) management of multi professional staff, logistics and materials; (ii) development of customized service delivery plan; (iii) family carer training, continued monitoring and interaction with multi professional staff; (iv) remote monitoring of health and wellbeing conditions of patients, carers and family members; (v) discovery of user needs, archetypes and tailored service design; (vi) commissioning of life support equipment and home improvement for service delivery; (vii) call center for user assistance; (viii) emergency assistance at home or transferring to hospital; (ix) occupation therapies, such as assistive technologies and community integration; (x) mobilizing community connectors and volunteers; (xi) psychological support; (xii) improving families income generation to allow for sustained service delivery.
