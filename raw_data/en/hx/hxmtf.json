The EB Pro balances the body's pH and and restores the electromagnetic energy by altering the electron and proton load in the water to create an electromagnetically charged environment or a \"Bio-energetic\" field. By placing your feet in the ionized water, life energy is transferred into your body through the zinc-copper array. Bioenergy is important because it improves the body's capacity to withstand chemical and physical, stress and facilitate healing from within. The EB Pro has been shown in clinical trials to improve the body's energy systems, facilitate detoxification and restore pH balance. What You Will Experience During the treatment, a light tingling or buzzing sensation can be felt in the feet. Healthy individuals can expect to feel lighter, more energized and experience a greater feeling of well-being after treatment. Patients with chronic conditions such as arthritis, painful swollen joints and neuropathy have reported relief even after only a couple treatments, while most patients experience improved energy and a signification reduction in symptoms after a series of treatments. Frequently Asked Questions How often can I be treated? Between the ages of 10 and 65, treatments are recommended every other day. Over 65 the recommendation is every third day. Why can't I be treated every day? Daily treatments may create a healing crisis as the body's detoxification systems come into balance. This may cause excessive fatigue and flu like symptoms. How does my body detoxify in the water? This detoxification occurs through the skin, which is the one of the largest detoxifying organs in the body. An energized and balanced body will naturally be able to detoxify at a higher rate, thereby protecting itself from toxins, pollutants and pathogens. Why does the water color change? The interaction of the elements in the water, the metals from the array and the toxins from the body together create a chemical reaction within the water bath. The water bath will change color regardless if a person is receiving treatment however, there will be a significant change in the water color when the treatment is performed with a patient's feet in the detox foot bath. What do different colors indicate? Some practitioners have correlated color changes in the water with areas of the body that are being detoxified. However, this is clinically and scientifically difficult to prove. Despite the various color changes to the water, clinical studies have shown a significant increase in toxic metals in the water after a treatment was conducted with the EB Pro foot bath.
