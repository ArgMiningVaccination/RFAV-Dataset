Global trends This overview provides a detailed look at energy developments based on complete supply and demand data for 2018 for more than 180 countries and regions, and where a vailable provisional official supply or production data for 2019 . Data are based on the IEA World energy balances , 2020. In 2018, global energy demand a s measured by total energy supply (T ES) increased significantly compared to 2017 (+2.4 %) to slightly less than 14 300 Mtoe. This is mainly driven by growth of demand in non- OECD countries (+3.2%), whereas energy demand rose at a slower pace in OECD countries (+1.0 %). In 2019, energy demand decreased in OECD countries ( -1%), as d iscussed in more detail in the OECD section. Some of the main m essages f rom t he overview a re: After two years of growth, total energy supply (TES) decreased in 2019 in the OECD due to falls in two thir d of its countries. Similarly, carbon dioxide emissions dropped too. Improvements in energy productivity, carbon intensity and more favourable weather conditions played a key role. Natural gas and renewable energy continued displacing coal and reached new heights in OECD electricity generation in 201 9. Further to power gener ation, gas steadily increased its share in buildings and in industry, both as a fuel and as a feedstock. Conversely, transport remained mostly fuelled by oil. Non-O ECD Asia, which accounte d for 28% of global production and 36% of global TES in 2018, is the region that relies the most on coal for electricity globally, with a share of 63% of coal in the region's electricity mix in 2018. Its main energy- consuming sector, industry, was also, in 2018, still heavily reliant on coal (41%); however the sector's consumption is gradually shifting to electricity. In 2018, total energy production in non-O ECD Europe and Eurasia increased by 3.9%, a growth above the world average of 3.2% and third after OECD (+4.8%) and non-O ECD Asia (+4.0%). The region's energy demand (TES) rose even more (4.5%). Nevertheless, the region self-s ufficiency ratio still remained very high at 171%. Energy production kept increasing in Africa, reaching 1 1 69 Mtoe in 2018. This production was dominated by crude oil (35%) and solid biofuels (32%). However, Africa remains highly dependent on its importation of refined oil products to meet its rising demand, especially in the transport sector . Non-O ECD Americas produced 757 Mtoe of energy in 2018, 33 Mtoe less than in 2017, and the lowest level since 2009. In Venezuela, crude oil production declined for the fifth year in a row. Oil provided the biggest share of TES in the region (39%), followed by natural gas (22%) and biofuels and waste (22%). In 2018, transport slightly surpassed industry as the biggest energy-c onsuming sector.World ener gy balances 2020: Overview PAGE | 3 IEA. All rights reserved. Production For 2019 , global count ry-level production data is preliminary and restricted to fossil fuels. Based on these data, the production of fossil fuels continued growing but at a slower rate (+1 .5% in 2019 after +3.2% in 2018 ). On the one hand, natural gas and coal production growth rates decreased (+3.1% and +2.2% respectively, compared to +5.0% and +3.3% a year before). On the other hand, oil production declined in 2019 as in 2017 (-0.2%). Ann ual average change in global fossil fuels production by fuel IEA.

Growth of global energy production in 2019 was driven by natur al gas and coal . The increase in coal production (peat and oil shale included) was particularly strong in two regions: non -OECD Asia China excluded, (+ 46 Mtoe, +7.1%), and China region (+ 75 Mtoe, +4.0%) . They more than compensated for the decline in OEC D (- 29 Mtoe, -3.5%), and in Africa ( - 4 Mtoe, Total*2017-2018 2018-2019World ener gy balances 2020: Overview PAGE | 4 IEA. All rights reserved. Natural gas production grew mainly in OECD (+ 68 Mtoe, +5.6%), in China region (+ 13 Mtoe, +9.8%) and in the Middle East and non -OECD Europe and Eurasia (+ 12 Mtoe each, + 2.3% and + 1.5% respectively ). This increase of production offset the decrease observed in non -OECD Americas and non -OECD Asia excluding China. As for oil production , it mainly decreased in 2019 in the Middle East ( -75 Mtoe , Asia, China excepted , (- 7 Mtoe, - 4.0%). The growth of production of crude oil in OECD (+ 72 Mtoe, + 5.9%), Africa (+11 Mtoe, + 2.6%) , non- OECD Europe and Eurasia (+ 6 Mtoe together) could not compensate. The remainder of this section looks at the detail of 2018 world production and use. World energy production was 14 421 Mtoe in 2018 - a 3.2% increase compared to 2017 . It was mostly driven by fossil fuels: natural gas (+5.0%), coal (+3.3%) and oil (+2.0%) , increasing together by m ore than 370 Mtoe in 2018. All renewables and nuclear also increas ed, by 60 Mtoe and 19 Mtoe respectively. Fossil fuels ultimately accounted for more than 81% of production in 2018 , as was the case in 2017.

Biofuels and waste increased their production in 201 8 by +1.5 %, a slightly higher rate than the year before, and aligned with the trend over the last f ive decades. Their share in the world energy production decreased by 0.16 percentage points , at 9.2% . Hydro significantly increased in 2018 (+3.5%), providing 2.5% of globa l energy production in 2018, and setting a record with 362\u00b0 Mtoe. Solar photovoltaic , wind and solar thermal production s kept increasing in 2018 but at a slower pace (+24.7%, +12.4% and +3.2% compared to +34.9%, +17.6% and +3.2% in 2017 respectively). As for geothermal, its production grew at the same rate in 2018 and 2017 (+7.2 %). Nonetheless , they still accounted for hardly 2% of global primary energy production together. Nuclear production increased by 2.8% in 2018, providing the same share of energy at global level in both years ( 5%). Growth of nuclear production wa s particularly strong in China (+19%), Chinese Taipei (+23%) and Argentina (+13%). On the contrary it decreased by 18% in South Africa, the only country with nuclear power in Africa. The contribution of each region to energy product ion was almost identical in 201 8 and 20 17. OECD has been the largest energy -producing a rea, ahead of non -OECD Asia in 2018 , since 2010. OECD economies produced 31% of global energy in 2018 , whereas non -OECD Asia accounted for 28%.

In the OECD as a whole production rose by +4 .8%, reaching 4 379 Mtoe in 2018, an increase of 200 Mtoe over 2017. With 4 089 Mtoe in 2018, non -OECD Asia increased its production of energy by 4.0%. Notwithstanding its slower growth (+1.3%), the Middle East remained the third biggest producing region, still ahead of non -OECD Europe and Eurasia which, with a 3.9% growth, is catching up (2 040 Mtoe and 1 987 Mtoe in 2018 respectively).

In 2018, the energy production grew strongly in most regions, except non-OECD Americas. In OECD , the three biggest producers all increased their energy production in 2018 and all reached new records of production . With a 9% growth in 2018 , the United States remained the biggest energy producer in OECD by far, reaching 2 173 Mtoe. It is the biggest energy production in history, 150 Mtoe above the previous records set in 2015 and 20 14, when production surpassed 2 000 Mtoe for the first time. In Canada, the second biggest producer in the OECD, production increased by 4 % at 529 Mtoe (+21 Mtoe compared t o 2017 previous record). In Australia, the third biggest OECD producer, production was above 400 Mtoe for the second year in a row, at 412 Mtoe (+1%) . Together, those countries increased their energy produc tion in 2018 by 207 Mtoe. Energy production grew in 21 of the 36 member countries of the OECD. In non- OECD Asia, energy production significantly increased (+ 4.0%), at 4 089 Mtoe in 2018, boosted by increases in the People's Republic of China (+ 4.3%) and Indonesia -6%-4%-2%0%2%4%6% OECD Africa Non-OECD AmericasNon-OECD Europe and EurasiaMiddle East 2017 - 2018World ener gy balances 2020: Overview PAGE | 7 IEA. All rights reserved. (+5.8 %). In the People's Republic of Chin a, energy production in 2018 reached 2 562 Mtoe, the biggest production in its histo ry, beating the last record set in 2015 by 50 Mtoe. This is explained by coal (+74 Mtoe, + 4.1 %), solar PV, wind and tide/wave/ocean, natural gas and nuclear (+10 to 12 Mto e each ). In Indonesia, the increase of energy production wa s mainly due to coal (+25 Mtoe, + 10%) followed by geothermal (+2 Mtoe, +10 %). In 2018 , the Middle East still ranked third, with 2 040 Mtoe of energy produced. Nonetheless, it is the region where en ergy production grew less in 2018: +1.3%, compared to +4.8% in OECD, +4.0% in non OECD Asia including China, +3.9% in non OECD Europe and Eurasia, and +2.4% in Africa . With 1 987 Mtoe, non -OECD Europe and Eurasia produced 75 Mtoe more energy in 2018 than in 2017 and ranked fourth among the energy -producing regions. With 1 169 Mtoe of energy produced in 2018 , Africa kept its fifth rank among regions in terms of primary energy production. In non- OECD Americas countries energy production dec reased ( -4.2%) for the fourth year in a row. The region produced 757 Mtoe of energy in 2018 , its lowest level since 2010 due to simultaneous decreases in two of its biggest energy producers, Venezuela ( -22.6 %) and Colombia ( -2.9%). Growth in Brazil (+0.8%) and Argentina (+2.4%) did not offset these reductions. The IEA family (IEA member economies, Association and Accession countries) represented 54% of the global energy production in 1971, and 59% in 2018 . Less than five countries, sometimes only two, produce more than hal f of each fuel. China produced 48% of the world coal in 2018, and 28% of hydro. The United States and France combined produced 46% of all nuclear. Saudi Arabia, the Russian Federation (Russia hereafter ), and the United States contributed 40% of the world crude oil - these last two also accounting for 40% of the world natural gas.

This concentration is usually stable, as well as ranks of the top countries ; the most notable change s in recent years is that Brazil took over Canada as the second biggest hydro producer in 2018, and Canada replaced Qatar as the fourth biggest natural gas producer in 2017 . Total Energy Supply (T ES) Between 1971 and 2018 , world total energy supply (TES) increased 2.6 times (from 5 519 Mtoe to 14 282 Mtoe) and its structure changed. O il fell from 44% to 32% of T ES between 1971 and 2010 ; it is stable since then , and still the dominant fuel in 2018 .

However, it has fluctuated significantly during that period, increasing constantly between 1999 and 2011, influenced mainly by increased consumption in China. In 2011 it reached its highest level (29% ), peaking at 71% of T ES in China. It has declined since then and represented 27% of world T ES in 2018 . Meanwhile nuclear grew from 1 % to 5%.

While the world total energy supply grew 2.6 times in the last 47 years, fossil fuels, in particular oil, remained dominant in the energy mix. Energy demand has evolved differently across t he regions betw een 1971 and 2018 . The OECD's share of global T ES fell from 61% in 1971 to 38% in 2018 . With 5 369 Mtoe, it is now almost on par with non -OECD Asia, where energy demand grew more than seven -fold, reaching 5 136 Mtoe in 2018 , and whose share of T ES almost t ripled over the period, from 13% in 1971 to 36% in 2018 . Though its share of global energy demand halved between 1971 and 2017 (from 16% to 8%), non -OECD Europe and Eura sia remained the th ird biggest energy -consuming region, with about 1 160 Mtoe T ES. It was fol lowed by Africa, wh ere energy demand over the period has multiplied by more than four, reaching 837 Mtoe in 2018 , Middle East (760 Mtoe) and balances 2020: Overview PAGE | 10 IEA.

OECD and non -OECD Asia are now on par in terms of total energy supply. Between 2017 and 2018, global T ES increased by 331 Mtoe (+2.4 %), reaching 14 282 Mtoe. The total primary energy supply increased mostly in non -OECD Europe and Eurasia (+4.5%) followed by non -OECD Asia (+4.1%) and Africa (+ 2.8%). It also increased in OECD countries and in the Middle East but to a lesser extent (+1.0% and +0.7% respectively). Non -OECD Americas is the only region of the globe where it decreased, for the fourth year in a row now ( -2.7%). With 10 292 Mtoe, the IEA family group acc ounted for 72.1% of T ES in 2018.

In 2018, energy demand increased more than 2%, boosted by growth in non -OECD Asia, non -OECD Europe and Eurasia and Africa. Non-OECD countries account for a continuously growing share of the world energy consumption (62% in 201 8). In 2018 , the People's Republic of China accounted for more than 22% of global T ES while the United States accounted for slightly less than 16% (Table 1). India and Russia ranked third and fourth respect ively. Japan, the second largest OECD consuming country, was in fifth position. Together, these five countries accounted for more than half of the global T ES in 2018 . The 2018 top ten coun tries represented 63% of global energy demand . Six of them (China, the United States, India, Japan, Germany and Canada) have been amongst the ten major energy consumers for the whole period. Three Europe countries (the U nited Kingdom , France and Italy) that appeared in the top ten in 1971, have now been replaced by Asia and Middle East countries (Brazil, Korea and Iran). -4%-3%-2%-1%0%1%2%3%4%5%6%7% OECD Africa Non-OECD AmericasNon- OECD Europe and EurasiaMiddle 2017 - 2018World ener gy balances 2020: Overview PAGE | 12 IEA.

China, the US, India, Japan, Germany and Canada have been amongst the ten major energy con sumers between 1971 and 2018. In 2018 , the top fiv e countries in terms of T ES ac counted for less than half of the world GDP and world population (49% and 45% respectively) but consumed 53% of total w orld energy. Ho wever, the relative shares of T ES, population and GDP of these five countries significantly varied from one to another. The United States consumed about 16% of world energy, with 4 % of the world's population . Con versely, China and India cons umed more than 22% and 6% of global energy respectively, but each accounted for more than 18% of the global population. Russia and Japan also consumed signi ficant amounts of energy in 2018 (5% and 3% of global T ES re spectively). However, their energy inten sities differed sig nificantly. To produce the same amount of wealth, as measured by GDP based on purchasing power parity , Russia consumed in 2018 almost 207 Mtoe per billion US dollars , 2.6 times as much energy as Japan (the country with the lowest energy intensity of the five top energy consumers , at 81 Mtoe per billion US dollars ), and more than t wice as much as India (92 Mtoe per billion US dollars). Such com parisons reflect the importance of specific industries in each country, and not just relative eff iciency in the use of energy.

Due to the combined fall in coal and increase in gas an d renewable energy, the carbon intensity of the energy mix continued to decrease in 2019 , resulting in a 3% drop in energy -related carbon dioxide emissions. -100 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60CoalOilGasNuclearRenewables MtoeWorld ener gy balances 2020: Overview PAGE | 21 IEA.

The decrease in generation was consistent across all OECD regions, with nine out of the top ten countries reducing the total electricity output. The increases in generation from gas and renewable energy together were equivalent to one- half of the drop for coal, i.e. -400 TWh .

In the other two OECD regions, the year -on-year change was marked by the decrease in oil consumption in 2018 after the 2017 increase. At a sectoral level, none of the final consumption sectors decreased in 201 8 except the non -energy use of fuels. Energy use in buildings (residential and services) contributed mostly to the overall TFC change (+67 Mtoe), with transport and industry following .

The production and consumption of biofuels (mainl y fuelwood) is significantly higher across Africa (45% of TES in 2018) than the world average (9% of TES). The presence of large forests, agro- industry, agriculture, a large rural population, and a low GDP per capita have resulted in a large use of solid b iofuels, in particular for cooking.

Coal** 19% Oil 18% Nat. 2020: Overview PAGE | 34 IEA. All rights reserved. However, the share of biofuels and waste in TES has decreased significantly between 1971 and 2018. This is partly explained by electrification\u00b2, and particularly the recent development of power generation from natural gas. Natural gas share in TES increased steeply from 1% in 1971 to 16% in 2018. Over the period, oil demand increased because of the increase of transportation consumption and is now the second fuel consumed in Africa. Coal has declined since 1971; it comes 4 th in African TES (14% in 2018, compared to 27% globally). Coal's role is much higher in South Africa, where it represented 89% of the country's primary production, 73% of TES, 90% of electricity generation and 24% of total final consumption in 2018. In 2018, power generation in Africa was more than nine times the level in 1971. The fuel mix of electricity generation changed a lot. Natural gas was barely nil in 1971 but provided more than 334 TWh of electricity in 2018, a 40% share of electricity generated in Africa (compared to 28% in OECD, 40% in non -OECD Europe and Eurasia, and 72% in the Middle East). Its share in the power mix reached even higher level in gas -producing countries such as Algeria (98%), Nigeria (82%), and neighbouring importing countries like Tunis ia (95%). In 1971, coal was the first fuel used for power generation in Africa (61%); in 2018 it ranked second after natural gas and accounted for 31% of power generation, providing 260 TWh. Hydro was the second provider of electricity in Africa in 1971 (2 3 TWh, 26% of the power produced in the continent) and ranked third in 2018 with 131 TWh. Electricity production reflects the disparity in fossil fuel resources between sub - regions of Africa. In 2018, North African countries plus South Africa, represented only 20% of the population but generated 73% of the electricity in Africa.

In 2018, transport slightly surpassed industry as the biggest energy -consuming sector. With a share of 36% each, both sectors consume more than twice the energy used in residential (17%). Industry final consumption, including non- energy use, increased from 51 Mtoe in 1971 to 162 Mtoe in 2018. However, it is in the transport sector that the energy final consumption increased the m ost: it multiplied by more than four times since 1971.

In 1971, oil accounted for half of total final consumption (TFC) in non- OECD Americas, and it peaked at 55% in 1979 be fore the second oil crisis. However, the increasing role of electricity and gas in the residential and the industry sectors lead to a slowly diminishing share of oil in TFC, which reached 45% in 2018. The share of electricity has almost tripled during that period, reaching 18% in 2018.

Source: IEA World Energy Balances , 2020. In 2018, coal is the top fuel used in most of the biggest energy -consuming countries in non - OECD Asia . Coal's role in non -OECD Asia's energy system is partly explained by power generation: in 201 8, it represented 63 % of the regional electricity mix, versus 38% globally. Coal provided 73 % of electricity in India, 67% in China and 56 % in Indonesia. The country mostly relying on coal for power in the region is Mongolia ( 88% in 2018 ). In China, the power mix is gradually shifting from coal to other fuels though (natural gas, nuclear, renewables). 0100020003000400050006000 Non-OECD AsiaChina IndiaMtoe 050100150200250 Indonesia gas Oil Coal*MtoeWorld ener gy balances 2020: Overview PAGE | 44 IEA.

With 586 Mtoe, the kingdom reached its second highest production since the 1970s, after the record set in 2016 (596 Mtoe). O il production also notably grew in Iraq (+2.2 %), which reached a record in its production at 232 Mtoe , in UAE (+1 .6%) and in Kuwait (+1.2%) . As for Yemen, its oil production increased for the second year in a row, by 16.5% in 2018, passing over 1.5 Mtoe after an almost continuous decrease for 15 years, from 22 Mtoe of crude oil produced in 2002 to less than 8 Mtoe in 2014, and less than 2 Mtoe per year since then. O n the contrary o il production declined in Iran (-6.0%), and Qatar ( -3.8%), but also in Bahrain ( -1.0%) and Syria ( -5.5%) . Natural gas production almost continuously increased in the Middle Eas t since the 1970s, reaching 539 Mtoe in 2018 - 35 times more than in 1971, and five times more than in 1994. With 35% of the region's natural gas production (191 Mtoe), Iran maintained its position as the Middle East's top producer in 2018, followed by Qatar at 27%, wi th 147 Mtoe. Iran's natural gas production increased by 4.4% in 2018, a slower growth compared to 7.9% increase in 2017 and 8.6% in 2016. Meanwhile natural gas p roduction in Qatar was stable for the second year in a row ( -0.5% in 2018 after -0.4% in 201 7).

In less than five decades, the share of natural gas in the total energy supply of the Middle East doubl ed, displacing the share of oil . Key factors driving the rapid development of natural gas in the Middle East are the petrochemical sector and power generation . Indeed the share of oil in electricity product ion continues to shrink, from 54% in 1971 to 25% in 2018. In contrast, the share of natural gas in electricity production continually increased, from 27% to 72% in the same period (compared with 23% in 2018 at global level). I n 2018, natural gas continued to provide all the electricity generated in Bahrain and Qatar, and more than 97 % in the United Arab Emirates and Oman. In Iran and Jordan, natural gas's share in electricity generation reached 83% in 2018. In Jordan, this change has come swiftly, with natu ral gas generating less than 20% of the electricity up to 2002 and growing to 50% the next year , and 85% in 2016 after the LNG terminal in Aqaba started operating. Except in Lebanon, where electricity is still mainly generated from oil and a small share of hydro, and Yemen where it is dominated by oil (79%), natural gas represents at least half of power generation in each country of the region.
