[More Services](/medical-conditions-treated/) Meet Our Team Wilma Clinic Administrator What Our Patients Are Saying Brenda S. Dr Godby was amazing when I had Adrenal fatigue and thyroid issues. Diagnosis was spot on and he knew exactly what to do in the most natural yet effective way possible. To this day 12 yrs later I still rely on his herbal recommendations and insights to support these 2 areas when needed. Dr Godby is thorough, caring and you will leave feeling educated and empowered with a plan of action and ongoing support. Sarah C. Dr. Godby was great! He has such a caring bedside manner, and spent a great deal of time with me talking me through my diagnosis and the next steps that I needed to take to get my numbers back in line and my body feeling normal again. Everyone at the clinic are very compassionate and so helpful! Thanks everyone at Sacramento Naturopathic Medical Center for your kindness! Gretchen D. What an extraordinary place! The staff at all levels are personal, professional and knowledgeable. I was treated quickly at each visit and they monitored my progress and comfort at each part. I had oxygen therapy and IVs each week. I never was apprehensive about anything because they were close by each step of the way. Thank you to all those professionals who assisted me in every way! Guy R. Dr. Godby is great doctor and naturopathic is the way to go if your health permits it. Also, you don't have to be in the Sacromento area to be treated by Dr. Godby. He can treat you if you are in the USA regardless of geographic location. The only downsides are: you won't be able to use your insurance for the labwork and Naturopathic doctors (ND) can only prescribe hormone based medications. Theresa E.
