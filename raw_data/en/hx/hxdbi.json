Fall Equinox marks a time of equal night and day. According to Chinese Medicine & Taoist philosophy, this is an excellent time to practice meditation, as there is more \"neutral force\" in the atmosphere. When we are \"polarized,\" we have less balance and clarity. The equinox provides the neutral \"cosmic weather\" that will aid our ability to find clarity & tranquility. We will also utilize this time to strengthen the immune system with special breathing exercises in preparation for the colder months of Fall & Winter ahead. The class will begin with gentle guided qigong exercises and an invigorating Kundalini Yoga breathwork journey for calming the nervous system, releasing anxiety, and coming into a state of relaxation. The class will finish with meditative pranayama (yogic breathing techniques) and MANIFESTATION INTENTION SETTING, followed by deep relaxation, rest, & aromatherapy. Use this time to bring your attention inward, allowing the dead leaves of your psyche to fall away, reflecting on what will truly sustain and nourish you in the colder, darker months of the year . **space is limited** please sign up in advance. Join Dr. Sinead Corrigan for a profoundly restorative breathwork experience. More about the offerings: Qigong Qigong is translated as \"cultivation of vitality.\" Soft and gentle movements help to reset and reprogram the nervous system, while visualizations help to expand and brighten the mind. Kundalini Yoga Kundalini is the primordial energy of creation. This style of yoga aims to reunite us with our own creative power via movement, breathing exercises, mantra (chanting), visualization, & meditation. You will experience a different state of consciousness & access new dimensions of self. Pranayama Prana means life force. Pranayama is breathing techniques. Breathwork is a powerful tool for transforming physical and emotional pain. We will utilize safe breathing techniques from both yogic and Taoist traditions. You will come away feeling grounded, centered, clear, and relaxed--ready for an amazing night's sleep & a crisp, peaceful Fall Season. What to bring: Yoga mat (blanket and pillow if you'd like for relaxation at the end) Recommended: water bottle, journal, and pen for self-reflection afterward. Wear comfortable, loose clothing for floor sitting/lying. Bug spray if you are sensitive (I have a non-toxic mosquito repellent insence that tends to keep them away though!) Benefits of qigong & breathwork: *Activates the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest response) * Reduces stress and anxiety * Promotes quality sleep * Balances the respiratory, digestive, endocrine, glandular, and nervous systems * Entrains brainwaves to Theta state for relaxation and opening creativity and intuition * Increases vital energy flow throughout cells, skin, organs, bones * Transforms self-limiting thoughts and behaviors * Promotes self-affirming thoughts and positive emotions * Restores \"inner harmony\" to mind/body system About the facilitator Sin\u00e9ad is a Doctor of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine, a Universal Healing Tao Qigong instructor, a Yoga instructor, and a dancer.
