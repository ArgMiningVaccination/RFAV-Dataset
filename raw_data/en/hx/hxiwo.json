APPROPRIATIONS The following table compares on a summary basis the appropria- tions, including trust funds for fiscal year 2022, the budget request for fiscal year 2022, and the Committee recommendation for fiscal year 2022 in the accompanying bill. 2022 LABOR, HHS, EDUCATION BILL [Discretionary funding in thousands of dollars] Budget Activity Fiscal Year\u2014 2022 Committee compared 2022 Budget $14,320,422 $16,867,354 +1,438,739 +22,049 GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE BILL For fiscal year 2022, the Committee recommends a total of $237,466,000,000 in current year discretionary funding\u2014the 302(b) allocation\u2014and $253,805,000,000 in overall programmatic funding, including offsets and adjustments. The fiscal year 2022 rec-ommendation is an increase of $55,236,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. The Labor-HHS-Education bill supports some of the nation's most critical programs that touch individuals and families through-out their lifespan, from Early Head Start to Social Security. Many of the bill's programs have been severely strained over the past 18 months during the simultaneous public health and economic emer-gencies related to COVID-19. Fortunately, the President's fiscal year 2022 budget proposes to invest significant resources in these critical programs that provide opportunities for millions of families. Through this bill, the Committee is moving ambitiously to help the country recover from the worst pandemic in a century and move forward to strengthen opportunities for every individual to have a better chance at a better life\u2014with a good education, a good job, and access to affordable health care. The Committee recommends historic investments in education programs, including meeting the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to more than double federal funding for Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies in fiscal year 2022 to a new level of $36,037,000,000. These investments will strengthen Federal sup- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 for high-poverty schools and support the delivery of a high- quality education for all students. The Committee also recommends a historic investment in re- building our public health system. As the country recovers from the worst pandemic in a century, the Committee includes more than $10,500,000,000 for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an increase of nearly $2,700,000,000, which is the largest increase in budget authority ever provided to the CDC. This in-cludes a new flexible funding stream of $1,000,000,000 for public health infrastructure and capacity, as well as an increase of $250,000,000 for CDC's global health activities. The Committee continues to build on investments made over the past six years in biomedical research by increasing funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by $6,500,000,000, including an increase of $3,500,000,000 for basic biomedical research at exist-ing NIH institutes and centers. As part of the Committee's invest-ment in health research, the Committee also includes $3,000,000,000 to support the President's request to establish the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, or ARPA-H, to ac-celerate the pace of scientific breakthroughs that have the potential to transform health care and address our most complex health challenges. And the Committee invests in workforce training and worker protection agencies, including significant new investments to re-build capacity to enforce federal labor laws to protect workers' pay-checks, benefits, and ensure the health and safety of our work-places. The Committee also makes a major commitment to retired workers by including an increase of $1,000,000,000 for the Social Security Administration's operating expenses, which will restore federal capacity to provide earned benefits and services through So-cial Security, one of the cornerstones of the federal safety net. Some of the most notable initiatives in fiscal year 2022 include: Investing in Public Education The Committee is committed to increasing investments in core Federal programs that support high-quality public education oppor-tunities for all students. Our nation's public schools serve more than 50 million children, more than 50 percent of whom come from low-income families. Research shows that low-income students are more likely to struggle academically and often attend high-need schools with fewer resources, less experienced teachers, and more limited access to advanced coursework. At the same time, there is overwhelming empirical evidence on education spending and stu-dent outcomes that finds more funding in schools yields statis-tically significant positive results for students. Overall, the Committee recommendation provides $65,551,722,000 for Federal K-12 education programs, including Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), an increase of $24,998,971,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the Biden-Harris Administration's fiscal year 2022 budget request. The recommendation is a 62 percent increase over last year. In particular, the Committee recommends an additional $19,500,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level for Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies for a total of VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Title I serves an estimated 25 million students in nearly 90 percent of school districts and nearly 60 percent of all public schools. The Committee recommends $1,000,000,000 for the English Lan- guage Acquisition program, which provides formula grants to States to serve English Leaners (EL), an increase of $202,600,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $82,600,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Federal data shows that signifi-cant achievement gaps exist between ELs and their peers. At the same time, many States and school districts have experienced rapid growth in their EL populations. Providing increased resources to improve educational quality for EL students is a top priority for the Committee. The Committee recommends $15,537,429,000 for IDEA Part B Grants to States, which is $2,599,972,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. The Committee is concerned that the Federal share of the excess cost of educating students with disabilities has declined and notes the critical role this increase will play in helping to reverse this trend and serve as a significant first step toward fully funding IDEA. Public Health Infrastructure The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the inadequacies of the cur- rent public health ecosystem. After the COVID-19 pandemic is over, public health agencies cannot go back to what they were and can no longer only get attention during a crisis. The Committee recognizes that State, local, territorial, and Federal public health partners need a long-term strategy and long-term investments, be-ginning at CDC. The bill includes more than $10,500,000,000 for the CDC, an increase of nearly $2,700,000,000. The Committee provides a new, annual funding line to turn the tide on the nation's public health infrastructure by providing a sta-ble source of disease-agnostic funding so that nation's State, local, territorial, and Federal public health agencies are better equipped to coordinate together to save lives. This bill includes $1,000,000,000 for Public Health Infrastructure and Capacity to begin to address mission-critical gaps nationwide. In addition, this bill includes increases of: $50,000,000 for Public Health Workforce and Career Development to invest in essential public health workers who protect our communities and are em-powered by science; $100,000,000 for Public Health Data Mod-ernization to advance the transformation of the collection and utili-zation of public health data from retrospective reporting to driving action in real time; $15,000,000 for the National Center for Health Statistics to initiate investments in the next generation of surveys; and $250,000,000 for Global Health to modernize and expand dis-ease surveillance and response capabilities to strengthen global health security. NIH Research The unprecedented speed with which scientists were able to de- velop effective COVID-19 vaccines would not have been possible without years of sustained investments made by Congress in bio- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 medical research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Committee continues and accelerates this investment by providing $46,434,000,000, an increase of $6,500,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. The bill includes an increase of $3,500,000,000 for traditional NIH research and activities, the larg-est annual appropriations increase for NIH since fiscal year 2003. The Committee continues its ongoing support for key NIH initia- tives, such as the Cancer Moonshot, BRAIN Initiative, and the All of Us Precision Medicine Initiative. The bill also includes sufficient funding to provide an across-the-board increase of no less than five percent for each Institute and Center. The Committee remains con-cerned that targeted funding for specific research initiatives in re-cent years has slowed the growth in other areas of basic research that may lead to unforeseeable scientific breakthroughs. The Committee also includes $3,000,000,000 to establish the Ad- vanced Projects Research Agency for Health (ARPA-H), as pro-posed in the President's budget request. Modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), ARPA-H will invest in large high-risk, high-reward research projects that have the po-tential to achieve breakthroughs in the treatment of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Employment and Training The economic recession resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic impacted American families and further exposed existing inequities in our society. For example, while the unemployment rate peaked at 14.8 percent in April 2020 and is now at 5.9 percent, the unem-ployment rate for Black workers peaked in May 2020 at 16.7 per-cent and is now at 9.2 percent and the unemployment rate for His-panic workers peaked at 18.9 percent in April 2020 and is now at 7.4 percent. The unemployment rate for White workers peaked at 14.1 percent in April 2020 and is now at 5.2 percent. In addition, COVID-19 had devastating impacts on women's participation in the labor force, especially for women of color. As our nation emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment assistance and workforce development opportunities will continue to play a critical role in our recovery. As such, the Committee recommendation includes needed invest- ments in workforce and training systems. Specifically, the rec-ommendation includes $6,237,181,000 for Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Programs, an increase of $825,326,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $271,750,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The recommendation includes $285,000,000 for registered apprenticeships, an increase of $100,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The recommendation also includes $100,000,000 for the Strengthening Community Colleges Training Grant program, an increase of $55,000,000 above the fis-cal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program helps community colleges build capacity for training workers. The recommendation includes $100,000,000 for a new grant program to support communities suffering dislocations re-lated to changes in fossil fuel and other energy industries. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul also includes $2,866,214,000 for Unemploy- ment Compensation State Operations, an increase of $509,398,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This funding will help support States in overcoming challenges associated with administering unemploy-ment insurance programs. Altogether, these investments will con-tinue to support families struggling with the economic con-sequences of COVID-19 and prepare workers for new employment opportunities. Protecting America's Workers The Committee recommends $2,095,685,000 for Department of Labor agencies responsible for worker protection and worker rights. This is an increase of $305,015,000 over the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and $1,161,000 over the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Wage and Hour Division employs fewer investigators today than it did in 1948, despite the workforce having grown signifi-cantly in that time. To help make up for this lost ground, hold bad- acting employers accountable and defend working people so they receive the pay they earned and are legally entitled to, the Com-mittee recommendation includes $300,000,000, an increase of $54,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and an increase of $23,500,000 over the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) cur- rently has the lowest number of health and safety inspectors in the agency's 48-year history. OSHA enforcement is critical to pre-venting workplace tragedies from occurring, which is why it is con-cerning that, under current staffing levels, the agency would need 165 years to inspect each workplace under its jurisdiction just once. To reverse the erosion of enforcement capacity at OSHA, the Com-mittee includes $691,787,000, an increase of $100,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $27,163,000 over the fiscal year 2022 budget request for this critical worker protection agency. The Committee also recommends $316,925,000 for the National Labor Relations Board, an increase of $42,701,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $15,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This increase will address decline in field staff the Board has seen over the past four years. Early Childhood Education The Committee includes over $20,000,000,000 for early childhood education programs through the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), Head Start, and Preschool Development Grants\u2014an increase of $3,075,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level. Child care is one of the most critical needs of families with young children\u2014it is essential\u2014and yet CCDBG currently reaches only 15 percent of children who are eligible to receive child care serv-ices. The increase included in this bill will provide CCDBG-funded child care for approximately 200,000 additional children, which will also enable more parents in low-income families to remain in the workforce. Women, particularly women of color, are disproportion-ately impacted by the child care crisis in this country, and the in-vestment in this bill builds on the $52,500,000,000 in supplemental VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 provided for child care during the coronavirus pandemic: $3,500,000,000 in the Coronavirus Aid, Re-lief, and (CARES) Act (P.L. 116-136), $10,000,000,000 through the Coronavirus Act, 2021 (P.L. and $39,000,000,000 through the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2). The bill includes an increase of $1,434,000,000 for Head Start, including increases of $250,000,000 for Quality Improvement Fund-ing for Trauma-Informed Care and $750,000,000 to expand Head Start, Early Head Start, and Early Head Start-Child Care Partner-ships to over 40,000 additional infants and toddlers from low-in-come families. The bill also includes $200,000,000 for Head Start programs to extend to full day services, to better support working parents and bring additional programs into compliance with the 2016 Head Start Program Performance Standards. The Committee further recommends $450,000,000, an increase of $175,000,000, for Preschool Development Grants to build State and local capacity to provide early childhood care and education for children birth through five from low- and moderate-income fami-lies. Higher Education In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, college afford- ability and access are vital to our nation's recovery efforts. There-fore, the Committee recommendation makes necessary investments in programs supporting student financial aid, student support serv-ices, and other programs supporting institutions of higher edu-cation and their students. The recommendation includes sufficient funding to support an in- crease in the maximum Pell Grant by $400 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level, from $6,495 to $6,895, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 discretionary budget request. In addition, the Committee recommendation provides $1,434,000,000 for Federal Work Study, an increase of $244,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee recommendation also in-cludes $1,028,000,000 for the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, an increase of $148,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee recommendation includes $1,297,761,000 for the TRIO programs, an increase of $200,761,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. The recommendation also includes $408,000,000 for the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Pro-grams, which is $40,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. In an effort to assist postsecondary institutions in addressing barriers in completion and attainment, the Committee rec-ommendation includes a total of $1,134,054,000 for programs that serve high proportions of students of color (Historically Black Col-leges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Tribal Col-leges and Universities, and other Minority Serving Institutions), an increase of $345,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 The Committee also includes robust funding to support teacher preparation. The recommendation includes $20,000,000 in new funding for the Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence pro-gram, and the recommendation includes $132,092,000 for the Teacher Quality Partnerships program, an increase of $80,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Maternal Health The U.S. has the highest maternal mortality rate among devel- oped nations, with a particularly high mortality rate for Black and American Indian/Alaska Native women. To help eliminate race- based disparities in outcomes among birthing people and drive down the rate of maternal mortality, the bill provides an increase of $56,000,000 for CDC's Safe Motherhood and Infant Health pro-grams. This funding allows for the expansion of Maternal Mortality Review Committees and Perinatal Quality Collaboratives to all 50 States and territories, and for increased support to current States and territories, as well as increased support for other programs in-cluding Sudden Unexplained Infant Death. The bill includes an in-crease of over $178,000,000 at HRSA to support activities to im-prove maternal health, including an increase of $30,000,000 for State Maternal Health Innovation Grants, an increase of $5,300,000 to expand the Alliance for Maternal Health Safety Bun-dles to more States, an increase of $2,000,000 to support and ex-pand availability of the Maternal Mental Health Hotline, $25,000,000 to conduct a demonstration program on pregnancy medical homes, an increase of $5,000,000 to double funding for Screening and Treatment for Maternal Depression and Related Disorders, an increase of $5,400,000 for Rural Maternity and Ob-stetrics Management Strategies. The bill also includes increased in-vestments in research related to maternal health and health dis-parities at NIH and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qual-ity (AHRQ). HIV Initiative Advances in medications for the prevention and treatment of HIV, improved diagnostic tests, and new outbreak detection tech-nology provide a unique opportunity to alter the trajectory of HIV infection rates in the U.S. with a goal of eliminating new HIV in-fections. This bill provides a total of $688,000,000, which is an in-crease of $245,000,000 for the third year of the Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative, which began a new era of moving the U.S. from HIV prevention to HIV epidemic control. Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research Firearm injury and mortality is among the leading causes of death for people aged 1-64 in the U.S. In 2019, there were nearly 40,000 firearm-related deaths in the U.S. Addressing the gaps in knowledge around this issue and identifying effective prevention strategies are needed steps toward keeping people, families, schools, and communities safe from firearm injury. In fiscal year 2020, the Committee provided the first funding in more than two decades to address the public health emergency of firearm violence VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul a total of $25,000,000 to CDC and NIH. This bill doubles the total funding to $50,000,000 to support research to identify the most effective ways to prevent firearm related injuries and deaths, and to broaden firearm injury data collection. Building on these ef-forts to address firearm injury and death, this bill also includes $100,000,000 for a new evidence-based community violence inter-vention initiative at CDC, which aims to prevent intentional vio-lence, such as mass casualty violence or gang violence. Mental and Behavioral Health The existing mental health and substance use disorder crises were worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, with Americans re-porting increased levels of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and substance use. Between September 2019 and August 2020, more than 85,000 people nationwide died from drug overdoses, and 47,000 people died from suicide in 2019. The Committee recommendation includes $9,160,277,000 for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), making a range of investments across the behavioral health continuum to support prevention, screening, treatment, and other services. The Committee includes a total increase of $1,366,020,000 for mental health activities. This includes an in-crease of $825,000,000 for the Mental Health Block Grant and an increase of $125,000,000 for Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. The bill increases the mental health crisis set-aside to ten percent, creates a new set-aside for prevention and early intervention, and makes investments to prepare for the launch of a new three digit National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The Committee includes $100,000,000 to establish the Mental Health Crisis Response Partnership Pilot Program, to help commu-nities create mobile crisis response teams that divert the response for mental health crises from law enforcement to behavioral health teams. The bill supports children's mental health with a $28,113,000 in- crease to the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative, a $17,000,000 increase for Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health, and an additional $25,000,000 for Children's Mental Health services. The Committee includes a total increase of $1,657,187,000 for substance use treatment activities. This includes an increase of $1,000,000,000 for the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant and an increase of $500,000,000 for State Opioid Re- sponse Grants. The bill creates a new set-aside within the block grant to support recovery services. The Committee recommendation also includes an increase of $35,284,000 for substance misuse pre-vention activities. OVERSIGHT OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH The Committee has also fulfilled its responsibility to maintain oversight of the Executive Branch by holding seven oversight hear-ings\u2014in addition to annual hearings on the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee has focused on ongoing crises in health care, education, and labor, which have highlighted unjust racial disparities which were further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pan- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 hearings have informed many of the deci- sions in the fiscal year 2022 Labor-HHS Education bill. COVID-19 and the Child Care Crisis The Committee held a virtual hearing to discuss the devastating impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic had on a child care industry already in crisis. Affordable child care was already a significant and severe issue, but rising operating costs and decreased enroll-ment as a result of the pandemic were too much for the razor thin margins of many child care providers, and other providers were left grasping for financial assistance. The Committee heard from policy experts, a State administrator, and a program director, about the critical financial needs of child care providers struggling to stay afloat, the necessity of child care for parents and especially for women in the workforce, and the impact that the child care short-age has on job reports and unemployment statistics. The hearing highlighted how COVID-19 exacerbated the child care crisis, and exposed the necessity for a financially stable child care industry, to support women and communities of color, and for post-pandemic economic recovery. Soon after the Committee's hearing, House and Senate Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) which included $39,000,000,000 for the Child Care and Develop-ment Block Grant program. Ready or Not: U.S. Public Health Infrastructure The Committee held a virtual hearing to examine the status and challenges of our nation's public health infrastructure, with a par-ticular focus on public health data, laboratories, and workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the inadequacies of the current pub-lic health ecosystem, and the Committee heard from State and local public health officials about the importance of flexible, long- term investments in public health. As a result of this hearing, this bill includes a new funding line of $1,000,000,000 for Public Health Infrastructure and Capacity. The Committee's action denotes that the tide has turned for public health funding, as it establishes a disease-agnostic source of funding to address mission-critical gaps in public health infrastructure nationwide. Health and Safety Protections for Meatpacking, Poultry, and Agri- cultural Workers The Committee held a virtual hearing to examine dangerous con- ditions faced by meat, poultry, and farm workers, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to highlight the role strong federal enforcement from the Occupational Health and Safety Administra-tion (OSHA) can play in addressing the problem. The Committee heard from a worker safety and health expert, a farmworker advo-cate, and the child of a Smithfield meatpacking worker about the concerning hazards workers faced during the pandemic and the need for urgent action from OSHA to hold these industries account-able to protect vulnerable workers. As a result of this hearing, this bill includes an increase of $100,000,000 for OSHA above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. The recommendation, a 17 percent in-crease over last year, will support additional OSHA inspectors and restore the agency's capacity to conduct more complex, labor-inten-sive inspections. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 COVID-19 and the Mental Health and Substance Use Crises The Committee held a virtual hearing to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and substance use crises and the responses to this emergency, and heard rec-ommendations on how to build a stronger behavioral health system capable of meeting the demand for services. The COVID-19 pan-demic dramatically worsened these existing crises, creating new barriers to treatment while increasing numbers of Americans are reporting anxiety, depression, and substance use. People with exist-ing vulnerabilities have been disproportionately affected\u2014including communities of color, underserved communities, essential workers, people who were already struggling with a mental illness or sub-stance use disorder or were otherwise in poor health, children, and families struggling economically. As a result of this hearing, the Committee is making substantial investments to strengthen the be-havioral health continuum of care to increase access to prevention, screening, treatment and other critical services. Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis The Committee held a virtual hearing to identify the reasons why the U.S. lags behind other industrialized nations in maternal health outcomes; examine the disparities in maternal health out-comes by race, socioeconomic status, residence, and other factors; and identify opportunities to address these issues through invest-ments in HHS programs. As a result of this hearing, the bill in-creases funding for programs across HRSA, CDC, NIH, and AHRQ to improve access to quality maternal and postpartum health care and reduce disparities in maternal health outcomes. Building Capacity, Building Community: Increasing Investments in Community Colleges The Committee held a virtual hearing that explored the impor- tance of community colleges, as well as their strengths and chal-lenges. Today, there are more than 1,000 community colleges. Com-munity colleges touch upon the lives of individuals in every State and even the outlying areas. Community colleges are typically open access institutions, serving a diverse student body with unique challenges. While, typically, the associate's degree is the highest degree awarded at community colleges, these institutions also offer a wide variety of postsecondary credentials. In this way, commu-nity colleges are uniquely positioned to meet the workforce develop-ment and educational needs of our country simultaneously. As a re-sult of this hearing, the recommendation includes robust increases for programs that help support community colleges and their stu-dents: the WIOA programs, the Strengthening Community Colleges Training Grant program, the Apprenticeship Grants program, the Strengthening Institutions program, and the Child Care Access Means Parents in School program. Mental Health Emergencies: Building a Robust Crisis Response System The Committee held a virtual hearing on how to create a robust mental health crisis care system with services available to anyone, anywhere, anytime, with a goal of diverting people experiencing a mental health crisis from the criminal justice system into mental VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul health treatment. The lack of sufficient mental health care re- sources in communities means mental illness often goes untreated, which can lead to law enforcement responding to mental health emergencies because there are no alternatives to respond to the cri-sis. As a result of this hearing, the bill increases funding for men-tal health crisis services and creates a Mental Health Crisis Re-sponse Partnership Pilot Program for communities to create, or en-hance existing, mobile crisis response teams that divert the re-sponse for mental health crises from law enforcement to behavioral health teams.

Adult Employment and Training Activities. \u2014For Adult Employ- ment and Training Activities, the Committee recommends $923,174,000, which is $60,525,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $23,187,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budg-et request. Youth Employment and Training Activities. \u2014For Youth Employ- ment and Training Activities, the Committee recommends $988,604,000, which is $67,474,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $24,767,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budg-et request. Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities. \u2014For Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities, the Com-mittee recommends $1,183,554,000, which is $122,001,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $28,276,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Dislocated Worker Assistance National Reserve. \u2014The Committee recommends $435,859,000 for the Dislocated Workers National Re-serve, an increase of $155,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $55,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. The Committee recommendation includes $100,000,000, an in- crease of $55,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 fiscal year 2022 budget request, for Strengthening Community College Training Grants to support a new grant competition. This funding will continue to help better align workforce development efforts with postsecondary education and build off lessons learned from the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Ca-reer Training Grant program. The Committee recommendation con-tinues to direct the Department to follow the program require-ments as laid out in House Report 116-62, except that the 120 day requirement for the solicitation shall not apply. The Committee recommendation also includes $100,000,000 for a new program designed to assist communities experiencing disloca-tions occurring in fossil fuel and other energy related industries. A part of the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization, this program builds upon the Obama Administration's POWER initiative and is in-tended to support the economic well-being of workers and commu-nities impacted by changes in the coal, oil, gas, and other indus-tries. The Committee includes $10,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level, for grants to support national out-of-school time organizations that serve youth and teens and place an emphasis on age-appropriate workforce readiness programming to expand job training and workforce pathways for youth and disconnected youth, including soft skill development, career exploration, job readiness and certification, summer jobs, year-round job opportunities, and registered apprenticeships. Funding will also support partnerships between workforce investment boards and youth serving organiza-tions. The Committee includes $5,000,000 for the Department of Labor to establish an Automation Impacted Industries Pilot Program to award competitive grants to industry or sector partnerships to sup-port demonstration and pilot projects relating to the training needs of workers who are, or are likely to become, dislocated workers as a result of automation. Under this program, grantees may use the funds for one or more of the following: 1) Providing training serv-ices, which may include training services that prepare workers for in-demand industry sectors or occupations.; 2) providing assistance for employers in developing a staff position for an individual who will be responsible for supporting training services provided under the grant; 3) purchasing equipment or technology necessary for training services; 4) providing job search and other transitional as-sistance to workers in industries with high rates of job loss; 5) pro-viding a training stipend to workers for training services; 6) pro-viding integrated education and training. The Committee includes $5,000,000 in fiscal year 2022 for a dem- onstration program to provide fulltime, work-based learning coordi-nators in underserved communities with an already proven track record for secondary career and technical education. Work-based learning coordinators will conduct outreach, engagement, recruit-ment and coordination of work-based learning activities, including, but not limited to, paid internships or pre-apprenticeships for high school students, with local community employers, especially with in-demand industries of information technology, health sciences, and engineering. The work-based learning coordinators may be em-ployed by the local education agency, local workforce development VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul board or local workforce development agency, a group of employers, or a consortium of eligible entities. In making grant awards, the Committee directs the Secretary to ensure to require a plan for evaluations in each individual grant proposal, including types of work-based learning opportunities completed, demographics of par-ticipating students, and students' post-secondary career plan, as well as to conduct a national assessment of all grantee proposals once complete. Native Americans. \u2014For the Indian and Native American pro- grams, the Committee recommends $58,000,000, which is $2,500,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers. \u2014For the National Farm- worker Jobs program, the Committee recommends $96,711,000, which is $2,815,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. YouthBuild. \u2014For the YouthBuild program, the Committee rec- ommends $145,000,000, which is $48,466,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budg-et request. Reintegration of Ex-Offenders. \u2014The Committee recommends $150,000,000 for training and reintegration activities for individ-uals with criminal legal histories or who have been justice system- involved, which is $49,921,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee directs the Department to ensure grantees estab-lish formal partnerships with employers and that program partici-pants receive industry recognized credentials and training in fields that prepare them for successful reintegration, including ensuring participants receive training and credentials in fields where their criminal record is not a barrier to entry or continued employment. The Committee also directs the Department to consider the needs of communities that have recently experienced significant unrest or have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pan-demic. The Committee also continues the set-aside of $25,000,000 for competitive grants to national and regional intermediaries for ac-tivities that prepare young adults with criminal legal histories or who have been justice system-involved or who have dropped out of school or other educational programs, with a priority for projects serving high-crime, high-poverty areas. The Committee directs the Department to consult data from the Department of Education and prioritize grants in communities where students of color have dis-proportionate rates of expulsions and suspensions. The Committee is aware that recent re-entry programs are an excellent way to help address workforce challenges, including those in the advanced manufacturing sector. The Committee directs the Department to provide an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congres-sional Budget Justification on information from the last three fiscal years on pathways and relationships built with employers, includ-ing data on formerly incarcerated individuals who have utilized the program, rates of increased credentials, and placement in higher paying positions. Workforce Data Quality Initiative. \u2014The Committee recommends $7,250,000 for the Workforce Data Quality Initiative, which is VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fis- cal year 2022 budget request. The Committee supports the work of States in using these funds to create and utilize data to align pre-school through workforce systems. Apprenticeship Grants. \u2014The Committee recommends $285,000,000 for the apprenticeship grants program, which is $100,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee estab-lished this program in 2016 to expand work-based learning pro-grams in in-demand industries through registered apprenticeships. Registered apprenticeships are a proven strategy for meeting the needs of our nation's workforce and industry simultaneously. The Committee continues to invest in expanding opportunities relating to Registered Apprenticeship programs registered only under the National Apprenticeship Act, to be available to the Sec-retary to carry out activities through grants, cooperative agree-ments, contracts and other arrangements with States and other ap-propriate entities. As part of these opportunities, the Committee di-rects the Secretary to continue funding for national and local ap-prenticeship intermediaries, business and labor industry partner intermediaries, and equity intermediaries. The Committee also di-rects the Department to ensure that these intermediaries are given opportunities to apply for competitive grants, cooperative agree-ments, contracts, and other funding opportunities. The Committee urges the Secretary to ensure that States engage both business and labor as part of any State funding opportunities associated with this program. In addition, the Committee continues to support the funding and development of industry or sector partnerships as a means to expand work-based learning programs and registered ap-prenticeships in in-demand industries. The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations providing details on entities award-ed funding, selection criteria used, and the funding amount for each grant or contract awarded at the time such awards are made. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Department shall provide the Committees on Appropriations a detailed spend plan of anticipated uses of funds made available, including admin-istrative costs. The Committee also directs the Department to pro-vide quarterly briefings on all spending activities under this pro-gram to the Committee. The Committee is encouraged by the Administration's actions to restore the Federal Government's role in ensuring high-quality training opportunities by taking steps to rescind the industry reg-istered apprenticeship program. The national apprenticeship pro-gram is in dramatic need of modernization through expansion of registered apprenticeship, youth apprenticeships, and pre-appren-ticeship programs to create more job training opportunities, espe-cially in the face of shifting workforce needs and in-demand career skills. In light of this need, the Committee encourages the Sec-retary to identify key sectors, beginning with cybersecurity work-force and advanced manufacturing, with growing workforce de-mands that adapt well within apprenticeship models and develop streamlined plans with key stakeholders to execute apprenticeship programs. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Committee strongly supports efforts to expand Registered Apprenticeships to traditionally underrepresented communities and encourages the Department to explore the feasibility and expansion of Registered Apprenticeship programs within the arts, theater, film, and television industries. Specifically, the Committee requests that the Department explore expanding the Registered Apprentice-ship model to create career training strategies for all roles in the entertainment industry such as creative, production, technical, marketing and public relations roles. In addition, the Committee notes that apprenticeships are an im- portant path to the middle-class. However, women are largely underrepresented in apprenticeship programs, and women who do participate make far less than men. Therefore, the Committee di-rects the Department to accelerate efforts to recruit and retain women as part of these programs and to ensure equal compensa-tion. The Committee is also concerned about shortages nationwide of qualified drinking water and wastewater operation professionals, especially in rural areas, and encourages the Secretary to make funding available to address these challenges. Further, the Com-mittee directs the Department to work with eligible community or-ganizations to support the creation of new training programs fo-cused on filling identified gaps in the maritime workforce. The Committee also supports the use of apprenticeship grants that provide worker education based on public-private partnerships in in-demand fields, including first responders, as well as in goods movement sectors such as global logistics, rail and other freight-re-lated employment. The Committee encourages the Department to support appren- ticeship programs that increase the number of trained workers in cybersecurity. The Committee notes that apprenticeship programs contribute to higher wages and fewer injuries for workers in the energy industry. The Committee also notes that as the United States combats cli-mate change, we need to expand the clean energy workforce. How-ever, we currently lack sufficient apprenticeship programs in the clean energy sector. Therefore, the Committee encourages prioritization of apprenticeships in clean energy and encourages the Department of Labor to accelerate efforts to support appren-ticeship programs that increase the number of trained workers in the clean energy sector, with an emphasis in regions anticipating a loss in fossil fuel industry jobs. National Youth Employment Program. \u2014For the National Youth Employment Program, the Committee recommends $50,000,000, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This new competitive grant program will provide funding for youth employ-ment programs, including summer and year-round opportunities. Veterans' Clean Energy Training Program. \u2014For the Veterans' Clean Energy Training Program, the Committee recommends $20,000,000, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. This new competitive grant program will prepare veterans and their spouses for careers in clean energy. Community Project Funding. \u2014Within the funds included in this account, $63,956,000 shall be used for the following projects in the following amounts: VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Project Amount AIDS Service Center of Lower Manhattan, Inc. dba Alliance for Positive Change, New York, NY for a workforce development initiative ............................................................................................... ................ $1,000,000 Anne Arundel County Government, Annapolis, MD for Youthworks! ............................................................. $500, 000 Arizona Opportunities Industrialization Center, Phoenix, AZ for the provision of comprehensive training courses and job placement in the hospitality industry .......................................................................... .. $1,200,000 Avivo, Minneapolis, MN for workforce training related to clean energy and green building, including equipment ...................................................................................................................... ............................ $1,000,000 Benedict College, Columbia, SC for workforce development activities, including technology, equipment, and supportive services ........................................................................................................ ..................... $2,000,000 Beyond the Sanctuary, Inc., Rochester, NY for job readiness program, including equipment and sup- portive services ............................................................................................................... ........................... $525,000 Bristol County Chamber Foundation, Fall River, MA for workforce development activities ......................... $500,000 Broward College, Ft.

nation's largest residential employment and workforce development program for youth, helping prepare thou-sands of young people ages 16 through 24 for jobs in in-demand oc-cupations with good wages each year. Operations. \u2014For Job Corps Operations, the Committee rec- ommends $1,653,325,000, which is $50,000,000 more than the fis-cal year 2021 enacted level and $50,314,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Construction, Rehabilitation, and Acquisition. \u2014The Committee recommends $138,000,000 for construction, rehabilitation, and ac-quisition activities, which is $25,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Administration. \u2014The Committee recommends $38,748,000 for the administrative expenses of the Job Corps program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fis-cal year 2022 budget request. For over 50 years, Job Corps has successfully educated and trained millions of young adults for jobs in high demand industries and trades. Job Corps has campuses across all 50 States and Puer-to Rico and provides a safe living, learning and disciplined residen-tial setting that allows disconnected and opportunity youth to gain the employment and skills that U.S. employers seek. The Com-mittee recommendation includes funding for Job Corps to meet ca-pacity and ensure a safe learning environment for all students and staff, including to train youth for employment in industry sectors facing critical shortages of skilled workers, such as construction, VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and cyber technologies. Job Corps centers are capable of serving approximately 50,000 out- of-work and out-of-school youth each year, and the Committee en-courages the Department to use such funding accordingly. In addition, the Committee is concerned with the administration of the Job Corps program, including the underutilization of centers relative to on-board strength, industry-standard training, and per-formance incentives. To better utilize Job Corps centers, the Committee directs the Department to include an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congres-sional Budget Justification on Job Corps application and enroll-ment data to evaluate the relative efficacy of different investments in producing Job Corps-eligible applicants, arrivals, and their fami-lies, including social media, national television or radio buys, and local outreach efforts targeted at eligible youth, guardians, and influencers. As millions of disconnected youth struggle with housing, food in- security, and unemployment, the Committee supports the efforts to resume operations at Job Corps centers as safely and rapidly as possible. Like other schools across the country, once Job Corps staff are vaccinated, the Committee encourages full resumption of Job Corps operations. The Committee directs the Department to in-clude an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Jus-tification on the requirements and measures the Department will utilize to approve Job Corps centers resuming operations at full ca-pacity. The Committee has previously expressed its concern that the transition to fixed price Job Corps contracts may negatively impact students and staff by prioritizing reducing costs over improving student outcomes. The Committee encourages the Department to ensure that Job Corps contracts offer competitive wages and bene-fits. The Committee directs the Department to include an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on the process by which the Department evaluates cost-realism in bid evaluations, particularly with respect to budgeting to pay pre-vailing wages, and data on the rate of contract turnover over each of the last ten years. COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT FOR OLDER AMERICANS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $405,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 450,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +45,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +45,000,000 The Community Service Employment for Older Americans pro- gram provides grants to public and private non-profit organizations that subsidize part-time work in community service activities for unemployed persons aged 55 and older whose family income is below 125 percent of the poverty level. The Committee recommends $450,000,000 for the Community Service Employment for Older Americans program, which is $45,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 AND ALLOWANCES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $633,600,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 551,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... \u00a582,600,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Trade Adjustment Assistance program (TAA) provides as- sistance to workers adversely affected by international trade. TAA provides training, income support, wage subsidies for older work-ers, job search and relocation allowances to groups of workers who file a petition and are certified as eligible to apply for such benefits due to job losses resulting from increases in imports or foreign trade. The authorization for this program is set to expire on July 1, 2022, and a sunsetting provision took effect on July 1, 2021, caus-ing the program to revert to limited eligibility for the program. The amount for fiscal year 2022 reflects this reversion. STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICE OPERATIONS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $3,416,649,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 4,176,230,000 Change from ......................................................... +759,581,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +54,469,000 The total includes $4,087,164,000 from the Employment Security Administration Account from the Unemployment Trust Fund and $89,066,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury. These funds are used to support the administration of Federal and State unem-ployment compensation laws. Unemployment Insurance Compensation. \u2014For Unemployment In- surance (UI) Compensation, the Committee recommends $3,125,214,000, which is $559,398,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. The recommendation provides additional resources for States to increase staffing capacity and to accommodate sustained in-creases in workload. In addition, the recommendation provides contingency funding for increased workloads that States may face in the administration of UI. The Committee recommendation includes bill language so that, during fiscal year 2022, for every 100,000 increase in the total average weekly insured unemployment (AWIU) above 2,008,000, an additional $28,600,000 shall be made available to States from the Unemployment Trust Fund. In the event that additional funds are provided to States under the AWIU contingency authority, the Department is directed to provide notification to the Committees on Appropriations of the current projected AWIU level for the fiscal year, when funds were provided to States, and how much additional funding was provided in total and to each State within 15 days of funding being provided. In the event that additional funds are provided on a quarterly basis, the Department shall provide this information on a quarterly basis. The Committee includes $117,000,000 for the Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments program, and an additional VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul is made available pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which is $50,000,000 more than the fis-cal year 2021 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget request. UI Integrity Center of Excellence (UIICE). \u2014The recommendation provides $9,000,000 for the continued support of UIICE, including $6,000,000 for the benefit of States to the entity operating the UIICE. GAO Study on Unemployment Insurance Compensation. \u2014The Committee notes that the significant increase in Unemployment In-surance (UI) Compensation claims during the COVID-19 pan-demic, which Congress provided to address the corresponding eco-nomic crisis, has strained the ability of state agencies responsible for administering UI Compensation in a timely and reliable man-ner. In a few short months, the unemployment rate increased from 3.5 percent in February 2020 to 14.8 percent in April 2020, requir-ing States to respond to unexpected workloads. Moreover, fraudu-lent filing for, and receipt of, UI Compensation, increased signifi-cantly as well. The Committee directs GAO to study existing defi-ciencies in the administration of UI Compensation, including but not limited to the need for investment in technological improve-ments at the state-level, and provide the Committees on Appropria-tions with its findings and recommendations. Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. \u2014The Coronavirus Aid, Re- lief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act, P.L. 116-136) estab-lished the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, which delivered billions of dollars in emergency assistance to indi-viduals who became unemployed due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Further, this program sus-tained American families and provided needed economic relief. The Committee notes that critical emergency assistance during simulta-neous public health and financial crises should be targeted to indi-viduals who are eligible for benefits. The Department and States should ensure that proper safeguards\u2014including program integrity and fraud prevention tools and procedures\u2014are in place to identify any schemes to defraud this emergency program. The Committee urges the Department to work with the Office of the Inspector Gen-eral on this matter and to utilize the UIICE to assist States in ef-forts to ensure benefits are delivered to individuals and families who qualify for them. Unemployment Compensation National Activities. \u2014The Com- mittee recommends $118,108,000 for National Activities, which is $100,108,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This increase in fund-ing is intended to help modernize information technology systems and support States in administering the UI program. The Committee supports ongoing efforts by the Department's Employment and Training Administration to collaborate with state workforce agencies to modernize unemployment insurance manage-ment systems. The Committee urges the department to develop a comprehensive long-term strategy for delivery of assistance to state workforce agencies that would: develop an open-systems approach and modular program of unemployment management systems that can be adapted for state-by-state usage plans; standardize employ-ment and wage records reporting requirements; incorporate 21st VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 standards; develop enforcement and oversight methods so that states meet established US DOL technology guid-ance such as Unemployment Insurance Program Letter 2-1; avoid use of high-risk automated decision-making and identity-proofing systems to deny claims; standardize dashboard and claimant portal information; require public dissemination of by-county demographic data on benefits denials, delays, overpayments, and fraud deter-minations; correct past inequities in benefits distribution by taking into account user-experiences of historically disadvantaged groups; conduct user testing and a full consultation with state-level stake-holders, users, and worker organizations. Employment Service. \u2014The Committee recommends $748,862,000 for the Employment Service allotment to States, which is $78,810,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $50,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee also recommends $22,318,000 for Employment Service National Activities, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Within the total, the Committee provides $2,500,000 to reduce the proc-essing backlog for the work opportunity tax credit program and for assisting States in adopting or modernizing information technology for processing of certification requests, which may include training and technical assistance to States. The Employment Service offers vital services such as referrals for job openings, career counseling, and job searches for individuals seeking employment, including veterans and people with disabil-ities. Since 1933, this Federal-State partnership has facilitated the connection between employers in need of workers and individuals seeking employment. Given the nature of this exchange, the De-partment has historically required that the Employment Service system rely on State merit-staff employees to ensure that these services are rendered in the public interest and not solely to meet private interests. However, under the previous Administration, the Department issued a final rule that marked a dangerous departure from this operation. As such, the recommendation includes new bill language preventing the implementation of the final rule, entitled ''Wagner-Peyser Act Staffing Flexibility'' (85 Fed. Reg. 592). Foreign Labor Certification. \u2014The Committee recommends $94,075,000 for the Foreign Labor Certification (FLC) program, which is $16,265,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The rec-ommendation includes $67,793,000 for Federal administration, an increase of $10,265,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request, that is intended to be used to ensure effective oversight and enforcement of em-ployer regulations, and $26,282,000 for grants to States, an in-crease of $6,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. H-2A Program. \u2014Given the rapid growth of the H-2A program, the role of farm labor contractors, and the troubling rate of viola-tions within the program, the Committee directs the Secretary to submit a report to the Committee on Appropriations on the Depart-ment's enforcement of farm labor contractors (FLCs) within 180 days of enactment of this Act. The report shall contain, at a min-imum, the following information for each of the last 5 years: an VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 for fixed-site employers and FLCs; an analysis of the inspections, audits, investigations, administra-tive complaints, and judicial litigation regarding findings of viola-tions by farm labor contractors in the H-2A program, including remedies; and recommendations to deter violations and improve compliance by farm labor contractors in the H-2A program and how to ensure that farmworkers obtain adequate relief for any vio-lations. The content of the final report shall be made publicly avail-able on the agency's website. H-2B visa disbursements. \u2014The Committee directs the Depart- ment to include an update in its fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on the number of labor certifications granted through the H-2B non-immigrant visa program. At a minimum, the report shall contain, but is not limited to, the number of job openings published on seasonaljobs.dol.gov each fiscal year, cat-egorized by industry and occupation. Schedule A Occupational Classification. \u2014The Committee is aware that the Schedule A occupational classification list currently includes only two broad occupational classifications and a narrow subset of other applicants. The Committee continues to encourage the Secretary to consider rulemaking to improve the experience of employers and to effectively allocate Department resources with the goal of protecting U.S. workers from undue foreign competition through the labor certification process. One-Stop Career Centers/Labor Market Information. \u2014The Com- mittee recommends $67,653,000 for One-Stop Career Centers and Labor Market Information, which is $5,000,000 more than the fis-cal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The recommendation also includes language au-thorizing the Secretary to transfer certain funding to the Office of Disability Employment Policy for research and demonstration projects. ADVANCES TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND AND OTHER FUNDS The Committee recommends such sums as necessary for Ad- vances to the Unemployment Trust Fund and Other Funds. The funds are made available to accounts authorized under Federal and State unemployment insurance laws and the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund when the balances in such accounts are insufficient. PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $158,656,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 211,503,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... 52,847,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The recommendation includes $144,497,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury and $67,006,000 from the Employment Secu-rity Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The Committee includes new bill language ensuring Office of Ap- prenticeship resources support Registered Apprenticeships and ade-quate staffing in the Office of Apprenticeship and State offices. Prize Competition. \u2014The Committee encourages the Department, in coordination with the Office of Science and Technology Policy, to establish a prize competition consistent with the requirements of VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul 24 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, to support eligible programs designed to prepare high school students to enter and succeed in an in-demand industry sector or occupation. Long-term Unemployed. \u2014The Committee notes the economic challenges millions of individuals now face due to the coronavirus pandemic and high-unemployment. Within a matter of months, a nine-year period of sustained economic recovery and growth was swept away by a wave of pathogen, shuttering businesses and cre-ating economic uncertainty. The Committee also notes that the eco-nomic prospects for many individuals unemployed prior to the start of the national emergency were worsened as a result of COVID-19. Prior to the pandemic, these individuals faced significant barriers to employment, having been unemployed for 27 weeks or more. While it is essential that the Department supports policies and practices that put Americans back to work in a safe and sustain-able way, the Department must also ensure that the long-term un-employed do not fall through the cracks of our economic recovery. To advance this effort, the Committee encourages the Department to support reemployment programs targeting long-term unem-ployed workers. Open Data Formats. \u2014The Committee notes that Congress has made a significant investment in our workforce development, post-secondary, and career and technical education systems. As a result of this investment, the number of credentials in the U.S. continues to rise. However, the Committee is aware that many workers and students may face challenges in navigating an intricate network of diplomas, licenses, certifications, and badges. Therefore, the De-partment is encouraged to require any information publicly dis-closed related to occupational and professional licenses and certifi-cations, as well as credentials and competencies earned through ap-prenticeships, whether directly or through contracts, be published using an open source description language that is designed to allow for public search and comparison of such data, including any such data on credentials and competencies. Such information may be published through open data formats such as the credential trans-parency description language specifications or a substantially simi-lar approach. The Department is further encouraged to provide a briefing to the Committees within 120 days of enactment of this Act, outlining a plan for providing such data, including any chal-lenges, barriers to implementation, as well as anticipated costs. National Guard Job ChalleNGe. \u2014The Committee appreciates the value and success of the National Guard's Youth ChalleNGe Pro-gram, and the benefits the Department of Labor's collaboration through Job ChalleNGe provides to the youth served through the experience. The occupational skills training, individualized career and academic counseling, work-based learning opportunities, and leadership development activities provided through the Job Chal- leNGe are even more vital in the aftermath of the economic fallout associated with the pandemic. The Committee encourages the De-partment to build upon its collaboration with Youth ChalleNGe programs and offer youth occupational skills training, individual-ized career and academic counseling, work-based learning opportu-nities, and leadership development activities. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Violence. \u2014The Committee encourages the Department to prioritize Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funding op-portunities, like the Young Adult Reentry Partnership and YouthBuild, to support reintegration, transitional employment, long-term impactful positions, union positions, and living wages for systems-involved youth and older adults in cities disproportionately impacted by daily gun violence. Collaborations between manufacturers and educational institu- tions. \u2014The Committee encourages the Department to develop dem- onstration and pilot programs that facilitate education and training programs in the field of advanced manufacturing. Eligible entities include local educational entities (e.g., technical college, community college, a manufacturing extension center, or an entity that assists educationally underserved communities) partnering with manufac-turers that employ individuals who have advanced manufacturing skills. These programs should (1) develop skills and competencies of workers in communities with expected growth in advanced man-ufacturing; (2) provide education and training for available and an-ticipated jobs in advanced manufacturing; (3) educate individuals about career advancement opportunities within advanced manufac-turing; (4) strengthen community college partnerships with manu-facturing extension centers and advanced manufacturing busi-nesses in an effort to meet the needs of businesses for adaptability in training of workers; and (5) give priority to incumbent workers, dislocated workers, and unemployed individuals. Justice Involved Workers. \u2014The Committee supports the Depart- ment's intention to expand education, skills training, and work ex-perience programs to connect justice-involved individuals with em-ployment opportunities to obtain and retain jobs. The Committee urges the Department to develop and improve the availability of employment and transitional job programs that support work-based learning activities designed to increase reentry employment as an equitable workforce approach. To increase alignment of work expe-rience opportunities across Federal programs, the committee also encourages the Department to work with national nonprofit organi-zations that have proven track records in this area, including orga-nizations with partnerships with the SNAP Employment and Training program. E MPLOYEE BENEFITS SECURITY ADMINISTRATION SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $181,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 218,475,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +37,475,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) assures the security of retirement, health and other workplace-related ben-efits of working Americans. The Committee recommends $218,475,000 for EBSA, which is $37,475,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) Com- pliance. \u2014The Committee has included resources for EBSA to fully VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Division BB of the Consolidated Appro- priations Act, 2021. Section 203 requires that all group health plans perform comparative analyses of the design and application of nonquantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs) to ensure those imposed on mental health and substance use disorder benefits are not more restrictive than limitations for medical and surgical bene-fits. These funds will enable EBSA to hire additional health inves- tigators who will focus exclusively on MHPAEA NQTL compliance and contract with external consultants with expertise in NQTL comparative analyses to assist and train investigators. To the ex-tent resources allow, the Committee also encourages EBSA to cre-ate templates and tools for collecting and scoring the comparative analyses and rendering decisions on compliance; enhance coordina-tion, standardization and MHPAEA-related decision-making uni-formity among regional offices; and conduct follow-up investiga-tions into group health plans whose comparative analyses indicate likely noncompliance or areas in which further examination is needed to determine compliance. P ENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $465,289,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 472,955,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +7,666,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - Congress established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insure the defined-benefit pension plans of working Americans. WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $246,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 300,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +54,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +23,500,000 The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) enforces Federal minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and child labor requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). WHD also has enforcement and other administrative responsibilities related to the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Davis Bacon Act, and the Service Contract Act. The Committee recommends $300,000,000 for WHD, which is $54,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $23,500,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The in-crease will support additional investigators to combat wage theft and protect workers. The Committee urges WHD to explore and ex-pand strategic enforcement approaches to the agency's work to make the most of this increase. Language Access. \u2014In hiring investigators, the Committee en- courages WHD to focus on employing and retaining a greater num-ber of multilingual investigators. In the fiscal year 2023 Congres-sional Budget Justification, WHD is directed to include information VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul the WHD's goals for meeting critical language access needs through its investigator workforce. Retaliation. \u2014Because retaliation and the threat of retaliation re- main critical challenges to workers' ability to exercise their work-place rights, the Committee requests for WHD to provide informa-tion regarding its volume of retaliation complaints, the status of those complaints, and how WHD is working effectively protect workers from retaliation in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Accessibility. \u2014The Committee notes the importance of making sure all workers can access WHD's resources, including workers of color, immigrant workers, workers in rural communities or with limited access to transportation, and workers with disabilities. The Committee encourages WHD to undertake efforts to improve acces-sibility of WHD offices, translate WHD documentation and signage into languages spoken by 5 percent or more of the population in a given WHD region, and translate WHD's online webpages, com-plaint forms, and resources to match regional needs identified. In addition, the Committee encourages WHD to establish protocols that permit workers to participate in investigations and hearings remotely where appropriate. Community-based Organizations and Partnerships. \u2014The Com- mittee believes that community-based organizations are critical in establishing necessary trust, connecting workers with agencies, fa-cilitating communication between agencies and workers, and de-ploying enforcement resources strategically. Working with commu-nity-based organizations helps agencies cooperate with workers who might be otherwise difficult to reach, including workers em-ployed by small businesses, workers with literacy challenges, work-ers with limited access to broadband, and workers in high-hazard industries most vulnerable to wage violations. Therefore, the Com-mittee urges WHD to increase its capacity to conduct outreach and collaborate with community-based organizations. U and T Visa Certification. \u2014The Committee notes the critical role WHD plays in completing U and T visa certifications on behalf of victims of crime and victims of trafficking in the workplace. En-suring that all workers regardless of immigration status can par-ticipate in WHD investigations and exercise their workplace rights is critical to the full and effective enforcement of Federal labor laws. The Committee urges WHD to use resources provided in fis-cal year 2022 to ensure the efficient and timely processing and cer-tification of all certification requests. Domestic Workers. \u2014The Committee is concerned that domestic workers are particularly vulnerable to workplace exploitation, in-cluding wage theft, verbal abuse, trafficking, and sexual assault. Domestic work commonly takes place in private homes where workers are often isolated and alone. This workforce is predomi-nantly female and represents populations that are already vulner-able, including immigrant women and women of color. The Com-mittee is concerned by the limited enforcement of workplace rights for this population and the severe power imbalance between domes-tic workers and their employers. In response to these concerns, the Committee includes new bill language directing the Secretary to use funds made available under WHD to establish a national hot-line to support domestic workers. In addition, the Committee urges VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul to prioritize investigations in sectors where workers are more vulnerable to wage theft, including domestic work, long term care, and home health care. O FFICE OF LABOR -MANAGEMENT STANDARDS SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $44,437,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... Recommendation ............................................................. 44,437,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a57,117,000 The Office of Labor Management Standards (OLMS) administers the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), which establishes safeguards for union democracy and union finan-cial integrity, and requires public disclosure reporting by unions, union officers, employees of unions, labor relations consultants, em-ployers, and surety companies. The Committee recommends $44,437,000 for OLMS, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $7,117,000 below the fiscal year 2022 budget request. O FFICE OF FEDERAL CONTRACT COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $105,976,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 140,732,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +34,756,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) ensures equal employment opportunity in the Federal contracting community through enforcement, regulatory work, outreach and education to workers and their advocates. OFCCP is responsible, per Executive Order 11246 (EO 11246), for ensuring Federal contractors and subcontractors take affirma-tive action to ensure that all individuals have an equal opportunity for employment, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or na-tional origin. The Committee recommends $140,732,000 for OFCCP, which is $34,756,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee supports OFCCP's efforts to make sure contractors and subcontractors are adhering fully to EO 11246. O FFICE OF WORKERS ' COMPENSATION PROGRAMS SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $117,601,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 140,809,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +23,208,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) admin- isters the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, the Energy Employees Oc- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Illness Compensation Program Act, and the Black Lung Benefits Act. These programs provide eligible injured and disabled workers and their survivors with compensation, medical benefits, and services including rehabilitation, supervision of medical care, and technical and advisory counseling. The Committee recommendation includes $138,604,000 in Gen- eral Funds from the Treasury, which is $23,180,000 above the fis-cal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 request, and $2,205,000 from the Special Fund established by the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. National Commission. \u2014The Committee is concerned by an ongo- ing and systematic decline in the adequacy of benefits provided to injured workers under the State-based workers' compensation sys-tem. Costs for disabling workplace injuries are being shifted to Federal programs, such as Social Security Disability Insurance, be-cause of reduced coverage under State laws. With the growth of the gig economy and misclassification of workers as independent con-tractors, millions of workers are falling through the cracks in State workers' compensation systems. Given the impact to the Federal government, the Committee believes that State workers' compensa-tion programs should be monitored on an ongoing basis. Following the issuance of the report of the National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws in 1972, the Department prepared an annual report on the operations of State workers' compensation programs, but ceased doing so in 2004. Since then, there has been no reporting or analysis as State legislatures have passed, and gov-ernors have signed, significant legislation affecting the availability and adequacy of workers' compensation. The Committee requests that the Department, through the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, include in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification an assessment of the resources necessary to reinstate OWCP's monitoring of State workers' compensation programs and preparation of an annual report. SPECIAL BENEFITS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $239,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 244,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +5,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - These funds provide mandatory benefits under the Federal Em- ployees' Compensation Act. SPECIAL BENEFITS FOR DISABLED COAL MINERS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $40,970,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 32,970,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... \u00a58,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - These funds provide mandatory benefits to coal miners disabled by black lung disease, to their survivors and eligible dependents, and for necessary administrative costs. The Committee recommends $32,970,000 for Special Benefits for Disabled Coal Miners. This amount is in addition to the $14,000,000 appropriated in fiscal year 2021 as an advance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. The total program level rec- VerDate Sep 11 2014 less than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee recommendation also provides $11,000,000 as an advance appropriation for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. These funds ensure uninterrupted payments to beneficiaries. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES , ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS COMPENSATION FUND Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $62,507,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 63,428,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +921,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - These funds provide mandatory benefits to eligible employees or survivors of employees of the Department of Energy (DOE); its con-tractors and subcontractors; companies that provided beryllium to DOE; atomic weapons employees who suffer from a radiation-re-lated cancer, beryllium-related disease, or chronic silicosis as a re-sult of their work in producing or testing nuclear weapons; and uranium workers covered under the Radiation Exposure Com-pensation Act. BLACK LUNG DISABILITY TRUST FUND Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $382,991,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 331,505,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... \u00a551,486,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, supported with manda- tory funding, pays black lung compensation, medical and survivor benefits, and administrative expenses when no mine operator can be assigned liability for such benefits, or when mine employment ceased prior to 1970. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is fi-nanced by an excise tax on coal, reimbursements from responsible mine operators, and short-term advances from the Treasury. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 authorized a re-structuring of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund debt and re-quired that annual operating surpluses be used to pay down the debt until all remaining obligations are retired. Black Lung Benefits Claims Processing. \u2014The Committee is con- cerned with lengthy delays in the processing of Black Lung Bene-fits Act claims, particularly where the mine operator's ability to pay the claim is in question. Delays impede access to necessary medical care while claims are pending. The Committee supports ef-forts by the Secretary to resolve these claims expediently to ensure miners can receive the benefits and medical care they need. The Committee requests that the Secretary provide an update on the Department's efforts to improve the speed and quality of its black lung claims processing in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budg-et Justification. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $591,787,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 691,787,000 Change from ......................................................... +100,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +27,163,000 The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to assure safe and healthy working conditions by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education and as-sistance. Within the total for OSHA, the Committee provides the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Safety and Direction and Administration ......................................................................................... ................ Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs). \u2014The Com- mittee is concerned about the significant reduction in OSHA Com-pliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs) in recent decades rel-ative to the number of workers they oversee. These CSHOs enforce Federal workplace standards across the country, inspecting work-sites and ensuring that employers comply with worker safety and health regulations. That is why the Committee is strongly sup-portive of OSHA's plans to use additional resources to support and rebuild OSHA's enforcement program by hiring additional CSHOs. The Committee encourages the agency to focus on employing and retaining multilingual officers crucial to thorough inspections of workplaces across the country. Penalties. \u2014The Committee notes that OSHA penalties are among the lowest of any Federal agency and believes they are woe-fully inadequate in deterring workplace health and safety viola-tions by employers. For instance, despite widespread reports that meatpacking facilities were becoming deadly COVID-19 hotspots as early as March 2020, OSHA waited six months before issuing two small financial penalties totaling $29,000 to a Smithfield and a JBS plant. For context, in 2019, JBS' annual revenue was $51.7 billion and Smithfield's was $14 billion. To address these concerns, Committee urges OSHA to adopt policies that encourage the use of full penalties or a penalty multiplier for serious violations in large businesses. Whistleblower Protection Program. \u2014The Committee is concerned with the increasing caseloads and unprecedented length of time taken by OSHA to complete whistleblower investigations. OSHA's whistleblower investigative staff enforces protections for employees who suffer retaliation for protected activity under more than 20 VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul and the number of statutes continues to increase with three more added in the past two years. OSHA's already-overbur-dened Whistleblower Protection Program staff faced an unprece-dented surge in complaints during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dur-ing the first four months of the pandemic, the average number of whistleblower complaints received per investigator increased by 30 percent\u201439 percent of these were COVID-19 related. At the same time, the Whistleblower Protection Program's FTEs decreased be-tween 2019 to 2020 to only 120 investigators, causing an increase in the number of cases handled by each investigator. The Office of Inspector General concluded in August 2020 that when OSHA fails to respond in a timely manner, it ''could leave workers to suffer emotionally and financially'' and may lead to the erosion of evi-dence needed for the case. To bolster the Whistleblower Protection Program's capacity to conduct critical investigations in a timely manner in industries across the country and bring the agency clos-er to compliance with statutory requirements of more than 20 stat-utes, the Committee increases resources for the Whistleblower Pro-tection program by $10,936,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. This increase will support OSHA's efforts to update its dec-ades-old Whistleblower database to the current OSHA Information System for OSHA's main enforcement program or to develop a new system. Susan Harwood Training Grants. \u2014The Susan Harwood Training Grants to non-profit organizations reach workers in dangerous in-dustries with critical education and training on workplace hazards and statutory protections. The latest statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that workplace fatalities are increasing for Black workers and that fatality rates are higher among Latino and Black workers. The Committee supports OSHA's efforts to provide funding to non-profit, community-based groups, and other non-prof-it organizations with the capability to reach workers in low-wage industries and workers in dangerous industries. In addition, the Committee urges OSHA to allow grantees to train on multiple haz-ards. In addition, the Committee encourages OSHA to support grants for workers employed in disaster recovery and rebuilding sectors. U and T Visas. \u2014The Committee strongly supports efforts by OSHA to ensure all workers, regardless of immigration status, can participate in OSHA investigations and exercise their workplace rights. However, the Committee notes that OSHA does not, like WHD, outline a process for U and T visa certification. The Com-mittee encourages OSHA to evaluate the merits of establishing a policy on U and T visa certification requests and consider assisting workers with U and T visa certification. COVID-19 Testing for Meatpacking Workers. \u2014The Committee is supportive of workplace health and safety procedures that include adequate COVID-19 testing for meatpacking workers. Even before the pandemic, meatpacking, poultry, and agriculture have been dangerous industries for workers. The pandemic exacerbated these hazards, which are disproportionately felt by workers of color. OSHA Noise Standard. \u2014The Committee is aware that the Na- tional Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) esti-mates that 22 million US workers are exposed to potentially dan-gerous levels of noise in the workplace every year and that hearing VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul the most commonly recorded occupational illness in manu- facturing, accounting for 1 in 9 recordable illnesses. The Committee is also aware that the OSHA Noise Standard for employers was es-tablished in 1983, but has not been updated since that time even as the Department of Defense (DoD), NIOSH, and many other countries have recommended or adopted more protective noise ex-posure limits. Accordingly, to better protect the American work-force and reduce the risk of noise-induced hearing loss, the Com-mittee encourages OSHA to lower the current permissible exposure level to 85 dBA TWA using a 3 dB exchange rate. Such a change would substantially reduce the excess risk of developing occupa-tional noise-induced hearing loss over a working lifetime and be consistent with current exposure limits specified by the DoD and voluntarily adopted by many private employers. Needlestick Safety. \u2014The Committee recognizes the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to our nation's essential healthcare workforce as they continue to ensure the administration of FDA-ap-proved COVID-19 vaccines. With the increase in demand for sy-ringe-administered vaccines comes the increased risk of exposure not only to COVID-19, but also to bloodborne pathogens including, but not limited to, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immuno-deficiency virus. OSHA should continue to work with the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services (HHS) to monitor the supply of safety-engineered devices for COVID-19 vaccinations. If OSHA and HHS determine that there is a shortage of these devices, the Committee requests that OSHA include cost estimates that will en-sure the standards prescribed in the Needlestick Safety and Pre-vention Act are enforced to the extent feasible in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. The authorization in-cludes a standard which states that employers are required to evaluate, select, and use engineering controls to eliminate or mini-mize exposure to contaminated sharps. Occupational Heat Stress Protection Standard. \u2014The Committee recognizes the urgency of developing a workplace safety standard to protect workers from excessive heat, and is aware that a stand-ard has already proven to be feasible to implement, and in light of rising temperatures urges OSHA to take all necessary steps to issue a proposed occupational heat stress protection standard by the end of fiscal year 2022. The Secretary is directed to submit a schedule to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the action steps it will be taking to promulgate an occupational heat stress protection standard. M INESAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $379,816,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 404,816,000 Change from ......................................................... +25,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a542,385,000 The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) enforces the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act in underground and sur-face coalmines and metal/non-metal mines. VerDate Sep 11 and Non-metal Mines. \u2014MSHA is directed to include in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification and all future Congressional Budget Justifications historical and budget year information on enforcement activities and outcomes, distin-guishing between coal and metal/non-metal mines. To promote transparency in agency spending on its enforcement activities, MSHA shall continue to separately present annual spending on coal and metal/non-metal mines as it has in past Congressional Budget Justifications. Resources and Activities. \u2014The Committee notes significant work- er dislocations and mine closures because of economic conditions throughout the mining industry, and in coal mining in particular. The Committee reiterates its support for the ongoing effort to bring MSHA enforcement into proportion by redistributing resources and activities to the areas where mine production is currently occurring and where MSHA identifies the most significant safety hazards. B UREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $655,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 700,653,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... + 45,653,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is an independent national statistical agency that collects, processes, analyzes, and dissemi-nates essential economic data to the Congress, Federal agencies, State and local governments, businesses, and the public. Its prin-cipal surveys include the Consumer Price Index and the monthly unemployment series. The Committee recommendation includes $632,653,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury and $68,000,000 from the Employ-ment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Within the total amount for BLS, the Committee includes $28,470,000 to continue the relocation of the BLS headquarters, which was initiated in fiscal year 2020. Within the total for BLS, the Committee provides the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Employment and Unemployment .......... $221,000,000 Labor Market Information ....................................................................................................... Cost of Living Compensation and Working and Technology .................................................................................................... and Staff Services ......................................................................................... ................. 66,329,000 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). \u2014The Committee is supportive of BLS' plan for the planning, development, and im-plementation of a new NLSY cohort and provides sufficient re-sources to implement this plan without delay. Specifically, the Committee supports the Department's plan to increase spending on the new NLSY cohort in fiscal year 2023 to $14,500,000 and re-quests an update on future spending plans in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul and Staff. \u2014When imple- menting the NLSY and other new investments, the Committee di-rects BLS not to reduce or eliminate existing statistical work. Fur-ther, the Committee directs BLS not to reduce the number of full- time equivalent positions beyond the apportioned fiscal year 2021 full-time equivalent ceiling. Artificial Intelligence. \u2014The Committee is aware of the develop- ment of artificial intelligence and encourages BLS to examine this trend's impact on the economy. Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) .\u2014The Com- mittee recognizes the need for enhancements to JOLTS to better understand national labor market dynamics. Therefore, the Com-mittee requests for the Department to provide cost estimates in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification for expanding the JOLTS sample level and for releasing JOLTS data monthly to improve timeliness. O FFICE OF DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT POLICY SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $38,500,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 42,711,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +4,211,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) provides pol- icy guidance and leadership to eliminate employment barriers to people with disabilities. The Committee recommendation for ODEP is $42,711,000, which is $4,211,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee is sup-portive of the budget proposal for ODEP to invest in research and demonstration projects related to testing effective ways to promote greater labor force participation of people with disabilities. D EPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $349,364,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 457,219,000 Change from ......................................................... +107,855,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +17,249,000 The Departmental Management appropriation provides funds for the staff responsible for Departmental operations, management, and policy development. The Committee recommendation includes $456,911,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury, $107,855,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $17,249,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request, and $308,000 from the Employment Security Ad-ministration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Within the total for Departmental Management, the Committee provides the following amounts: VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Affairs Bureau (ILAB). \u2014Of the $136,000,000 recommended for the International Labor Affairs Bureau (ILAB), the Committee directs the Secretary to allocate not less than $40,175,000 in grants to build the capacity of countries to enforce labor rights to promote a more level playing field for workers in the U.S. The Committee directs ILAB to use its fiscal year 2022 fund-ing increase to place additional labor attaches in strategic countries focused on fundamental worker rights such as freedom of associa-tion, collective bargaining, protection from sex discrimination, and acceptable conditions of work. The Committee urges ILAB to prioritize these additional attaches in areas of strategic importance such as Honduras, Guatemala, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. Flagship Reports on Child Labor and Forced Labor. \u2014ILAB is di- rected to continue its work on three key reports, including: DOL's Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor; the List of Goods Pro-duced by Child Labor or Forced Labor; and, the List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor. The Committee in-cludes the resources requested in the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest for staff and contract costs to fulfill a new statutory mandate requiring the List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor to include goods that are produced with inputs that are pro-duced with forced labor or child labor. USMCA Implementation Act. \u2014The Committee urges ILAB to use USMCA Implementation Act funding to directly support workers' rights and capacity to organize independent unions in Mexico. These activities must be central to ILAB's monitoring, enforcement, and capacity-building roles in USMCA implementation. ILAB can also advance this critical work through technical assistance that strengthens the capacity of independent unions in USMCA priority sectors. Further, ILAB can fund research and legal teams, includ-ing through academic institutions, to develop sustainable programs that train and support labor lawyers and researchers in priority sectors. Finally, ILAB can support key USMCA objectives by fund-ing innovative supply chain monitoring and accountability mecha-nisms, focused on ensuring the effective recognition of workers' rights to organize and collective bargaining in USMCA priority sec-tors. Such efforts to develop necessary research, legal assistance and monitoring mechanisms will collectively supplement and strengthen core ILAB program to directly educate and train work-ers to build independent unions. In the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification, ILAB is directed to include spending plans for resources provided in the USMCA Implementation Act for fiscal years 2020 through 2023. Spending plans should include descriptions and amounts for projects and staffing. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Discrimination in Employment and the Workplace. \u2014The Committee recognizes the vital role ILAB plays in building the ca-pacity of other countries to enforce and improve labor protections for workers and in enforcing the labor provisions of U.S. trade agreements and preference programs; however, the Committee is concerned that the issue of sex discrimination has not received enough attention in the Bureau's capacity-building, monitoring, and enforcement activities. It is essential that workers around the world are protected from pregnancy- and maternity-based discrimi-nation, discriminatory recruitment and hiring, and the manifesta-tion of unconscious bias in the workplace. Further, many female workers receive unequal access to training opportunities and work schedules that prevent them from acting as primary care givers and accepting positions that would help them advance. In addition, the Committee is concerned by the complete absence of gender mainstreaming in labor inspections; lack of labor inspector training on best practices for identifying and addressing sex discrimination; and inadequate complaint mechanisms for women to anonymously report sex discrimination in employment and the workplace. Fi-nally, the Committee believes workers should receive equal pay for work of equal value. In response, the Committee urges ILAB to prioritize these areas of concern through its capacity-building, mon-itoring, and enforcement efforts. Child Labor in Cocoa. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the continued prevalence of child labor in the harvesting and produc-tion of cocoa beans. Further, the Committee notes that while the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group (GLCCG) has facilitated progress in the reduction of child labor in cocoa production, sub-stantial levels of children remain engaged in child labor in the in-dustry. The Committee is concerned about the progress of the GLCCG in accordance with goals established in the Harkin-Engel Protocol. The Committee encourages the Department to report on indicators of progress being made by high-risk countries to elimi-nate child labor and forced labor in the cocoa sector, including progress being made to map all cocoa farms. In addition, the Com-mittee encourages the Department to report on government and in-dustry use of available best practices for management, reporting, and verification, and on the active and meaningful participation of worker organizations in order to provide consumers with assurance that cocoa products are produced without the use of child labor and forced labor. Women's Bureau. \u2014Of the $25,000,000 appropriated to the Wom- en's Bureau, the Committee provides no less than $6,794,000 for the Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations (WANTO) program, which is $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This pro-gram helps employers and labor unions recruit, train, and retain women for nontraditional employment opportunities. These re-sources are essential in helping women overcome traditional bar-riers to entry and supporting women's full participation in the labor force. Women's Unemployment. \u2014The Committee is concerned by the dramatic increase in the unemployment rate for women as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee encourages the Wom-en's Bureau to make it an agency-wide priority to mitigate and re- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul this trend in fiscal year 2022. Additionally, the Committee is supportive of the recommendations from GAO's report on the gen-der pay gap in the federal workforce (GAO-21-67) and is sup-portive of GAO's ongoing work to identify improvements regarding measures taken by the Department of Labor to mitigate women's unemployment, including the immediate and long-term effects of COVID-19 on women's employment. The Committee is interested in the impacts of COVID-19 on unemployment rates for low-income women and women of color, groups that have been disproportion-ately impacted by the pandemic Operating Plan. \u2014The Committee directs the Department to sub- mit its annual Operating Plan to the Committees on Appropria-tions within the 45-day statutory deadline. Advertising Spending. \u2014The Committee understands that, as the largest advertiser in the U.S., the Federal Government should work to ensure fair access to its advertising contracts for small dis-advantaged businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women. The Committee directs the Department to include the fol-lowing information in its fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification: Expenditures for fiscal year 2021 and expected ex-penditures for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, respectively, for (1) all contracts for advertising services; and, (2) contracts for the adver-tising services of (I) socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small Busi-ness Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)); and (II) women- and minority-owned businesses. Employees. \u2014The Committee directs the Department to provide a report not later than 30 days after the conclusion of each quarter detailing the number of full-time equivalent employees and attri-tion by principal office and appropriations account. Investments in Impoverished Areas. \u2014The Committee supports targeted investments in impoverished areas, particularly in per-sistent poverty counties and in other high poverty census tracts. To understand how programs funded through the Department are serving these particular areas, the Committee directs the Depart-ment to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations on the percentage of funds allocated by all competitive grant programs in fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 to serve individuals living in persistent poverty counties, as defined as a county that has had 20 percent or more of its population living in poverty over the past 30 years, as measured by the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses and the most recent Small Area Income and Poverty estimates, or any territory or possession of the United States, and high-poverty areas, as defined as any census tract with a poverty rate of at least 20 percent as measured by the 2014-2018 5-year data series avail-able from the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau. The Department shall report this information to the Committees within 90 days of such data being available and provide a briefing to the Committees not later than 180 days of enactment of this Act on how the Department is carrying out this directive. In the case of any competitive program for which at least 10 percent of the funds allocated were not allocated to persistent poverty counties or for which the percentage allocated to high-poverty areas in fiscal year 2020 or 2021 was less than the average percentage of Federal assistance allocated to high-poverty areas awarded under the pro- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul in fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019, such report and briefing shall explain why such a benchmark is unable to be met. Evidence-based Policymaking Act. \u2014The Committee is supportive of efforts by the Department to consider evidence of effectiveness in grant competitions and requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on implementation of the Foundations for Evidence-based Policymaking Act (P.L. 115-435) and implementation plans for the coming year. The Committee en-courages the Secretary to develop guidance to ensure relevant par-ticipants and grantees are involved in the Department-wide process of prioritizing evidence needs, including participating in Depart-ment led evaluations. Consistent with program statutes, the Com-mittee encourages the Secretary to ensure that evidence of effec-tiveness is a consideration in grant opportunities. Organizational Priority Goals. \u2014The Committee directs the De- partment to comply with title 31 of the United States Code, includ-ing the development of organizational priority goals and outcomes such as performance outcome measures, output measures, effi-ciency measures, and customer service measures. The Committee further directs the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service. \u2014 The Committee continues to support efforts to improve customer service in accordance with Executive Order 13571\u2014Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service. The Committee directs the Secretary to develop standards to improve customer service and incorporate the standards into the performance plans required under 31 U.S.C. 1115. The Committee further directs the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Use of Force. \u2014The Committee supports vigorous action to im- prove training for all Federal, State, and local law enforcement offi-cers on racial profiling, implicit bias, procedural justice, the use of force, and the duty for officers to intervene when witnessing the use of excessive force against civilians. The Committee therefore di-rects the Secretary to work with the Attorney General and the Fed-eral Law Enforcement Training Centers to implement improved, mandatory training on these topics for all federal law enforcement officers, along with the development of related standards that can be applied in hiring and performance assessments. These training requirements and standards should be based on the related provi-sions in H.R. 1280, as passed by the House of Representatives in March 2021. The Committee directs the Department's Division of Protective Operations, to the extent it has not already done so, to submit its use of force data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Use of Force Data Collection database. The Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this Act on current efforts to tabulate and submit use of force data to the FBI. Inter-agency Collaboration. \u2014The Committee identifies a need for more inter-agency collaboration between the Department (including WHD and OSHA), Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the National Labor Relations Board to enforce labor and civil rights laws fully and effectively. The Committee encourages the VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul to review and evaluate current enforcement efforts, re- scind harmful regulations and sub-regulatory guidance, and ensure each agency is using all the tools and policies at their disposal to protect workers. This includes robust coordinated outreach and education to rebuild trust in government enforcement, especially in communities of color. Critical Minerals. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of critical minerals for use in the United States. In response to this growing need, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations, Act of 2021, Congress authorized in section 7002 a workforce assessment and workforce development program in the Department of Labor to address mineral security. The Committee requests an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justifica-tion. Family-Friendly Workplaces Certification. \u2014The Committee rec- ognizes the importance of promoting family-friendly workplaces. The pandemic has placed an unexpected burden on working par-ents, particularly working mothers who have left the labor force in disproportionate numbers since March 2020. Therefore, the Com-mittee directs the Secretary to evaluate the feasibility of estab-lishing a certification program that recognizes exemplary family- friendly businesses and incentivizes businesses to adapt best prac-tices that reflect the challenges faced by working parents. Modeled off the Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star Program, this Family-Friendly Workplaces Certification would evaluate busi-nesses based on a number of policies including; paid sick days, paid family leave of at least 12 weeks per year, childcare subsidies, lac-tation support, assistance paying for or referring employees to fer-tility or adoption services, and accommodations for pregnant work-ers. The Committee directs the Secretary to submit this feasibility report within 270 days of enactment of this Act. VETERANS EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $316,341,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 334,841,000 Change from ......................................................... +18,490,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +10,000,000 The recommendation includes $67,500,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury and $267,331,000 from the Employment Se-curity Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The Veterans Employment and Training (VETS) program serves America's veterans and separating service members by preparing them for meaningful careers, providing employment resources and expertise, and protecting their employment rights. Within the total for VETS, the Committee provides the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee State Administration Veterans Reintegration Program ........................................................................................ Committee recommendation includes $31,379,000 for the Transition Assistance Program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This funding will enhance the quality of employment support serv-ices for transitioning service members and allow VETS to develop and implement a course curriculum to help military spouses over-come the challenges they face related to employment and career de-velopment. The Committee includes $67,500,000 for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program, which is $10,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Funds will be used to further support the needs of veterans experi-encing homelessness. The Committee includes $500,000, which is the same as the fis- cal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to support the HIRE Vets Medallion Program authorized by the Honoring Investments in Recruiting and Employing American Mili-tary Veterans Act of 2017. The Committee recommendation includes $300,000 within Fed- eral Administration, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level to continue the operation of the Disabled Veteran Pro-gram (DVP), which was initiated by the Committee in fiscal year 2020. The DVP addresses the high unemployment and low labor force participation rate of veterans with service-connected and non- service-connected disabilities. The DVP helps increase employment and advancement opportunities for veterans with disabilities by working with Federal, State, and private partners to promote the hiring of veterans with disabilities, improve coordination of avail-able employment services and supports, and to identify and share employment best practices for hiring, retaining, and advancing vet-erans with disabilities in the workforce. Equity and Access for Homeless Veterans. \u2014The Committee di- rects the Department to include an update on racial equity and ac-cess to programs at the Department providing services to homeless veterans in its fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. The update shall also track departmental expenditures within the Homeless Veteran Programs, specifically with regard to minority, female, and LGBTQ populations. Where available, the Department shall disaggregate data by ethnicity, age, gender identity, and dis-charge status. Military Spouse Occupational License and Certification Port- ability. \u2014The Committee encourages the Department of Labor to work with states to encourage them to implement occupational li-cense and certification portability measures for military spouses through full license recognition. The current framework for license and certification portability often poses a barrier to employment, and this is particularly problematic for military spouses as they frequently are required to relocate due to the nature of their spouse's military employment. The number of jobs that require a license has steeply risen from 5 percent in the 1950s to 30 percent today. The increase in licensing requirements and frequent moves contribute to the high unemployment rate of military spouses, cur-rently at 24 percent. Addressing this issue demonstrates the Com-mittee's appreciation for the service of military members and the sacrifices their families make on a daily basis. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Committee encourages the De- partment to pilot an accelerated veteran transition program in re-gions surrounding military installations in the United States, in-clusive of exiting soldiers and retired veterans. The pilot program would utilize funding under this account for direct services to sup-port veterans and transitioning military members into in-demand civilian occupations aligned with their military training and experi-ence. This project is needed as available veteran resources do not fully pay for school, transitional benefits (in terms of training), or target regional career/trade demands. While transitioning soldiers have access to available resources, those sources do not offer the job-placement-centric approach that this program would prioritize. Additionally, existing allocation from the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) resources does not fund certificate edu-cation in prospective targeted occupations. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $ 27,269,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... Recommendation ............................................................. 37,269,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +10,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - Information Technology (IT) Modernization provides a dedicated source of funding for Department-wide IT modernization projects together with funding through the Department's Working Capital Fund. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $90,847,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 95,398,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +4,551,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits of Depart- ment programs and operations in order to determine that they comply with the applicable laws and regulations, that they use re-sources effectively, and that they are achieving their intended re-sults. The recommendation includes $89,738,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury, which is $4,551,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budg-et request, and $5,660,000 from the Employment Security Adminis-tration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. \u2014The PUA program was de- signed to ensure that critical emergency assistance was delivered immediately, so it would be available to unemployed workers when it was most needed. It is important to ensure that resources for such critical emergency assistance during simultaneous public health crisis and financial crisis should be targeted to individuals and families who are eligible for benefits. The Committee supports the Inspector General's oversight activities and efforts to inves-tigate any illegal schemes to defraud the PUA program.

TITLE II\u2014DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES H EALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $7,207,234,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 8,723,922,000 Change from ......................................................... +1,516,688,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +910,628,000 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) sup- ports programs that provide health services to disadvantaged, medically underserved, and special populations; decrease infant mortality rates; assist in the education of health professionals; and provide technical assistance regarding the utilization of health re-sources and facilities. The Committee recommendation for HRSA includes $8,723,922,000 in discretionary budget authority, $316,778,000 in mandatory funding and $16,200,000 in trust fund appropriations for the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program Trust Fund, and $5,000,000 for the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Pro-gram. PRIMARY HEALTH CARE Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $1,683,772,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 1,831,772,000 Change from ......................................................... +148,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +98,000,000 Health Centers The Committee recommends $1,830,772,000 for the Health Cen- ters program, $148,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $98,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Health Centers deliver affordable, accessible, quality, and cost-effective primary health care to millions of people across the country regard-less of their ability to pay. Programs supported by this funding in-clude community health centers, migrant health centers, health care for the homeless, school-based, and public housing health serv-ice grants. In addition, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $7,600,000,000 in discretionary appropriations to support Health Centers' response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee includes bill language providing up to $120,000,000 for the Federal Tort Claims Act program, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budg-et request. Alcee L. Hastings Program for Advanced Cancer Screening in Un- derserved Communities. \u2014The Committee is extremely concerned about the disparity in cancer screening\u2014and corresponding higher levels of cancer incidence and adverse outcomes\u2014in medically un-derserved communities. Several studies have demonstrated that this problem has only been made worse by the pandemic. The Com- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul to fund Health Centers to increase ac- cess and address barriers to cancer screening, including patient education, case management, outreach, and other enabling serv-ices. Grantees must partner and coordinate closely with NCI-des-ignated cancer centers to deploy cancer-center trained and super-vised outreach specialists and navigators to improve cancer screen-ing and referrals among vulnerable populations in their catchment areas. Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative. \u2014The Committee pro- vides $152,250,000 within the Health Centers program for the EHE Initiative, $50,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This ini-tiative provides funding to Health Centers in high-need jurisdic-tions to increase the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among people at high risk for HIV transmission. Health Center Dental Services. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of Health Centers in providing comprehensive primary and preventive health services to the nation's underserved commu-nities. Health Centers provide dental services for many who would otherwise face barriers to dental care. The Committee is aware that some Health Centers have partnered with Community Dental Health Coordinators (CDHCs) to provide patients with greater ac-cess to dental care. CDHCs provide community-based prevention, care coordination, and patient navigation to underserved popu-lations in rural, urban, and Native American communities. The Committee encourages HRSA to work with Health Centers to ex-pand their work in this area. Health Center Mental Health Services for Children. \u2014The Com- mittee is concerned about the many challenges faced by children in need of mental health services because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had serious impacts on children's mental, psy-chological, and emotional well-being, especially in low-income and minority communities. This impact will likely last for an extended period. The Committee strongly encourages HRSA to provide fund-ing to Health Centers to support vital mental health services for children. School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) and Health Center Serv- ices at School-Based Sites. \u2014Recognizing the critical role of Health Centers as part of our nation's health care safety net, and that Health Centers providing services at sites located at schools within the communities they serve are currently one of the most effective sources of mental health care for children and adolescents, the Committee includes a total increase of $50,000,000 within the total for Health Centers to support the delivery of health care services at school-based sites. The Committee includes $25,000,000 to make grants to establish new school-based health centers and expand services at SBHCs pursuant to 42 USC 280h-5. SBHCs provide a convenient access point to high-quality, comprehensive primary health care, mental health services, preventive care, social services, and youth development to primarily children and adolescents from low-income families. The Committee also includes $25,000,000, an increase of $20,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level, for awards to Health Centers operating at school-based sites to in-crease their capacity to meet the increasing demand for health services, including mental health services. The Committee encour- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 grants to applicants that previously sub- mitted fundable applications under HRSA-21-093 but that did not receive such funding. Health Center Controlled Networks. \u2014Health Center Controlled Networks (HCCNs) are the foundation of health information tech-nology (HIT) services for the nation's community health centers. Health Centers function as the largest primary care network in the country, caring for 30 million patients. HCCNs are voluntary asso-ciations of community health centers that band together to invest in HIT tools, optimize the use of these technologies, digitally con-nect to health care and community partners, and more. The HIT infrastructure requires robust federal investment to support the de-mand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic's resulting shift in how health care is provided. The Committee strongly supports the work of HCCNs. HRSA Strategy to Address Intimate Partner Violence and Project Catalyst. \u2014The Committee includes no less than $2,000,000 for the HRSA Strategy to Address Intimate Partner Violence, an increase of $500,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee encourages HRSA to support training, technical assistance, and resource development to assist public health and health care professionals to better serve individuals and communities impacted by intimate partner vio-lence. Native Hawaiian Health Care Program. \u2014The Committee pro- vides $22,000,000 within the total for Health Centers for the Na-tive Hawaiian Health Care Program, $1,500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Native Hawaiian Healthcare Systems help improve the health status of Native Hawaiians by making health education, health promotion, disease prevention, and Native Hawaiian traditional healing services available. The Committee understands the importance of ensuring that in- digenous people, including Native Hawaiians, have access to health care. The Committee requests a report from the Government Ac-countability Office (GAO) on the status of health care accessibility and affordability for Native Hawaiians living in Hawaii, to include the rural and medically underserved islands. Free Clinics Medical Malpractice The Committee includes $1,000,000 for carrying out responsibil- ities under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The program provides medical malpractice coverage to individuals in-volved in the operation of free clinics to expand access to health care services to low-income individuals in medically underserved areas. HEALTH WORKFORCE Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $1,224,006,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 1,564,876,000 Change from +340,870,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +184,492,000 The Bureau of Health Workforce strengthens the health care workforce by providing grants, scholarships, and loan repayment programs to help communities recruit and retain health care pro-viders where they are most needed. In addition to the amounts above, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $1,000,000,000 in discretionary appropria-tions to support health workforce programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee bill strikes language prohibiting HRSA funds from being used to support alternative dental providers. Dental therapists are licensed providers who play a similar role in den-tistry to that of physician assistants in medicine, and work under the supervision of a dentist to provide routine dental care like exams and fillings. Ending this prohibition on funding will give States flexibility to expand the oral health workforce and improve access to dental care, particularly in rural and underserved com-munities. National Health Service Corps (NHSC) The Committee includes $185,000,000, an increase of $65,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for NHSC to support competitive awards to health care providers dedicated to working in underserved com-munities in urban, rural, and tribal areas. In addition to the amounts above, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $900,000,000 in discretionary appropriations to support NHSC in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Loan Repayment for Opioid and Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Treatment. \u2014The Committee includes $155,000,000, $25,000,000 below the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for loan repayment for clinicians that provide opioid and substance use disorder treat-ment. Within this total, the Committee includes $15,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to support NHSC awards to participating individ-uals that provide health services in IHS facilities, Tribally-Oper-ated Health Programs, and Urban Indian Health Programs. Maternity Care Target Areas (MCTAs). \u2014The Committee includes $5,000,000, an increase of $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request, within NHSC to implement requirements contained in the Improv-ing Access to Maternity Care Act, including establishing criteria for and identifying MCTAs and collecting and publishing data on the availability and need for maternity care health services in health professional shortage areas. National Health Service Corps Rural Demonstration Program. \u2014 The Committee strongly supports the NHSC program for improving access to quality care in rural and underserved areas. The Com-mittee notes that rural communities continue to face acute work-force challenges, with approximately five percent of incoming med-ical students coming from rural areas and only one-third of NHSC placements in rural communities. The Committee includes $25,000,000 within NHSC for a pilot program to evaluate the ben-efit to patient access and practitioner recruitment and retention of extending loan repayment for five years and $200,000 for providers serving in rural areas that are part of a Health Professional Short- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul The Committee also directs HRSA to include an assess- ment of program utilization and impact in the annual NHSC report to Congress and to submit a final report after completion of the pilot. Health Professions Education and Training The Committee includes $565,404,000 for Health Professions Education and Training Programs authorized under title VII of the PHS Act, $125,870,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $37,992,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Addressing the Shortage of Behavioral Health Professionals. \u2014 The Committee is concerned that increased gun violence and the pandemic's exacerbation of health disparities has unveiled an im-mediate and desperate need for behavioral health professionals, in-cluding social workers, psychologists, counselors, occupational therapists, and psychiatrists. Neuropsychiatrists and advanced practice behavioral nurses are specially trained to diagnose mood disorders or biochemical imbalances. A HRSA report found that there will be a shortage of 250,000 mental health professionals by 2025. The Committee directs HRSA to submit a report addressing the scope of the shortage of behavioral health professionals, bar-riers to careers in behavioral health, Federal support available, and recommendations to Congress to address the shortage within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Social Work Reinvestment Commission. \u2014The Committee is aware that millions of Americans are not receiving the mental, be-havioral and social care services they need. The COVID-19 pan-demic has increased the need for services. The nation's 700,000 so-cial workers are the largest provider of these services, so it is im-perative that we ensure a robust social work workforce. As such, the Committee directs HRSA in collaboration with SAMHSA, ACF, OMH, and CMS, to conduct a study and to report to Congress and the Secretary on policy issues related to social work recruitment, retention, research and reinvestment. Not later than 18 months after enactment of this Act, HRSA shall submit its findings and recommendations regarding recommendations and strategies to en-sure a sufficient and strong social work workforce. Health Professions Training for Diversity The Committee supports programs that improve the diversity of the health care workforce. HRSA's diversity pipeline programs, in-cluding the Health Careers Opportunity Program, Centers for Ex-cellence, Faculty Loan Repayment, Nursing Workforce Diversity, and Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students, help advance patient care and ensure opportunity for all health care providers. Centers of Excellence (COEs). \u2014The Committee includes $31,711,000 for COEs, $8,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. This program provides grants to health professions schools and other institutions to serve as resource and education centers for the recruitment, training, and retention of underrepresented minority students and faculty. The Committee notes that COEs educate a disproportionate share of health professionals from mi-nority and underserved backgrounds and address the need for a di-verse and culturally competent American health care workforce. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul \u2014The Committee includes $20,500,000 for HCOP, $5,500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budg-et request. The Committee notes that HCOPs assist students from minority and economically disadvantaged backgrounds navigate ca-reers into the health professions. The Committee encourages HRSA to continue its improvement of the diversity and distribution of needed health care professionals through the National HCOP Acad-emies. Faculty Loan Repayment. \u2014The Committee includes $2,310,000 for Faculty Loan Repayment, $1,120,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program provides loan repayment to health profession grad-uates from disadvantaged backgrounds who serve as faculty at eli-gible health professions academic institutions. Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students (SDS). \u2014The Com- mittee includes $61,970,000 for SDS, $10,500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program provides grants to health professions and nursing schools to provide scholarships to students from dis-advantaged background who have financial need. Within this total, the Committee includes $5,000,000, a $2,500,000 increase over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level, for grants to educate midwives to address the national shortage of ma-ternity care providers, and specifically the lack of adequate diver-sity in the maternity care workforce. This amount will double the number of five-year grants first made available beginning in fiscal year 2020. Primary Care Training and Enhancement The Committee includes $49,924,000, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 level and the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest, for Primary Care Training and Enhancement programs, which support training and direct financial assistance for future primary care clinicians, teachers, and researchers. Eating Disorders Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral, and Treatment (SBIRT). \u2014The COVID-19 pandemic worsened eating disorders across the nation, with one study reporting up to 76 per-cent of respondents engaging in eating disorder behaviors. Despite the medical and psychiatric acuity associated with eating disorders, many patients remain undetected and untreated, as only 20 per-cent of surveyed medical residency programs offer elective training in eating disorders and only six percent require such training. Within the total for Primary Care Training and Enhancement, the Committee provides up to $1,000,000, in coordination with SAMHSA's National Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders, to provide trainings for primary care health professionals to screen, briefly intervene, and refer patients to treatment for the severe mental illness of eating disorders, as authorized under section 13006 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255). Oral Health Training The Committee includes $42,673,000 for Oral Health Training, $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Within the total, the Committee includes VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul than $14,000,000 for Pediatric Dentistry Programs, an in- crease of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. The Committee directs HRSA to provide continuation funding for sec-tion 748 post-doctoral training grants initially awarded in fiscal year 2020 and dental faculty loan repayment program (DFLRP) grants initially awarded in fiscal years 2018 and 2021. The Com-mittee directs HRSA to initiate a new pre-doctoral grant cycle, and to initiate a new DFLRP grant cycle with a preference for pediatric dentistry faculty supervising dental students or residents and pro-viding clinical services in dental clinics located in dental schools, hospitals, and community-based affiliated sites. Interdisciplinary Community-Based Linkages Area Health Education Centers (AHEC). \u2014The Committee in- cludes $50,000,000 for the AHEC program, an increase of $6,750,000 above the fiscal year 2021 level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program links university health science cen-ters with community health service delivery systems to provide education and training networks. The Committee encourages HRSA to support AHEC oral health projects that establish primary points of service and address the need to help patients find treatment outside of hospital emergency rooms. The Committee encourages HRSA to work with programs that have already been initiated by some State dental associations to refer emergency room patients to dental networks. Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP). \u2014The Com- mittee includes $52,737,000 for the GWEP program, an increase of $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 level and $6,200,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program supports train-ing to integrate geriatrics into primary care delivery and develops academic-primary care-community based partnerships to address gaps in health care for older adults. Mental and Behavioral Health Programs. \u2014The Committee in- cludes $43,916,000 for Mental and Behavioral Health Programs, an increase of $6,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 level. Graduate Psychology Education (GPE). \u2014Within the total for Mental and Behavioral Health Programs, the Committee includes $25,000,000, $6,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for the inter-professional GPE Program to increase the number of health service psychologists trained to provide integrated services to high-need, underserved populations in rural and urban communities. The Committee recognizes the severe impact of COVID-19 on Ameri-cans' mental and behavioral health and urges HRSA to strengthen investments in the training of health service psychologists to help meet these demands. Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training (BHWET). \u2014The Committee includes $181,000,000 for the BHWET Program, $69,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level $43,874,000 below the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This pro-gram establishes and expands internships or field placement pro-grams in behavioral health serving populations in rural and medi-cally underserved areas. Adolescent Addiction Medicine and Addiction Psychiatry Work- force. \u2014The Committee applauds HRSA for issuing a funding solici- VerDate Sep 11 2014 the Addiction Medicine Fellowship (AMF) program and the Mental and Substance Use Disorder Workforce Training Dem-onstration, as both programs will build the capacity of our nation's addiction medicine physician workforce. However, the Committee remains concerned by the lack of pediatric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry expertise. Currently, there are insufficient opportunities to effectively train a robust mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) workforce. Only 75 of the na-tion's 179 accredited medical schools offer addiction medicine fel-lowships, and only one program focuses on fellowship opportunities for pediatric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psy-chiatry. The Committee encourages HRSA to support fellowship programs focused on increasing the number of board certified pedi-atric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry subspecialists. Peer Support Specialists in the Opioid Use Disorder Workforce. \u2014 Within the total for BHWET, the Committee includes $15,000,000, an increase of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to fund training, intern-ships, and national certification for mental health and substance abuse peer support specialists to create an advanced peer work-force prepared to work in clinical settings. Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery (STAR) Loan Repayment Program. \u2014The Committee includes $28,000,000 for this program, $12,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program address-es shortages in the SUD workforce by providing for the repayment of education loans for individuals working in a full-time SUD treat-ment job that involves direct patient care in either a Mental Health Professional Shortage Area or a county where the overdose death rate exceeds the national average. An estimated 21 million Americans needed treatment for SUD in 2017, but only four million received any form of treatment. The Bu-reau of Labor Statistics data has cited tremendous shortfalls in the SUD treatment profession. Without strategic investments in the SUD workforce, this gap will not close and more lives will be lost. Funding is now needed to increase the ranks of a well-trained SUD workforce in communities across America. Congress can save lives by equipping the frontline professionals who prevent and treat ad-diction, provide recovery support, and help reduce the negative con-sequences associated with substance use. The Committee directs HRSA to provide a report to the Committee on the progress and implementation of this program within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Mental and Substance Use Disorder Workforce Training Dem- onstration. \u2014The Committee includes $34,000,000 for the Mental and Substance Use Disorder Workforce Training Demonstration program, $4,300,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program makes grants to institutions, including but not limited to medical schools and Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), to sup-port training for medical residents and fellows in psychiatry and addiction medicine, as well as nurse practitioners, physician assist-ants, and others, to provide SUD treatment in underserved commu-nities. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 for Health Workforce Analysis (NCHWA) The Committee includes $5,663,000, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for the NCHWA. This program collects and analyzes health workforce data to provide information on health workforce supply and demand. Public Health and Preventive Medicine Training Programs The Committee includes $23,000,000 for Public Health and Pre- ventive Medicine Training Grant Programs, $6,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Within this total, the Committee provides an increase of $3,000,000 for the Preventive Medicine Residency Training Program and an increase of $3,000,000 for Public Health Training Centers. Nursing Workforce Development The Committee recommends $314,472,000 for Nursing Workforce Development programs authorized under title VIII of the PHS Act, $50,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $46,500,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. In addition to the amounts above, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $200,000,000 in discretionary appropriations to support nursing workforce development in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Impact of COVID-19 on the Rural Nursing Workforce. \u2014The Committee directs HRSA to submit a report within 180 days of en-actment of this Act on the impact of the current public health emergency on the nursing workforce, especially in rural areas, and summarize strategies to mitigate and address these impacts. Registered Nurse Shortages. \u2014The Committee is concerned about current and projected shortages of registered nurses (RNs) in the U.S. As discussed in the HRSA publication ''Supply and Demand Projections of the Nursing Workforce 2014-2030'', California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Texas are projected to have a deficit of 10,000 or more full time equivalent RNs by 2030. The Com-mittee directs HRSA to give priority in new funding announce-ments to public entities for training of additional RNs, specifically for acute care settings. In addition, the Committee directs HRSA to give priority to applicants in States listed by HRSA as having the greatest shortages. Advanced Nursing Education. \u2014The Committee includes $82,081,000 for Advanced Nursing Education, $6,500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $1,500,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program supports traineeships and fac-ulty and curriculum development to increase the number of quali-fied nurses in the primary care workforce. Nursing Education, Practice, Quality, and Retention (NEPQR). \u2014 The Committee includes $51,913,000 for NEPQR, $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program supports academic, service, and continuing education projects to enhance nursing education, improve the qual-ity of care, increase nurse retention, and strengthen the nursing workforce. Nurse Practitioner Optional Fellowship Program. \u2014The Com- mittee provides $15,000,000, an increase of $10,000,000 above the VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget re- quest, for grants to establish or expand community-based nurse practitioner residency and fellowship training programs that are accredited, or in the accreditation process, for practicing post-graduate nurse practitioners (NPs) in primary care or behavioral health, where supported education and training specialties will in-clude family, adult family, adult-gerontology, pediatric, women's health care, nurse midwife, and psychiatric-mental health. The Committee directs HRSA to give preference to FQHCs, as defined by section 1861(aa)(4) of the Social Security Act. The Committee is concerned the Nation is unprepared for health care provider short-ages and recognizes that postgraduate programs with this focus, in-tegrating primary care and behavioral health, will help to address this problem. Patients need expert primary care and behavioral health providers prepared to manage the social and clinical com-plexities experienced in FQHCs. The program provides residency training and fellowships to enable postgraduate NPs to transition to an integrated model of care consistent with current high stand-ards of NP education and practice meeting the needs of our na-tion's most vulnerable populations. The events of 2020, from the global COVID-19 pandemic to national recognition of the severity of health disparities and health inequities in our country, has made this even more urgent. Nursing Workforce Diversity. \u2014The Committee includes $26,343,000 for Nursing Workforce Diversity, $6,500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $3,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program increases nursing education op-portunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds by pro-viding student stipends, scholarships, and preparation and reten-tion activities. Nurse Corps Scholarship and Loan Repayment. \u2014The Committee includes $108,635,000 for Nurse Corps, $20,000,000 above the fis-cal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request.

In addition, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $200,000,000 in discretionary appropriations to support to Nurse Corps in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nursing Faculty Loan Program. \u2014The Committee includes $30,500,000 for the Nursing Faculty Loan Program, $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program supports schools of nursing to pro-vide loans to students enrolled in advanced nursing education pro-grams who are committed to becoming nurse faculty. Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) The Committee includes $400,000,000 for the CHGME payment program, $50,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program helps eligible hospitals maintain graduate medical education programs, which support the training of residents to care for the pediatric popu-lation and enhance the supply of primary care and pediatric med-ical and surgical subspecialties. VerDate Sep 11 2014 The Committee includes $75,000,000, $25,000,000 above the fis- cal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to support colleges of medicine at public universities located in the top quintile of States projected to have a primary care provider shortage. The Committee directs HRSA to give priority to applica-tions from academic institutions located in States with the greatest number of Federally-recognized Tribes. The Committee also directs HRSA to give priority to applications from public universities with a demonstrated public-private partnership. Pediatric Subspecialty Loan Repayment Program The Committee recognizes that there are significant shortages of pediatric subspecialists, child psychiatrists, and other child mental health providers in underserved areas and includes $25,000,000 for the Pediatric Subspecialty Loan Repayment Program under section 775 of the PHS Act. The Committee understands that high grad-uate debt load is a significant barrier to providers choosing to com-plete additional training to enable them to provide specialized care for children with special medical and mental health care needs. National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) The Committee includes $18,814,000 for the NPDB, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The NPDB is a workforce tool that collects and discloses information to authorized entities on past adverse actions of health care practitioners, providers, and suppliers to reduce fraud and abuse and improve health care quality. MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $975,284,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 1,188,784,000 Change from ......................................................... +213,500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +88,700,000 The mission of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) is to improve the physical and mental health, safety, and well- being of the Nation's women, infants, children, adolescents, and their families. Congenital Syphilis. \u2014The Committee is concerned with the rise in congenital syphilis as well as the need to expand efforts to pre-vent this disease and reduce infant mortality. To improve the qual-ity of health care to mothers and their children, the Committee en-courages MCHB to support efforts to increase prenatal screening for congenital syphilis and postnatal follow-up for both mothers and babies to ensure that congenital syphilis is detected at the ear-liest possible stage. Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant The Committee recommends $868,700,000 for the MCH Block Grant, $156,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $46,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. States use the MCH Block Grant to improve access to care for mothers, chil-dren, and their families; reduce infant mortality; provide pre- and post-natal care; support screening and health assessments for chil- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul and provide systems of care for children with special health care needs. The Committee recommends that HRSA continue to support MCH Block Grant partnerships with Federal and State partners to address gaps in services to mothers, children, and their families in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the territories; includ-ing densely populated Medically Underserved Areas and Medically Underserved Population designated Health Professional Shortage Areas. Special Projects of Regional and National Significance The Committee continues bill language identifying specific amounts for Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS). The Committee provides the following within SPRANS: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Set-aside Set-aside for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome ........................................................................................... ................. 1,000,000 State Oral Health Programs. \u2014The Committee includes $250,000 to continue demonstration projects to increase the implementation of integrating oral health and primary care practice. The projects should model the core clinical oral health competencies for non-den-tal providers that HRSA published and initially tested in its 2014 report ''Integration of Oral Health and Primary Care Practice''. The Committee encourages the Chief Dental Officer to continue to play a key role in the design, monitoring, oversight, and implementation of these projects. Alliance for Maternal Health Safety Bundles. \u2014The Committee includes $14,300,000, an increase of $5,300,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budg-et request, to support continued implementation of the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health Program's maternal safety bundles to all U.S. States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories, as well as tribal entities. Maternal safety bundles are a set of targeted and evidence-based best practices that, when implemented, im-prove patient outcomes and reduce maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. Children's Health and Development. \u2014There is increasing evi- dence that experiences in early childhood have long-term health consequences over the course of one's life. These experiences are critical in all areas of children's educational, social, and physical development and economic well-being. Children living in persist-ently high poverty experience more negative health outcomes. The Committee includes $3,500,000 to build upon the work done to ad-dress these challenges, and directs HRSA to fund projects bringing systemic change, such as Statewide systems of early childhood de-velopmental screenings and interventions, in States with high lev-els of or disparities in childhood poverty. The goal of the program is to yield comprehensive and integrated models for other States to utilize in improving child health and development outcomes. Early Childhood Development Expert Grants. \u2014The Committee includes $25,000,000, an increase of $25,000,000 above the fiscal VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 and $15,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to place early childhood development experts in pediatri-cian offices that serve a population with a high percentage of Med-icaid and CHIP patients. Group Prenatal and Postpartum Care Programs. \u2014The Com- mittee recognizes the important role of group prenatal and postpartum care (GPC/PC) programs, such as Centering Pregnancy, can have on improving prenatal care and providing support for ex-pecting mothers. GPC/PC programs provide the opportunity for ex-pectant mothers to learn more about pregnancy, a network of social support, educational tools, and ultimately work towards lowering rates of infant and maternal mortality. The Committee includes $2,000,000 within SPRANS for grants to establish new or support existing GPC/PC programs. Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) Centers of Excel- lence. Committee includes $2,000,000 to establish a new com- petitive grant program for HHT Centers of Excellence. This fund-ing will support coordination and expansion of care for HHT pa-tients and participation in a prospective, longitudinal registry of HHT patients to better understand this rare disease and accelerate the development of new diagnostic and treatment options. Implicit Bias and Racism Training for Health Care Profes- sionals. \u2014The Committee includes $5,000,000, an increase of $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to make grants to train health care providers on identifying and avoiding implicit bias. Infant-Toddler Court Teams. \u2014The Committee includes $25,000,000 to continue and expand research-based Infant-Toddler Court Teams to change child welfare practices to improve well- being for infants, toddlers, and their families. The Committee ex-pects this increase of $15,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level to: (1) build upon the work of sites currently supported through the Infant-Toddler Court Program provision of training technical assistance, and additional support for Infant-Toddler Court teams' efforts across the country, and (2) provide grants to plan and support additional Infant-Toddler Court Teams. Maternal Mental Health Hotline. \u2014The Committee includes $5,000,000, an increase of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 level and $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to support a maternal mental health hotline. The COVID-19 pan-demic has exacerbated maternal mental health conditions, with pregnant and new mothers experiencing anxiety and depression at a three to four times higher rate than prior to the pandemic. The hotline shall provide 24 hours a day voice and text support that is culturally and linguistically appropriate. Funds provided shall also be used to raise public awareness about maternal mental health issues and the hotline. NASEM Study on Bias Recognition in Clinical Skills Testing. \u2014 The Committee includes $1,000,000, $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budg-et request, to support a NASEM study that will make recommenda-tions for incorporating bias recognition in clinical skills testing for accredited schools of allopathic medicine and osteopathic medicine. Pregnancy Medical Home Demonstration. \u2014The Committee in- cludes $25,000,000, an increase of $25,000,000 above the fiscal year VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to support a demonstration providing incentives to maternal health care providers to provide integral health care services to pregnant women and new mothers, with the goal of reducing adverse mater-nal health outcomes and maternal deaths. Regional Pediatric Pandemic Network. \u2014The Committee provides $13,000,000, an increase of $3,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, within SPRANS to continue the work of the Regional Pediatric Pandemic Network to prepare the pediatric community for and coordinate timely research-informed responses to future pandemics. State Maternal Health Innovation Grants. \u2014The Committee in- cludes $53,000,000, $30,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for State Maternal Health Innovation Grants to establish demonstrations to implement evidence-based interventions to address critical gaps in maternity care service delivery and reduce maternal mortality. The demonstrations should be representative of the demographic and geographic composition of communities most affected by maternal mortality. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. \u2014The Committee includes $5,100,000, an increase of $4,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for the Na-tional Fetal, Infant, and Child Death Review (FIDCR) program to expand support and technical assistance to States and tribal com-munities and improve the availability of data on sudden unex-pected infant deaths (SUID). The Committee urges HRSA to con-sider making grants to support families who have experiences SUID by providing information, referrals, or peer or follow-up sup-port services. Maternal and Child Health Programs Sickle Cell Anemia Demonstration Program The Committee includes $9,205,000 for this program, an increase of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. With the start of new five-year grant awards in fiscal year 2022, the Committee is interested in learning how the program is supporting the growth of comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) centers that provide the latest treatment op-tions following evidence-based guidelines and have mechanisms to identify and serve patients with SCD, who are not currently being cared for by SCD specialists. The Committee directs HRSA to pro- vide an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Jus-tification on its plans to meet these goals. Autism and Other Developmental Disorders The Committee recommends $57,344,000 for Autism and Other Developmental Disorders, $4,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. These programs seek to improve the health and well-being of chil-dren and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and other de-velopmental disabilities and to advance best practices for the early identification and treatment of autism and related developmental disabilities. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Related Dis- abilities (LEND). \u2014The Committee provides $38,245,000, $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $856,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for the LEND program to allow the existing 52 LEND sites to maintain their capacity to train interdisciplinary professionals to screen, diagnose, and pro-vide evidence-based interventions to individuals with autism spec-trum disorder and other developmental disabilities. Heritable Disorders The Committee provides $25,883,000 for the Heritable Disorders program, $7,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program supports activi-ties that strengthen the newborn screening system to ensure in-fants born in every State receive rapid identification, early inter-vention, and potentially life-saving treatment. Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID). \u2014Within the total amount for Heritable Disorders, the Committee provides $4,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to support wider implementation, education, and awareness of newborn screening and follow-up for SCID and other newborn screening dis-orders. The Committee recognizes the progress that has been made in screening for SCID at birth to enable early interventions, includ-ing bone marrow transplantations and emerging investigational gene therapies. This work has been extremely beneficial to families who will soon have access to additional support with the launch of a virtual, facilitated caregiver support group this year. The Com-mittee directs HRSA to continue supporting this and related work that focuses on helping families understand and navigate the proc-ess from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up and to expand access to these resources for providers and families of infants with SCID and other newborn screening disorders with a focus on reaching underserved populations. Healthy Start The Committee recommends $145,000,000 for the Healthy Start program, $17,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The program provides grants to communities with high rates of infant mortality to support pri-mary and preventive health care services for mothers and their in-fants. The primary purpose of Healthy Start is to reduce maternal and infant mortality and to generally improve maternal and infant health. Grants are awarded to nonprofits, State and local health departments and community health centers in eligible communities with high rates of infant mortality and other adverse birth out-comes, to develop a package of innovative health and social services for pregnant women and infants, and evaluate those services. Funding is provided to both increase funding to existing grantees so they can increase the number of individuals served and to sup-port new, additional awards to community-based organizations for targeted initiatives to reduce disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Pressure Monitoring Initiative. \u2014Preeclampsia/ec- lampsia is the most dangerous form of hypertension that can de-velop during pregnancy or the postpartum period, affecting as many as one in twelve pregnancies and resulting in 15 percent of premature infant deaths. While new preeclampsia diagnostics are being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Committee understands that medical providers continue to rely on regular blood pressure monitoring to identify pregnant and postpartum people at highest risk of developing preeclampsia. The Committee also understands that preeclampsia disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities and those living in rural com-munities, and supports efforts to improve blood pressure moni-toring for people lacking access to consistent prenatal care, particu-larly efforts to support remote blood pressure monitoring of preg-nant people through use of blood pressure cuffs and easy-to-under-stand patient information to identify the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia and allow patients to proactively engage their health providers. The Committee urges the Healthy Start Program to work with States, health care providers, and nonprofit patient or-ganizations to design and support an initiative that will strengthen remote blood pressure monitoring programs among high-risk vul-nerable populations and communities. Maternal Mortality. \u2014The Committee recognizes the rising ma- ternal mortality rate in the U.S. as a pressing public health issue. Analysis of maternal mortality review committee data indicates that over 60 percent of pregnancy-related deaths are preventable. The Committee continues to provide no less than $15,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for Healthy Start grantees to support nurse practi-tioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, and other maternal-child advance practice health professionals within all pro-gram sites nationwide. Clinical staff will provide direct access to well-woman care and maternity care services to reduce barriers in access to maternity care and help address maternal health dispari-ties among high-risk and underserved women, including those in rural areas and maternal and infant care deserts. Clinical staff will also support health educators by conducting training on maternal early warning signs. Universal Newborn Hearing Screening The Committee includes $19,518,000 for the Universal Newborn Hearing Screening program, an increase of $1,700,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. This program awards grants to 53 States and territories to support Statewide systems of newborn hearing screening and early intervention programs. Emergency Medical Services for Children The Committee includes $28,134,000 for Emergency Medical Services for Children, an increase of $5,800,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budg-et request. Funding is available to every State emergency medical services office to improve the quality of emergency care for children and to support research on and dissemination of best practices. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul and Treatment for Maternal Depression and Related Dis- orders State Grants The Committee provides $10,000,000 for the Screening and Treatment of Maternal Depression and Related Behavioral Dis-orders Program (MDRBD), an increase of $5,000,000 above the fis-cal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Maternal mental health (MMH) conditions are the most common pregnancy and postpartum complication; however, 75 percent of mothers go untreated. The COVID-19 pandemic has ex-acerbated maternal mental health conditions, with pregnant and new mothers experiencing anxiety and depression at a three to four times higher rate than prior to the pandemic. MDRBD trains health care providers to screen, assess, and treat for MMH condi-tions and provide specialized psychiatric consultation to assist the providers. The Committee directs HRSA to make grants to estab-lish new State programs, and improve or maintain existing State programs. Grants shall include culturally competent approaches to assist in the reduction of maternal health inequities. The Com-mittee recognizes the high need amongst States and directs MDRBD to provide technical assistance to non-grantee States. Pediatric Mental Health Access The Committee includes $25,000,000 for Pediatric Mental Health Access, an increase of $15,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program supports expanded access to behavioral health services in pediatric primary care by supporting the development of pediatric mental health care telehealth access programs. Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program The Committee recognizes that good oral health is an important component for improving the health and well-being of children and families. The Committee encourages HRSA to explore opportunities to facilitate linkages between the agency's Home Visiting Program and Community Dental Health Coordinators, where available. The Committee also encourages HRSA to work with oral health initia-tives such as Community Dental Health Coordinators that have al-ready been initiated by dental organizations to provide dental edu-cation, community-based prevention, care coordination, and patient navigation to children and vulnerable families. RYAN WHITE HIV /AIDS PROGRAM Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $2,423,781,000 Budget year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 2,654,781,000 Change from ......................................................... +231,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +100,000,000 Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Im- munodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) program funds activities to address the care and treatment of persons living with HIV/AIDS who are either uninsured or underinsured and need assistance to obtain treatment. The program provides grants to States and eligi-ble metropolitan areas to improve the quality, availability, and co-ordination of health care and support services to include access to HIV-related medications; grants to service providers for early inter- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul services; grants to organizations to provide care to HIV infected women, infants, children, and youth; and grants to organizations to support the education and training of health care providers. Within the total for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, the Committee provides the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Emergency Comprehensive .................. 1,387,005,000 ............................................................................................................. 900,313,000 Early Intervention Program ..................................................................................................... ........................ 207,079,000 Children, Youth, AIDS Dental Services Training Centers ................................................................................................. Projects of National Significance ...................................................................................... Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative ............................................................................................. ................... 190,000,000 Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative. \u2014The Committee in- cludes $190,000,000 within the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program for the EHE Initiative, an increase of $85,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. Funds are distributed to high-need jurisdictions to increase linkage, engagement, and retention in care with the goal of increas-ing viral suppression among people living with HIV. Ryan White Part A Formula Disparities. \u2014The Committee directs HRSA to take action to revise and improve the funding formula disparities under Part A of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. Funding allocations utilized under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 are largely based on a formula which considers the place of residence of persons at the time of ini-tial diagnosis when making formula-based grants. Under current law, if a person diagnosed with HIV in one area of the country moves to another part of the country, the funding for the case is not transferred to the new location. Therefore, the Committee di-rects HRSA to develop methods for calculating RWHAP formula funds to reflect the number of persons living with HIV in eligible jurisdictions, as well as other factors that reflect variability in funds and other resources. Additionally, HRSA should review their methods for awarding supplemental funds to effectively and accu-rately address the need for RWHAP Part A funds among eligible jurisdictions and report their findings back to the Committee with-in 180 days of enactment of this Act. HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $129,093,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 147,093,000 Change from ......................................................... +18,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +11,000,000 The Health Care Systems Bureau supports national activities that enhance health care delivery in the U.S., including maintain-ing a national system to allocate and distribute donor organs to in-dividuals awaiting transplant; building an inventory of cord blood units; maintaining a national system for the recruitment of bone VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul the 340B drug discount program; and op- erating a national toll-free poison control hotline. Organ Transplantation The Committee includes $34,049,000 for the Organ Transplan- tation program, $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Maximizing Deceased Donor Organ Recovery, Acceptance, and Utilization. \u2014The Committee supports swift implementation of the CMS final rule for Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) Con-ditions for Coverage (CMS-3380-F), including efforts to decertify underperforming OPOs. OPO failures are disproportionately borne by patients of color, which means OPO reform is an urgent health equity issue. The Committee believes swift and effective implemen-tation of the Final Rule is a first step toward ensuring OPOs per-form their public duties to secure more organs in an inclusive and equitable manner. The Committee supports regulatory and enforce-ment efforts to minimize excessive and frivolous expenses reim-bursed by Medicare, including the CMS proposed rule on Medicare reimbursement for organ acquisition costs (CMS-1752-P). The Committee also encourages HHS to make all efforts to promote competition for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Net-work (OPTN) contract, and to use the announced movement of the Division of Transplantation to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health to facilitate coordinated organ donation reforms. Reimbursement of Travel and Subsistence Expenses Toward Liv- ing Organ Donation Program. \u2014The Committee includes $18,800,000, an increase of $12,800,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest, for the Living Organ Donation Program. The Committee supports the expansion of this program to reimburse a comprehen-sive range of living donor expenses for the greatest possible num-ber of donors, including lost wages, childcare, eldercare, similar ex-penses for donor caretakers, and removing other disincentives to donation. The Committee supports significant expansion of income eligibility for the program to allow as many donors as possible to qualify and to ensure that financial reimbursement and monetary exchange take place outside of the organ donor-organ recipient re-lationship to the greatest extent possible. National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI) The Committee includes $20,266,000 for the NCBI, an increase of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The NCBI program supports cord blood banks to build an inventory of the highest quality cord blood units for transplantation. The National Cord Blood Inventory program builds a genetically and ethnically diverse inventory of high-quality umbilical cord blood for transplantation. The Committee applauds HRSA for the growth of the number of units collected and main-tained under the NCBI. C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation The Committee includes $33,009,000 for the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation program, an increase of $2,000,000 above the fis-cal year 2021 level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 program supports coordinating the procurement of bone marrow and and umbilical cord blood units for transplantation. The Committee continues to support cell transplantation using bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, and cord blood. The Committee appreciates HRSA's efforts to increase the diversity of the volunteer registry and has provided funding above the budget request to significantly reduce barriers to transplant for patients. This includes increasing targeted donor recruitment efforts, inter-vening with community referring physicians upon patient diagnosis to accelerate the path to transplant, and propelling innovation to improve outcomes and establish new treatment options to ensure a matched donor for all searching patients, regardless of their ra-cial/ethnic background, socioeconomic status, age, ancestry, or any other individually defining characteristic. The highest priority should be given to providing immediate and free testing of patients' cellular markers to quickly determine if a there is an available matched donor. Eliminating these barriers would allow therapies for patients to be delivered on time and to provide equal and suc-cessful outcomes for all. Office of Pharmacy Affairs (OPA) The Committee includes $17,238,000 for OPA, $7,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. OPA administers the 340B drug pricing pro-gram, which was designed to help safety net providers maintain, improve, and expand patient access to health care services. The 340B program has lowered the cost of outpatient drugs to health clinics and nonprofit and public hospitals that serve a dispropor-tionate share of low-income and rural patients. These entities pro-vide additional services and benefits to their communities with the savings realized. Funding will support implementation of 340B Program statutory obligations, oversight of participating manufac-turers and covered entities, operational improvements, and in-creased efficiencies using information technology. 340B Drug Discount Program. \u2014The Committee recognizes that the 340B program is a critical lifeline to safety net providers, in-cluding Community Health Centers. Health Centers are model stewards of the program and reinvest 340B savings to ''stretch scarce Federal resources as far as possible, reaching more eligible patients and providing more comprehensive services'', as Congress intended. The Committee is pleased that HRSA sent letters to six pharmaceutical companies on May 17, 2021, determining that on-going actions by the companies have resulted in overcharges to 340B covered entities. Furthermore, the Committee notes that HRSA articulated that continued failure to provide the 340B price to covered entities utilizing contract pharmacies may result in Civil Monetary Penalties, as described in the final Civil Monetary Pen-alty rule. The Committee encourages HRSA to continue to use its authority and any available measures, including the imposition of civil penalties, where appropriate, to hold those drug manufactur- ers in violation of the law directly accountable. The Committee di-rects HRSA to provide a report no later than 120 days after enact-ment of this Act on actions taken to safeguard covered entities' lawful access to discounted drugs. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul The Committee is aware that in 2011, GAO issued a report out- lining five recommendations for HRSA to improve performance and accountability within the 340B program. The Committee commends HRSA for implementing three of those recommendations and di-rects HRSA to report to the Committee within 120 days of enact-ment of this Act on plans to implement the remaining two rec-ommendations, which focus on clarifying eligibility criteria for 340B patients and providers. The Committee also directs GAO to update the 2011 report on the performance of the 340B program. Poison Control Centers The Committee includes $26,846,000 for Poison Control Centers, an increase of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Poison Control Cen-ters program supports a national network of centers that prevent and treat poison exposures by providing cost effective, quality health care advice to the public and health care providers. Hansen's Disease Program The Committee includes $13,706,000 for the Hansen's Disease Program, $122,000 for Hansen's Disease Buildings and Facilities, and $1,857,000 for Payments to Hawaii for Treatment of Hansen's Disease. These funding levels are the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted levels and the amounts requested in the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The programs support inpatient, outpatient, long- term care, as well as training and research in Baton Rouge, Lou-isiana; a residential facility at Carville, Louisiana; 11 outpatient clinic sites in the continental U.S. and Puerto Rico; repair and maintenance of buildings at the Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Center; and medical care and treatment of persons with Hansen's disease in hospital and clinic facilities at Kalaupapa, Molokai, and Honolulu, Hawaii. RURAL HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $329,519,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 400,209,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +70,690,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy's programs provide funding to improve access, quality, and coordination of care in rural communities; for research on rural health issues; for technical assistance and recruitment of health care providers; for screening activities for individuals affected by the mining, transport, and processing of uranium; for the outreach and treatment of coal min-ers and others with occupation-related respiratory and pulmonary impairments; and for the expansion of telehealth services. Rural Health Outreach Programs The Committee includes $90,000,000 for Rural Health Outreach Programs, an increase of $7,500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program supports projects that demonstrate new and innova-tive modes of outreach in rural areas, such as integration and co-ordination of health services. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Obstetrics Management Strategies (RMOMS). \u2014The Committee recommendation includes $10,400,000 for RMOMS, an increase of $5,400,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. RMOMS supports grants to improve access to and continuity of maternal and obstetrics care in rural communities by increasing the delivery of and access to preconception, pregnancy, labor and delivery, and postpartum services, as well as developing sustain-able financing models for the provision of maternal and obstetrics care. Rural Health Research and Policy Development The Committee includes $11,576,000 for Rural Health Research and Policy Development, an increase of $500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Funding supports the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy's activi-ties to analyze, advise the Secretary, and provide information to the public regarding issues that affect the availability, access to, and quality of health care in rural areas. Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants The Committee includes $79,009,000 for Rural Hospital Flexi- bility Grants, $23,400,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $21,500,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. These programs support States to assist small and critical access rural hospitals to remain economically viable and to provide high-quality care. Small Rural Hospital Improvement Program (SHIP). \u2014The Com- mittee recommendation includes $23,242,000 for SHIP, an increase of $2,300,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Rural Emergency Hospital Technical Assistance Program. \u2014The Committee includes $10,000,000 within the total for Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants to establish the Rural Emergency Hospital Tech-nical Assistance Program. This program will provide technical as-sistance from existing State Flexibility Programs and other stake-holders to assist facilities in the implementation of the new Rural Emergency Hospital model. Rural Provider Modernization Technical Assistance Program. \u2014 The Committee includes $5,000,000 within the total for Rural Hos-pital Flexibility Grants to establish the Rural Provider Moderniza-tion Technical Assistance Program. This program will provide tech-nical assistance to hospitals and other health care providers to im-plement sustainable models of care that address social deter-minants of health and health equity. Rural Provider Modernization Grants. \u2014The Committee includes $4,000,000 within the total for Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants to establish the Rural Provider Modernization Grants program. This program will make grants to support hospitals, public health de-partments, clinics, and community-based organizations to plan and implement emerging, sustainable models of care. State Offices of Rural Health The Committee includes $13,000,000 for State Offices of Rural Health, $500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 2022 budget request. HRSA supports the establishment and operation of State offices of rural health to strengthen rural health care delivery system. Black Lung Clinics The Committee includes $12,190,000 for Black Lung Clinics, an increase of $690,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program funds clinics that treat respiratory and pulmonary diseases of ac-tive and retired coal miners, steel mill workers, agricultural work-ers, and others with occupationally-related respiratory and pul-monary impairments. Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program (RESEP) The Committee includes $2,734,000 for the RESEP program, an increase of $900,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program pro-vides grants for the education, prevention, and early detection of radiogenic cancers and diseases resulting from exposure to ura-nium during mining and milling at nuclear test sites. Telehealth The Committee includes $39,000,000 for Telehealth, an increase of $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $2,500,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Funds sup-port the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth, which promotes the effective use of technologies to improve access to health services for people who are isolated from health care and to provide dis-tance education for health professionals. Telehealth Centers of Excellence. \u2014The Committee includes $7,500,000 for Telehealth Centers of Excellence, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. Grantees ex-amine the efficacy of telehealth services in rural and urban areas and serve as a national clearinghouse for telehealth research and resources. The Centers of Excellence serve to promote the adoption of telehealth programs across the country by validating technology, establishing training protocols, and by providing a comprehensive template for States to integrate telehealth into their State health provider network. Additional funding for the Centers of Excellence will support the development of models of care and best practices for the expansion of telemental health. Urban Focused Telehealth Network Grant Program. \u2014The Com- mittee believes that a fundamental element to ensuring our health care system is prepared for pandemic events is the development of robust telehealth services and integrated systems that can provide a continuum of care across State and regional lines. This is espe-cially true in the nation's urban areas, where a pandemic event has the potential to disproportionately impact and overwhelm the health care and delivery system. The Committee believes increased investments in urban telehealth services could have a tremendous impact on the health and well-being of the nation's most vulnerable citizens and medically underserved populations, especially during times of national public health emergencies. The Committee en-courages HRSA to establish a pilot program to expand academic VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul system telehealth programs aimed at addressing the health inequities of urban populations. Rural Health Residency Program The Committee includes $12,700,000 for the Rural Health Resi- dency Program, an increase of $2,200,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. This program funds physician residency training programs that support physician workforce expansion in rural areas. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the challenges in ac- cess to care faced by Americans in rural areas, particularly when they require specialty care. The Committee commends the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy for its efforts to expand the physician workforce in rural areas and supports continuation and expansion of the program to develop new rural residency programs, or Rural Training Tracks (RTTs). This Committee encourages HRSA to ex-pand the current program to include RTTs in obstetrics and gyne-cology, as women in rural communities are more likely to begin prenatal care late and are more likely to experience maternal mor-tality and severe maternal morbidity. The Committee requests a report in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on the progress made to date and efforts to expand RTTs in obstetrics and gynecology. Rural Communities Opioids Response The Committee includes $140,000,000 to continue the Rural Communities Opioids Response program, an increase of $30,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $25,000,000 below the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Com-mittee recognizes the devastating impact the opioid epidemic has had on rural communities and how the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the opioid crisis. The Committee expands funding to sup-port treatment for and prevention of substance use disorders, in-cluding opioid abuse, focusing on rural communities with the high-est risk for substance use disorders. Within the funding provided, the Committee includes $10,000,000 to continue the three Rural Centers of Excellence, as established by Public Law 115-245 and continued in Public Law 116-94. FAMILY PLANNING Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $286,479,000 Budget fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 400,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +113,521,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +60,000,000 The Committee includes $400,000,000 for the Family Planning program, $113,521,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $60,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. In addition, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $50,000,000 in funding to support emergency needs of the Family Planning pro-gram due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. The Family Planning program administers Title X of the Public Health Service Act. This program plays a vital role not only in en-suring access to affordable contraceptive education, services, and supplies, but also in STD prevention, screening, and treatment; VerDate Sep 11 2014 cancer screenings; first-line infertility services; and other community and health care services. The Committee directs the Secretary to ensure that grantees cer- tify that they: (1) provide medically accurate and complete coun-seling, including referral as requested, on all matters; (2) shall not condition the receipt of Title X-supported services on patients re-maining sexually abstinent until marriage; and (3) will not make any appointments or referrals for patients that are contrary to the patient's wishes. The bill requires that all recipients of funds under this heading offer services consistent with the best available evi-dence-based standards, including the Quality Family Planning guidelines from the CDC and the Office of Population Affairs (OPA). Telehealth Guidance. \u2014The Committee recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the importance of access to telehealth services across the health care system, including for Title X providers and patients. The Committee urges the OPA to release telehealth guidance and best practices for Title X projects that reiterate the importance of telehealth in providing quality family planning services. Ensuring Health Equity .\u2014The Committee recognizes that the Title X program remains an important component of the health care safety net and is essential to addressing health inequities. Building a more inclusive Title X program requires focusing on grantmaking that will continue this work. Recommendations for Quality Family Planning Services .\u2014The Committee directs the Secretary to begin the process of revising ''Providing Quality Family Planning Services,'' evidence-based rec-ommendations from the CDC and OPA that were last updated in 2017. Revisions should incorporate new evidence and support holis-tic reproductive and sexual health needs. The Committee requests a briefing on the status of this process no later than 180 days of enactment of this Act. Estimated Need for Services .\u2014The Committee requests the Sec- retary conduct a study, within 270 days of enactment of this Act, reflecting the current estimated need for Title X services and cost required to provide such updating the 2016 study published in the American Journal of Public Health. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $155,300,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 536,407,000 Change from ......................................................... +381,107,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +368,436,000 Program management supports the cost of Federal staff and re- lated activities to coordinate, direct, and manage the programs of HRSA. HRSA Chief Dental Officer .\u2014The Committee is disturbed to learn that despite its directive in House Report (116-450) to have HRSA ensure that the Chief Dental Officer (CDO) is functioning at an executive level authority with resources and staff to oversee and lead all oral health programs and initiatives across HRSA, no such authority has been delegated. The Committee directs HRSA to re-store the authority of HRSA CDO with executive level authority VerDate Sep 11 2014 oversee and lead HRSA dental programs and ini- tiatives as well as have a role within oral health across the agency. The CDO is also expected to serve as the agency representative on oral health issues to international, national, State, and/or local gov-ernment agencies, universities, and oral health stakeholder organi-zations. The Committee requests an update as part of the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on how the CDO is serving as the agency representative on oral health issues to inter-national, national, State and/or local government agencies, univer-sities, and oral health stakeholder organizations. Action for Dental Health .\u2014With the enactment of the Action for Dental Health Act of 2018, the Committee encourages HRSA to ex-pand oral health grants for innovative programs under PHS Act Section 340G (42 USC Section 256g) to include Action for Dental Health activities. The Action for Dental Health program helps re-duce barriers to dental care through oral health education, preven-tion, and the establishment of dental homes for underserved popu-lations. Oral Health Literacy .\u2014The Committee includes $500,000 to con- tinue the development of an oral health awareness and education campaign across relevant HRSA divisions, including the Health Centers Program, Oral Health Workforce, Maternal and Child Health, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, and Rural Health. The Committee directs HRSA to identify oral health literacy strategies that are evidence-based and focused on oral health care prevention and education, including prevention of oral disease such as early childhood and other caries, periodontal disease, and oral cancer. The Committee urges HRSA to ensure that the Chief Dental Offi-cer plays a key role in the design, monitoring, oversight, and imple-mentation of this project. Targeted Investments in Impoverished Areas .\u2014The Committee supports targeted investments in impoverished areas, particularly in persistent poverty counties and in other high-poverty census tracts. The Committee directs HRSA to develop and implement measures to increase the share of investments its programs in per-sistent poverty counties, high-poverty areas, and any other impov-erished communities that HRSA determines to be appropriate areas to target. The Committee appreciates the report HRSA pro-vided in response to the Committee's request in House Report 116- 450 and directs the Department to provide an update to the Com-mittee within 180 days of enactment of this Act on how HRSA is carrying out this directive. Community Project Funding The Committee includes $367,415,000 for projects financing the construction and renovation (including equipment) of health care and other facilities and for one-time grants supporting other health-related activities. The budget request does not include fund-ing for this purpose. The Committee includes $4,000,000 within this total for agency administrative expenses.

This program pro-vides compensation for individuals with vaccine-associated injuries or deaths. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 FUND Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $0 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 5,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +5,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Committee includes $5,000,000 for administrative costs asso- ciated with the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), an increase of $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The CICP provides benefits to individuals who are seriously injured as a result of a vaccination, medication, device, or other item rec-ommended to diagnose, prevent or treat a declared pandemic, epi-demic or security threat. C ENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $7,874,804,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 10,571,419,000 Change from ......................................................... +2,696,615,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +1,018,900,000 The Committee recommendation for the Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention (CDC) program level includes $9,612,761,000 in discretionary budget authority, $55,358,000 in mandatory funds under the terms of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, and $903,300,000 in transfers from the Prevention and Public Health (PPH) Fund. CDC's mission is to protect Americans from health, safety, and security threats, which it accomplishes by supporting core public health functions at State, local, and tribal health departments, de-tecting and responding to new and emerging health threats, pro-moting health and safety, and providing leadership in the public health workforce. IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $821,005,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 950,930,000 Change from ......................................................... +129,925,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +5,000,000 The Committee recommendation includes $531,580,000 in discre- tionary budget authority and $419,350,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. Immunization cooperative agreements are awarded to State and local public health departments for planning, developing, and con-ducting childhood, adolescent, and adult immunization programs, including enhancement of the vaccine delivery infrastructure. CDC directly maintains a stockpile of vaccines, supports consolidated purchase of vaccines for State and local health agencies, and con-ducts surveillance, investigations, and research into the safety and efficacy of new and presently used vaccines. Within the total for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, the Committee recommends the following amounts: VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 226,358,000 Adult Hepatitis B Vaccination .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the rate of adult hepatitis B vaccination, as low rates of vac-cine coverage among adults represent a missed opportunity. The Committee urges CDC to develop a plan to achieve adult hepatitis B vaccination goals. Cost Estimates .\u2014The Committee looks forward to reviewing the fiscal year 2023 report on estimated funding needs of the Section 317 Immunization Program and urges that the report be updated and submitted not later than February 1, 2022. The updated report should include an estimate of optimum State and local operations funding, as well as a discussion of the role of the 317 Program, as coverage for vaccination under public and private resources con-tinues to evolve. The fiscal year 2023 report should include specific information on the estimated cost to fully address evidence-based public health strategies that could be funded through CDC to im-prove coverage for human papillomavirus and influenza. COVID-19 Antibody Testing .\u2014The Committee is aware that there is some concern that antibody or serologic testing has been underutilized in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and that CDC guidance on the use of these tests may warrant further re-view. The Food and Drug Administration has authorized numerous antibody tests. These tests can be deployed to inform seroprevalence surveys and to improve patient care. The Com-mittee encourages the use of antibody tests, where appropriate, and requests an update on this topic in the fiscal year 2023 Con-gressional Budget Justification. Enhancing 317 Immunization Program .\u2014The Committee in- cludes an increase of $99,925,000 to enhance adult immunization. The COVID-19 pandemic illuminated a variety of gaps in our pub-lic health capacity, including the need for a comprehensive adult immunization program. This expansion holds the potential to meet longstanding issues of inequity in protection from vaccine-prevent-able diseases and to address vaccine hesitancy. Immunization Rates .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the marked decline in routine childhood and adolescent vaccines as a result of the pandemic. The Committee urges CDC to engage pro-viders, health care stakeholders, educators, community organiza-tions, and parents/guardians about the importance of ensuring that children and adolescents visit their primary care provider and re-ceive their routinely recommended vaccinations, including HPV vaccination. In addition, the Committee urges that immunization reminder recall is prioritized. The Committee requests a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act regarding the strategy and plan for the public awareness campaign to increase childhood and adult routine vaccination rates and reduce barriers to routine vac-cinations including, but not limited to vaccine hesitancy. This re-port should include information on immunization rates of all age groups and provide disaggregated data on vaccines rates to deter-mine disparities across race, ethnicity, sex, age, and zip code, as available, for both routine and COVID-19 vaccinations. In addition, VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 the report shall address actions taken and plans to strengthen awareness, understanding, and trust in vaccines. Improving Immunization Information System Infrastructure and Data .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the state of interoper- ability across Immunization Information Systems (IIS), especially as vaccine administration information becomes more critical with respect to stopping the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important that IIS across the country interoperate with each other, are capable of transmitting information to public health authorities, including CDC, and that each IIS has the capacity to intake data and satisfy bidirectional queries. The Committee includes $5,000,000 for CDC to consult with stakeholders to outline the steps toward a more ro-bust common core data set for collection of vaccine administration information and to initiate a national framework that includes the minimum functional standards for IIS to interoperate. Influenza Planning and Response .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $25,000,000 to enhance CDC's influenza activities, in-cluding expanding vaccine effectiveness monitoring and evaluation, and increasing influenza vaccine acceptance by removing barriers to vaccination and promoting vaccination coverage. Influenza Vaccine .\u2014The Committee encourages CDC to consider including vaccines produced through recombinant DNA technology in addition to traditionally-produced vaccines in future solicitations to facilitate the competitive process for all vaccine manufacturers. Respiratory Syncytial Virus .\u2014The Committee applauds the ongo- ing development of novel immunizations to provide protection for all infants against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) disease. Cur-rently, there is no licensed immunization that can protect all in-fants from RSV. The Committee encourages CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to review any novel immunization, including monoclonal antibodies, that holds the promise of broad protection for all infants and public health benefit to children, for inclusion on the Child and Adolescent Immuniza-tion Schedule and in the Vaccines for Children program. Shared Clinical Decision Making .\u2014The Committee encourages CDC to work with health professional organizations to utilize deci-sion making support tools to promote recent changes made to the Evaluation and Management office visit Current Procedural Termi-nology codes which allow for the use of ''Total Time'' or the use of ''Medical Decision Making'' as key contributing factors, for the basis of payment for vaccination counseling and administration. This will ensure that medical professionals and patients are in-formed and have a clear understanding of and continued access to the immunizations they should receive across the life course. Vulnerable Populations .\u2014The Committee commends the CDC ACIP recommendations and the Office of Civil Rights for its contin-ued vigilance regarding potential discrimination in vulnerable pop-ulations during the COVID-19 pandemic and for working collabo-ratively with States to ensure State guidelines reflect best practices for serving individuals with disabilities and the elderly. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul , SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES , AND TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $1,314,056,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 1,501,556,000 Change from ......................................................... +187,500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +81,000,000 CDC provides national leadership and support for prevention re- search and the development, implementation, and evaluation of evidence-based HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and tuberculosis (TB) prevention programs serving persons affected by, or at risk for, these infections. Activities include sur-veillance, epidemiologic and laboratory studies, and prevention ac-tivities. CDC provides funds to State, local, and tribal health de-partments and community-based organizations to develop and im-plement integrated community prevention plans. Within the total for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Domestic HIV/AIDS Congenital Syphilis. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the massive interruptions in sexually transmitted infection care and preventative services due to the pandemic. The Committee urges priority be given to jurisdictions experiencing the highest preva-lence of congenital syphilis (CS) cases. The Committee urges CDC to prioritize CS programming and multi-point testing of pregnant women in community organizations, and STD and drug addiction clinics. Hepatitis B. \u2014The Committee urges CDC to maintain its invest- ment in hepatitis B grants to support community-based organiza-tions that are vital to serving disproportionately impacted commu-nities to help ensure these groups receive the necessary testing and linkage to care. CDC is also urged to expand the viral hepatitis dis-ease tracking and surveillance capabilities of the States to permit an effective targeting of resources and evaluation of program effec-tiveness. HIV Initiative. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $100,000,000 for the third year of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative to advance the four key strategies: diagnose, treat, pre-vent, and respond. The Committee recognizes that sexually trans-mitted diseases are associated with increased risk of HIV acquisi-tion. The Committee commends CDC for including dedicated fund-ing within this initiative for sexually transmitted infection clinics. Infectious Diseases and the Opioid Epidemic. \u2014The Committee in- cludes an increase of $56,500,000 to expand activities to target the infectious disease consequences of the public health crisis involving injection drug use, including expanding the implementation of and access to high quality syringe services programs nationwide. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $16,000,000 to bolster school capacity for evidence-based sexual health education, and access to sexual health services and safe and supportive environments. Sexually Transmitted Infections. \u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $5,000,000 to address the high rates of sexually trans-mitted infections (STIs). The Committee recognizes that direct funding to State and local health departments is critical to address STIs and other infectious diseases. In addition, the Committee notes the investment of more than $1,000,000,000 from the Amer-ican Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) to bolster support and enhance the disease intervention specialist workforce nationwide to respond to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Tuberculosis. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 to enable CDC, along with State and local entities, to provide TB screening, identification, treatment and prevention services, and to restore funding to the TB Trials Consortium. The Committee is concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant impacts on individuals with TB and on State and local TB programs, in-cluding delays in care for people with TB and postponement of identification and treatment of individuals with latent TB infection, stalling efforts to eliminate TB in the U.S. Viral Hepatitis. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 to enhance efforts to eliminate the public health threat of viral hepatitis. EMERGING AND ZOONOTIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $648,272,000 Budget fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 726,272,000 Change from ......................................................... +78,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +48,000,000 The Committee recommendation includes $674,272,000 in discre- tionary appropriations and $52,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. Programs funded under Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Dis- eases (EZID) support the prevention and control of infectious dis-eases through surveillance, outbreak investigation and response, research, and prevention. Within the total for EZID, the Committee recommends the fol- lowing amounts: Budget \u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $5,000,000 and recognizes the value of the Advanced Mo-lecular Detection program through its crosscutting and collabo-rative work that introduces and helps establish biotechnology-fo-cused innovation to public health programs across CDC and in State and local health departments. The Committee is aware that at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were only a few pub-lic health laboratories capable of performing the necessary ad-vanced molecular detection tests. The Committee requests a status update on the capabilities at public health laboratories in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Antibiotic Resistance. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000. The Committee recognizes the importance of effectively combatting antibiotic resistant bacteria as part of CDC's broader efforts to mitigate the clinical and public health impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, the Committee recognizes the importance of addressing the problem of antibiotic-resistant bac-teria through a ''One Health'' approach and by tracking resistance through local, regional, national, and global surveillance. The Com-mittee encourages CDC to competitively award research activities that address aspects of antibiotic resistance related to ''One Health,'' including global surveillance and research and develop-ment for new tools to counter antibiotic resistance among entities, including public academic medical centers, veterinary schools with agriculture extension services, and public health departments whose proposals are in line with CDC's strategy for addressing an-tibiotic resistant bacteria. Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity Awards. \u2014The Committee urges CDC to work with States to prioritize funding to local health departments based on factors such as population size, disease bur-den, and other public health metrics to promote equitable funding distribution. Harmful Algal Blooms. \u2014The Committee includes funding to sup- port monitoring and health reporting concerns related to harmful algal blooms (HABs). The Committee urges CDC to continue work to understand and prevent illnesses associated with affected waters, with a focus on freshwater and the related dangers to drinking water supplies. CDC has a unique role in better under-standing the intersection of public health and environmental im-pacts of HABs using a One Health approach to: (1) increase out-reach efforts to States and local public health officials to use these monitoring and reporting systems; and (2) work with a variety of agencies that currently collaborate on HABs such as the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act Interagency Working Group and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The scope of future research may expand to include improving labora-tory methods for HAB-related toxins in biological specimens and clinical diagnostic methods to identify HAB-related symptoms and illnesses, optimizing emergency response capacities, and identifying and addressing the impacts of harmful algal toxins to humans. There is an important nexus between freshwater and health through drinking water and recreation, and CDC is encouraged to expand their work regionally to understand HABs impact on our nation's largest fresh bodies of water. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $10,000,000 to help address the critical unmet needs in the nation's food safety system, in part through programs that enhance State and local public health capacity to support vital national surveil-lance, improve foodborne outbreak detection and investigations, en-hance food safety prevention efforts, and maintain vigilance for emerging threats to our nation's food supply. Live Animal Imports. \u2014The Committee is aware that importation of live animals, particularly dogs, has increased substantially dur-ing the COVID-19 pandemic and is concerned by instances in which live animals have been held at ports of entry for hours or days. The Committee emphasizes the importance of prioritizing in-spection of live cargo by CDC personnel to ensure that all due standards of animal welfare are maintained and urges CDC to adopt policies limiting the maximum amount of time between the arrival of cargo containing live animals and inspection to the short-est practicable period. Lyme Disease. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 to support efforts to develop improved diagnostics with appropriate sensitivity and specificity for the detection of subclin-ical or low-level infection for use in disease eradication, and sur-veillance networks so that disease burden can be more accurately determined; and to bolster critical prevention and provider and public awareness efforts. Furthermore, the Committee encourages CDC to reevaluate the practice of utilizing the classification of States as high or low incidence as surveillance criteria. Mosquito-Borne Diseases. \u2014The COVID-19 pandemic response re- quired many State and local health departments to redirect staff from other vital tasks such as mosquito control-related activities, resulting in less capacity to surveil and mitigate potential mos-quito-borne public health threats. The Committee is concerned about the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, such as Zika, and en-courages the use of the Mosquito Abatement for Safety and Health Program to provide grants and technical assistance to States and political subdivisions to prevent and control mosquito-borne dis-eases. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. \u2014The Committee commends CDC its recent progress in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) medical edu-cation and in its participation in the Interagency Working Group for ME/CFS. Mycotic Diseases. \u2014The Committee provides an increase of $2,000,000 in Emerging Infectious Diseases for mycotic diseases, including, but not limited to, surveillance and prevention, building capacity in the State and local health departments, cooperative agreements, education of the public and healthcare providers, and laboratory support. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on how this funding is being utilized. National Healthcare Safety Network. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 and recognizes the value of this system for healthcare quality measurement and improvement. The Com-mittee supports the modernization of the system's infrastructure resulting in increased timeliness and accuracy, reduced burden on healthcare facilities, and the ability to collect urgent data. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Museums. \u2014The Committee notes that the na- tion's natural history museums provide an unparalleled resource for studying zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19. These museums hold millions of animal samples collected over decades from across the globe, offer deep and broad scientific expertise, and are unique-ly positioned to assist in preparing for and predicting the next pan-demic-causing viruses. The Committee encourages increased utili-zation and support of this largely untapped resource. One Health. \u2014The Committee understands that despite unprece- dented efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic, many questions remain about the prevention of future pandemics, especially those caused by zoonotic disease transmission. The Committee supports a One Health approach that recognizes that human, animal, and environmental health are fundamentally interconnected. Prion. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000 and recognizes the critical work of the National Prion Disease Pathol-ogy Surveillance Center. The workload related to chronic wasting disease in deer and elk populations in the U.S. is in addition to the Center's ongoing efforts related to human prion diseases that in-cludes research, surveillance, tissue banking, and technical and supportive assistance to providers to families. Quarantine. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $30,000,000 to enhance programs to protect the U.S. from infectious diseases, including expanded coverage at the most heavily trafficked airports and land border crossings and increased capacity for health screenings. Vector-Borne Diseases. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $15,000,000 to address the steady increase in the incidence of vec-tor-borne disease and to sustain the Regional Centers of Excellence program, including State-level surveillance and research being con-ducted by partners. The Committee encourages CDC to examine options to provide greater coverage of the Northwest region for vec-tor-borne disease resources. Wastewater Surveillance. \u2014The Committee commends CDC's work implementing the National Wastewater Surveillance System with partners at State health labs and academic institutions to bet-ter track COVID-19 and understands the important role waste-water testing plays for our nation's biosecurity.

VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Awareness for Young Women. \u2014The Committee in- cludes an increase of $1,000,000 to expand awareness and preven-tion efforts for young women. Chronic Disease Education and Awareness. \u2014The Committee in- cludes an increase of $3,500,000 to expand public health education and awareness activities that help to improve surveillance, diag-nosis, and proper treatment for chronic diseases. This competitive grant program expands and advances CDC's work with stake-holders on education, outreach, and public awareness activities for a variety of chronic diseases for which there is a clear disparity in public and professional awareness that are not already specified under CDC in this report. Chronic Kidney Disease. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 for a public health approach to kidney disease screening for early detection and treatment and prevalence surveillance, so that the progression of kidney disease can be slowed and complica-tions can be reduced, which will dramatically improve the quality of life of patients. Colorectal Cancer .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 to expand efforts to address disparities in colorectal cancer screening rates and to improve access to underserved popu-lations. Diabetes .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 to prevent diabetes and its complications, and to reduce inequities through prevention strategies, translational research, and edu-cation. In addition, the Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 for the Diabetes Prevention Program to expand efforts of this public-private partnership that provides diabetes prevention for people with prediabetes. Early Child Care Collaboratives .\u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $1,000,000 for the expansion of the core program to at least one new State and to enhance efforts to address food insecu-rity. The Committee is aware that COVID-19 escalated food inse-curity for children and families and recognizes the early care and education setting is important for promoting healthy habits in young children and ensuring that they have access to nutritious food. The Committee includes funding for the National Early Child Care Collaboratives Program to support technical assistance to States for integrating best practices into existing State and local systems for early care and education, as well as direct provider- level training in implementation of comprehensive programming to support healthy eating and physical activity best practices. The Committee encourages the program to serve a mix of rural, subur-ban and urban areas, including areas with high childhood obesity rates. Early Detection of Brain Aneurysms .\u2014The Committee recognizes that there are typically no warning signs or symptoms unless brain aneurysms rupture. Even when an aneurysm has ruptured, the symptoms are not widely known. The Committee encourages CDC to capture and disseminate information about best practices. Eating Disorders .\u2014The Committee encourages CDC to assist States in collecting data by including standard questions on unhealthy weight control practices for eating disorders, including binge eating, through the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Sys-tem and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Committee includes an increase of $2,500,000 for epilepsy. The Committee recognizes the opportunity to advance public and provider awareness and improve care for the epilepsy community through meaningful timely investment in successful public health activities. Excessive Alcohol Use Prevention .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000 to expand alcohol epidemiology capacity through improved data collection on excessive drinking and related harms in more States, and monitoring identifying strategies to re-duce youth exposure to alcohol and alcohol marketing. Farm-to-School .\u2014The Committee includes $2,000,000 within Nu- trition, Physical Activity, and Obesity to continue research and education activities related to farm-to-school programs that result in promoting healthy eating habits for students. Food Allergies .\u2014The Committee includes $2,000,000 for a school- based effort to address food allergies and reduce potentially fatal anaphylactic reactions. Heart Disease and Stroke .\u2014The Committee includes a total in- crease of $20,000,000 to address cardiovascular diseases. The Com-mittee includes an increase of $5,000,000 to support, strengthen, and expand evidence-based initiatives at the State, local, tribal, and territorial level. The Committee recognizes the vital impor-tance of addressing cardiovascular disease among women and un-derserved communities, communities of color, those communities with limited access to information about cardiovascular health dis-ease, and communities at risk for delaying regular monitoring of cardiovascular health as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee supports CDC's efforts to improve our understanding of the outcomes and health effects of COVID-19 infection, including cardiovascular disease. The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 for the WISEWOMAN program to be expanded to addi-tional States, growing the number of low-income, uninsured and underinsured women who are assessed and connected to resources. The Committee also includes an increase of $10,000,000 for the Million Hearts initiative to increase education and outreach about the importance of healthy behaviors, regular heart screenings, and prevention measures. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases .\u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $500,000 to support an initial pilot education and out-reach program targeted toward healthcare providers, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, and people with IBD-type symptoms, including those from minority populations, and focused on improv-ing remission rates by reducing the time to diagnosis and the start of effective treatments. Additionally, the Committee encourages CDC to collaborate with organizations that serve the IBD patient community in planning and executing this pilot. Interstitial Cystitis .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $400,000 for interstitial cystitis activities. Johanna's Law .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 for CDC's Inside Knowledge Campaign that raises awareness of the five main types of gynecological cancer: cervical, ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and vulvar. This campaign educates women of all ages, races, and ethnic groups, and healthcare pro-viders. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Cancer .\u2014The Committee remains concerned about the high morbidity and mortality of lung cancer. Early detection and treat-ment of lung cancer translates into higher survival rates. The Com-mittee encourages CDC to incorporate lung cancer screening awareness and referral into its tobacco prevention and control ac-tivities. Lupus .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000 for activities to advance public health knowledge about lupus, which will lead to improved care for those living with the disease. Multiple Myeloma .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the bur- den of multiple myeloma on patients and their caregivers. The Committee encourages CDC to increase outreach and education of myeloma among high-risk individuals especially among African Americans, Hispanics, and other communities of color. Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity .\u2014The Committee sup- ports CDC's efforts to protect the health of Americans at every stage of life by encouraging regular physical activity, good nutri-tion, and preventing adult and childhood obesity. The Committee is concerned that the eligibility for the High Obesity Program is limited to communities with high obesity rates solely among adults, without taking into account childhood obesity rates. This exclusion represents a missed opportunity to address the important public health problem of childhood obesity, which can lead to high blood pressure, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, fatty liver disease, psycho-logical problems and more. The Committee encourages CDC to con-sider including high childhood obesity rates in its eligibility criteria for the High Obesity Program. Oral Health .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 to expand support to State and territorial health departments in their efforts to reduce oral disease and improve oral health through effective interventions.

Prostate Cancer .\u2014The Committee supports CDC's efforts to in- crease the public's awareness of prostate cancer risks, screening, and treatment, and improve surveillance of this disease. The Com-mittee encourages CDC to increase outreach and education among high-risk men, especially African-American men. Psoriatic Disease .\u2014The Committee recognizes the value of the Public Health Agenda for Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis and its impact in interventions to address psoriatic disease over the past decade. Despite significant advancements in research, treatment options, and care approaches for this community, the Committee is concerned that many individuals, especially people of color, remain undertreated and are not achieving optimal health outcomes. The Committee encourages CDC to develop an updated public health agenda and action plan to be focused on addressing the systemic nature of the disease, unmet needs, heterogeneity of disease and treatment response, and diversity of diagnosis, care and outcomes. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Ethnic Approaches to Community Health .\u2014The Com- mittee includes a total increase of $10,000,000 to continue scaling this program to all States and territories, and support grantees in building capacity for collaboration and disseminating evidence- based strategies in communities. Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) is a vital initiative to help eliminate healthcare disparities in minority communities. The Committee's recommended level includes an increase of $5,000,000 for Good Health and Wellness in Indian Country. Safe Motherhood and Infant Health .\u2014The Committee includes a total increase of $56,000,000 for this portfolio of programs to im-prove the health of pregnant and postpartum individuals and their babies, including to reduce disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes. Building on the commitment made in FY 2021, the total funding allows for the expansion of Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs) and Perinatal Quality Collaboratives (PQCs) to all States and territories and for increased support to current States and territories, as well as increased support for other programs including Sudden Unexplained Infant Death (SUID). The Committee encourages CDC to help MMRCs build stronger data systems and improve data collection at the State level to create consistency in data collection, analysis, and report-ing across State MMRCs. This investment is necessary to provide accurate national statistics on U.S. maternal mortality rates and will inform data-driven actions to prevent these deaths. The Com-mittee requests a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act on barriers to effective and consistent data collection and opportu-nities to improve coordination among State MMRCs. PQCs improve maternal and neonatal outcomes using known prevention strate-gies such as reducing severe pregnancy complications associated with high blood pressure and hemorrhage. PQCs help to address the high incidence of maternal mortality, particularly among women of color, maternal opioid use disorder and neonatal absti-nence syndrome as a result of the opioid crisis, which has been ex-acerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee requests an update on the PQC program and challenges faced, including those created by the COVID-19 pandemic, within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Furthermore, little is known about the tragic, sudden, and unexpected deaths of young children because of variations in investigations and the way deaths are certified. The Committee urges CDC to facilitate data and analysis, including the expansion of the SUID and Sudden Death in the Young Case Registry, to im-prove SUID prevention strategies. Social Determinants of Health .\u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $150,000,000 for investments in social determinants of health (SDOH) to improve health equity. The Committee includes funding to expand activities to address SDOH in States, local, trib-al and territorial jurisdictions to improve outcomes among persons experiencing health disparities and inequalities, including, but not limited to, expanding and implementing Accelerator Plans, initi-ating a SDOH implementation program, providing technical assist-ance to communities and continuing to build the evidence base and advance data collection to better understand health disparities. So-cial Determinants Accelerator Plans should include a description of the health and social outcome objectives; identify populations that VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 from implementation of the plan, including Medicaid- eligible individuals; and identify non-governmental, private, or pub-lic health organizations and community organizations that would participate in the development of the plan. Grantees may use a portion of grant funding to convene government entities, public and private stakeholders, and to engage qualified research experts in developing Social Determinants Accelerator Plans. Tobacco .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $12,500,000 so that CDC and States can more robustly respond to the public health threat caused by youth use of e-cigarettes, enhance efforts to reduce tobacco use among disparate populations and in areas with high tobacco use rates and tobacco-related mortality, and ex-pand education efforts to reach youth influencers. Vision and Eye Health .\u2014The Committee is aware that vision im- pairments and eye disease contribute to or complicate many other serious and costly chronic health conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, injuries and death related to falling, depres-sion, and cognitive decline. State and community partnerships are essential in promoting messages of early detection and coordinating access to treatment to prevent eye disease from progressing to per-manent vision loss.

The Committee urges an expansive sickle cell surveillance program to better identify affected individuals, understand their health outcomes and comorbidities, and evaluate their utilization of the most effective and appropriate treatments to prevent complica-tions and risk factors that affect individuals living with the dis-ease. Cerebral Palsy .\u2014The Committee encourages CDC to explore cross-divisional funding opportunities, networks, data sets and sys-tems to accelerate data-driven public health research to improve Cerebral Palsy (CP) surveillance and develop increased under-standing of the mechanisms leading to earlier diagnosis and im-proved outcomes to reduce the public health burden of CP. The Committee also encourages CDC to conduct an updated study from the 2003 report on the healthcare and societal costs of CP in the U.S. Congenital Heart Defects .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000 for grants or cooperative agreements to provide tech-nical assistance to State and local agencies to complement intra-mural programs and to conduct applied research related to screen-ing, evaluation, diagnosis, results reporting, data collection, sur-veillance, intervention programs, systems, and follow-up of children identified through Critical Congenital Heart Defects screening to better understand the long-term outcomes and needs of this popu-lation. Early Hearing Detection and Intervention .\u2014The Committee is aware of the significant racial and ethnic disparities in care facing children with hearing loss, and the effect unaddressed congenital hearing loss has on communication skills, psychosocial develop-ment, educational progress, and language development. The Com-mittee encourages CDC to expand their work to improve surveil-lance of early hearing detection and intervention systems to ensure access to timely identification of congenital and acquired hearing loss and develop materials to enhance connection to follow up serv-ices among racial and ethnic minorities, and other medically under-served populations. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000. The Committee is concerned about the ris-ing trend of prenatal alcohol consumption and increased rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The Committee urges CDC to increase support to: expand prevention efforts to heighten awareness of FASD and the risks associated with prenatal alcohol exposure; and strengthen existing national community-based and professional FASD networks to expand access to diagnostic, treat-ment, intervention, and other essential services. Fragile X and Fragile X-Associated Disorders .\u2014The Committee commends CDC's efforts to identify and define the population im-pacted by fragile X (FX) and all conditions associated with the gene mutation with the goal of understanding the public health impact of these conditions. To help this effort, the Committee urges CDC to support additional strategies to promote earlier identification of children with FX. The Committee also urges CDC to work to en-sure underserved populations at risk of FX conditions are being properly diagnosed and are aware of medical services available. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Improving the Health of People with Intellectual Disabilities .\u2014 The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 for the expanded provision of year-round, grassroots activities in communities to cre-ate opportunities for health screenings and access to quality healthcare, and health and wellness programming for people with intellectual disabilities. These efforts enhance the lives of individ-uals while eliminating stigmas and stereotypes. Muscular Dystrophy .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 to enhance Muscular Dystrophy research and disease surveillance initiatives, including the Duchenne Muscular Dys-trophy Care Considerations. The Committee directs CDC to provide a report within 120 days of enactment of this Act describing the al-location for specific activities in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. The re-port should, to the extent practicable, identify program priorities, including an evaluation of the impact of the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Care Considerations across the country on patient out-comes and any remaining gaps, particularly in rural and under-served areas. CDC should also address the following three areas of unmet need: evaluating the differences in care and outcomes be-tween Certified Duchenne Care Centers (CDCC) and non-CDCC MD-STARnet data and other data sources; the availability of con- sistent and coordinated care for adults with Duchenne as they transition from pediatric care settings to adult care settings; and the impact of progressive disability on the mental health of pa-tients and their caregivers. The Committee encourages CDC to partner with stakeholder organizations to leverage additional knowledge and resources to advance this work. Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed Conditions Awareness Act (P.L. 110-374) .\u2014As a response to the growth in prenatal screening and testing, Congress passed this Act to ensure women receive ac-curate information on genetic testing, community support, and out-comes of care for their children when they receive a prenatal or postnatal diagnosis for Down syndrome or similar conditions. The Committee requests an update on the efforts to implement the Act in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Spina Bifida .\u2014The Committee is aware of a growing incidence of sudden death in the adult spina bifida population, and under-stands that there is a significant need to study this issue and to address the transitional and adult care needs of the growing, aging spina bifida community. Therefore, the Committee encourages CDC to use funding for the National Spina Bifida Program to support the continuation of the Spina Bifida Clinical Care Monitoring and Tracking Program, which works with the National Spina Bifida Registry, to guide the health care community in best treatment op-tions for people living with spina bifida; and to expand and mod-ernize data collection, including the National Spina Bifida Patient Registry and surveillance activities to allow for data collection from more clinics and individuals with spina bifida. PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENTIFIC SERVICES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $591,997,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 756,997,000 Change from +165,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +15,000,000 This account supports programs that provide leadership and training for the public health workforce, support infrastructure to modernize public health surveillance, promote and facilitate science standards and policies, and improve access to information on dis-ease outbreaks and other threats.

Community Health Workers. \u2014The Committee commends CDC for integrating community health workers into care teams, commu-nity-based organizations, and coordinated public health-led actions to manage COVID-19 among priority populations within commu-nities. The Committee urges CDC to continue this critical invest-ment by supporting, promoting and expanding State investments in the community health worker workforce in the COVID-19 response and long-term efforts to address the social determinants of health and achieve health equity in partnership with community health worker professional organizations. Disability Data. \u2014The Committee encourages CDC to ensure dis- ability data is included as a core demographic component across surveys and surveillance systems administered by the National Center for Health Statistics. The Committee encourages CDC to support and fund research focused on the community of people with disabilities as a whole. Familial Hypercholesterolemia. \u2014The Committee includes $100,000 to support public health efforts focused on this inherited genetic disorder to improve diagnosis and care delivery and prevent heart disease. National Center for Health Statistics. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $15,000,000 for the National Center for Health Sta-tistics, a component of our nation's public health infrastructure, to monitor the health of the American people and to make much-need-ed investments in the next generation of surveys and products. National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System. \u2014The Committee includes $5,000,000 within Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Informatics to continue efforts on the two initial conditions. Overdose and Suicide Data Collection. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes the importance of timely and accurate data to understand the incidence and prevalence of health outcomes to effectively respond to emerging trends, especially drug overdoses and suicides. Data on fatal overdoses and suicide become publicly available six months to over a year after they occur. These delays hinder the ability of com-munities to respond quickly to preventable deaths. The Committee directs CDC to evaluate its current process for fatal overdose, non- VerDate Sep 11 2014 suicide attempts/self-harm data collec- tion. The Committee further directs the CDC to develop rec-ommendations to reduce reporting lags while maintaining data ac-curacy, and to submit these recommendations to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Primary Immunodeficiencies. \u2014The Committee includes funding to continue the existing program of education and awareness re-lated to primary immunodeficiencies and to expand allowable use of funding to include genetic sequencing surveillance. This program has proven effective in identifying undiagnosed patients and link-ing them to centers of care. Public Health Data Modernization Initiative. \u2014The Committee initiated the funding for the Data Modernization Initiative (DMI) to create modern, integrated, and real-time public health surveil-lance with CDC, State, territorial, local and tribal partners in fiscal year 2020 and provided significant resources through annual and supplemental appropriations, including $500,000,000 in the Amer-ican Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2). The Committee directs CDC to cre-ate a standards-based, interoperable public health infrastructure where systems can communicate and share data seamlessly; ad-vance standards so that information can be stored and shared across systems and facilitate complete and timely reporting so that our public health system has essential data on race, ethnicity, pregnancy status, treatments, and co-morbidities that are critical for achieving equity in public health responses. The Committee urges CDC to consider innovative mechanisms to ensure States and local jurisdictions, where appropriate, have access to this funding to modernize their vital records data systems in accordance with the goals of the initiative. The Committee reiterates that the Na-tional Center for Health Statistics is to be fully integrated in the DMI. The Committee acknowledges the need for sustained funding for this public health infrastructure and thus, includes $150,000,000, an increase of $100,000,000, to continue to move from siloed and brittle public health data systems to connected, re-silient, adaptable, and sustainable systems to achieve real change. Essential to this significant effort are core data standards and sup-port to recruit and retain the data science workforce. This is a mas-sive undertaking by CDC, and it will only be successful with the commitment to improvement by the entire agency and active en-gagement with partners. Public Health Workforce. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $50,000,000 to aid in the rebuilding of the public health workforce. At this funding level, CDC will double the number of Epidemic In-telligence Service and Laboratory Leadership Service Fellows, en-suring the opportunity for placement of a fellow in every State. The Committee recognizes that a robust and well-trained public health workforce is critical to maintaining a highly effective public health infrastructure. Vital Statistics Reporting .\u2014The Committee encourages CDC to engage with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine to improve vital statistics and death reporting. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul ......................................................... $222,850,000 Budget fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 343,350,000 Change from ......................................................... +120,500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +10,500,000 The Committee recommendation includes $326,350,000 in discre- tionary appropriations and $17,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. Programs supported within Environmental Health conduct sur- veillance and data collection to detect and address emerging patho-gens and environmental toxins that pose significant challenges to public health, as well as determine whether and at what level of exposure these substances are harmful to humans. Within the total, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Environmental Health Laboratory ................................................................................................ ..................... $72,750,000 Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program ..................................................................................... 23,000,000 Newborn Screening /Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Diseases ...................................................... ........................... 5,000,000 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Registry. \u2014The Committee directs CDC to present a plan to the Committee within 90 days of enact-ment of this Act to enhance the oversight and advisory process for the National ALS Registry to increase transparency and better re-flect the needs of the ALS community. This plan should consider ways to translate Registry findings to human application that can lower the risks and disease burden of ALS, make disease reporting more representative, more accurate, and more inclusive, and in-clude a range of estimates rather than point estimates of ALS prev-alence. Equally important are updates to the survey process to en-sure the data they collect are impactful and respectful of partici-pant burden. Finally, the plan should ensure that the ALS commu-nity can view as much Registry information as possible without compromising the privacy of participants. Asthma. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $4,000,000 for the National Asthma Control Program to increase the number of States carrying out programmatic activities. The Committee recog-nizes that millions of people in the U.S. suffer from asthma, and that it disproportionately affects African American children. Childhood Lead Poisoning. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $11,000,000 to support the expansion of direct CDC assistance and funding to additional State and local public health depart-ments. The Committee believes that CDC's expertise and technical assistance can be a valuable asset. The Committee directs CDC to provide a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act on plans to make direct assistance and funding available to additional State VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul and local programs. Furthermore, the Committee encourages CDC to require that States receiving funding for lead prevention report all blood tests in a standardized format through the Nationally Notifiable Noninfectious Diseases and Conditions reporting system. Climate and Health. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $100,000,000 to expand the Climate and Health program to all States and territories to identify potential health effects associated with climate change and implement health adaptation plans. Cli-mate-related events affect everyone, but not everyone is affected equally. Improving Pediatric Reference Intervals. \u2014The Committee encour- ages CDC to initiate efforts to improve the accuracy of pediatric reference intervals. Lead Exposure Registry. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $500,000 for the Flint, Michigan Lead Exposure Registry. Newborn Screening. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 to further support newborn screening efforts so that af-fected newborns can receive early and often life-saving treatment through the timely implementation for all Recommended Uniform Screening Panel conditions. The Committee is aware that State laboratories need specialized support to begin screening for addi-tional newborn conditions and recognizes CDC's expertise in work-ing with laboratories to implement accurate newborn screening tests. The Committee urges the Newborn Screening Quality Assur-ance Program to support State laboratories as they implement screening for new disorders. The increase in funding will enable States to establish testing for new conditions and improve testing of current conditions; build technical capacity in States by pro-viding education, training and technical assistance to address test-ing challenges and determine appropriate testing methods for rapid screening; and ensure test results for new conditions are accurate by improving test result interpretation and expanding data ana-lytic capacity. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. \u2014The Committee encourages CDC to take into consideration Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) as a pos-sible cause of autism, epilepsy, and cardiac rhabdomyomas in sur-veillance. The Committee encourages CDC to counsel researchers and other stakeholders to facilitate development of a viable new-born screening assay for TSC. INJURY PREVENTION AND CONTROL Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $682,879,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 1,064,169,000 Change from ......................................................... +381,290,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a539,000,000 Programs supported within Injury Prevention and Control pro- vide national leadership on violence and injury prevention, conduct research and surveillance, and promote evidence-based strategies to inform real-world solutions to prevent premature death and dis-ability and to reduce human suffering and medical costs caused by injury and violence. Within the total, the Committee recommends the following amounts: VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 .......................................................................................... ............... Maltreatment ............................................................................................................................... 7,250,000 Child Sexual Community and Youth Violence Prevention ........................................................................................ ........... 115,100,000 Research Centers ................................................................................................ .................... Injury and Mortality Prevention Research ............................................................................... ......... 25,000,000 Adverse Childhood Experiences. \u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $2,000,000 to expand efforts including technical assist-ance to States to analyze data and burden. The Committee re-quests a report within 120 days of enactment of this Act on the via-bility and utility of a Positive Childhood Experience Surveillance System that measures resilience factors in a State or community. Child Sexual Abuse Prevention .\u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $1,000,000 and recognizes the severe and often life-long physical, cognitive and emotional impact of child sexual abuse. CDC's child sexual abuse prevention research includes opportuni-ties to improve surveillance systems and data collection, increase the understanding of risk and protective factors, and develop and disseminate effective prevention efforts. Community and Youth Violence Prevention. \u2014The Committee in- cludes an increase of $100,000,000 for a new evidence-based com-munity violence intervention, which aims to prevent intentional vi-olence, such as mass casualty violence or gang violence. The Com-mittee encourages CDC to fund a broad range of interventions, in-cluding programs to provide de-escalation and conflict mitigation skills. Domestic Violence and Sexual Violence. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 for domestic violence and sexual violence. The Committee notes the importance of the collection, reporting, and sharing of data on domestic violence and sexual violence. In addition, the Committee recognizes that the fiscal year 2022 appro-priation invests in efforts to end gender-based violence across mul-tiple Federal agencies. The Committee notes that the United Na-tions urged countries to adopt national action plans to combat gen-der-based violence and violence against women, including domestic violence. The Committee directs CDC to work in coordination with the Administration for Children and Families, the Office of the Surgeon General, and the Department of Justice to create a Na-tional Domestic Violence Prevention Action Plan to expand, inten-sify, and coordinate domestic violence prevention efforts among Federal, State, local, and tribal government agencies and with other relevant stakeholders to ensure a whole-of-government, goal- oriented, community-informed, forward looking approach in ad-dressing domestic violence prevention in the U.S. and report the VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul plan to the Committee no later than one year after enactment of this Act. Domestic Violence Community Projects. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 to expand the reach of the Domestic Vio-lence Prevention Enhancement and Leadership Through Alliances (DELTA) program. Drowning. \u2014The Committee includes new dedicated funding to scale proven drowning prevention programs, including programs working with underserved youth, and to support State drowning surveillance efforts and a national plan on water safety. The Com-mittee is concerned that protocols for proper lifeguard positioning at pools are not based on scientific testing, and therefore, life-guards are often positioned so that they cannot identify a patron in distress before drowning leads to serious injury or death. The Committee urges CDC to identify gaps in scientific evidence for lifeguard positioning to support the Model Aquatic Health Code provisions, specifically as it relates to Zone of Patron Surveillance requirements. Furthermore, the Committee is concerned about drowning rate of children with autism. The Committee urges CDC to work with State and local organizations to identify subgroups of the populations at greater risk for drowning, including autistic chil-dren and specific racial/ethnic groups, and to develop initiatives aimed at preventing drowning among these populations. Drug Use Surveillance. \u2014The Committee notes that trends in drug use change quickly and vary significantly geographically. The Committee encourages CDC to develop a strategy to expand the use of the National Wastewater Surveillance System for drug use surveillance to quickly detect emerging drug-use trends to more ef-fectively implement public health interventions. Firearm Injury and Mortality Data. \u2014The Committee urges CDC to collaborate with the National Institute of Justice to compile, share, and improve gun violence data. Such data should include the Uniform Crime Report and include data from hospitals treating vic-tims of nonfatal gunshot wounds. Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research. \u2014The Com- mittee includes an increase of $12,500,000 for research on firearm injury and mortality through a public health approach that focuses on data to understand its causes and to inform prevention strate-gies. The Committee directs CDC to focus on activities that will have the greatest potential public health impact. Furthermore, the Committee recognizes that community gun violence, such as gang violence, constitutes a significant portion of gun homicides in the U.S. There is a disproportionate impact of community gun violence on low-income communities of color, which is not often reflected in the national narrative surrounding gun violence. The Committee encourages CDC to support research on community gun violence, reflecting the diversity of the victims of gun violence. Furthermore, the Committee urges CDC to investigate the impact of access to teen and youth services in a community on rates of community vio-lence. Injury Control Research Centers. \u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $2,000,000 to award additional grants. National Violent Death Reporting System. \u2014The Committee in- cludes an increase of $10,000,000 to collect data on gender identity and sexual orientation. This data will increase our understanding VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul of violent deaths among disproportionately affected groups and in- form efforts towards decreasing the number of deaths across groups. Opioid Abuse and Overdose Prevention. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $187,790,000 and appreciates efforts by CDC to en-sure that funding for opioid and stimulant abuse and overdose pre-vention reaches local communities to advance local understanding of the opioid overdose epidemic and to scale-up prevention and re-sponse activities, as intended by Congress. The Committee encour-ages CDC to consider community member naloxone education as a criterion when distributing overdose prevention funds. In addition, the Committee directs that CDC report on the results of the invest-ments in local cities, counties, and communities and ensure that traditionally underrepresented communities, including rural and tribal communities, receive equitable access to funds in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. In addition, the Committee notes that chronic pain is a disabling and costly health condition; who is affected, the extent of resulting disability, the na-ture and accessibility of effective pain management, and related costs all remain largely unknown. The Committee directs CDC to conduct the collection, analysis, and publication of population re-search data using questions from the National Health Interview Survey and other nationally representative population-based sam-ples to describe those with chronic pain by patient age, comorbidities, part of body affected, socio-economic status, geo-graphic location by State, county and city, payor source, race, and gender. The Committee further directs CDC to analyze and report data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey regarding the use of and associated direct healthcare costs related to pain manage-ment treatments and services as well as indirect costs related to pain. Finally, the Committee directs CDC to report on the status of these activities in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Jus-tification. Public Health Approach to Violence. \u2014The Committee notes House Report 116-450 directed CDC to provide a report under this heading. The Committee is still awaiting this report and looks for-ward to its submission. Rape Prevention. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $50,000,000 to support rape prevention and education programs. Suicide. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 to expand surveillance and comprehensive prevention efforts, as sui-cide is devastating communities across the U.S. Traumatic Brain Injury. \u2014The Committee provides an increase of $2,000,000 to begin to address concussion surveillance, particularly among children and youth. NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $345,300,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 360,300,000 Change from ......................................................... +15,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +15,000,000 The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts applied research, develops criteria for occupa-tional safety and health standards, and provides technical services VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul to government, labor, and industry, including training for the pre- vention of work-related diseases and injuries.

Assessment of the Extent of COVID-19 Infections and Deaths Among Workers. \u2014The Committee is aware that many groups of es- sential workers faced higher rates of COVID-19 infections and death during the pandemic, such as those employed in health care, first responders, meat and poultry, corrections, grocery, corrections, and transit industries. Many of these are low wage workers of color, whose jobs required them to report to work in person throughout the pandemic. In order to fully assess the extent and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on workers and to protect them from unnecessary future exposure and infection, the Committee di-rects CDC to prepare: (1.) A study quantifying COVID-19 deaths by occupation and industry based upon an analysis of death certifi-cates. Such report shall compare the higher risk occupations and the rate of COVID-19 deaths in the general population. Such re-port shall be provided to the Committee on Appropriations and the public 180 days from the date of enactment of this Act; and (2.) A report on the extent of COVID-19 infections among working popu-lations by occupation, the factors that contribute to this increased risk, and a description of disparate impacts by race and ethnicity. The report should include an assessment of the adequacy of report-ing and data collection of COVID-19 infections, outbreaks and deaths among workers, and recommendations and a professional budget justification for improvements in data collection and report-ing by employers, localities, States and the Federal government for COVID-19 and future epidemics. Such report shall be provided to the Committee on Appropriations and the public within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Education and Research Centers. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 to support efforts to reduce work-related in-juries and illnesses through prevention research, education, and implementation of programs to improve occupational health and safety and minimize the dangers faced by workers across the coun-try. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 \u2014The Committee commends CDC for the progress outlined in the 2019-2023 mining program strategic plan to reduce overexposure to hazardous airborne contaminants in the mining environment by conducting studies to: (1) improve measure-ment of exposures to hazardous dusts, and to better understand the risks for respiratory diseases among mine workers; (2) develop and assess the effectiveness of interventions and technologies to prevent overexposure to hazardous dusts; and (3) to improve the adoption of control interventions and technologies. Personal Protective Technologies. \u2014The Committee recognizes the important role that CDC continues to provide regarding personal protective technologies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to protect workers every day and includes an increase of $3,000,000 to support these efforts. The Committee directs CDC to review and report back to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this Act, a consideration of how technology, including voice-activated technology, could save PPE and clinicians' lives. This review should include specific analysis of the impact on nurses employed in acute care hospitals. Total Worker Health. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $4,000,000 to expand the Total Worker Health program, which sup-ports and conducts ground-breaking research to advance the over-all safety, health, and well-being of U.S. workers. ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS COMPENSATION PROGRAM Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $55,358,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 .......................................................

NIOSH estimates occupational radiation exposure for cancer cases, con-siders and issues determinations for adding classes of workers to the Special Exposure Cohort, and provides administrative support to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health. GLOBAL HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $592,843,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 842,843,000 Change from ......................................................... +250,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +145,000,000 Through its Global Health activities, CDC coordinates, cooper- ates, participates with, and provides consultation to other nations, Federal agencies, and international organizations to prevent and contain diseases and environmental health problems and to develop and apply health promotion activities. In cooperation with min-istries of health and other appropriate organizations, CDC tracks and assesses evolving global health issues and identifies and devel-ops activities to apply CDC's technical expertise. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $750,000,000 for global disease detection and emergency response. Within the total, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Global Protection ................................................................................................ ..................... 448,200,000 Global Health Security. \u2014The Committee supports CDC's work to protect global health security through programs that detect, pre-vent, and respond to infectious diseases and other health threats. Emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and Zika and the global threat of spread of known diseases such as Ebola, represent profound challenges to our health system. The Committee supports CDC's continued work on the development of new tools, especially diagnostics, the application of advanced molecular detection for the identification and tracking of diseases and disease variants at home and abroad, and core technical contributions to developing and validating tools for use by U.S. bilateral and multilateral glob-al health programs and laboratory efforts to monitor and combat drug and insecticide resistance, functions essential to ensuring that global health programs are responsive, efficient, and tailored for maximum impact. The Committee urges CDC to ensure that the importance of research and development to global health security is appropriately reflected in their international engagements. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congres-sional Budget Justification on how CDC is working with FDA, BARDA, and NIH to jointly coordinate global health research ac-tivities with specific measurable metrics used to track progress and collaboration toward agreed upon health goals. Global Public Health Protection. \u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $245,000,000 to support and enhance CDC's mission to protect the health of our nation including by working across the globe. The Committee supports CDC's global efforts to detect epi-demic threats earlier, respond more effectively, and prevent avoid-able crises, including by providing support of program implementa-tion and scientific and technical experts in Atlanta and in the field with concentrated efforts on countries, populations, and programs where resources will have the greatest public health impact. In ad-dition, the Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on wastewater-based epidemi-ology and surveillance global detection efforts in the global re-sponse to COVID-19, including a professional judgement on the necessary budget and infrastructure requirements to fully operationalize these programs. Global Water Strategy. \u2014The Committee recognizes CDC's work to provide sustainable Water, Sanitation, & Hygiene (WASH) in healthcare facilities, aligned with the 2017 U.S. Global Water Strategy, and to support WASH efforts to contribute to the elimi-nation of cholera as a public health threat as outlined by Ending VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Roadmap to 2030. The Committee urges CDC to increase its WASH efforts in areas where Neglected Tropical Dis-eases are endemic. Parasitic Disease and Malaria. \u2014The Committee provides an in- crease of $5,000,000 recognizing the important role CDC plays in the fight against malaria and parasitic disease. CDC provides cru-cial monitoring and surveillance of transmission, evaluation of interventions for effectiveness and impact, development of key diagnostics, and testing of tools in a real world setting that are critical to ensuring that our global health investments are smarter, better, and not wasteful. Therefore, the Committee encourages CDC to continue to research, monitor, and evaluate efforts for ma-laria and parasitic disease in collaboration across the agency and with other agencies. Population-based Surveillance Platforms. \u2014The Committee di- rects at least $5,000,000 to be used to support existing longitudinal population-based infectious disease surveillance platforms that en-able comparative analysis between urban and rural populations in the developing world. Soil Transmitted Helminth and Related Diseases of Poverty. \u2014The Committee includes $1,500,000 to extend the currently funded CDC projects aimed at surveillance, source remediation and clinical care to reduce soil transmitted helminth infection. PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $842,200,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 862,200,000 Change from ......................................................... +20,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +20,000,000 The Public Health Preparedness and Response (PHPR) account supports programs that build and strengthen national prepared-ness for public health emergencies, both naturally-occurring and in-tentional. PHPR supports needs assessments, response planning, training, epidemiology and surveillance, and upgrades for labora-tory capacity and communications systems. Within the total, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement .................................................................. $71 5,000,000 Academic Centers for Public Health Preparedness 8,200,000 CDC Preparedness and Response .................................................................................................. ................ 139,000,000 Public Health Preparedness Cooperative Agreements. \u2014The Com- mittee includes an increase of $20,000,000 to enhance investments in State, local, and territorial health departments to quickly detect, monitor, and respond to health threats. Public health system in-vestments serve as the backbone for disaster and outbreak re-sponse in every State and the pandemic has shown that increased funding for preparedness is necessary for a baseline of consistent protection. The Committee directs that grant recipients incorporate Limited English Proficient (LEP) Individuals into their emergency response. Grant recipients must ensure they are conducting tai-lored and robust outreach efforts to LEP communities. In addition, VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul the Committee requests a State distribution table in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification, which should also include how funding is being allocated to local health departments and how States are determining these allocations. BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $30,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 55,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +25,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - This account supports capital projects as well as repairs and im- provements to restore, maintain, and improve CDC's assets at fa-cilities in seven States and San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Committee continues language to allow CDC to retain unob- ligated funds in the Individual Learning Accounts from departed employees to support the replacement of the underground and sur-face coal mine safety and health research facility. Maintenance Backlog. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $25,000,000 to make significant progress on reducing CDC's back-log of maintenance and repairs. CDC-WIDE ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAM SUPPORT Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $283,570,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 1,308,570,000 Change from ......................................................... +1,025,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +600,000,000 This account supports public health leadership and support ac- tivities at CDC. The Committee recommendation includes $1,148,570,000 in dis- cretionary funds and $160,000,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. In addition, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) provided sig- nificant supplemental funding for the COVID-19 response, includ-ing $7,500,000,000 for vaccination efforts and $1,000,000,000 for vaccine confidence activities. Within the total, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant .............................................................................. ....... $160,000,000 Public Health Leadership and Support ........................................................................................... ............... Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund ................................................................................ 35,000,000 Public Health Infrastructure and Capacity ...................................................................................... .............. 1,000,000,000 Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund. \u2014The Com- mittee includes an increase of $25,000,000. As utilized during the initial response to COVID-19, the Reserve Fund will provide an immediate source of funding to quickly respond to an imminent in-fectious disease crisis that endangers American lives. Funds are available until expended. Local Health Departments. \u2014The Committee recognizes that COVID-19 has raised awareness of the importance of the role of local health departments in our nation's governmental public health partnership to protect the public's health. However, Federal VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 funding intended for both State and local health departments does not consistently reach local health departments beyond those di-rectly-funded. The Committee encourages CDC to require States to fund local health departments when programmatically appropriate. National SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance Program. \u2014The Committee recognizes that new SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge across the globe, including variants that may have in-creased transmissibility and potential to evade vaccines. This dire situation demonstrates the need for a comprehensive genomic se-quencing and surveillance program to discover and track the spread of these variants and devise appropriate public health coun-termeasures. The Committee directs NIH and CDC, in coordination with other HHS agencies as appropriate, to continue to expand na-tional genomic surveillance to rapidly scale up sequencing of viral samples and dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data. Prevention and Public Health Fund. \u2014The Committee encourages the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification to request Prevention and Public Health funds for programs it was intended to assist, such as cardiovascular/stroke prevention through Million Hearts. Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant. \u2014The Com- mittee continues to support the Preventive Health and Health Services Block grant, of which at least $7,000,000 is to support di-rect services to victims of sexual assault and to prevent rape. Public Health Infrastructure and Capacity. \u2014The Committee in- cludes $1,000,000,000 for this new funding line to invest in core public health infrastructure and capacity nationwide. The COVID- 19 pandemic exposed the inadequacies of the current public health ecosystem and the message from the Subcommittee hearing on Public Health Infrastructure on February 24, 2021 was clear: flexi-ble, sustainable investments in public health are critical. The Com-mittee recognizes that State, local, territorial, and Federal public health partners need a long-term strategy and long-term invest-ments, beginning at CDC. The Committee provides this new, an-nual funding to turn the tide on the nation's public health infra-structure by providing a stable source of disease-agnostic funding so that nation's State, local, territorial, and Federal public health agencies are better equipped to coordinate together to save lives. Each year, CDC awards nearly 75 percent of its budget through grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to accomplish its mission; the Committee directs no less than 75 percent of this funding to be awarded to State, local, and territorial health depart-ments. Rural Health. \u2014The Committee recognizes the unique challenges present in rural areas and encourages CDC to consider the impor-tance of reaching those in rural areas. Vaccine Outreach with Community Health Workers. \u2014The Com- mittee directs CDC to ensure funding made available through COVID-19 emergency supplemental appropriations supports a vac-cine outreach program in partnership with community health workers to increase vaccine access in hardest-hit communities in-cluding Hispanic, Black, Asian, and Native American populations. In addition, the Committee requests a report within 120 days of en-actment of this Act outlining best practices for increasing vaccine access in the aforementioned communities. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $42,934,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 49,434,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +6,500,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a52,298,713,000 The Committee recommendation for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) program level includes $48,162,495,000 in discre-tionary appropriations and $1,271,505,000 in Public Health Service Act section 241 evaluation set-aside transfers. Within the total ap-propriation, the Committee recommendation includes $496,000,000 in budget authority authorized in the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L.114-255). The mission of NIH is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. NIH conducts and supports research to understand the basic biology of human health and disease; apply this under-standing towards designing new approaches for preventing, diag-nosing, and treating disease and disability; and ensure that these approaches are widely available. The recommendation includes funding for initiatives established in the 21st Century Cures Act, including a total of $194,000,000 for the Cancer Moonshot Initiative; $541,000,000 for the ''All of Us'' precision medicine initiative (including $150,000,000 from the Cures Act); and $612,000,000 for the Brain Research through Ap-plication of Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative (in-cluding $152,000,000 from the Cures Act). The Committee includes specific funding allocations for several initiatives and activities detailed in the Institute- and Center-spe-cific sections below. NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $6,559,852,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 6,992,056,000 Change from +432,204,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +258,754,000 Mission. \u2014NCI leads, conducts, and supports cancer research across the nation to advance scientific knowledge and help all peo-ple live longer, healthier lives. Cancer Data Sharing. \u2014The Committee applauds NIH for cre- ating the National COVID Collaborative (N3C), a commercial solu-tion leveraged to create a centralized and secure database that re-searchers in academic institutions can use to study COVID-19 and identify potential treatments. The Committee encourages NIH to continue pursuing similar approaches to other critical areas of re-search, including cancer, where data sharing continues to be a bar-rier to progress. The Committee commends NCI's data sharing ef-forts through the Cancer Moonshot, the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative, and other programs, and requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on NCI's continued progress toward adopting a centralized, secure, national platform to share cancer research data to drive new insights and speed re-search efforts across the country. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 that NCI- supported research exploring cancer immunology, cancer immunotherapy, and cancer vaccines that started years before the emergence of COVID-19 contributed to the rapid development of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. Applying lessons learned from COVID-19 therapeutic development to cancer immunotherapy clin-ical trials has the potential to greatly improve treatment options and outcomes for cancer patients. The Committee encourages NCI to accelerate the translation of discoveries in cancer immunotherapy by means of the same innovations used to develop COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. This should include expediting consideration and support for potential high-impact cancer immunotherapy clinical trials, and for correlative science based on planned and ongoing clinical trials. Cancer Moonshot. \u2014The Committee directs NIH to transfer $194,000,000 from the NIH Innovation Account to NCI to support the Cancer Moonshot initiative. These funds were authorized in the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255). Cancer Vaccines. \u2014The Committee recognizes that the success of the COVID-19 vaccines\u2014which became available less than a year from the outset of the pandemic and now deliver up to 95 percent protection rates\u2014is due to the fact that these vaccines were built on messenger RNA technology, or mRNA, an approach that had been initiated for cancer research. While most traditional vaccines use inactivated viruses to stimulate an immune response, a com-plicated process that can take several years, mRNA vaccines use the body's own genetic material, and can be developed much more quickly. The Committee understands that with further research, mRNA cancer vaccines could potentially be among the most cost- effective methods of preventing recurrences and the high costs of cancer care. The Committee commends the work of NCI, which is currently supporting multiple research projects focusing on the use of mRNA vaccines, and encourages its continued commitment to moving the field forward for mRNA vaccines as an approach for cancer immunotherapy treatment and prevention. To better under-stand NCI's progress to date and the potential of new break-throughs with mRNA, the Committee requests an update in the fis-cal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on NCI's work on mRNA vaccines, noting existing barriers or challenges, if any. Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI). \u2014The Committee in- cludes $50,000,000 for the second year of the CCDI, as proposed in the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The development of new thera-pies is important to finding a cure for childhood cancers, many of which have not seen new therapies in decades. The Committee commends NCI for its support of the establishment of the National Childhood Cancer Registry as a part of the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative. Data sets for childhood cancers are often small and spread out across institutions or aggregated into State-wide or Fed-eral registries where the particulars of incidence rate by cancer are lost. Traditional disease registries such as the Federally-supported Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER) and the CDC's National Program for Cancer Registries (NPCR) aggre-gated into the U.S. Cancer Statistics (USCS) do not yet include all of the data relevant to cutting-edge pediatric cancer research, such as the molecular characteristics of each child's cancer. The Com- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 urges NCI to use available resources to ensure all relevant data needed to assist childhood cancer researchers in developing in-novative treatments for childhood cancer are made available through the National Childhood Cancer Registry and other inte-grated CCDI programs. The Committee requests an update on the progress made to increase available childhood cancer data in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Childhood Cancer STAR Act. \u2014The Committee includes no less than $30,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level, for continued implementation of sections of the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Act to ex-pand existing biorepositories for childhood cancer patients enrolled in NCI-sponsored clinical trials to collect and maintain relevant clinical, biological, and demographic information on children, ado-lescents, and young adults, with an emphasis on selected cancer subtypes (and their recurrences) for which current treatments are least effective. Funding provided this year will allow NCI to con-tinue to conduct and support childhood cancer survivorship re-search as authorized in the STAR Act. Colorectal Cancer Disparities. \u2014Given the impact that screening can have on reducing mortality and morbidity in colorectal cancer, the Committee encourages NIH to study the impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on the incidence of colorectal cancer in minority com-munities. The Committee is hopeful that such information will pro-vide policymakers with a better understanding of the effects on mi-nority communities and help develop strategies to address barriers to screening and reduce health inequities and cancer deaths. Deadliest Cancers. \u2014The Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act (RCRA) of 2012 (P.L. 112-239) focuses on cancers with a five-year survival rate below 50 percent, which account for 44 percent of all U.S. cancer deaths. While advances in some cancers have made it possible to reduce the overall rate of cancer deaths over the last two decades, there has been limited progress reducing mortality for these diseases. For fiscal year 2020, Congress directed NCI to de-velop a scientific framework using the process outlined in the RCRA for stomach and esophageal cancers. The Committee notes that in addition to the ongoing framework development, NCI has also developed and received approval from its Board of Scientific Advisors to launch a Program in Origins of Gastroesophageal Can-cers. Alongside the research and advocacy communities, the Com-mittee appreciates NCI's efforts to keep the Committee apprised of continued research progress informed by the pancreatic, lung, glio-blastoma, esophageal, and stomach cancer frameworks. The Com-mittee encourages NCI to consider a similar process, as appro-priate, for primary liver cancer, including cholangiocarcinoma. Given the toll all recalcitrant cancers exact on society and the lack of diagnostic and treatment resources currently available to help patients, the Committee also requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on research goals to ad-vance progress for the deadliest cancers (brain, esophagus, liver, lung, ovary, pancreas, stomach and mesothelioma). Germline RUNX1 Mutations. \u2014The Committee commends NCI for supporting NHGRI in running a natural history study of pa-tients with germline RUNX1 mutations and their families. These mutations frequently lead to blood cancers, especially acute mye- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 more research on how this occurs could ultimately lead to treatments that would prevent malignancy. Interest in this field has grown significantly in recent years, and the Committee strongly urges NCI to initiate funding opportunities for NIH intra-mural and extramural researchers. Priority areas of research should include the role of inflammation and the immune system on cancer transformation, pharmacological approaches to regulating RUNX1 activity, gene editing strategies, and support for an extra-mural clinical consortium dedicated to national patient data collec-tion, analysis and specimen storage for collaborative research. Glioblastoma (GBM). \u2014The Committee commends NCI for its es- tablishment and initial implementation of the GBM Therapeutics Network GTN's cross-cutting teams' capability of pre-clinical and early-phase clinical trials necessary to rapidly evaluate potential treatments, including but not limited to 87 drugs, bio-logics, radiation, and devices, is what is needed to continue to ad-vance toward cures and improved quality of life. The Committee urges NCI to continue to implement the GTN so that this program can rapidly launch clinical trials that speed access to promising qualified treatments to patients consistent with NCI's Glioblastoma Working Group recommendations in 2019. Gynecologic Cancers. \u2014The Committee continues to be concerned about the growing racial, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities in gynecologic cancers. In contrast to most other common cancers in the U.S., relative survival for women with newly diagnosed ad-vanced cervical or endometrial cancer has not significantly im-proved since the 1970s. Furthermore, historical data demonstrates that Black and Latina women with gynecologic cancers are not as likely to receive standard therapy and/or die more frequently. The current COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the health care disparities that were already present in minority and underrep-resented communities. Therefore, the Committee urges NCI to ex-pand the number of programs, projects, clinical trials, research grants, and contract opportunities for investigators that focus on discoveries that will positively impact access to prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment for gynecologic cancers and ad-dress these now well-documented disparities. The Committee re-quests an update on NCI's research program for gynecologic can-cers in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification, in-cluding specific grants and strategies where the intent is to over-come these racial disparities in gynecologic cancers outcomes, in-cluding the underrepresentation of minority women in gynecologic cancer clinical trials. HPV-Associated Cancers. \u2014The Committee encourages NCI to ex- pand research related to HPV-associated cancers. Liver Cancer. \u2014The Committee notes that liver cancer is the sec- ond deadliest cancer, with a five-year survival rate of only 20 per-cent. The number of liver cancer cases in the U.S. has increased by over 250 percent since 2000 and continues to increase. Since early detection of cancer in general and liver cancer in particular is the most effective way to reduce cancer mortality, the Committee urges NCI to support the research needed to develop a liver cancer screening test using the blood and saliva samples from widespread national COVID testing. This extensive and growing inventory of saliva and blood samples offers a unique opportunity to develop a VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul liver cancer screening test that can soon reach over 100 million citi- zens, a number that will grow as COVID testing is expanded. Melanoma. \u2014As UV radiation is established as the primary car- cinogen for melanoma, the Committee urges NCI to support re-search directed at genomic and mechanistic characteristics of mutagenesis; optimization of prevention strategies; and early detec-tion and risk declassification strategies that leverage artificial in-telligence, access to large databases, noninvasive technologies, and molecular markers that will support precision medicine. Although SEER data show decline in mortality with the advent of new categories of treatment, some patients do not respond to ini-tial treatment, and many of the responders have disease that will recur. The Committee encourages NCI to expand research on mech-anisms of primary and secondary drug resistance and validation of predictive biomarkers that allow selection of optimal therapy and prediction of comprehensive longitudinal monitoring. Basic and translational goals should be facilitated through development and use of ever-improving models of human melanoma. Building on the success of adjuvant therapies, and the promising results of neoadjuvant therapies, the Committee encourages NCI to continue support of research addressing tumor cell dormancy and metastases. The Committee encourages NCI to support multicenter trials that will determine whether shorter courses of therapy will decrease toxicity and costs while maintaining benefit, the role of adjuvant therapy and whether patients with earlier disease should receive adjuvant therapy and that further determine the role of ad-juvant therapy in both treatment and drug development. The Committee encourages NCI to support research on novel tar- gets, especially for rare subtypes, and support development of reg-istries where populations are not adequate for randomized trials. The Committee requests an update on these requests and a status of NCI-funded melanoma research in NCI's fiscal year 2023 Con-gressional Budget Justification. Metastatic Breast Cancer. \u2014The Committee is aware that clinical research is of utmost importance to those living with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), which is breast cancer that has spread to other organs and become incurable. An estimated 168,000 Ameri-cans live with MBC, and nearly all of the more than 43,000 deaths from breast cancer are attributed to this late stage of disease. Given the mortality associated with MBC and the lack of treatment options, research offers the best possibility of therapeutic advances and extended life for these patients. MBC is also associated with startling health disparities, since breast cancer mortality is about 40 percent higher for Black women in the U.S. than White women, and breast cancer is the second most common cause of death by cancer for Black women. The Committee believes that a renewed emphasis by NCI on research for MBC, especially in communities of color, is needed to discover better treatments and a cure for MBC and to address health disparities in this population. The Committee requests an update on NCI's activities regarding MBC in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification, includ-ing progress made with respect to inclusion of people of color in NCI-funded clinical trials in this area. Metastatic Cancer Research. \u2014While the early detection and treatment of early stage disease for many cancers results in cures, VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul most tumors, metastatic cancer remains incurable. More than 90 percent of cancer deaths are due to metastatic disease. In addi-tion to genetic alterations in the cancer itself, recent research has revealed that there is a genetic basis for susceptibility to meta-static cancer or resistance to metastasis. More research is required to develop a comprehensive understanding of this complex process involving tumor and host interactions. Clinical trials are an impor-tant aspect of that progress, and diverse representation of patients in clinical trials is integral to the development of medications and therapies that effectively treat metastatic disease. Ethnicity, gen-der, age, and genetics all play a role in the safety and efficacy of a treatment for an individual. The Committee commends NIH and the Department of Defense (DoD) for work already underway to support research needs and opportunities identified in the April 2018 Task Force Report to Congress on Metastatic Cancer. The Committee encourages NIH to maintain collaborative efforts with DoD and provide subject matter expertise as appropriate as DoD continues to implement recommendations from the report aimed at achieving representation of the demographics of the U.S. popu-lation in clinical trials. NCI Paylines. \u2014Grant applications to NCI have increased by ap- proximately 50 percent since 2013, outpacing available funding, with requests for cancer research ten-fold greater than other Insti-tutes and Centers. With such a high demand for NCI grants, only a fraction of highly meritorious research proposals can be funded. To support more awards and improve success rates, the Committee provides an increase of $200,000,000 for NCI to prioritize com-peting grants and to sustain commitments to continuing grants. Pancreatic Cancer. \u2014Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. In 2020, over 60,000 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer; more Americans than ever before. The five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer re-mains at just over ten percent. The Committee appreciates that NCI has adhered to and completed all reporting requirements of the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act of 2012 (RCRA) as it pertains to the Pancreatic Cancer Scientific Framework. The Committee looks forward to updates and progress made on the action items identified in the pancreatic cancer focus areas. The Committee is encouraged to hear that NCI is building upon the RCRA's Strategic Framework and taking steps to integrate research efforts across the NCI, and that several NCI-supported consortia focused on early detection have formed the Alliance of Pancreatic Cancer Consortia as a virtual network of researchers, clinicians, and advocacies to provide a platform and coordinate resources to discover and vali-date biomarkers and imaging methods for early detection. The Committee applauds this effort and requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on progress made within the Alliance since its inaugural meeting in December 2016. Pediatric Cancer Expertise. \u2014The Committee recognizes that the Childhood Cancer STAR Act (P.L. 115-180) calls on NCI to ensure that all applicable study sections, committees, advisory groups, and panels at NCI include one or more qualified pediatric oncologists, as appropriate. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on the actions NCI VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul has taken to ensure appropriate pediatric cancer expertise is in- cluded in such groups. Prioritizing Underserved Populations in Cancer Clinical Trials. \u2014 The Committee remains concerned about the lack of equity and ac-cess to cancer clinical trials across the country. Groups that are generally underrepresented in clinical trials include racial and eth-nic minorities and older and lower-income individuals as well as those from rural communities. To better identify and address these disparities, the Committee encourages NCI to continue to develop and prioritize trial recruitment strategies that consider socio-economic status, race/ethnicity, or location and to prioritize grant applications that aim to recruit and enroll diverse patient cohorts when appropriate. The Committee urges NCI to continue collecting and publicly reporting research data on race/ethnicity, and to en-courage the collection of data, when appropriate, on sexual orienta-tion, gender identity, and other variables that are known to influ-ence clinical outcomes. Prostate Cancer. \u2014The Committee remains concerned that pros- tate cancer lacks treatments for men with advanced disease as well as adequate diagnostic and imaging methodologies. To ensure Fed-eral resources are leveraged to the greatest extent possible, the Committee encourages NCI to coordinate, when appropriate, its re-search efforts with other Federal agencies, including DoD, as well as private research foundations and advocacy groups. Research on Cancer Disparities. \u2014The Committee encourages NCI to continue its commitment to support the NCI Community Oncol-ogy Research Program and the activities of the Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities, two key efforts that contribute to build-ing a cadre of community stakeholders and medical researchers prepared to engage in transdisciplinary approaches to address can-cer, including its disparate impact on some communities nation-wide. Although there have been significant advances in the preven-tion and treatment of cancer, evidence shows persistent differences in cancer incidence, late-stage diagnosis, and mortality in many States depending on socioeconomic status, geography, race, eth-nicity, and other factors. The Committee encourages NCI to con-tinue to prioritize research and training programs aimed at reduc-ing health disparities in cancer, including through NCI's continued support of its integrated training, education, and outreach net-works between communities and medical research centers. The Committee encourages NCI to prioritize partnerships with commu-nity groups and other stakeholders to explore the issues associated with cancer disparities as identified by local communities and in-clude activities to develop curriculum to inform health professions education to reduce medical mistrust in targeted groups and to highlight relevant research questions to address cancer disparities. Additionally, NCI efforts should support the development of a can-cer research infrastructure to identify relevant research questions related to disparities and to develop integrated and sustainable ap-proaches to reducing cancer disparities, including examining social determinants of health and their impacts on such disparities. Skin Cancer in Communities of Color. \u2014Research has shown that skin cancer in patients with skin of color is often diagnosed in its later stages, making treatment more difficult and decreasing the chances for survival. The Committee requests an update in the fis- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 cal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification regarding re- search that assesses factors contributing to later diagnoses of skin cancer among patients with skin of color, as well as research fo-cused on measures to raise awareness of risk factors for skin can-cer and to encourage activities that promote prevention and early detection of skin cancers among patients with skin of color and other underserved populations. Telehealth-Based Services for Vulnerable Patients. \u2014The COVID- 19 pandemic significantly exacerbated the physical, emotional, and mental toll on cancer patients and families. Providing clinical and psychosocial services to address these challenges is an essential component of comprehensive cancer care across a patient's lifespan. Cancer centers across the U.S. quickly pivoted to providing patient support and related health services by telehealth, although the ex-tent to which all patients and families had equitable access to these services and the impact for those who have attended them is unknown. For example, both rural and urban underserved areas disproportionately lack reliable home-based Internet service, cre-ating barriers for patients to access telehealth-based clinical and psychosocial support services. To overcome this, many cancer cen-ters provided technical assistance to patients during the pandemic to support their use of telehealth. The Committee urges NCI to in-crease its support of research on the delivery and evaluation of telehealth-based clinical and psychosocial services, particularly among vulnerable patients and disadvantaged communities. This enhanced research would lead to evidence-based best practices, so that all patients can benefit from the most effective cancer care at all stages of the disease. NATIONAL HEART , LUNG , AND BLOOD INSTITUTE (NHLBI) Appropriation, fiscal year ......................................................... $3,664,811,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 3,866,828,000 Change from +202,017,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +21,147,000 Mission. \u2014NHLBI provides global leadership for a research, training, and education program to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood disorders and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more ful-filling lives. Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia. \u2014Well-characterized, longitudinal, population-based cohort studies provide value in bringing to light more information about the risk factors related to dementia. By studying participants over time, much can be learned about cognitive decline and early biomarkers; however, mature co-horts naturally dwindle as participants pass away, requiring that the research mission be adjusted to continue to leverage the pre-vious science and build upon it. The Committee urges NHLBI to fund research into next generation cohorts, with a focus on under-standing the development and progression of risk factors and detec-tion of early signs of cognitive decline. Funded cohorts should be racially and ethnically diverse with broad geographic representa-tion. Blood Donor Questionnaire Educational Materials. \u2014The Com- mittee is concerned that certain FDA guidance in the educational VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul in the blood donor questionnaire are inappro- priate and misguided. The recommendations for deferral should not mention someone's sexual orientation, and rather focus on risk fac-tors that might expose a potential donor to blood-borne illness. The Committee strongly recommends that NHLBI work with the FDA and remove or replace the recommended deferment of blood for men who have had sex with men in the last 12 months. Community Engagement Alliance Against COVID-19 Disparities (CEAL) Initiative. \u2014The Committee includes $30,000,000 for the new CEAL initiative, the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. This initiative will connect researchers with community or-ganizations and leaders to conduct outreach and increase participa-tion of people from underrepresented communities in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. COVID-19-Associated Illnesses. \u2014The Committee recognizes the growing burden of COVID-associated critical illnesses, including sepsis and pneumonia. The Committee encourages NHLBI to accel-erate research into sepsis, pneumonia, and acute lung injury. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. \u2014In light of improvements in care leading to patients living into their third decade, the leading cause of death in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients is heart failure. The Committee urges NHLBI to support research that character-izes cardiomyopathy in Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy. There is a gap in the ability to develop novel cardiac therapeutics for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy due to a lack of accepted cardiac outcome measures. The Committee encourages NHLBI to convene a workshop with research, clinical, and patient organization lead-ers to work towards establishing viable cardiac outcome measures for the development of therapeutic agents to combat cardio-myopathy. Health Disparities Research. \u2014The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated health disparities in the U.S. The Committee includes an increase of $50,000,000 for NHLBI to sup-port research related to identifying and reducing health disparities, the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Long-Term Impact of COVID-19. \u2014The Committee notes with concern that an estimated ten percent of individuals who have re-covered from COVID-19 are experiencing ''long haul'' health condi-tions, including serious respiratory diseases such as acute res-piratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. The Committee urges NHLBI to prioritize research into the understanding, treat-ment and prevention of ''long haul'' post-COVID respiratory condi-tions, particularly among minority populations disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Lymphedema (LE). \u2014LE is a chronic, debilitating, and incurable swelling that can be a result of damage to the lymphatic system due to surgery, cancer treatment, or injury, and that can also be inherited. An estimated 10,000,000 Americans suffer from LE. Ad-ditional research is necessary to improve our understanding of this condition and expand the treatment options available. The Com-mittee directs NHLBI to increase support for research on LE and to establish a Research Condition Disease Categorization category for research related to lymphedema. Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) Workshop. \u2014MVP is a common valve disease that has an estimated 2.4 percent prevalence. Though VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul most cases are thought to be benign, reported complications such as severe mitral regurgitation and arrythmias can result in sudden cardiac death (SCD). Medical research has found an association be-tween MVP and SCD. Predictors of this outcome, however, are not readily available, underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and indicators of high-risk individuals are lacking. Despite several studies, there is not sufficient data to generate guidelines for care of patients with valvular heart disease, including MVP. The Com-mittee encourages NHLBI to convene a workshop of subject matter experts to identify research needs and opportunities with the goal of informing guidelines for treatment of patients with MVP. National Commission on Lymphatic Diseases. \u2014The Committee directs NIH to establish a National Commission on Lymphatic Dis-eases and to engage with relevant Institutes, Centers, and external stakeholders in establishing this Commission. The Committee di-rects NIH to provide an update on progress to establish the Com-mission within 60 days of the enactment of this Act. National Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Action Plan. \u2014The Committee notes NHLBI's role in crafting the National COPD Action Plan. NHLBI is encouraged to continue this impor-tant work by supporting additional research activities and collabo-rating with other Public Health Service agencies to facilitate imple-mentation of the plan's recommendations. Polycystic Kidney Disease. \u2014The Committee commends NIDDK for its continued commitment to Polycystic Kidney Disease Re-search and Translation Centers and the Pediatric Centers of Excel-lence in Nephrology, which improve our understanding of the causes of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. The Committee en-courages NIDDK to ensure that funds previously committed for polycystic kidney disease research centers remain dedicated to funding other PKD research efforts. Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF). \u2014The Committee recognizes that PF is a family of more than 200 different lung diseases that all look very much alike despite having a variety of causes. This heterogeneity presents significant challenges for diagnosis and treatment. The Committee commends NHLBI for its recent efforts to apply the principles of precision medicine to PF research, especially by fund-ing a major new study that will evaluate a promising treatment for a subset of patients with a particular gene variant. This study, known as PRECISIONS, also aims to identify genetic variants that play a role in certain forms of PF. The Committee urges NHLBI to prioritize basic research on PF, particularly to better understand the causes and process of scarring and the varying impacts on pa-tients. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) Research. \u2014The Committee commends NIH for its ongoing support of clinical research for SCD, which im-poses major morbidity on an estimated 90,000 to 100,000 individ-uals in the U.S., with three million Americans carrying the sickle cell trait. The Committee encourages NIH to support clinical trials for prenatal and postnatal treatment of SCD, which includes mul-tiple promising approaches to eradicate this disease, save lives, and reduce dramatically the substantial health care costs associated with SCD for children and adults. The Committee encourages NIH to consider programs both domestically and globally to evaluate the VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul effectiveness of screening technologies for infants and children with the sickle cell trait and disease. Support for The Heart Truth Program. \u2014For over a decade, The Heart Truth program has worked to raise awareness about wom-en's risk of heart disease. The program's goals are to increase awareness that heart disease is the leading cause of death among women and to increase the conversations between women, and their health care providers. Accordingly, the Committee encourages the NHLBI to robustly fund The Heart Truth program. Thalassemia. \u2014Recent studies have shown that the length of time between when blood is donated and transfused does not impact out-comes for patients in need of an emergency blood transfusion, such as in cases of trauma or acute events. However, these studies do not determine the impact on chronically transfused patients, such as those with thalassemia, in which an administration of older red cells may exacerbate iron loading in the heart and other internal organs and contribute to worse outcomes for patients. The Com-mittee urges NHLBI to establish research initiatives to address current gaps in clinical understanding in this area. Valvular Heart Disease Research. \u2014Many people in the U.S. have heart valve defects or disease but do not have symptoms. For some, the condition remains the same throughout their lives and does not cause significant or life-threatening problems. Unfortunately, over 25,000 people die each year in the U.S. from heart valve disease, primarily due to underdiagnosis and undertreatment of the condi-tion. The Committee strongly supports more research into valvular heart disease. Such research should focus on advances in techno-logical imaging and precision medicine to generate data on individ-uals with valvular heart disease, identify individuals who are at high risk of sudden cardiac death, and develop prediction models for high-risk patients, enabling interventions and treatment plans to help keep these patients healthy throughout their lives. Addi-tionally, the Committee supports efforts by NIH to convene a work-shop of subject matter experts to identify research needs and op-portunities with the goal of informing guidelines for treatment of patients with valvular heart disease. Vascular Dementia. \u2014A growing number of Americans are devel- oping severe forms of vascular dementia, conditions resulting from many years of living with chronic diseases such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease. This prevalence is especially high in areas with high rates of hypertension, obesity, and lack of access to regular health care. Epidemiological studies and human pathol-ogy studies have demonstrated association of vascular risk factors, vascular diseases, and pathology with dementia. Research in ani-mal models could further investigate causal relationships, under-stand mechanisms, and test novel interventions (including repurposing existing drugs). Study of the mechanisms of vascular dementia can help researchers to understand causation, develop new treatment therapies and study how to repurpose existing drugs to delay or halt disease progression. The Committee encour-ages NHLBI to continue its support for investigating potential rela-tionship between vascular disease and risk factors for vascular de-mentia, leveraging the work of well-established longitudinal cohort studies of dementia and cardiovascular disease and experimental models well characterized phenotypes and mechanisms. The Com- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 to coordinate this research with NIA and NINDS to ensure that the continuum of research from basic science to observational cohort to clinical trial to implementation is main-tained. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH (NIDCR) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $484,867,000 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 519,010,000 Change from +34,143,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +2,813,000 Mission. \u2014The mission of NIDCR is to improve dental, oral, and craniofacial health through research, research training, and the dissemination of health information. Dental Restorative Materials. \u2014To help address one of the U.S. commitments under the Minamata Convention on Mercury, the Committee encourages NIDCR to conduct additional research on durable mercury-free dental restorative materials. Opioids and Pain/Pain Management Research .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $18,000,000 for NIDCR to support research related to opioids, pain, and pain management, as requested in the fiscal year 2022 budget. Oral Microbiome. \u2014The Committee appreciates NIDCR's leader- ship in microbiome research, including its support of the Human Oral Microbiome Database. The Committee encourages NIDCR to build upon its microbiome research to discover and better under-stand the microbiome's connection to overall health, including its influence on preventing and treating illness and disease. SARS-CoV-2. \u2014The Committee thanks NIDCR for its commit- ment to prioritizing research to answer critical research questions related to the novel coronavirus. The Institute's research into high- impact areas such as transmission risk in dental environments is critical for the nation to continue fighting COVID-19 and to ensure everyone is as safe as possible. Report on Oral Health in America. \u2014The Committee greatly ap- preciates NIDCR's leadership on the upcoming Report ''Oral Health in America: Advances and Challenges''. The Committee anticipates the final release of the report and encourages NIDCR to utilize the findings of the 2021 Report to identify research gaps across dental, oral, and craniofacial research and to pursue research opportunities to fill those gaps. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES (NIDDK) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $2,131,975,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 2,237,625,000 Change from Change from budget request ...................................................... +18,327,000 Mission .\u2014The NIDDK mission is to conduct and support medical research and research training and disseminate science-based in-formation on diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, nutritional disorders, and obesity; and kidney, urologic, and hematologic diseases, to improve people's health and quality of life. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul (ESRD). \u2014The Committee continues to note the important work in supporting critical kidney research that NIDDK has accomplished on ESRD. The Committee encourages NIDDK to work with stakeholders to facilitate new opportunities for research in related conditions. Glomerular Disease. \u2014The Committee continues to support the important work that the Cure Glomeruloneuropathy (CureGN) ini-tiative has accomplished, which has led to breakthroughs for crit-ical clinical trials. The Committee encourages NIDDK to continue supporting research on related conditions such as minimal change disease. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). \u2014The Committee encourages NIDDK to continue pursuing bedside-to-bench research in IBD with a focus on biological and clinical drivers of patient remission and relapse in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, including mucosal healing as well as environmental triggers such as nutri-tion and psychological stress. The Committee recognizes the impor-tance of having common data elements (CDE), standardizing the clinical categorization of IBD patients, to facilitate the sharing, val-idation, and comparison of results across research studies, and commends the work many Institutes and Centers have done to sup-port development of CDEs for a number of diseases and disorders. To effectively support bedside-to-bench research in IBD, the Com-mittee encourages the Institute to support the development of CDEs and to collaborate with other IBD researchers and organiza-tions. Interstitial Cystitis. \u2014The Committee notes the progress of inter- stitial cystitis research through the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Program and encourages NIDDK and stakeholders to continue collaboration on a comprehen-sive state of the science conference to examine mechanisms for sci-entific opportunity. The Committee requests an update on the progress of the conference in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Liver Disease and Health Disparities. \u2014The Committee notes the relationship between health disparities and a variety of conditions of the liver, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The Committee encourages NIDDK to continue to work with NIMHD and other Institutes and Centers to advance liver disease research in a comprehensive and impactful way. Opioids and Pain/Pain Management Research .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $20,000,000 for NIDDK to support research related to opioids, pain, and pain management, as requested in the fiscal year 2022 budget. Pediatric Nephrology Workforce Diversification. \u2014The Committee recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented dis-ruption in biomedical research, delaying awards and dissuading ap-plications for pediatric nephrology research. The Committee is con-cerned that these disruptions have disproportionately impacted re-searchers from traditionally underrepresented groups, resulting in even fewer researchers from communities of color. Pediatric ne-phrology studies continue to suffer from low enrollment, due in part to the disproportionate impact of kidney disease on children of color and longstanding challenges of clinical trial recruitment VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul within those communities. Because children and families of color are more likely to enroll in studies where the research team is from the same community, the diversity of pediatric nephrology bio-medical workforce is paramount to the success of this research. The Committee requests that NIDDK consult with stakeholder groups to identify barriers to increasing the diversity of the pediatric ne-phrology workforce and identify ways to incentivize researchers from traditionally underrepresented groups to enter this field. The Committee requests that NIDDK include information in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on the progress made to bolster the diversity of the pediatric nephrology biomedical re-search workforce. Prostate Cancer Disparities. \u2014Nearly 250,000 men will be diag- nosed with and 34,000 men will die from prostate cancer in 2021. Incidence of prostate cancer is almost 80 percent higher in non-His-panic Black men, and prostate cancer mortality among Black men is more than double that of men in every other racial or ethnic group, representing a stark example of health inequity in cancer outcomes. The Committee supports NCI and NIMHD research on Prostate Cancer in Men of African American Ancestry: Defining the Roles of Genetics Tumor Markers, and Social Stress (RESPOND) Study, intended to identify the underlying causes of disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality. The Committee requests an update on the study in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budg-et Justification. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE (NINDS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $2,513,393,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 2,799,515,000 Change from Change from budget request ...................................................... +16,215,000 Mission. \u2014The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and use that knowledge to re-duce the burden of neurological disease. BRAIN Initiative. \u2014The Committee directs NIH to transfer $76,000,000 from the NIH Innovation Account to NINDS to support the BRAIN Initiative. These funds were authorized in the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255). This collaborative effort is revo-lutionizing the understanding of how neural components and their dynamic interactions result in complex behaviors, cognition, and disease, while accelerating the development of transformative tools to explore the brain in unprecedented ways, making information previously beyond reach accessible. Cerebral Palsy (CP) Research. \u2014The Committee commends NIH for supporting research on mechanisms leading to CP, health out-comes for those affected, biomarkers that may aid in diagnosis or treatment selection, and interventions for treatment and preven-tion of CP. The Committee strongly encourages NIH to strengthen, accelerate, and coordinate cerebral palsy research priorities across the lifespan identified in the 2017 NINDS/NICHD Strategic Plan for CP Research, such as basic and translational discoveries, in-cluding neuroprotective, regenerative medicine and mechanisms of neuroplasticity, as well as implementation and clinical studies VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul at early detection and intervention, comparative effective- ness, and functional outcomes. The Committee encourages that a follow-up workshop be held in 2022 in conjunction with key stake-holders to provide updates on promising research performed to date, with the goal to further refine or expand the opportunities that were identified in the five to 10 year NIH strategic plan, in-cluding early detection and intervention. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. \u2014While the expression of the dystrophin protein in the brain is recognized, our understanding of the link between the absence of dystrophin and related neurobehavioral/cognitive diagnosis is not well understood. The Committee urges NINDS to support research to characterize the role of dystrophin in the brain and to further define the relation-ships between mutation and neurobehavioral and cognitive diag-nosis. Dystonia. \u2014The Committee continues to urge NINDS to imple- ment the recommendations from the NINDS workshop ''Defining Emergent Opportunities in Dystonia Research'' and engage with other Institutes and stakeholders on advancing translational re-search that may lead to more treatment options for those affected by dystonia. Expanded Access to ALS Treatments. \u2014The Committee supports efforts to expand access for neurodegenerative diseases with no dis-ease modifying treatments. The Committee encourages NINDS to collaborate with stakeholders to expand access for patients unable to access treatment through clinical trials. Headache Disorders. \u2014Migraine is a leading cause of disability, affecting more than 17 percent of people in the U.S. The statutory language providing authority for Helping End Addiction Long-Term (HEAL) Initiative cites the necessity of attending to disease burden in prioritizing HEAL research programs (42 U.S. Code \u00a7 284q 1). The Committee encourages NIH to consider HEAL Initiative sup-port of fundamental, translational, clinical, and social science re-search on headache disorders, as appropriate to the mission of the HEAL initiative, to provide lasting scientific solutions to the opioid crisis. HEAL has invested in resources and infrastructure devel-oped to support pain research across all pain conditions and should continue to encourage application submissions on headache dis-orders, as well as those on pain conditions for which opioid use and prescribing is highly prevalent. Headache disorders research sup-ported through the HEAL initiative should supplement, not sup-plant, current funding for headache disorders research at NIH, which has contributed to many of the effective non-opioid treat-ments for headache. Multiple Sclerosis (MS). \u2014The Committee encourages NINDS to prioritize studies that develop the medical understanding of the progression of MS and advance research on prevention strategies, treatments, and cures for MS. Opioid and Stimulant Research. \u2014The Committee includes $405,400,000 million within NINDS for the Helping to End Addic-tion Long-Term (HEAL) Initiative, $135,105,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budg-et request. The HEAL Initiative is a trans-NIH effort to accelerate scientific discovery related to prevention and treatment of opioid use disorder and developing nonaddictive alternatives for pain VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Committee also includes an additional $43,000,000 in NINDS to support basic research related to opioids and pain, as requested in the fiscal year 2022 budget. Parkinson's Disease (PD). \u2014The Committee commends NINDS for taking critical steps in identifying priority recommendations to ad-vance research on PD, which impacts between 500,000 and 1,500,000 people in the U.S. and is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in this country. The Committee recog-nizes that NINDS is prioritizing public health concerns with severe gaps in unmet medical needs and supports the research rec-ommendations set forth by the NINDS planning strategy to bring us closer to better treatments and a cure for PD. The Committee also encourages NINDS to submit an update of its progress on im-plementing these recommendations in the fiscal year 2023 Congres-sional Budget Justification. Sleep Disorders. \u2014The Committee notes the leadership of NINDS in advancing research into underrepresented sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, and Kleine Levin Syndrome. The Committee encourages NINDS to bolster these activities and review the state of the science around sleep disorders to better ad-vance initiatives that advance scientific understanding of specific sleep disorders impacting patients. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES (NIAID) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $6,069,619,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 6,557,803,000 Change from Change from budget request ...................................................... +311,877,000 Mission. \u2014The NIAID mission is to conduct and support basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. Antiviral Drugs and Pandemic Preparedness. \u2014The Committee strongly encourages NIAID efforts to establish a public-private partnership focused on global pandemic preparedness and antiviral drug discovery, in coordination with BARDA. Such a partnership could leverage the best of academia and pharmaceutical manufac-turers to develop broad-spectrum antiviral drugs to address rapidly emerging public health threats, helping our nation be better pre-pared for the next global pandemic. The Committee directs NIAID to provide an update on this and any related efforts in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Celiac Disease. \u2014The Committee encourages NIH to devote fo- cused research to the study of celiac disease, including the auto-immune causation underpinning the affliction. Today, the only known treatment for this disease is a gluten-free diet; however, re-cent public and private sector research confirms that such a treat-ment is insufficient for many who suffer from celiac disease. There-fore, the Committee urges NIAID to support new research on celiac disease, to better coordinate existing research, and to focus new re-search towards diagnosing and effectively treating this condition. The Committee also strongly encourages NIH to establish a Re-search Condition, Disease Categorization (RCDC) for celiac disease and a Notice of Special Interest to spur additional research. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul for AIDS Research. \u2014As part of the Ending the HIV Epi- demic initiative, the Committee includes $71,000,000 for the Cen-ters for AIDS Research, an increase of $10,000,000 above the esti-mated fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. These Centers offer evidence-based prac-tices on prevention and treatment to initiative partners and sup-port for evaluating the initiative. Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. \u2014The Committee sup- ports NIAID's efforts related to combating antibiotic-resistant bac-teria. These funds enable NIAID to support research on anti-microbial (drug) resistance, including basic research on how mi-crobes develop resistance, new and faster diagnostics, and clinical trials designed to find new vaccines and treatments effective against drug-resistant microbes. Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR). \u2014The Committee recognizes the serious issue of food allergies which affect approxi-mately eight percent of children and ten percent of adults in the U.S. The Committee commends the ongoing work of NIAID in sup-porting a total of 17 clinical sites for this critical research, includ-ing seven sites as part of the CoFAR. The Committee includes $12,200,000, an increase of $6,100,000, for CoFAR to expand its clinical research network to add new centers of excellence in food allergy clinical care and to select such centers from those with proven expertise in food allergy research. Emerging Diseases. \u2014The Committee supports the work of NIAID in researching emerging coronaviruses, and urges NIAID to fund basic science on a host of deadly viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, Marburg, and Nipah viruses. The Committee notes the im-portance of using high containment BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs in this effort. The Committee is aware of the success of non-animal ap-proaches to identify how viral proteins interact with host proteins and their pathways. The Committee notes the success of these ap-proaches with SARS-CoV-2 to identify new therapeutic ap-proaches. The Committee encourages NIAID to support research into viruses, including Ebola, Marburg, and Nipah viruses, to help identify small molecule drugs to block infection by a host of deadly viruses. Hereditary Angioedema (HAE). \u2014The Committee recognizes NIAID for its ongoing stewardship of the HAE research portfolio, including advancements that have taken HAE from a debilitating and fatal condition to a manageable chronic disease. The Com-mittee notes the potential of gene therapy and other cutting-edge research to further improve health outcomes for HAE patients and encourages NIAID to maintain the commitment to the HAE re-search at this critical time. Microbicides. \u2014The Committee recognizes that with NIH and USAID leadership, research has shown the potential for antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to prevent HIV infection in women. The Committee encourages NIH to continue coordination with USAID, the State Department, and others to advance ARV-based microbicide development efforts, with the goal of enabling regu-latory approvals of the first safe and effective microbicide for women and supporting an active ARV-based microbicide pipeline to produce additional solutions to prevent HIV and to help end the epidemic. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Vaccine Development Platforms for Emerging Infectious Disease. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of being able to quickly, efficiently, and safely develop and manufacture vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. Vaccines play a pivotal role in host protection against infectious diseases and have significantly reduced mortality worldwide. Older methods of developing vaccines are no match for a host of emerging and reemerging pathogens that call for a tailored and speedy response, such as the developing coronavirus variants. Today, innovations in how vaccines are devel-oped enable faster production of platforms capable of making and initially testing a new vaccine in less than 120 days that then are tailored to specific pathogens as manufacturing begins, based on science and data, not speculation. Such rapid vaccine platform technologies can vastly decrease the time it takes to develop, man-ufacture and distribute vaccines. Therefore, the Committee in-cludes $50,000,000 to support research and development of rapid vaccine platform technologies and requests a briefing on these ef-forts within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) .\u2014The Committee commends NIAID for issuing a Request for Applications (RFA) to support the RBLs through the RFA for Facility and Building Sys-tem Upgrades Support for the RBLs. The Committee encourages NIAID to continue supporting meritorious research applications from investigators conducting research through the RBLs on efforts to prevent, prepare for, and respond to infectious disease out-breaks, including, but not limited to: (1) conducting research on de-veloping testing for antiviral compounds, new vaccines, and point of care tests; (2) conducting research on validating methods for identifying suitable prophylactic methods to prevent infections; and (3) training new researchers in biosafety level 3 practices. Universal Influenza Vaccine. \u2014The Committee includes no less than $250,000,000, an increase of $30,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to support basic, translational, and clinical research to develop a universal in-fluenza vaccine that provides robust, long-lasting protection against multiple subtypes of flu, rather than a select few. Such a vaccine would eliminate the need to update and administer the seasonal flu vaccine each year and could provide protection against newly emerging flu strains, potentially including those that could cause a flu pandemic. The Committee requests an update on these efforts within 60 days of enactment of this Act. Valley Fever. \u2014The Committee is encouraged by NIAID's recent announcement to establish collaborative coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) research centers. To guide this continuing work, the Com-mittee requests, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, a 10- year strategic plan from NIH with the objective of producing a Val-ley Fever vaccine by 2031. This plan should include, but not be lim-ited to: (1) a statement of science on Valley Fever, including dis-ease burden in the U.S.; (2) identifiable and achievable benchmarks for Valley Fever vaccine development, including vaccine market vi-ability; (3) identifying or developing funding priorities and opportu-nities that actively support the development of a Valley Fever vac-cine; and (4) any recommendations to Congress on policy reforms designed to help develop a Valley Fever vaccine. Furthermore, the Committee directs NIAID to convene a stakeholder and researchers VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 conference in an endemic region to help guide the strategic plan's development. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on progress towards achieving goals in this strategic plan. Viral Vector Platforms. \u2014The Committee notes that viral vector platforms have a proven track record for successfully producing vaccines against infectious diseases for many decades and believes well-established viral vectors with a robust safety record for use in children, pregnant women, or other high-risk populations should be continuously developed and adjusted to potential emerging infec-tions in the future. The Committee encourages investments in vac-cine centers with long-term experience in the development of viral vectors covering multiple virus-based vaccine platforms, with par-ticular emphasis on entities that have established collaborations with high-security facilities (BSL-4) for preclinical studies. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES (NIGMS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $2,991,417,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 3,139,656,000 Change from +148,239,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +43,553,000 Mission. \u2014NIGMS supports basic research that increases our un- derstanding of biological processes and lays the foundation for ad-vances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Increasing Diversity in Biomedical Research .\u2014The Committee has long sought to promote opportunities for the Nation's next gen-eration of researchers and enhance diversity in biomedical re-search. Early-stage researchers, particularly women and racial and ethnic minorities, spend longer periods of time in postdoctoral posi-tions with lower salaries, receive inadequate mentorship, and are offered fewer opportunities for professional advancement, resulting in lower retention rates for these groups. Even with these obsta-cles, many early-stage researchers tackle riskier projects and have seen positive outcomes for the benefit of society. Grant programs offering support and opportunities for researchers at key career transition points requiring little or no preliminary data, are critical to ensuring innovative scientists from diverse backgrounds succeed in biomedical research. The Committee provides an increase of $20,000,000 for NIGMS for programs, including but not limited to the Maximizing Opportunities for Scientific and Academic Inde-pendent Careers (MOSAIC), Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC), Bridges to the Baccalaureate, and Undergraduate Re-search Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U RISE) pro-grams, that train the next generation of scientists while enhancing the diversity of the biomedical research workforce and enabling promising scientists to pursue high-risk, high-reward research. Institutional Development Awards (IDeA). \u2014The Committee pro- vides $415,000,000 for IDeA, $18,427,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. IDeA supports high-quality research and inves-tigators throughout the country in States in which the success rate for NIH grants has been historically low. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT (NICHD) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $1,590,337,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 1,689,786,000 Change from +99,449,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5252,331,000 Mission. \u2014NICHD investigates human development throughout the entire life process, with a focus on understanding disabilities and important events that occur during pregnancy. The Committee commends the important role that NICHD has historically served to support research in the areas of behavioral health, cognition, development of young children, language, learn-ing differences, and school readiness. The COVID pandemic has only increased the importance of research in these areas, such as the long-term consequences of social isolation or emotional develop- ment after a year of inconsistent in-person school attendance. Ac-cordingly, the Committee encourages NICHD to prioritize ongoing investment in these areas. Endometriosis Research. \u2014The Committee urges NICHD to ex- pand funding for basic, clinical, and translational research into the mechanics of endometriosis, identify early diagnostic markets, and develop new treatment methods. Human Milk Research. \u2014The Committee encourages NICHD to continue to support human milk research through peer-reviewed scientific research and graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The Committee encourages NICHD to connect at least four, but not more than 10, centers for human milk research to establish a re-search center network to support shared resources and facilities for human milk research and any required infrastructure. Impact of COVID-19 on Children. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $15,000,000, as requested in the fiscal year 2022 budg-et, for NICHD to support additional research into multisystem in-flammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and other ways in which COVID-19 affects children. The Committee looks forward to receiv-ing NIH's SARS-CoV-2 pediatric research agenda and asks NIH to continue identifying research needs focused on the novel coronavirus impacts on children and adolescents, exploring how pe-diatric patients have been included in current NIH SARS-CoV-2 research and clinical trials, investigating any disparities that have emerged in how children of different communities have been af-fected, assessing the risk and protective factors children may produce against COVID-19 antigens, investigating longer-term im-pacts of SARS-CoV-2 on child health, and pursuing research fo-cused on treatments and prevention methods for SARS-CoV-2 fo-cused on children and adolescents when carrying out this agenda. Learning Disabilities Research Centers and Learning Disabilities Innovation Hubs. \u2014The Committee is increasingly concerned with the decline in achievement for students with disabilities and recog-nizes the need for continued research and improved interventions, particularly in light of the COVID-19 crisis, which has led to sig-nificant loss of in-person instruction for many students. The Com-mittee recognizes the importance of NICHD's funding of Learning Disabilities Research Centers and Learning Disabilities Innovation Hubs, which are the only source of Federal funding available to re- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul searchers interested in exploring child development and learning disabilities to conduct randomized control trials and explore the re-lationships between different variables at work. While learning dis-abilities do impact an individual's education and academic achieve-ment, these disorders are brain-based, and so clinical research using the latest technology and advances in neuroscience is essen-tial. To continue robust research into language, reading develop-ment, learning disabilities, and disorders that adversely affect the development of listening, speaking, reading, writing, and mathe-matics abilities, the Committee urges NICHD to continue its in-vestment in its Learning Disabilities Research Centers and Learn-ing Disabilities Innovation Hubs. Male Reproductive Health. \u2014The Committee urges NICHD to con- tinue to support research on male mechanisms of infertility. There is a gap in the knowledge of how to diagnose and treat male infer-tility, often resulting in women undergoing unnecessary treatments due to undiagnosed or untreated male partner infertility. The Com-mittee supports research to identify new proteins and sperm struc-tures that are necessary for normal sperm function and, con-sequently, for fertility and healthy embryo development. Maternal Health Research. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $30,000,000 for the Implementing a Maternal Health and Preg-nancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone (IMPROVE) Initiative, as re-quested in the fiscal year 2022 budget. Maternal mortality in the U.S. is higher than in other industrialized nations, and there are disparities in maternal outcomes across the country. For example, Black women experience maternal mortality at nearly four times the rate of White women. The IMPROVE Initiative advances re-search to reduce preventable causes of maternal deaths and im-prove health for pregnant and postpartum individuals before, dur-ing, and after delivery. The initiative uses an integrated approach to understand biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and structural factors that affect severe maternal mortality and maternal mor-tality (SMM/MM) by building an evidence base for improved care and outcomes in specific regions of the country. IMPROVE will tar-get health disparities associated with SMM/MM by (1) imple-menting and evaluating community-based interventions for dis-proportionately affected women (e.g., African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, advanced maternal age, low socioeconomic status, and rural populations), and (2) identifying risk factors and the underlying biological mechanisms associated with leading causes of SMM/MM, including cardiovascular disease, infection and immunity, and mental health. Population Research. \u2014The Committee applauds NICHD for sup- porting many of the Nation's most used prospective, population- representative longitudinal studies, including the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child Supplement Survey, and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, and also for supporting research and research training through the NICHD Population Dynamics Centers Research Infrastructure Pro-gram. Given the dearth of data being collected regarding the short and long-term social, economic, developmental, and health effects of the COVID pandemic on children and families, the Committee urges NICHD to consider expanding data collection and research through these existing surveys and the Centers Program. Further, VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Committee encourages NICHD to explore the use of existing and new mechanisms to enhance research regarding the effect of COVID on fertility trends and reproductive health overall. Finally, the Committee urges NICHD to expand data collection and re-search regarding maternal, infant, child, and adolescent mortality. The Committee asks that NICHD report on its progress to enhance and expand these research and survey activities within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Research in Pregnant and Lactating Women. \u2014The Committee is pleased with the progress being made by the Task Force on Re-search Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women (PRGLAC) in identifying and developing strategies to address gaps in knowledge and research on safe and effective therapies for preg-nant and lactating women. The Committee encourages NICHD, along with other relevant Institutes and Centers, CDC, and FDA, to continue to implement PRGLAC recommendations to the extent appropriate and feasible under the legal authorities available to the Secretary. Additionally, The Committee includes $1,500,000 within NICHD to contract with the National Academies of Science, Education, and Medicine (NASEM) to convene a panel with specific legal, ethical, regulatory, and policy expertise to develop a framework for ad-dressing medicolegal and liability issues when planning or con-ducting research specific to pregnant people and lactating people. Specifically, this panel should include individuals with ethical and legal expertise in clinical trials and research; regulatory expertise; plaintiffs' attorneys; pharmaceutical representatives with tort li- ability and research expertise; insurance industry representatives; Federally funded researchers who work with pregnant and lac-tating women; representatives of institutional review boards (IRBs); and health policy experts. Uterine Fibroids. \u2014Nationally, an estimated 26,000,000 individ- uals ages 15 to 50 have diagnosed uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids are the most common gynecological condition, but individuals are frequently unaware that the symptoms of this condition, including heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, and frequent urination during pe-riods, are abnormal. Fibroids contribute to significant negative health outcomes including chronic pain, iron deficiency and ane-mia, miscarriage, and/or infertility. The Committee strongly urges the NICHD to prioritize funding to expand basic, clinical, and translational research into the mechanics of fibroids, identification of early diagnostic methods, and fertility-preserving treatments. Research focusing on understanding the significant health dispari-ties among individuals with fibroids should also be prioritized, given that Black women are at increased risk for fibroids, tend to develop symptoms at a younger age, and suffer more severe symp-toms. NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE (NEI) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $835,714,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 877,129,000 Change from +41,415,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +18,594,000 \u2014NEI conducts and supports basic and clinical research, research training, and other programs with respect to blinding eye diseases, visual disorders, and mechanisms of visual function, pres-ervation of sight, and the special health problems and needs of in-dividuals who are visually-impaired or blind. Blepharospasm. \u2014The Committee notes the work of NEI in ex- panding research into blepharospasm, a form of dystonia, and re-quests an update on collaboration amongst stakeholders and other Institutes and Centers. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES (NIEHS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $814,675,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 941,799,000 Change from +127,124,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +4,692,000 Mission. \u2014NIEHS's mission is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. Climate Change Research. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $100,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for NIEHS to support research on the impact of climate change on human health. Harmful Algal Blooms Research. \u2014The Committee recognizes the value of the NIEHS mission and the NIEHS NSF jointly-funded Oceans and Human Health Program as a means to increase sci-entific knowledge about short-term and long-term human health ef-fects potentially associated with acute and chronic exposures to tox-ins produced by harmful algal blooms (HABs). The Committee rec-ognizes the increasing relevance of this scientific research to com-munities directly affected by HABs, including Florida, where a 16- month bloom one of the longest documented HABs in the State's history occurred from late 2017 through early 2019. The Committee encourages NIEHS to continue investing in this research area using its competitive, peer-reviewed grantmaking processes. In par-ticular, the Committee notes growing scientific interest in the use of multidisciplinary approaches to investigate respiratory irritation or illness associated with inhalation of aerosolized HAB toxins and with neurotoxic shellfish poisoning arising from ingestion of con-taminated seafood. The Committee commends NIEHS for its col-laborations with other agencies, including NSF, NOAA, EPA, and CDC, to advance such research and translate key research findings for clinical and public health benefits. Parkinson's Disease. \u2014Research suggests that Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental fac-tors. Agricultural exposure to pesticides, including herbicides, has been associated with an increased risk of developing the disease, yet other exposures common to soldiers, firefighters, first respond-ers and others, such as burn pits, insecticides, solvents and heavy metals, need to be explored or should be considered. The Com-mittee urges NIEHS to expand its research and collaborate with appropriate partners to understand effects of these chemicals on PD development and progression. Research should include funda-mental approaches to identify other environmental triggers and to understand the expression of PD traits that result from the inter-play of genes and environment to advance the development of indi- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 environmental health strategies to prevent and treat PD. The Committee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING (NIA) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $3,899,227,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 4,258,049,000 Change from +358,822,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +222,458,000 Mission. \u2014NIA's mission is to understand the nature of aging and the aging process, and diseases and conditions associated with growing older, in order to extend the healthy, active years of life. Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias. \u2014In recognition that Alzheimer's disease poses a serious threat to the nation's long-term health and economic stability, the Committee recommends a total of no less than $3,394,000,000 for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias research, $200,000,000 above the estimated fiscal year 2021 level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Center on Exposome Studies in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of mechanistic research to address ADRD disparities, including the social and contextual factors that contribute to increased risk for disease. The Committee directs NIA to establish research infra-structure in the form of a Center(s) on Exposome Studies in ADRD, which would enable the linkage of community and health system- level factors to biological outcomes including cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to disease. This includes linking social and biological factors via characterization of the exposome, the measure of all the exposures of an individual over the life course (e.g. phys-ical, chemical, environmental, social), characterized through a mechanistic disparities lens. The Committee includes $15,000,000 to facilitate these efforts to provide a cornerstone of health dispari-ties operations to advance solutions, innovations, and cures. Diversity in Alzheimer's Disease Research. \u2014The Committee com- mends NIA for its leadership in supporting longitudinal, popu-lation-based cohort studies into the causes of dementia. Since rural, poor, and minority populations may be at greater risk for dementia, the value and application of these studies are enhanced when they include individuals from various geographic, ethnic, socioeconomic, and generational backgrounds. The Committee urges NIA to con-tinue to support diversity in its cohort studies, with the specific goal of better understanding disease burden and biomarkers by race and geographic region, as well as the underlying pathologies which may differ by race. Elder Abuse. \u2014The Committee commends NIA for its research on developing linguistically and culturally appropriate tools to combat elder abuse and financial exploitation and improve the identifica-tion and reporting of elder abuse. The Committee is pleased by ef-forts to facilitate cross-Institute collaborations, such as the 2015 Workshop on Multiple Approaches to Understanding and Pre-venting Elder Abuse and Mistreatment. The Committee urges NIH to utilize innovative means such as inter-institute workshops, im-proved cross-agency coordination, or the Project ECHO telemen-toring model with aging professionals and housing providers to VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul translate and disseminate information to combat elder abuse in di- verse populations. Opioids and Pain/Pain Management Research .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $29,000,000 for NIA to support research re-lated to opioids, pain, and pain management, as requested in the fiscal year 2022 budget. Overactive Bladder and Cognitive Impairment Treatment. \u2014The Committee is concerned that anticholinergic medications commonly prescribed to treat overactive bladder, a condition that affects one in three older Americans, have been shown in recent studies to in-crease the risk of developing ADRD. The Committee believes that further research of anticholinergic medications as well as on alter-natives to these treatments is urgently needed to establish cer-tainty regarding the safety of these medications as a treatment op-tion for overactive bladder in older adults. The Committee urges NIA to prioritize research grants and contracts that study the long- term use of anticholinergic medications and the risk of cognitive impairment and ADRD. The Committee requests an update on this issue and on research activities to advance safe and effective alter-native treatments for overactive bladder in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Population Research. \u2014The Committee praises NIA for sup- porting a scientifically innovative population aging research port-folio that reflects some of the Institute's, and Nation's, highest sci-entific priorities, including Alzheimer's disease and social inequal-ity in health and the aging process. More research, however, is needed to understand the short and long-term social, behavioral, and economic health consequences of COVID-19 on older people and their families, which NIA is uniquely positioned to foster and support. Existing large-scale, longitudinal and panel surveys, such as the Health and Retirement Study, the National Health and Aging Trends Study, and Understanding America Study, should be enhanced to facilitate scientific research on the complex, multi-faceted effects of the pandemic on older, diverse populations. Fur-ther, the Committee encourages NIA to support the further devel-opment of data infrastructure to promote research on racial, ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic disparities in health and well-being in later life and the long-term effects of early life experiences. The Committee asks that NIA to report on its progress to enhance and expand these research and survey activities within 90 days of en-actment of this Act. Prion Diseases. \u2014The Committee encourages NIH to continue funding research proposals on prion diseases that could be relevant for ADRD. The disease mechanism and clinical presentation of prion diseases closely resemble AD/ADRDs. Advances in prion dis-ease science have been valuable to the study of other ADRDs and vice versa, and further integration of the fields will benefit sci-entific pursuits in both fields. Thalassemia. \u2014Thanks to significant advances in medical science, thalassemia patients and others dealing with chronic diseases are now living well into adulthood, some even into their 60s. While this is a tremendous victory for research, it has opened new questions. Among these are female and male reproductive issues, the impact of non-disease related medicines, the relationship to diseases of aging such as ADRD, Parkinson's, arthritis, osteoporosis, and more. VerDate Sep 11 2014 The Committee requests that NIA develop a plan to research comorbidities in thalassemia and other rare disease patient popu-lations as they continue to age. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASES (NIAMS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $634,292,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 679,410,000 Change from +45,118,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5776,000 Mission .\u2014NIAMS's mission is to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases; the training of basic and clinical scientists to carry out this research; and the dissemination of information on re-search progress in these diseases. Opioids and Pain/Pain Management Research .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $24,000,000 for NIAMS to support research related to opioids, pain, and pain management, as requested in the fiscal year 2022 budget. Skin Disease Research Core Centers .\u2014The Committee recognizes the important work at the Core Centers funded by NIAMS to con-duct basic and clinical research on a variety of skin diseases, in-cluding inflammatory and infectious skin diseases. The Committee urges NIAMS to fund Centers with diverse geographic locations, and to encourage proposals that incorporate pediatric skin diseases and collaboration with diverse stakeholders, such as States or pa-tient and provider groups. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS (NIDCD) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $498,076,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 522,758,000 Change from +24,682,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +10,966,000 Mission .\u2014NIDCD conducts and supports biomedical and behav- ioral research and research training in the normal and disordered processes of hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and lan-guage. NIDCD also conducts and supports research and research training related to disease prevention and health promotion; ad-dresses special biomedical and behavioral problems associated with people who have communication impairments or disorders; and supports efforts to create devices which substitute for lost and im-paired sensory and communication function. Spasmodic Dysphonia .\u2014The Committee notes the research NIDCD continues to facilitate on spasmodic dysphonia. The Com-mittee requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justificationon collaborative efforts with related Institutes, Centers, and stakeholders to advance critical research into all forms of dystonia, including spasmodic dysphonia. VerDate Sep 11 RESEARCH (NINR) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $174,957,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 200,782,000 Change from +25,825,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +1,027,000 Mission .\u2014The mission of NINR is to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and communities. To achieve this mission, NINR supports and conducts clinical and basic research and research training on health and illness, research that spans and integrates the behavioral and biological sciences, and develops the scientific basis for clinical practice. Health Disparities Research .\u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $20,000,000 for NINR to support research related to iden-tifying and reducing health disparities, the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM (NIAAA) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $554,923,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 582,422,000 Change from +27,499,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +12,257,000 Mission .\u2014NIAAA's mission is to generate and disseminate fun- damental knowledge about the effects of alcohol on health and well-being, and apply that knowledge to improve diagnosis, preven-tion, and treatment of alcohol-related problems, including alcohol use disorder, across the lifespan. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE (NIDA) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $1,479,660,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 1,860,329,000 Change from +380,669,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +7,826,000 Mission .\u2014NIDA's mission is to advance science on the causes and consequences of drug use and addiction and to apply that knowledge to improve individual and public health. Addiction Intervention .\u2014The Committee is deeply concerned by alarming trends related to the addiction in the U.S. The number of alcohol-related deaths doubled in the US from 1999 to 2017, the age-adjusted rate of deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone increased 1,040 percent from 2013 to 2019, and the use of psychostimulants increased 317 percent. One trait that is evi-dent in every form of addiction is the excessive discounting of the future by the addicted person, who will value the immediate over benefits of the future. Episodic Future Thinking is a promising intervention that helps individuals who are predisposed to addic-tion consider the positive consequences of remaining sober through a mental simulation of positive events that might occur in the fu-ture. The Committee encourages NIDA to support transdisciplinary research that incorporates neuroscience, behavioral research, neuroeconomics, brain imaging, decision-science, engineering, and computer science to deploy Episodic Future Thinking intervention strategies across a range of addictions. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul to sup- port multidisciplinary cannabis research, including basic, clinical, and translational cannabis research and research on the health effects of cannabis use, potential therapeutic effects of cannabis use, and effects of cannabis legalization. NIDA is encour-aged to support peer-reviewed scientific research, graduate and postdoctoral fellowships, and any required infrastructure, with pri-ority given to research programs in States where State co-funding is available. Cannabidiol Research .\u2014The in cannabis\u2014 may provide beneficial medicinal effects. However, there is insuffi-cient scientific information about the short- and long-term effects of these compounds. The Committee is also concerned that mari-juana policies on the Federal level and in the States are being changed without the benefit of scientific research to help guide those decisions. Additional, coordinated research on a national scale is necessary to determine the toxicology and medicinal effects of these compounds. The Committee believes that NIH should con-sider significantly expanding funds to study the medicinal effects and toxicology of CBD, CBG, CBC, minor cannabinoids, and terpenes. This expanded effort should include funding of clinical trials with academic health centers to study the long-term medic-inal benefits and toxicology of CBD, CBG, CBC, minor cannabinoids, and terpenes. The Committee encourages NIH to continue supporting a full range of research on the health effects of marijuana and its components, including research to understand how marijuana policies affect public health. Drug Impairment Standards for Marijuana .\u2014The Committee is concerned that development of a drug impairment standard for marijuana remains unlikely in the near term and encourages NIH to continue supporting a full range of research on the health effects of marijuana and its components, including research to understand how marijuana policies affect behaviors that impact public health, such as drug-impaired driving. The Committee is aware that due to Drug Enforcement Administration restrictions on registered growers, the majority of Federal research using marijuana has been limited to marijuana produced by a single grower and encour-ages NIH, when possible, to undertake research that encompasses the diversity, quality, and potency of commonly available cannabis products. Kratom .\u2014The Committee recognizes that NIDA-funded research has contributed to the continued understanding of the health im-pacts of kratom, including its constituent compounds, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. The Committee is aware of the poten-tial promising results of kratom for acute and chronic pain patients who seek safer alternatives to sometimes dangerously addictive and potentially deadly prescription opioids and of research inves-tigating the use of kratom's constituent compounds for opioid use disorder. The Committee directs NIDA to continue to invest in this important research, especially considering the increase in overdose deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methamphetamine and Other Stimulants .\u2014The Committee is concerned that, according to CDC, over 30,000 overdose deaths in- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 in the drug categories that include methamphetamine and cocaine in 2019, an increase of over threefold since 2014. The sharp increase has led some to refer to stimulant overdoses as the ''fourth wave'' of the current drug addiction crisis in America fol-lowing the rise of opioid-related deaths involving prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl-related substances. Methamphetamine is highly addictive and there are no FDA-approved treatments for methamphetamine and other stimulant use disorders. The Com-mittee continues to support NIDA's efforts to address the opioid cri-sis, has provided continued funding for the HEAL Initiative, and supports NIDA's efforts to combat the growing problem of meth-amphetamine and other stimulant use and related deaths. Opioid and Stimulant Research .\u2014The Committee continues to be concerned about the opioid overdose epidemic and appreciates the important role that research plays in the various Federal initia-tives aimed at this crisis. The Committee is also aware of the most recent data from CDC that shows opioid overdose fatalities increas-ing from 2018 to 2019, with the primary driver being the increased overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, primarily illicitly man-ufactured fentanyls. To combat this crisis, the Committee includes $405,400,000 within NIDA for the HEAL Initiative, $135,105,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The HEAL Initiative is a trans-NIH ef-fort to accelerate scientific discovery related to prevention and treatment of opioid use disorder and developing nonaddictive alter-natives for pain management. In response to rising rates of stimu-lant use and overdose, the Committee has included language ex-panding the allowable use of these funds to include research re-lated to stimulant use and addiction. The Committee also includes an additional $196,300,000 in NIDA to support basic research re-lated to opioids and other stimulants, as requested in the fiscal year 2022 budget. Overdose Prevention Centers .\u2014The Committee recognizes that overdose prevention centers, or supervised consumption sites, are part of a larger effort of harm reduction interventions intended to reduce the risk of drug overdose death and reduce the spread of in-fectious disease. The Committee directs NIH, in consultation with CDC, to provide a report to the Committee no later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act that provides an updated literature review and evaluation on the potential public health impact of overdose prevention centers in the U.S. Pain Prescribing Education .\u2014The Committee encourages NIDA to continue and expand efforts to educate physicians and other medical professionals on safe prescribing for pain and managing patients who abuse prescription opioids, as well as best practices for incorporating substance misuse and addiction screening and treatment into their clinical practices. Raising Awareness and Engaging the Medical Community in Drug Use and Addiction Prevention and Treatment .\u2014Education is a critical component of any effort to curb drug use and addiction, and it must target every segment of society, including health care providers (doctors, nurses, dentists, and pharmacists), patients, and families. Medical professionals must be in the forefront of ef-forts to curb the opioid crisis. The Committee continues to be pleased with the NIDAMED initiative, targeting physicians in- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 including medical students and resident physicians in pri- mary care specialties ( e.g., internal medicine, family practice, and pediatrics). NIDA should continue its efforts in this area, providing physicians and other medical professionals with the tools and skills needed to incorporate substance use and misuse screening and treatment into their clinical practices. The Committee recommends that NIDA continue to support the education of scientists and prac-titioners to find improved prevention and treatments for substance use disorders. Schedule I Drug Research .\u2014The Committee recognizes that, de- spite marijuana being legalized in some form in 35 States and nearly 45,000,000 American adults reporting having used mari-juana in the past year, research on marijuana and other Schedule I substances is extremely limited. The Committee directs NIH, in collaboration with FDA, DEA, ONDCP, and any other relevant agencies, to develop an approach to facilitate access to Schedule I drugs for research. Sleep and Circadian-Dependent Mechanisms Contributing to Opioid Use Disorder .\u2014The Committee notes NIDA's continued sup- port in research to better understand opioid use disorder and urges engagement with stakeholders to examine contributing factors, in-cluding sleep and circadian-dependent mechanisms. Tobacco Regulatory Science Program .\u2014The Committee supports the Tobacco Regulatory Science Program and encourages NIH to increase funding for research into the understanding of nicotine ad-diction and to spur the development of better prevention and treat-ment strategies. Of particular importance is funding for research for effective interventions to help youth and young adults to quit tobacco use or vaping, and to understand the interrelationship be-tween the vaping of tobacco and marijuana. The Committee directs NIDA to conduct interdisciplinary research on this topic with an emphasis on risk perceptions, decision-making and neuroscience. Underage and Perinatal Marijuana Use .\u2014The Committee in- cludes $2,000,000 for NIDA to enter into a contract with NASEM to commission a study to determine the scope of the problem of un-derage and perinatal marijuana use and effective ways of reducing it. Topics explored should include but not be limited to the demo-graphics of underage and perinatal marijuana use; its economic and social costs; adolescent and perinatal decision making and risk and protective factors; and the effectiveness of various prevention programs and approaches, including media campaigns, school- based education, pricing, and access. The NAS will develop a strat-egy for reducing and preventing underage and perinatal consump-tion of today's marijuana and THC products, specifically focused on the impacts of THC on the developing brain. To help develop an effective strategy, the NAS shall review exist- ing Federal, State, and non-governmental programs, including media-based programs, that have been shown to be effective with other substances that can be harmful to youth, including any done on marijuana, that are designed to change the attitudes and health behaviors of youth (those under the age of 21). In addition, the NAS shall review existing Federal, State, and non-governmental programs including media-based programs, that have been shown to be effective with other substances that can be harmful to babies of pregnant and breast-feeding women, including VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 marijuana, that are designed to change the atti- tudes and health behaviors of pregnant and breast-feeding women. Based on its reviews, the NAS shall produce a strategy designed to prevent and reduce underage consumption of today's marijuana and THC products in addition to a strategy designed to prevent and reduce consumption of today's marijuana and THC products by pregnant and breast-feeding women. This shall include but not be limited to: an outline and implementation strategy, message points that will be effective in changing the attitudes and health behav-iors of youth concerning underage marijuana consumption and an outline and implementation strategy, message points that will be effective in changing the attitudes and health behaviors of preg-nant and breast-feeding women, target audience identification, goals and objectives of both campaigns, and the estimated costs of development and implementation. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH (NIMH) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $2,103,708,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 2,223,085,000 Change from +119,377,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +9,511,000 Mission .\u2014NIMH's mission is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. Autism .\u2014The Committee encourages NIH to continue to prioritize and invest in research on autism consistent with the rec-ommendations included in the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee's (IACC) Strategic Plan for Autism Spectrum Disorder. However, while significant progress has been made in our under-standing of autism because of Federally-funded research, large gaps remain that must be addressed to improve outcomes and ac-cess to services for autistic individuals and their families. Research has shown that autistic individuals have higher rates of some co- occurring physical and mental health conditions, which not only lead to quality of life issues, but also increased medical utilization and costs. Similarly, to address the racial, ethnic, and socio-economic health equity challenges experienced by autistic individ-uals and their families, it is imperative that greater investment is made to address disparities in access to services and interventions. The Committee encourages NIH to support greater investment in research focused on particular areas in need of growth, outlined in the strategic plan, including research on lifespan issues to address the needs of transition-age youth and adults on the spectrum, re-search to enable development of evidence-based services, and re-search to support the development and delivery of new and im-proved screening tools, treatments and interventions. The Com-mittee further encourages NIMH to work collaboratively with NIMHD to support research on the socioeconomic, racial, and eth-nic health disparities associated with autism spectrum disorder. BRAIN Initiative .\u2014The Committee directs NIH to transfer $76,000,000 from the NIH Innovation Account to NIMH to support the BRAIN Initiative. These funds are authorized by the 21st Cen-tury Cures Act (P.L. 114-255). This collaborative effort is revolu-tionizing our understanding of how neural components and their VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 interactions result in complex behaviors, cognition, and disease, while accelerating the development of transformative tools to explore the brain in unprecedented ways making information previously beyond reach accessible. Impact of COVID on Mental Health .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $25,000,000 for NIMH to expand research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, as requested in the fiscal year 2022 budget. Suicide Prevention .\u2014The Committee is encouraged that 2019 was the first year in two decades in which the suicide rate de-creased. However, death by suicide remains the tenth leading cause of death in the U.S., and the Committee remains committed to providing the resources necessary to address this alarming cri-sis. The Committee commends NIMH for consistently expanding re-sources for suicide screening and prevention research over the last four fiscal years and strongly encourages the Institute to continue to prioritize suicide research in fiscal year 2022, with special em-phasis on producing models that are interpretable, scalable, and practical for clinical implementation, including utilization of health care, education, and criminal justice systems that serve populations at risk. In addition, the Committee encourages NIMH to prioritize research efforts related to primary care settings to evaluate suicide prevention interventions, strategies, and programs, including as-sessments of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Com-mittee requests that NIMH provide an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE (NHGRI) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $615,780,000 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 646,295,000 Change from +30,515,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +13,322,000 Mission .\u2014NHGRI's mission is to accelerate scientific and medical breakthroughs that improve human health by driving cutting-edge research, developing new technologies, and studying the impact of genomics on society. Computational Medicine and RNA Molecules .\u2014The Committee is encouraged by recent discoveries in the computational medicine field that are helping uncover more of the causes behind disease onset and disease progression. Multiple reports, in many human diseases and conditions, provide compelling evidence that an indi-vidual's sex, ancestry, and age differentially affect the individual's regulatory RNA molecules and their impacts. The Committee recog-nizes that more research in this area could lead to new and impor-tant biological discoveries, improve our understanding of disease processes, and herald highly personalized approaches to diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. The Committee urges NHGRI to continue to support computational and experimental research on RNA mol-ecules and the mechanisms through which they affect biological processes that cause disease. Emerging Centers of Excellence in Genomic Sciences .\u2014The Com- mittee provides no less than $15,000,000 to sustain and grow the Emerging Centers of Excellence in Genomic Sciences competitive grant program, an increase of $2,500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 VerDate Sep 11 2014 level. The Committee maintains prior direction that present awardees of the Centers for Excellence in Genomic Sciences program shall not be eligible to receive these grants. Germline RUNX1 Mutations .\u2014The Committee commends NHGRI for collaborating with NCI to launch and maintain the RUNX1-FPD Clinical Research Study, the only longitudinal nat-ural history study of patients with germline RUNX1 mutations and their families. This study has broad implications for the fields of hematology and oncology because it offers researchers the rare op-portunity to monitor the genomic evolution of cancer within a precancerous population in real time. Currently, the study tracks only 50 of the approximately 20,000 people in the U.S. with these mutations. The Committee encourages NHGRI to continue sup-porting this study. In addition, the Committee encourages NHGRI to continue to work towards the implementation of an open source database to share data in real-time for the benefit of the entire re-search community and the patients and their families searching for answers. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING (NIBIB) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $410,728,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 431,081,000 Change from Change from budget request ...................................................... +9,042,000 Mission .\u2014The NIBIB mission is to improve health by leading the development and accelerating the application of biomedical tech-nologies. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES (NIMHD) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $390,865,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 661,879,000 Change from +271,014,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +9,635,000 Mission. \u2014NIMHD's mission is to lead scientific research to im- prove minority health and reduce health disparities. Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). \u2014The Committee en- courages NIMHD to collaborate with other Institutes, Centers, and stakeholders to expand research opportunities on the APOL1 gene that causes African Americans to be disproportionately affected by FSGS. Mercury in Beauty Products .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the prevalence of cosmetics containing dangerous levels of mercury made available through online sales and increased global travel. Evidence suggests that these harmful unregulated cosmetics, such as skin lightening creams, are disproportionately used by women of color. The Committee encourages NIMHD to collaborate with FDA to identify research gaps in the understanding of the health effects of these products. Research Centers at Minority Institutions .\u2014The Committee in- cludes $88,000,000, an increase of $8,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for RCMIs to ensure that infrastructure development in historically VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul graduate and health professional schools continue to en- hance to meet these critical needs. The Committee also recognizes the importance of the RCMI Coordinating Center in ensuring that collectively, institutions can engage in multi-site collaborative re-search, especially as the U.S. and NIH positioned themselves to ad-dress the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic to our health system and underserved populations. The Committee encourages the NIMHD to continue following Congressional intent for the RCMI program and follow the spirit of the original instructions provided to NIH by Congress. The Com-mittee notes the original intent of the RCMI program is to provide equitable means for health professions institutions with historical missions and precedence of serving minorities and building re-search infrastructure. Health Disparities Research .\u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $250,000,000 for NIMHD to support additional research related to identifying and reducing health disparities, as requested in the fiscal year 2022 budget. Rural Health. \u2014Rural Americans are a population group that ex- periences significant health disparities. Health disparities are dif-ferences in health status when compared to the population overall, often characterized by indicators such as higher incidence of dis-ease and/or disability, increased mortality rates, lower life expectancies, and higher rates of pain and suffering. Rural risk fac-tors for health disparities include geographic isolation, lower socio-economic status, higher rates of health risk behaviors, limited ac-cess to healthcare specialists and subspecialists, and limited job op-portunities. The Committee encourages NIMHD to continue re-search to address the health disparities found in rural commu-nities. NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH (NCCIH) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $154,162,000 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 185,295,000 Change from +31,133,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +972,000 Mission .\u2014The mission of NCCIH is to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of complementary and integrative health interventions and their roles in improving health and health care. Integrative Health .\u2014The Committee commends NCCIH as the lead Federal scientific agency supporting research to determine the usefulness and safety of complementary and integrative health ap-proaches and their roles in improving health and health care. The Committee supports the Center's continued leadership of several trans-NIH and inter-agency initiatives, including the NIH-DoD- VA Pain Management Collaboratory (PMC) and the Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory, both of which are investigating best practices for implementing complementary health approaches in clinical health care settings. Consistent with goals that NCCIH identified in its fiscal year 2021-2025 strategic plan, the Center is encouraged to maintain its focus on whole person health, pro- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul on multimodal approaches in treating pain and emphasize improving individual health. Pain and Pain Management Research .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $26,000,000 for NCCIH to support research related to pain and pain management, as requested in the fiscal year 2022 budget. NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES (NCATS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $855,421,000 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 897,812,000 Change from +42,391,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +18,855,000 Mission .\u2014NCATS was established to transform the translational process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be deliv-ered to patients faster. Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program .\u2014 The Committee includes $616,183,000 for the CTSA Program, an increase of $29,342,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $14,683,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee notes that while the CTSA program works to advance the full spectrum of medical research and modernize our research enterprise, as demonstrated by the CTSAs being a driving force be-hind the Federal effort to rapidly develop COVID-19 treatments, diagnostic tools, and vaccines. Central to the ongoing success of the CTSA consortium are individual CTSA hubs that form a nation-wide network. The Committee directs NCATS to maintain the cur-rent size of the core awards supporting CTSA hubs, including the institutional partners that are part of the hubs, and historic struc-ture of the CTSA program. This ongoing approach reflects the cen-tral role of the hubs, including each hub's partners, as critical na-tional research infrastructure and the core of the CTSA Consor-tium. The Committee reiterates previous guidance that NCATS duly inform the Committee of any planned changes to the size of awards, scope of the program, or strategic direction of emerging or ongoing CTSA initiatives. Further, NIH is encouraged to further integrate the CTSA program into cross-agency initiatives that can leverage the full spectrum of medical research for progress on a va-riety of contemporary topics. CTSA Diversity Supplements .\u2014The Committee supports efforts by NCATS to promote diversity in the workforce, especially though its research supplements. The Committee encourages NCATS to ensure funding is available for its diversity research supplements for the CTSA program, and distributed equitability across CTSA hubs. Furthermore, the Committee encourages NCATS to continue funding, through the existing CTSA hubs, expanded programs that address the health inequities and significant burden of diseases and other conditions that disproportionally affect minority and spe-cial populations at both the community health and individual levels through a variety of funding mechanisms. Enhancing this capacity will contribute to reducing health disparities and promote health equity. The Committee also encourages continued support for CTSA efforts to engage communities for the purposes of educating community stakeholders and implementing proven clinical pro-grams and treatments, including vaccines. Applying the CTSA VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 to address longstanding regional health disparities can pro- vide innovative, multi-disciplinary approaches to reducing the bur-den of disease among vulnerable populations. Collaboration with Business Incubators .\u2014The Committee urges NCATS to explore ways to increase the success in meeting its mis-sion by exploring funding opportunities or potential collaborations with business incubators that host small to midsize science, re-search, and pharmaceutical companies that use services-based ap-proaches to nurture and guide the member companies to success. Collaborations with such business incubators may offer the most ef-fective way to advance translational science. Priority consideration should be given to nonprofit life science incubators that seek to ad-vance biotechnology, maximize synergies between nonprofit sci-entists and their commercial colleagues, and launch new ideas and discoveries that will make a difference including drug discovery, biomarker discovery and translational biotechnology around com-mon research themes in an environment conducive to interaction, collaboration, and focus. Rare Disease Research .\u2014The Committee recognizes the incred- ible unmet need in the rare disease research community and en-courages NCATS to expand rare disease funding opportunities, in-cluding, but not limited to, the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network. Accelerating rare disease research will allow society to capitalize on the evolution of science in rare diseases, leading to new treatments for the more than 95 percent of rare diseases with-out approved therapies and lowering the nearly $1 trillion annual economic burden of rare diseases. Cures Acceleration Network .\u2014The Committee includes $60,000,000 for the Cures Acceleration Network, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. The Committee does not include bill language proposed in the budget that would establish this program as a percentage of the NCATS appropriation. JOHN E . FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER (FIC) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $84,044,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 96,842,000 Change from +12,798,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +520,000 Mission .\u2014FIC's mission is to support and facilitate global health research conducted by U.S. and international investigators, build-ing partnerships between health research institutions in the U.S. and abroad, and training the next generation of scientists to ad-dress global health needs. COVID-19 has shown the importance of FIC's essential role in global infectious disease health research training, pandemic pre-paredness, and global health security by assisting low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) in advancing their own research and health solutions and tools. The FIC has developed important part-nerships in countries to not only fight infectious diseases, but also to build their capabilities to detect and treat infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the importance of FIC's efforts to strengthen country capacity to enable cutting edge research at the origin of outbreaks, improving the likelihood that emerging dis-eases can be addressed at their source\u2014ultimately protecting VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 American health security. The Committee believes these long- standing relationships and unique capabilities position FIC to play an important and expanded role in pandemic preparedness, includ-ing developing a network of modeling hubs and joint research pro-grams to engage LMIC investigators to collaboratively train for pandemic preparedness. The Committee requests information from FIC in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification about how FIC training programs and research collaborations have, and with additional resources can, increase efforts to advance glob-al health security and pandemic preparedness. The Committee is particularly interested in understanding FIC's unique capabilities and capacities as well as coordination with other Federal govern-ment agencies engaged in these efforts. Health Disparities Research .\u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $10,000,000 for FIC to support additional research related to identifying and reducing health disparities, as requested in the fiscal year 2022 budget. NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE (NLM) Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $463,787,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 486,769,000 Change from Change from budget request ...................................................... +11,905,000 Mission .\u2014The NLM collects and organizes information important to biomedicine; serves as a national information resource for med-ical education, research, and health service activities; enhances ac-cess to biomedical literature through electronic services; serves the public by providing electronic access to reliable health information for consumers; supports and directs the national network of librar-ies of medicine; provides grants for research in biomedical commu-nications, medical library development, and training health infor-mation specialists; conducts and supports research in biomedical informatics and computational biology; and creates information re-sources for genomics, molecular biology, toxicology, medical images, environmental health, emergency preparedness and response, and health services research.

The items below include issues and programs specific to the Of- fice of the Director as well as those that involve multiple Institutes and Centers. Addressing Maternal Mental Health Gaps .\u2014The Committee rec- ognizes growing evidence that maternal mental health has long- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul on the physical, intellectual, and emotional devel- opment of a woman's children. Pregnancy-related mortality in the U.S. has steadily increased from 7.2 deaths per 100,000 in 1987 to 17.3 deaths per 100,000 in 2017. Black mothers are three to four times more likely than White mothers to die from complications re-lated to pregnancy or childbirth. Maternal mental health disorders and associated symptoms are common, and cases often go unre-ported and untreated. The societal cost of untreated perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) can reach $14.2 billion, and those with PMADs have a higher risk of suicide, cesarean deliveries, and work absenteeism and presenteeism. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the mental and physical toll on pregnant and postpartum mothers. The Committee directs NIH to provide a re-port within 180 days of enactment of this Act with the number and description of research grants awarded over the past three fiscal years that address maternal mental health outcomes for women who are pregnant and one year postpartum. Further, the Com-mittee encourages the Department to ensure mental health is in-corporated in any efforts to reduce maternal mortality rates. Adult Cellular Therapies .\u2014To support collaborative evidence de- velopment, the Committee encourages NIH, in coordination with FDA and HRSA, to continue efforts to enhance transparency re-garding outcomes from adult cellular therapies that are FDA-ap-proved or being administered under FDA Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption protocols by ensuring that re-sults are submitted to appropriate databases, such as the Stem Cell Therapeutic Outcomes Database and ClinicalTrials.gov. Advancing Cell-Based Therapies. \u2014The Committee recognizes that adult cell-based therapies hold promise for a broad range of conditions, including neurological conditions, musculoskeletal con-ditions, cancer, radiation damage, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, wound healing, and immunological disease, including COVID-19. While results of early clinical studies are promising, the primary barrier to advancing such therapies is the significant cost of con-ducting large-scale, randomized clinical trials\u2014especially among academic and research institutions and small biotechnology compa-nies\u2014which are a precursor to bringing safe and effective therapies to patients. Therefore, the Committee directs NIH to develop and submit a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act that describes cur-rent NIH funding for adult cell-based therapies, disaggregated by Institute and Center, and plans to support and expand investments in such therapies. Such report shall describe plans to support clin-ical trials; the characterization, optimization, and scaling of manu-facturing of cell-based therapies; and collaborative evidence devel-opment, including the development and operation of an outcomes database. The Committee encourages NIH to consult outside ex-perts, including researchers who have conducted clinical trials in- volving adult cell-based therapies, to inform its activities related to cell-based therapies. All of Us Program .\u2014The Committee provides a total of $541,000,000 for the All of Us precision medicine initiative, $41,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The total includes VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114- 255) to be transferred from the NIH Innovation Account. The All of Us initiative is a historic effort to collect data from over one million people living in the U.S. to accelerate research and improve health and serves as a national research resource to sup-port thousands of studies, spanning various health conditions in-cluding COVID-19. More than 75 percent of these participants are from communities historically underrepresented in biomedical re-search, and more than 50 percent are from racial and ethnic minor-ity groups. The Committee encourages NIH to increase its outreach through a network of trusted community engagement partners to continue enrollment of participants from diverse and underserved populations. ALS Research Coordination and Acceleration .\u2014The Committee is aware of the significant need to expand scientific understanding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to translate ALS science more rapidly into effective treatments that can make ALS a livable disease. To achieve these outcomes as soon as possible, the Com-mittee directs NIH to organize a trans-agency initiative to develop an ALS research strategic plan. The plan, which should be devel-oped in collaboration with the nation's leading ALS patient and biomedical research organizations, should: identify the most prom-ising areas of research and the specific NIH activities where addi-tional funding could lead to more rapid translation of discoveries for treatments, prevention, and interventions or technologies that can reduce the burden of ALS; identify which Institutes and Cen-ters are undertaking ALS and ALS-related research and which are not but have a role to play; and uncover any impediments to ALS research. As part of this effort, NIH should hold at least one public meeting at which stakeholders can provide testimony. This effort should include, but not be limited to: NINDS, NIA, NIEHS, NIMH, NHGRI, NIAMS, and NCATS. Additionally, The Committee strongly supports the Trans- formative Research Award program for ALS and directs the Direc-tor to continue to fund this critical initiative in fiscal year 2022. Finally, the Committee includes $1,000,000 to commission a study by NASEM to identify and recommend actions for the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to undertake to make ALS a livable disease within a decade. Given the significant adverse physical, fi-nancial, psychological impact this progressive neurodegenerative disease has on the individuals and families affected by it, a com-prehensive assessment of what is necessary to address its effects is warranted. The study should include, but not be limited to: how to develop more effective and meaningful treatments and a cure; interventions to reduce and prevent the progression and complica-tions of ALS; the type and range of care and services people and families with ALS need and how to ensure they receive comprehen-sive, quality care; what care, services, and preventive measures people at-risk of ALS need; and how to improve the quality of life, health, and well-being of affected individuals and families. The Committee directs NIH to submit this study to the Committee no later than October 2024 and requests an update on the status of this study in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justifica-tion. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 NIH to continue its expan- sion of research efforts in amyloidosis, a group of rare diseases characterized by abnormally folded protein deposits in tissues. Am-yloidosis is often fatal, and there is no known cure. Current meth-ods of treatment are risky and unsuitable for many patients. Aver-age survival without treatment is in months. The Committee di-rects NIH to provide an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congres-sional Budget Justification on the steps NIH has taken to expand research into the causes of amyloidosis and the measures taken to improve the diagnosis and treatment of this devastating group of diseases. Autoimmune Neuropathies .\u2014The Committee notes the effect that the pandemic had on the progress of a state-of-the-science con-ference on autoimmune neuropathies research into conditions like Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The Committee supports continued efforts on es-tablishing this critical conference. Biomedical Research Facilities .\u2014The Committee includes $50,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $50,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for grants to public and/or nonprofit entities to expand, remodel, renovate, or alter existing research facilities or construct new research facilities as authorized under 42 U.S.C. section 283k. The Committee urges NIH to make awards that are large enough to underwrite the cost of a significant portion of newly constructed or renovated facilities. Biomedical Research Workforce Diversity .\u2014The Committee is concerned with the impact of COVID-19 on the diversity of the bio-medical research workforce, particularly women and women of color at risk across career stages. The Committee strongly encour-ages NIH to study the race and gender breakdown of the impact of COVID on participation in the workforce by monitoring the types of awards applied for and granted by gender, race, and ethnicity for two years. If the data demonstrate that fewer women are applying for grants, then it is imperative that NIH take steps to address this disparity. The Committee requests a status update from NIH on this research in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Jus-tification as well as the steps being taken to maintain and stabilize the diversity of the biomedical research workforce. Biosafety Labs. \u2014The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) recommends as a special practice the report-ing of all laboratory incidents and near misses in Biosafety Lab (BSL) BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories. The Committee directs NIH to ensure all funding for BSL-3, BSL-4, high containment labora-tory, or any entity involved in managing Hazardous Biological Agents both foreign or domestic maintains up to date, comprehen-sive policies, to promote optimal Biosafety and Biosecurity prac-tices. Such policies must reference (1) incident reporting, (2) roles and responsibilities, (3) training, (4) inventory control, and (5) in-spections and must be reported to NIH and/or related agencies. Black Men and Women Pursuing Medicine and Science .\u2014The Committee supports the efforts of the National Academies Round-table on Black Men and Black Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine and its efforts to develop specific programs to increase numbers and effectiveness of Black Men and Women pursuing medicine and science. The Committee directs the Director to allo- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 increased resources from the Common Fund of the diversity program consortium to the National Academies Roundtable on Black Men and Black Women in Science, Engineering, and Medi-cine to address the increasing underrepresentation of Black men in medical schools and in the biomedical research profession. In addi-tion, the Committee recognizes the need to increase the number of biomedical research professionals as leaders in critical areas of na-tional need. The Committee directs NIH to establish a scholarship program that encourages African American students to pursue a career in medicine, science, and biomedical research to combat the persistent decline of Black male physicians over the last decade. Brain Cancer .\u2014The Committee recognizes that certain types of brain cancers are associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. Primary brain tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme, have a five-year survival rate of five percent in adults and less than 20 percent in children. Certain brain tumors that occur in hu-mans also occur spontaneously and naturally in dogs. These brain cancers in dogs share many of the same molecular underpinnings of their human counterparts. There is great potential for devel-oping treatments for brain cancers that will benefit dogs and hu-mans and provide an intermediate step to evaluate human treat-ments in a more meaningful and related species. The Committee encourages NIH to continue to support research that brings to-gether researchers and clinicians from pediatrics, adult oncology, veterinary medicine, and biomedical engineering to leverage the linkage between brain cancers in dogs and humans in order to evaluate and develop treatments and safe delivery systems to ben-efit both species. Center for Alternatives to Animals in Research and Testing .\u2014The Committee directs NIH to submit a plan not later than 180 days after enactment of the Act for the establishment of a Center for Al-ternatives to Animals in Research and Testing within NIH, for the purposes of (1) developing, promoting, and funding alternatives to animal research and testing, and (2) developing a plan for reducing the number of animals used in Federally funded research and test-ing. Childhood Post-Infectious Neuroimmune Disorders .\u2014The Com- mittee continues to be concerned that some children, following streptococcal and other infections, may experience the onset of neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorders. These auto-inflam-matory encephalopathic conditions include Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infec-tions (PANDAS) and Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syn-drome (PANS). Due to a paucity of research and limited avenues of treatment, children continue to encounter significant delays in identification and treatment, resulting in escalation of mental health symptoms and associated costs. The incidence of neuro-logical and psychiatric symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 un-derscores the need for research that expands our understanding of neuropsychiatric illness following infection. Because these com-plications lie at the nexus of medical and mental health, investiga-tions into their mechanisms have far-reaching implications. The Committee encourages NIH to explore cross-disciplinary research in this area, including neurobiology, neurology, immunology, rheumatology, infectious disease, and mental health, and report to VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul the Committee in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Jus- tification on the understanding of the incidence, causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment of these conditions. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome .\u2014The Committee encourages NIH to expand ME/CFS efforts such as new ME/CFS disease specific fund-ing announcements to deliver needed diagnostics and treatments as quickly as possible and mechanisms to incentivize researchers to enter the field. Cockayne Syndrome .\u2014The Committee recognizes that Cockayne Syndrome is a rare hereditary autosomal recessive disorder that disproportionately impacts children. It has no known treatments, therapies, or cures. Cockayne Syndrome presents unique research challenges for many reasons, including difficulty in accruing enough patients to participate in clinical trials and a lack of indus-try focus on such rare genetic diseases due to the relatively small number of patients diagnosed with this disease. The Committee strongly encourages NIH to expand funding on research on Cockayne Syndrome, including but not limited to gene replacement therapy. Collection and Reporting of Animal Research Numbers and Agen- cy Funding .\u2014The Committee recognizes that Congress has long ex- pressed an interest in reducing the use of nonhuman animals in NIH-funded research and replacing animals with valid, reliable al-ternatives. In the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993, Congress first requested that the agency create a plan for doing so. The Committee also recognizes the scientific community's Stated commitment to the ''three Rs'' of replacement, reduction, and refinement. Integral to that commitment are the accurate counting of animals used in research and testing and the accurate reporting of NIH funding dedicated to projects involving animals. The Committee recognizes that it has been NIH's policy since 1985 to collect an ''average daily inventory'' of vertebrate animals housed in research facilities that wish to receive agency funding. The Com-mittee understands that domestic facilities are required to file such documentation every four years as part of an Animal Welfare As-surance and that copies of the documents are available to the pub-lic only through Freedom of Information Act requests. The Com-mittee requests a report from NIH within 120 days of enactment of this Act outlining a plan for increasing the accuracy and trans-parency of collecting and publicly disseminating research animal numbers. The plan should explain how NIH will collect the infor-mation annually and include a draft form that requires the total number of animals per species bred and used in the previous year and assigns all animals to a pain and distress category. The plan should also include details on how NIH will create a publicly acces-sible online database for dissemination of this information. Sec-ondly, the Committee requests that NIH include in its report a plan for implementing a system that tracks which agency-funded projects involve the use of animals and makes the information pub-licly accessible. The Committee recognizes that NIH currently col-lects such information with every grant application using the Re-search & Related Other Project Information form, which asks ap-plicants to answer ''Yes'' or ''No'' to the question ''Are Vertebrate Animals Used?'' NIH's plan should ensure that the answer to that question for each funded project is searchable via the Expenditures VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Results module of NIH's Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools website as many other categories of information are. Common Fund .\u2014The Committee recommends $657,112,000 for the Common Fund (CF), and an additional $12,600,000 provided to support the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act for the sev-enth year of the ten-year Pediatric Research Initiative. This is $21,173,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $11,173,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. COVID-19 Technology Access Pool. \u2014The Committee understands that the World Health Organization has developed a COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), which aims to facilitate access to COVID-19 health products by sharing intellectual property through pooling and voluntary agreements. The Committee strong-ly urges the Secretary, in partnership with NIH, to consider what contributions NIH could make to C-TAP. Cybersecurity .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $100,000,000 to support expanded cybersecurity efforts at NIH, as requested in the fiscal year 2022 budget. Funding will enhance Se-curity Operations Center functions, expand threat mitigation and incident response capabilities, implement important architectural improvements to the NIH network, and implement tools and tech-nologies to allow real time monitoring of activity across a variety of sources. Diversity at NIH Working Group and Strategic Plan .\u2014The Com- mittee is encouraged by NIH's demonstrated commitment to diver-sity and thanks the NIH for acting on the fiscal year 2021 request to develop a strategic plan that includes long- and short-term goals to address disparities at NIH. The Committee understands that NIH is beginning robust outreach to traditionally marginalized communities to lay the foundation for a comprehensive strategic plan and encourages NIH to continue this line of work in order to fully understand the scope of need in this area, properly make rec-ommendations, then develop and implement strategies to increase inclusivity and diversity in biomedical science while aligning with Executive Order 13985 on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. The Committee directs NIH to provide quarterly briefings to the Committee on the progress of the development of the strategic plan. Diversity in NIH Clinical Trials .\u2014While 40 percent of Americans belong to a racial or ethnic minority, 80 to 90 percent of partici-pants in clinical trials are White. Patients in underserved commu-nities are often less comfortable enrolling in clinical trials or are unaware of how to do so, excluding them from the opportunity to access potentially lifesaving treatment. Further, it is essential that NIH researchers develop a comprehensive understanding of how treatments impact various populations. The Committee encourages NIH to increase proactive outreach efforts to patients in minority and underrepresented communities and providers serving these populations, to improve awareness of clinical trials and under-standing of how patients can participate. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy .\u2014Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a severe form of muscular dystrophy for which there is no cure and for which life expectancy is in the second or third decade. The Committee urges NIH to establish a framework for data sharing VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul and sharing of specimens generated or collected within six months of completion of any NIH-funded clinical study. The Committee also urges NIH to support methodological research on challenges related to gene therapies, such as enabling delivery to individuals with neutralizing antibodies to viral vectors, manufacturing supply to ensure all patients can receive treatment, and minimizing poten-tial life-threatening immune response to high viral doses. Early Career Researchers .\u2014The Committee recognizes the impor- tance of awards intended to support training of early-stage re-searchers, including physician scientists. The Committee is also aware of the negative impact the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had on research career trajectories and that these challenges are particularly burdensome on early-career researchers who have yet to achieve research independence. The Committee commends NIH for allowing holders of fellowship and career development awards to apply for funded and no-cost extensions but is concerned about the possibility of uneven levels of support between Institutes and Centers, unclear qualifying standards, and demand that may ex-ceed resources. To address these concerns, the Committee encour-ages NIH to develop and disseminate a standardized approach to support eligible investigators across Institutes and Centers. The Committee also encourages NIH to develop a funding oppor- tunity for a trans-NIH early career development award targeted to investigators working in pediatrics that would build upon the Next Generation Researchers Initiative and other initiatives and to pro-vide an update on these efforts to Congress within 180 days of en-actment of this Act. Eating Disorders .\u2014The Committee commends NIH for sup- porting multi-Institute research on the chronic, fatal, and serious mental illnesses encompassing eating disorders that affect 30,000,000 Americans during their lifetimes, and its association with other conditions such as diabetes, infertility, heart disease, PTSD, substance use, co-morbid mental illnesses, and tooth decay. The Committee encourages NIH to increase support for eating dis-orders research and encourages the relevant Institutes and Cen-ters, including NIMH, NIMHD, NICHD, and NIDA, to collaborate to address research gaps in genetics, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of eating disorders. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome .\u2014The Committee encourages NIH to support research and activities with respect to Ehlers-Danlos Syn-drome and related connective tissue disorders. Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) .\u2014 The Committee includes $180,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for the ECHO Project, which has the potential to greatly increase under-standing of critical determinants of health across the lifespan, through its observational cohorts and the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network. The Committee encourages continued com-munication about to the program's progress toward goals, mile-stones, and projected funding estimates with both external stake-holders and Congress. The Committee includes funding for ECHO in the Office of the Director, consistent with previous years. Federal Advisory Committees Transparency Initiative .\u2014The Com- mittee recognizes that Federal advisory committees established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 282(b)(6) fill an important role in advising VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul NIH on major decisions on plans and policies. However, to guar- antee due process, it is vital that all NIH Federal advisory commit-tees operate in a transparent way. The Committee recognizes that one particular NIH Federal advisory committee, the Literature Se-lection Technical Review Committee (LSTRC), has not made its re-view process clear or transparent. As such, the Committee directs the LSTRC, within 60 days of enactment of this Act, to make pub-lic all documents and any other relevant information related to its: (1) processes for and standards of review, including the scope of the review, a timeline and detailed steps of the review, and any other guidelines used to ensure objective reviews; and (2) decision-mak-ing processes and methodologies, including scoring rubrics, metrics, and any other guidelines used to ensure objective decisions. The Committee further directs the LSTRC, within 60 days of enactment of this Act, to make available detailed instructions regarding how to appeal its decisions. Moreover, the Director of NLM shall ensure and certify to the Committee that the LSTRC is operating in ac-cordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended (5 U.S.C., Appendix 2). Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research .\u2014The Com- mittee includes $25,000,000 to support research on the prevention of gun violence, $12,500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee also requires NIH and CDC to collaborate with the Na-tional Institute of Justice to compile, share, and improve firearm violence data. Such data must include the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) and include data from hospitals treating victims of nonfatal gunshot wounds. Foreign Animal Research. \u2014The Committee requests additional information in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justifica-tion about how NIH monitors and ensures foreign institutions' com-pliance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies governing NIH-funded animal research. Foreign Threats to Research .\u2014Foreign actors continue to engage in the theft of intellectual property from NIH and its grantees, pos-ing threats to national security. The Committee directs NIH to pro-vide quarterly briefings on the progress of investigations into these efforts, as well as the institutions, scientists, and research affected. The Committee continues to direct NIH to provide $5,000,000 to the Inspector General to continue additional investigations into this issue. The Committee also includes an increase of $2,500,000 for the Office of Extramural Research to expand its resources dedi-cated to reviewing potential cases of fraud. Fragile X .\u2014The Committee commends NIH for funding three Fragile X Centers within the guidelines established in the Strategic Plan for Research on FMR1-Related Conditions. The Committee notes the importance of expanding the base of researchers and cli-nicians who are familiar with and trained in the Fragile X-associ-ated disorders and promoting collaboration between basic scientists and clinicians to enable researchers to better understand phenotypes, document variations in how the disorder presents itself, identify potential biomarkers and outcome measures, and de-velop new interventions. The Committee also commends NIH for recognizing the ethical, legal, and social issues in premutation screening and testing and encourages NIH to look at existing pilot VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul studies that are exploring innovative ways to screen newborns, and to coordinate efforts and research with the CDC as they consider screening solutions for FMR1-related conditions. Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program .\u2014The Committee recognizes that pediatric cancer is a leading cause of death among children and is still poorly understood. Childhood can-cer also has lasting negative health effects on children who do sur-vive due to the high levels of toxicity associated with treatment. The Committee acknowledges that the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program enables researchers to uncover new in-sights into the biology of childhood disease. Since its inception, Kids First has initiated the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Re-source Center, which is a comprehensive data resource for research and patient communities meant to advance discoveries. The Com-mittee recognizes the progress that the Program has made towards understanding childhood cancer and disease and provides $12,600,000 to support pediatric research as authorized by the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act (P.L. 113-94). Gene-Environment Interactions in Neurodegenerative Disorders in the Diverse Populations of African Americans and Latinos .\u2014In the context of NIH's robust neurological disease research portfolio, the Committee commends the leadership of NIH in advancing the rel-evant objectives of the 21st Century Cures Act and the BRAIN Ini-tiative. The Committee recognizes the need to better understand the interactions between genetics and environmental factors, in particular with older and diverse populations of African Americans and Latinos. The Committee encourages NIH to accelerate collabo-rative research across relevant Institutes and Centers and the re-search community to address the goal of determining the role of the interaction between environmental exposures to toxic chemicals and genetics and their impact on neurodegenerative disorders in di-verse populations of African Americans and Latinos, to allow for earlier diagnosis and subsequent treatment to arrest the progres-sion of these devastating neurodegenerative disorders. Harassment Policies .\u2014The Committee is deeply frustrated by NIH's failure to implement its direction to address harassment in extramural research settings. Both the Statement of managers ac-companying the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Public Law 116-94) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260) directed NIH to revise its guidance to make clear that grantees must identify any changes to key per-sonnel on an award that are related to concerns about harassment. The Committee has included a new general provision to require in-stitutions that receive NIH funding to notify the agency when key personnel are removed from their position for harassment. Health Disparities for Persons with Disabilities .\u2014Despite being uniquely affected by COVID-19, people with disabilities experi-enced gaps and inequities in health care in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This illustrates that there is a need for in-creased data collection to provide policymakers with necessary in-formation to improve pandemic planning and outcomes. The Com-mittee strongly encourages NIH to examine health and health care inequities more broadly for people with disabilities, including those with physical, sensory, cognitive, intellectual and developmental, and psychological disabilities. The Committee strongly encourages VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul NIH to fund research on identifying inequities in health and health care for people with disabilities and to support research that devel-ops and evaluates interventions to reduce these disparities, includ-ing approaches that focus on addressing systemic and community- level barriers. HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study .\u2014The Committee recognizes and supports the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study, which will establish a large cohort of pregnant women from regions of the country significantly affected by the opioid crisis and follow them and their children for at least 10 years. This knowledge will be critical to understanding typical brain development and how pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids and other substances or adverse environments affect brain develop-ment and other outcomes, including risk for future substance use, mental health disorders, and other behavioral and emotional dif-ficulties and disorders. The Committee recognizes that the HBCD Study is supported in part by the HEAL Initiative, and NIH Insti-tutes, Centers, and encourages other Institutes and Centers to support this important study. Hearing Health Screening for Older Americans .\u2014The Committee recognizes the associated comorbidities and costs of untreated hear-ing loss and, with the growing aging population, the importance of hearing screening for older Americans. The Committee urges NIH to provide an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on hearing screening research for older adults across the NIH. The Committee encourages NIDCD and NIA to support studies that address the research needs and gaps identified by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) review of hearing screening recommendations for older Americans. Hepatitis B .\u2014The Committee recognizes the estimated $4 billion of annual medical costs associated with the care and treatment of those infected with the hepatitis B virus and urges NIH to redouble its efforts to identify more effective treatments for the disease. While there are treatments available to control HBV, they must be taken for years if not for life. Without treatment, one in four of those infected will die prematurely from cirrhosis, liver failure, and/or liver cancer. This serious public health threat results in over 800,000 worldwide deaths each year, making it the tenth leading cause of death in the world. The Committee commends NIH for it support in the development of the 2019 Strategic Plan for Trans- NIH Research to Cure Hepatitis B and urges NIH to help imple-ment the plan by issuing new targeted calls for research. The Com-mittee requests that NIH support an update of the Strategic Plan for Trans-NIH Research to Cure Hepatitis B and that it submit it to the Committee, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, a spe-cific plan to pursue a cure for hepatitis B in coordination with the Trans-NIH Hepatitis B Working Group. Humane Research Alternatives .\u2014Recognizing that humane, cost- effective, and scientifically suitable non-animal methods are avail-able but underutilized, the Committee requests that NIH assemble a panel to investigate and make recommendations regarding incen-tives for more quickly and effectively moving NIH intramural and external research away from methods that rely on animals to meth- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 on non-animal methods including epidemiological and clinical studies, cell-based methods, computer modeling and simula-tion, and human tissue studies. The panel should review and rec-ommend means of encouraging greater reliance on human-relevant non-animal methods/approaches. Panel membership should include individuals with proven knowledge of/experience with non-animal research methods; with expertise in evaluating the adequacy of searches for non-animal methods/approaches described in research proposals; and with knowledge of the welfare concerns and sci-entific limitations of animal-based studies. The Committee asks that NIH provide a report of the panel's findings within 60 days of enactment of this Act. Impact of Technology and Digital Media Use Among Infants, Children, and Teens .\u2014The Committee remains concerned about the impacts of technology use and media consumption on infants, chil-dren, and adolescents, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has resulted in closures of schools, sports, and extra-curricular activities giving children less access to offline social op-portunities and resulting in increased time children spend on screens and digital media. The Committee appreciates NIH's ongo-ing engagement on this important topic and encourages NIH to prioritize research into the cognitive, physical, and socioemotional impacts of young people's use of technologies as well as long-term developmental effects on children's social, communication and cre-ative skills. The Committee also encourages NIH to study the re-percussions of increased use of digital media and technologies on suicidal thoughts and ideation among children. The Committee en-courages NIH to consider different forms of digital media and tech-nologies including mobile devices, smart phones, tablets, com-puters, and virtual reality tools, as well as social-media content, video games, and television programming. INCLUDE Initiative. \u2014The Committee includes no less than $80,000,000, an increase of $15,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level, within OD for the INCLUDE Initiative. The Com-mittee is pleased that this multi-year, trans-NIH research initia-tive has enabled significant advances in understanding immune system dysregulation, new research into the connection with Alz-heimer's disease, and the creation of national Data Coordinating Center, all of which may dramatically improve the health and qual-ity of life of individuals with Down syndrome as well as millions of typical individuals. The Committee encourages NIH to pursue some of the most neglected areas of research and care such as health disparities for African Americans with Down syndrome, mo-saic Down syndrome, those with the dual diagnosis of Down syn-drome and autism, and new studies on metabolic dysregulation. The Committee requests the Director provide an updated plan within 60 days of enactment of this Act that includes a timeline, description of potential grant opportunities and deadlines for all ex-pected funding opportunities so that young investigators and new research institutions may be further encouraged to explore re-search in this space. This plan should also incorporate and increase pipeline research initiatives specific to Down syndrome. Indoor Amplified Microbial Growth Research. \u2014The Committee believes that a more robust and focused NIH commitment to re-search relating to mold and amplified microbial growth in damp VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 water-damaged buildings would yield significant advancements of knowledge and insight regarding how fungi, mycotoxins, actinobacteria, and endotoxins within indoor environments affect public health. The Committee urges NIH to expedite planned and ongoing studies already nominated and established through the National Toxicology Program (NTP). The Committee is concerned that some of these studies were nominated in 2001 but have yet to be conducted. The Committee also urges NIH to prioritize new research, explore the causal links, and interventions to the poten-tial neurotoxic, immunosuppressive, immunoreactive, autoimmune, nephrotoxic, carcinogenic, and inflammatory responses due to inha-lation of indoor amplified microbial growth in damp and water- damaged indoor environments. The Committee encourages NIH to improve applied research, communication and education, and co-ordination with other Federal, State and local health and environ-mental agencies regarding mold and microbial growth in damp and water-damaged indoor environments. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on its efforts. Inflammation. \u2014Inflammation is one of the body's major defense mechanisms in response to infection or injury, but when it is un-controlled, it causes inflammatory diseases such as cardiometabolic diseases (such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes), neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease and de-mentia), and mood disorders (such as depression). The Committee supports and encourages NIH to fund research into how inflamma-tion may contribute to these various disorders. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). \u2014The Committee is aware of current and emerging NIH priorities focused on nutrition, including the recently finalized Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research and the Common Fund's Nutrition for Precision Health initiative. Given these priorities, the Committee encourages NIH to coordi-nate across Institutes and Centers focused on nutrition research to support research to understand the relationship between food and immune-mediated conditions, including IBD. This may include re-search on the development of evidence-based anti-inflammatory diets and the roles such diets can play in managing IBD and other immune-mediated conditions. Lung Cancer Research. \u2014The recent decline in cancer mortality that has been fueled by progress in lung cancer is directly attrib-utable to NIH-funded research. Advances in the understanding of the molecular underpinnings of lung cancer and the identification of additional oncogene driver subsets has led to rapid development of new targeted therapies, which together with efforts to broaden uptake of comprehensive biomarker testing, has the potential to de-liver the promise of precision medicine to more patients than ever before. The Committee therefore encourages the NIH to continue supporting important research across these areas, to broaden the base of lung cancer survivors across different disease types, includ-ing small cell lung cancer. Lyme and Other Tick-Borne Diseases. \u2014The Committee encour- ages NIH to support research on early diagnosis and treatment of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases (TBD) to prevent the develop-ment of late stage disease and more serious and longer-term dis-ability, but also to intensify research on diagnosis and treatment VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul of late stage and chronic disease. Priority should be based on dis- ease burden, which CDC has indicated for Lyme disease to be ap-proximately 476,000 people diagnosed and treated annually in the U.S. Lyme has a significant patient population who are not diag-nosed until late stage, when treatment is more difficult, and a sig-nificant percentage of patients who relapse and go on to develop chronic symptoms. Along with development of highly sensitive and specific diagnostics for all stages of disease, a goal should be to de-velop diagnostics with appropriate sensitivity and specificity for the detection of subclinical or low-level infection for use in disease eradication. Treatments for all stages of Lyme and other TBD, de-termining optimal combinations of new candidate or older drugs and exploring novel combinations should be developed. Although a cure may be defined to include sustained remission, a goal of treat-ment should be eradication of the pathogen, in which case resur-gence is not possible. The Committee is gratified that NIH officials have recognized the need for further exploration of maternal-fetal or vertical trans-mission of Lyme disease and the occurrence of adverse outcomes among women with untreated and disseminated Lyme disease dur-ing pregnancy. The Committee encourages NIH to intensify re-search on adverse outcomes related to Lyme disease during preg-nancy and to continue to participate with Lyme advocacy organiza-tions on these issues. Maintenance of Chimpanzees on U.S. Air Force Bases. \u2014The Com- mittee remains concerned about NIH's intention to retain govern-ment-owned chimpanzees at the Alamogordo Primate Facility (APF), a laboratory facility, instead of retiring them to the national chimpanzee sanctuary, Chimp Haven. While NIH cites the health condition of the chimpanzees as a reason to warehouse them at APF, the health condition of the chimpanzees and their long his-tory of laboratory use makes it urgent that they be provided an op-portunity to live the remainder of their lives in sanctuary, even if for a short period. The Committee directs the NIH to resume trans-port of government-owned and supported chimpanzees beginning with chimpanzees at APF. Movement of chimpanzees from South-west National Primate Research Center (SNPRC) and Keeling Cen-ter for Comparative Medicine and Research (KCCMR) should follow transport of the APF chimpanzees to Chimp Haven. The Com-mittee also directs the NIH to provide a written report to the Com-mittee every 180 days, beginning no later than December 31, 2021, that shall include: (1) the number of chimpanzees transported to the national sanctuary over the last quarter; (2) a census of all gov-ernment-owned and supported chimpanzees remaining, if any, at APF, SNPRC or KCCMR; (3) a list of any chimpanzee deaths that have occurred at any time after January 1, 2020, at either APF, SNPRC, KCCMR, or the national sanctuary system, and (4) the plan, including the timeline, for transferring the chimpanzees from APF, SNPRC, and KCCMR to Chimp Haven. Maternal Infections. \u2014The Committee requests an update on re- search to better understand and prevent congenital cytomegalovirus in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Jus-tification. Modeling and Simulation Technology Deployment. \u2014The Com- mittee encourages NIAID, NIBIB, and other NIH Institutes and VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Centers as appropriate, to support the development and study of in silico approaches to accelerate vaccines for emerging infectious dis-eases including, but not limited to, computational simulation, data analytics, and the digital patient model, with the objective of reduc-ing the time to market for virus vaccines. National Laboratories. \u2014NIH funding supports investments which are collaborative with the ongoing work of the Department of Energy. The Committee directs NIH to provide an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on the work to coordinate its efforts with DOE and the National Laboratories, and in more strategic ways to leverage NIH's research needs in the next generation of cancer research, brain mapping, drug develop-ment or other emerging ideas in biomedical research that would benefit from DOE's instrumentation, materials, modeling simula-tion, and data science. In 2015, the Secretary of Energy established the Energy Advisory Board (SEAB) to evaluate the prospects for in-creased collaboration between DOE researchers and biomedical sci-entists supported by other agencies, especially NIH. Increased and more effective coordination could be instrumental to assist in the development of the Nation's health, security, novel biomedical tech-nologies, and in the development of more strategic enabling tech-nologies. The Committee supports NIH's collaboration with DOE and the National Laboratories in an effort to maximize utilization of DOE's capabilities, particularly for NIH's rapidly growing data and computational challenges, and encourages NCI to build off the success of previous initiatives and consider additional pilots to ad-dress key computation and imaging bottlenecks in cancer research. National Primate Research Centers. \u2014The Committee does not in- clude funding directed towards expanding non-human primate re-source infrastructure. The budget request included $50,000,000 for this activity. National SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance Program .\u2014New SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge across the globe, includ-ing variants that may have increased transmissibility and potential to evade vaccines. This dire situation demonstrates the need for a comprehensive genomic sequencing and surveillance program to discover and track the spread of these variants and devise appro-priate public health countermeasures. The Committee directs NIH and CDC, in coordination with other HHS agencies as appropriate, to continue to expand national genomic surveillance to rapidly scale up sequencing of viral samples and dissemination of SARS- CoV-2 genomic data. Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Health Research. \u2014The Com- mittee encourages NIH to place high priority on addressing the re-search needs of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Health Re-search. The OD, in coordination with NIMHD and other Institutes and Centers, should work closely with NHPI communities and NHPI-serving organizations, which are located in States with sig-nificant NHPI populations to allow for the development of future researchers and scientists from these same communities. Natural History Museums as Critical Contributors to Virus Re- search. \u2014The Committee notes that the nation's natural history museums provide an unparalleled resource for studying zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19. These museums hold millions of ani-mal samples collected over decades from across the globe, offer VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul deep and broad scientific expertise, and are uniquely positioned to assist in preparing for and predicting the next pandemic-causing viruses. The Committee encourages increased utilization and sup-port of this largely untapped resource. Neurofibromatosis (NF). \u2014The Committee supports efforts to in- crease funding and resources for NF research and treatment at multiple Institutes, including NCI, NINDS, NIDCD, NHLBI, NICHD, NIMH, NCATS, and NEI. Children and adults with NF are at elevated risk for the development of many forms of cancer, as well as deafness, blindness, developmental delays, and autism. The Committee encourages NCI to continue to support a robust NF research portfolio in fundamental laboratory science, patient-di-rected research, and clinical trials focused on NF-associated benign and malignant cancers. The Committee also encourages NCI to continue to support preclinical research and clinical trials. Because NF can cause blindness, pain, and hearing loss, the Committee en-courages NEI, NINDS, and NIDCD to continue to aggressively fund fundamental basic science research on NF relevant to restoring normal nerve function. Based on emerging findings from numerous researchers worldwide demonstrating that children with NF are at significant risk for autism, learning disabilities, motor delays, and attention deficits, the Committee encourages NINDS, NIMH, and NICHD to support laboratory-based and patient-directed research investigations in these areas. Since NF2 accounts for some genetic forms of deafness, the Committee encourages NIDCD to continue its investment NF2-related research. NF1 can cause vision loss due to optic gliomas. The Committee encourages NEI to support NF1- focused research on optic gliomas and vision restoration. NIH Division of Police. \u2014The Committee supports vigorous action to improve training for all Federal, State, and local law enforce-ment officers on racial profiling, implicit bias, procedural justice, the use of force, and the duty for officers to intervene when wit-nessing the use of excessive force against civilians. The Committee therefore directs the Director to work with the Attorney General and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers to implement improved, mandatory training on these topics for all Federal law enforcement officers, along with the development of related stand-ards that can be applied in hiring and performance assessments. These training requirements and standards should be based on the related provisions in H.R. 1280, as passed by the House of Rep-resentatives in March 2021. The Committee further directs the NIH Division of Police, to the extent it has not already done so, to submit its use of force data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Use of Force Data Collection database. The Committee requests a briefing with-in 90 days of enactment of this Act on current efforts to tabulate and submit use of force data to the FBI. Office of AIDS Research. \u2014The Committee includes no less than $3,290,000,000 for HIV/AIDS research, an increase of $200,000,000 above the estimated fiscal year 2021 level. Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) .\u2014The Committee includes $49,827,000 for OBSSR, an increase of $20,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $19,523,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Com-mittee notes that OBSSR has the mission to enhance NIH's behav- VerDate Sep 11 2014 science research enterprise across all Institutes and Centers. As multiple Surgeons General and NASEM have declared that most health problems facing the nation have significant behavioral components, the Committee strongly supports the continued strengthening of the behavioral science enterprise at NIH and urges OBSSR funding be increased to accomplish this mission. In this regard, the Committee is pleased that an NIH working group has been established to review how better to integrate and realize the benefits of overall health from behavioral research at NIH, and directs that appropriate OBSSR funding levels, authority, and or-ganizational structure be included in this review. Office of Nutrition Research. \u2014The Committee is encouraged by recent efforts to prioritize nutrition research across Institutes and Centers, including the release of first NIH-wide strategic plan for nutrition research. As such, the Committee supports the transfer of the Office of Nutrition Research to OD and encourages the Direc-tor to allocate sufficient resources to this office to ensure it can op-erate effectively as a trans-NIH entity. Office of Research on Women's Health. \u2014The Committee includes $61,480,000 for the Office of Research on Women's Health, an in-crease of $17,555,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $9,177,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This office ensures women's health research and research on the biological and sociocultural influence of sex and gender are included within the larger NIH scientific framework. Congress recognizes that ORWH is the first public health service office to officially promote women's health research within and beyond the NIH scientific com-munity. ORWH provides critical leadership to develop research pro-grams like the Specialized Centers of Research Excellence (SCORE), a program designed to expedite the development and ap-plication of new knowledge to human diseases that affect women, to learn more about the etiology of these diseases, and to foster im-proved approaches to treatment and/or prevention. The Committee applauds ORWH's effort to encourage research across many sci-entific disciplines to examine how sex and gender factors influence health and contribute to various diseases. Within the total, the Committee includes an additional $2,000,000 expand the number of sites in the Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Wom-en's Health (BIRCWH) program, an initiative that aims to increase the number and skills of investigators who conduct research on sex and gender influences on health and disease. ORWH is encouraged to expand the program to less-resourced institutions, such as HBCUs, tribal colleges and Institutions of Emerging Excellence. Office of the Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity. \u2014The Committee includes $22,000,000 for the Office of the Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity, $16,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. OIG Transfer. \u2014The Committee includes $5,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for transfer to the HHS OIG to support oversight of NIH activities. Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes that although Parkinson's is often thought of only as a move-ment disorder, most PD patients also develop dementia; common VerDate Sep 11 2014 include difficulty with problem solving, speed of think- ing, memory and other cognitive skills. Because people with PD usually develop these symptoms several years after their diagnosis of Parkinson's, PD represents an under-explored opportunity to study the onset and progression of dementia. The Committee strongly urges NINDS and NIA to put a higher priority on PD, both before and after onset of dementia, within their overall de-mentia research portfolios. The Committee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Jus-tification. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). \u2014PCOS affects up to 15 per- cent of women and is a significant risk factor for multiple cardio- metabolic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, lipid disorders, high blood pressure, obesity, sleep disorders, and others which may sig-nificantly increase risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Emerging data also link the risk of severe COVID-19 with certain factors such as low vitamin D levels, hyperandrogenism, inflammation, and ethnicity predisposition, all of which are directly associated with PCOS. The Committee encourages NHLBI, NICHD, ORWH, and NIDDK to support research investigating the risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in the PCOS patient population and the strong overlap of risk factors for both worse PCOS cardio-metabolic manifestations and severe COVID-19. Findings should be dissemi-nated to health care providers, PCOS patients, and the public, as well as highlighted for clinical practice. The Committee also en-courages NIH to report on research that has been conducted on PCOS and its impact on cardio-metabolic health to date in the fis-cal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Finally, the Com-mittee requests that PCOS be added to the NIH Research, Condi-tion, and Disease Categories reporting. Post-acute COVID and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). \u2014 The Committee commends NIH on its ongoing ME/CFS efforts, in-cluding the rapid expansion of research regarding post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) and its potential connections to ME/ CFS, its leadership in the Interagency Working Group for ME/CFS, and the recent success of mapMECFS and searchMECFS projects. The Committee recognizes the scientific and clinical opportunities in post-viral research and strongly encourages NIH to continue and expand its efforts to understand the underlying causes and risk factors for individuals with PACS and ME/CFS, with a focus on di-agnosis, treatment, and prevention. The Committee encourages NIH to accelerate and expand efforts related to PACS and ME/ CFS; such as (1) investing and collaborating to form large data sets through patient registries, biobanks, and interdisciplinary research investment (2) issuing PACS and ME/CFS disease specific funding announcements (3) coordinating an initiative to develop consensus on the diagnosis of PACS and the selection criteria for study par-ticipants involved in ME/CFS research, and (4) implementing mechanisms to incentivize new and early career researchers to enter and contribute data to the ME/CFS scientific field. Primary Mitochondrial Disease Research. \u2014The Committee is aware that NIH has spearheaded a number of initiatives to identify new mitochondrial disorders, discover the linkages between mitochondrial disorders, and translate advances in mitochondrial research to treatments, cures, and other medical interventions for VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul secondary diseases, such as Alz- heimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cancer. Given the ad-vancements seen through peer-reviewed research into mitochondrial disorders at several academic sites across the nation, the Committee encourages NIH to increase its funding of primary mitochondrial disease research and requests the agency provide an update on these efforts within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Psychedelic Treatments. \u2014Despite the recent Department of Vet- erans Affairs' 2020 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report that showed there were no significant increases in the vet-eran suicide rate from 2017 and 2018, the Committee is concerned that over 17 veterans on average continue to commit suicide each day, which is a number that has remained persistent over the past decade. There have been many recent studies and clinical trials demonstrating the positive impact of alternative therapies, includ-ing psychedelics, for treatment resistant post-traumatic stress dis-order (PTSD) and major depressive disorder, particularly for vet-eran participants. In light of growing interest in this area, the Committee encourages NIH and other relevant Federal agencies to undertake, and where appropriate expand, research to evaluate the effectiveness of psychedelic therapies in treating PTSD, major de-pressive disorder, and other serious mental health conditions. Rare Disease Research. \u2014The Committee is aware that nearly one in ten individuals in the U.S. is affected by a rare disease, and that rare diseases frequently are genetic or have a genetic component. The Committee urges NIH to expand research on rare genetic and chromosomal abnormalities, such as 7q11.23 Duplication Syndrome and Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis 49 (TECPR2). The Committee directs NIH to provide an update on these two conditions in the fis-cal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Research on Long COVID. \u2014The Committee commends NIH for undertaking a major initiative to research the causes of, and the best ways to prevent and treat, what is often referred to as Long COVID, which occurs when individuals experience a variety of symptoms long past the time that they have recovered from the ini-tial stages of COVID-19 illness. Symptoms can include fatigue, ex-ercise intolerance, shortness of breath, trouble with memory and concentration, headache, sleep disorders, orthostatic tachycardia, chest, muscle and joint pains, fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression, can last for months or longer, and can range from mild to incapacitating. In ad-dition, it is unclear to what extent COVID-19 and its long-term ef-fects may interact with pre-existing conditions such as vascular and neurodegenerative diseases, potentially changing their course and morbidity. The Committee directs NIH to sustain and strengthen its research into Long COVID. As part of this research, the Committee urges NIH to study Long COVID in children and youth. Furthermore, the Committee recognizes that the COVID-19 pan- demic has exposed an array of related health disparities, including a difference in severity and outcomes between female and male pa-tients due to sex and gender influences. This is also true for indi-viduals who continue to experience COVID-19 symptoms and/or damage to organs to varying degrees months after their initial di-agnosis. To better understand how sex differences are implicated in VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Committee encourages the Institutes and Centers of the NIH in coordination with the NIH Office of the Director and Office of Women's Health Research to support research that studies how sex as a biological variable im-pacts short and long-term outcomes due to infection with SARS- CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Sequence Data. \u2014The Committee is con- cerned by reports that early SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data from China, specifically the Wuhan region, were withdrawn from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) at the National Institutes of Health. The Committee is aware of allegations that the Chinese Communist Party has refused to provide raw data to international scientists and the World Health Organization to impede the inves-tigation into the origins of Covid-19. From the beginning of the pandemic, there have been suggestions that the Chinese Com-munist Party barred scientists from releasing data and even de-layed the release of the genetic map of the virus to the world. The Committee understands that it is difficult to identify, early in pandemics, what data may be most relevant because of the dis-perse nature of initial reports and the uncertainty surrounding an emerging virus\u2014however, some scientists have cited difficulties in studying the origins of the virus due to a lack of early data from Wuhan. Furthermore, the Committee is aware that there are legiti-mate reasons to request the withdrawal of genomic sequence data from SRA, including insufficient data quality and incomplete con-sent procedures, however, the early sequence data at issue here may be key to understanding the origin of SARS-CoV-2. Within 30 days of the enactment of this Act, the Director of the National In-stitutes of Health shall report to the Committee on the withdrawal of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data from the Sequence Read Archive. The report should include the total number of requests for withdrawals of SARS-CoV-2 data broken down by institution, the number of sequences that were subsequently withdrawn from the SRA, the reasons provided by the institution for the request for withdrawal, any characteristics provided for the sequences and other pertinent information, as well as any pending requests for SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence withdrawals. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). \u2014The Committee commends NIH for its ongoing support of clinical research for SCD, which imposes major morbidity on an estimated 90,000 to 100,000 individuals in the U.S., with three million Americans carrying the sickle cell trait. The Committee encourages NIH to support clinical trials for pre-natal and postnatal treatment of SCD, which includes a wealth of promising approaches to eradicate this disease, save lives, and dra-matically reduce the substantial health care costs associated with SCD for both children and adults. The NIH is encouraged to con-sider programs both domestically and globally to evaluate the effec-tiveness of screening technologies for infants and children with the sickle cell trait and disease and to develop different innovative technologies to cure SCD. The Committee encourages NHLBI and NHGRI to collaborate on research on Sickle Cell Trait. It is critical to better understand the risks for health complications and the po-tential link to severe illness and risk of death from COVID-19 for the one to three million Americans living with Sickle Cell Trait, the single gene mutation for SCD. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Committee encourages NIA, NIDDK, NICHD, and NINDS to study the causes and care of the neurogenic bladder and kidney disease in order to improve the quality of life of children and adults with Spina Bifida; to support research to address issues related to the treatment and manage-ment of Spina Bifida and associated secondary conditions, such as hydrocephalus and sudden death in the adult Spina Bifida popu-lation; and to invest in understanding the myriad co-morbid condi-tions experienced by individuals with Spina Bifida, including those associated with both paralysis and developmental delay; and report out by Institute research findings on Spina Bifida and issues re-lated to it. The Committee supports the specific efforts of NICHD to understand early human development; set the foundation for healthy pregnancy, and lifelong wellness of women and children; and promote the gynecological, andrological, and reproductive health for people with Spina Bifida. Additionally, NIH is encour-aged to identify sensitive time periods to optimize health interven-tions; improve health during transition from adolescence to adult-hood; and ensure safe and effective therapeutics and devices for adults as well as children. Finally, the Committee encourages NIH to support research on the potential causes behind a growing inci-dence and prevalence of bladder cancer in individuals with Spina Bifida. Thalassemia. \u2014Nutrition can be an important tool in the man- agement of rare diseases. Currently, there is no guidance on nutri-tion approaches for the management of thalassemia, which occurs most often in African Americans and in people of Mediterranean and Southeast Asian descent. In addition to the possibility that thalassemia itself creates nutritional deficits, there is concern that necessary iron chelation therapy may create additional deficits. Re- search is needed to provide practitioners with evidence-based ad-vice for patients, both on diets that would help improve and man-age their condition, and those that may be harmful. The Committee encourages the Office of Nutrition Research to coordinate across NIH on the impact of nutrition on thalassemia management and current gaps in clinical understanding in this area. Trans-NIH Pediatric Research Consortium. \u2014The Committee is aware of the Trans-NIH Pediatric Research Consortium (N-PeRC) that was established in 2018 to better coordinate and support pedi-atric research activities across multiple Institutes and Centers. The Committee supports the goals and objectives of N-PeRC and re-quests that NIH update the Committee as to multi-Institute or Center pediatric research projects implemented as a result of N- PeRC and projects in the planning stage. Additionally, the Com-mittee requests a report in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on how N-PeRC plans to support studies of the physical, mental and behavioral health impacts of COVID-19 on children, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in chil-dren (MIS-C), as well as plans for N-PeRC's focus over the coming three years. Undiagnosed Diseases. \u2014The Committee recognizes the important role the NIH-funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has played to improve diagnosis of rare diseases and other undiagnosed conditions and encourages NIH to continue supporting this work, including by developing a plan to sustain the work of the UDN. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $200,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 250,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +50,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - Mission.\u2014 This account provides for the design, construction, im- provement, and major repair of clinical, laboratory, and office buildings and supporting facilities essential to the mission of the NIH. The funds in this appropriation support the buildings on the main NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland; the Animal Center in Poolesville, Maryland; the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and other smaller facilities throughout the U.S. NIH INNOVATION ACCOUNT This account supports NIH programs authorized in the 21st Cen- tury Cures Act (P.L. 114-255). ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY FOR HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $0 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 3,000,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +3,000,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a53,500,000,000 The Committee includes $3,000,000,000 to establish the Ad- vanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), $3,000,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $3,500,000,000 below the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee strongly supports the goals and vision behind the proposal for ARPA-H and believes that once established, ARPA-H will be able to make pivotal investments in breakthrough tech-nologies and broadly applicable platforms that have the potential to transform medicine, research, and health. The Committee looks forward to working with the Administration to establish ARPA-H and expects to expand its capacity to support innovative projects in future fiscal years. The Committee agrees that ARPA-H projects focused on devel- oping treatments and cures for cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and di-abetes would be a worthy investment, given the prevalence and im-mense burden of these diseases on society, as well as the potential for such an investment to achieve progress. The Committee strong-ly encourages NIH to pursue ARPA-H projects related to finding treatments and a cure for ALS, given its devastating impact on those who suffer from ALS and their families. The Committee ex-pects to be kept apprised of NIH's proposed criteria for selecting and prioritizing projects for ARPA-H funding. For ARPA-H to be successful, the Committee believes ARPA-H must be a distinct Institute within NIH, with a unique culture and organization that should focus on time-limited projects with goals, benchmarks, and accountability. The Committee strongly encour-ages NIH to recruit an ARPA-H Director with extraordinary tech-nical and leadership skills, who has a proven track-record in inno-vation and partnership-building. As the success of this endeavor will be largely dependent upon the recruitment and empowerment VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 of a diverse cohort of program managers, the Committee urges NIH to consider recruiting from a wide range of industry, academia, and other sectors. The Committee encourages NIH to collaborate with DARPA to develop the foundational policies, procedures, and staff training for ARPA-H employees. The Committee is aware that there may be ongoing activities within NIH's current Institutes and Centers that may be better aligned with ARPA-H's mission. The Committee encourages NIH to closely examine whether there is duplication or misalignment of programs once ARPA-H is stood up and to notify the Committee of any proposed reorganization. SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $6,015,508,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 9,160,277,000 Change from ......................................................... +3,144,769,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5572,234,000 The Committee recommendation for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) program level includes $9,014,610,000 in discretionary budget authority, $133,667,000 in PHS Evaluation Tap Funding, and $12,000,000 in transfers from the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). In addition, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $3,235,000,000 for SAMHSA to address the increased need for mental health and substance use disorder services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. SAMHSA is the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that leads public health efforts to ad-vance the behavioral health of the nation. SAMHSA's mission is to reduce the impact of substance misuse and mental illness on Amer-ica's communities. The Committee continues to include bill language that exempts the Mental Health Block Grant and the Substance Abuse Preven-tion and Treatment Block Grant as a source for the Public Health Service Act section 241 evaluation set aside in fiscal year 2022.

Behavioral Health Crisis Coordinating Office. \u2014The Committee includes $10,000,000 for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Mental and Substance Use to create and staff an office within the Center for Mental Health Services to coordinate work relating to behavioral health crisis care across HHS operating divisions, in-cluding CMS and HRSA, as well as with external stakeholders. The office will support technical assistance, data analysis and evalua-tion functions in order to develop a crisis care system encom-passing nationwide standards with the objective of expanding the capacity of and access to local crisis call centers, mobile crisis care, crisis stabilization, psychiatric emergency services, and rapid post- crisis follow up, provided by the National Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Crisis Response System, Community Mental Health Centers, Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics and other community mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) pro-viders. The Committee directs the Secretary to include a multi-year plan in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification out-lining a nationwide crisis care system plan of action. Criminal Justice Activities. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $45,125,000 for Criminal and Juvenile Justice Programs, to ad-dress some of the unmet need for effective behavioral health serv-ices and supports that are accessible before, during, and after in-carceration and continue in the community for those with a mental disorder. The Committee recognizes the importance of providing comprehensive services to those who suffer from severe mental health issues. The Committee is aware that lack of coordinated and accessible treatment for individuals with mental health and co-oc-curring disorders often results in avoidable arrest and incarcer- VerDate Sep 11 2014 that these individuals often recidivate in part due to gaps in addressing their needs. Communities of color are often dis-proportionately impacted by these service gaps. The Committee en-courages SAMHSA to prioritize funding for centers that provide as-sistance to those with severe mental health needs who are at risk of recidivism. These mental health centers can provide, but are not limited to, the following services: crisis care, residential treatment, outpatient mental health and primary care services, and commu-nity re-entry supports. The Committee also encourages SAMHSA to prioritize applications from areas with high rates of uninsured indi-viduals, poverty, and substance use disorders. Garrett Lee Smith (GLS) Youth Suicide Prevention. \u2014The Com- mittee includes an increase of $10,000,000 for GLS Youth Suicide Prevention, to develop and implement youth suicide prevention and early intervention strategies. Healthy Transitions. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 for the Healthy Transitions program, which provides grants to States and tribes to improve access to mental disorder treatment and related support services for young people aged 16 to 25 who either have or at risk of developing a serious mental health condition. Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health. \u2014The Committee rec- ognizes the importance of building mental health services for chil-dren under the age of six and includes an increase of $17,000,000 for Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health. This will support increased access to a range of evidence-based and culturally appro-priate infant and early childhood mental health services, and aid in addressing the national shortage of mental health professionals with infant and early childhood expertise. The Committee urges SAMHSA to expand grants to entities such as State agencies, tribal communities, and university or medical centers that are in dif-ferent stages of developing infant and early childhood mental health services. These entities should have the capacity to lead partners in systems-level change as well as building or enhancing the basic components of such early childhood services, including an appropriately trained workforce. The Committee is pleased with SAMHSA's use of a portion of funding to provide technical assist-ance to existing grantees to better integrate infant and early child-hood mental health into state systems and encourages that work to continue. Interagency Task Force for Trauma-Informed Care. \u2014The Com- mittee includes $1,000,000 for the Interagency Task Force for Trauma-Informed Care, as authorized by the SUPPORT Act, to de-velop best practices to identify, prevent, and mitigate the effects of trauma on infants, children, youth, and their families. Minority Fellowship. \u2014The Committee provides $20,289,000, an increase of $4,120,000, for the Minority Fellowship program in order to improve prevention, wellness, and treatment across the lifespan. As Congress seeks to better address substance misuse and mental health disorders across all populations, the Committee rec-ognizes the critical importance of supporting a diverse behavioral health workforce and its effectiveness in addressing substance use disorders and mental health issues impacting minority and under-served populations. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 for Suicide Prevention. \u2014The Committee in- cludes an increase of $5,000,000 for the implementation of the Zero Suicide model, a comprehensive, multi-setting approach to suicide prevention in health care systems. The Committee also includes an increase of $500,000 for the AI/AN Suicide Prevention Initiative. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline The Committee recognizes that suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States, taking the lives of more than 47,000 Americans every year. According to the CDC, mental health and suicidal ideation have worsened significantly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; approximately twice as many individuals have reported serious thoughts of suicide and 40 percent of adults reported struggling with mental health or substance use. The Com-mittee includes an increase of $89,621,000, which is $12,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to enhance the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline's (NSPL) infrastructure in preparation for the launch to a new 988 number in July 2022. 988 has the po-tential to make it simpler for people experiencing a mental health crisis to connect with lifesaving crisis intervention services. How-ever, the Committee is disappointed that SAMHSA has not com-pleted the report on the resources required to implement 988, as required by the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act (P.L. 116-172). This report is critical in ensuring the appropriate amount of funding is available to strengthen the infrastructure of the existing Lifeline to increase the capacity of Lifeline centers to be ready to respond to the expected increase in calls, chats, and texts from people in crisis seeking assistance. The Committee di-rects SAMHSA to provide this report within 30 days of enactment of this Act. The Committee also directs that as SAMHSA works to enhance the NSPL infrastructure, it should expand existing capa-bilities for response in a manner that, to the extent possible, uti-lizes existing phone, chat, and text capabilities. NSPL Specialized Services for LGBTQ Youth. \u2014The Committee directs that of the funds made available for NSPL, $7,200,000 shall be used to provide specialized services for LGBTQ youth within the NSPL. SAMHSA shall make this funding competitively available to an organization with experience working with LGBTQ youth and capable of handling LGBTQ youth callers through Integrated Voice Response. NSPL Text-Based Crisis Support Capabilities. \u2014The Committee is aware that texting for individuals experiencing a mental health crisis is important, particularly among young people for whom texting is often a preferable means of communication to voice calls. The Committee also recognizes the significant operational and fi-nancial challenge of building the infrastructure for text capacity to support implementation of text to the 988 number by the network of local crisis centers that support the NSPL. Given the high num-ber of individuals whose cell phone number does not match the cell phone area code in their area, the regional model that is in place for routing telephone calls to a local crisis center may not be nec-essary for texters in crisis. Furthermore, both the Veterans Crisis Line and the Disaster Distress Hotline have employed national backup centers to receive texts. As SAMHSA considers making text-based crisis support capabilities available to members of the VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Committee directs SAMHSA to avoid duplicating exist- ing capabilities to the extent possible. The Committee directs SAMHSA to coordinate and work with existing text and chat pro-viders that have the technology to triage text conversations based upon severity of risk, to improve risk assessment and response ca-pacity. NSPL Partnerships. \u2014The Committee recognizes that the des- ignation of 988 as the new three-digit dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline will help increase the effectiveness of suicide prevention efforts, increase access to crisis services, reduce the stigma of mental health conditions, and save lives. As SAMHSA considers partnerships to administer 988, the Committee encourages SAMHSA to consider partnering with non-profit or aca-demic institutions with first-hand experience administering a na-tional network of local behavioral health crisis call services to en-sure the highest level of quality and efficiency. Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration. \u2014The Com- mittee includes an increase of $5,000,000 to improve the coordina-tion and integration of primary care services and publicly funded behavioral health services. Project AWARE. \u2014To increase access to mental health services, as set out by the 2013 ''Now is the Time'' plan, the Committee in-cludes a total increase of $48,501,000 for Project AWARE, which is designed to identify children and youth in need of mental health services, to increase access to mental health treatment, and to pro-mote mental health literacy among teachers and school personnel. This includes an increase of $42,251,000 for Project AWARE state grants, an increase of $6,250,000 for Resilience in Communities after Stress and Trauma (ReCAST) grants. In addition, the Com-mittee includes an increase of $11,982,000 for Mental Health Awareness Training. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to sus-tain and strengthen its grant and other programs that support school-based and campus-based services aimed at preventing and treating mental health challenges experienced by younger Ameri-cans. Tribal Behavioral Grants. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $4,250,000 to expand efforts to address the high incidence of substance misuse and suicide among American Indian/Alaska Na-tive populations. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHC) .\u2014The Committee includes an increase of $125,000,000 for the CCHBC program. In addition, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) in-cluded $420,000,000 to support CCBHCs. The Committee is pleased that the CCBHC program is expanding access to mental health and SUD treatment services and significantly reducing hos-pital emergency room utilization. CCBHCs are required to partner with local agencies and this often includes partnering with law en-forcement to develop safe and effective crisis response. The Com-mittee directs SAMHSA to continue to make funds available na-tionwide and to prioritize resources to entities within States that are part of section 223(a) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-93) demonstration and to entities within States that were awarded planning grants. Children's Mental Health. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $25,000,000 for the Children's Mental Health program, which VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 technical assistance for community-based serv- ices for children and adolescents with serious emotional, behav-ioral, or mental disorders, and assists States and local jurisdictions in developing integrated systems of community care. Mental Health Block Grant The Committee includes $1,582,571,000, an increase of $825,000,000, for the Mental Health Block Grant (MHBG). In addi-tion, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $1,500,000,000 for the MHBG. The MHBG provides funds to States to support mental illness prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services. Funds are allocated according to a statutory formula among the States that have submitted approved annual plans. The Committee continues the 10 percent set-aside within the MHBG for evidence-based programs that address the needs of individuals with early serious mental illness, including psychotic disorders. The Committee expects SAMHSA to continue its collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and to encourage States to use this funding to support programs that demonstrate strong evidence of effectiveness. In addition, the Committee urges States to use a portion of their MHBG formula funding to provide mental health services to the survivors of mass shootings as well as their families. MHBG Crisis Care Set-Aside. \u2014The Committee includes a 10 per- cent set-aside in the MHBG for evidence-based crisis care programs addressing the needs of individuals with serious mental illnesses and children with serious mental and emotional disturbances. The Committee directs SAMHSA to use the set-aside to fund, at the discretion of eligible States and territories, some or all of a set of core crisis care elements including: local, regional or statewide call centers that have capacity to address distressed and suicidal callers and deploy mobile teams or direct persons to accessible crisis re-ceiving centers or clinics with same day appointments, mobile crisis response teams and crisis receiving units. The goal is a crisis care system where a person in crisis will have someone to talk to, some-one to respond, and/or somewhere to go for crisis intervention at any time. MHBG Prevention and Early Intervention Set-Aside. \u2014The Com- mittee understands that early intervention is critical if we are to prevent or mitigate the effects of mental illness and enable individ-uals to live fulfilling, productive lives. The Committee notes emerg-ing science developed by the NIMH on early intervention and pre-vention of mental disorders. Many neuropsychiatric illnesses have a typical age of onset in late adolescence, and studies demonstrate that half of those who will develop mental health disorders show symptoms by age 14. To increase access to early intervention and prevention services, the Committee includes a new 10 percent set- aside within the MHBG total to support evidence-based programs that address early intervention and prevention of mental disorders among at-risk children, including young children and toddlers, and adolescents. The Committee directs SAMHSA to use the set-aside to fund, at the discretion of eligible States and territories, activities targeted to children and youth such as, but not limited to, training school-based personnel to identify children and youth at risk of mental disorders; programs to promote positive social-emotional de- VerDate Sep 11 from birth to age five; mental health con- sultation for child care programs; collaborating with primary care associations to field depression and anxiety screening tools in front line primary care practices; or partnering with local non-profit enti-ties in low-income and minority communities to implement trauma- informed early intervention and prevention initiatives. Statutory state plan and reporting requirements will apply to early interven-tion and prevention set-aside programming. MHBG and Children Ages 0-5 .\u2014The Committee strongly be- lieves that by investing in early mental health prevention, identi-fication, and treatment, we can reduce the need for treatment later in life when it becomes much more difficult, time intensive, and ex-pensive. Early intervention can change the course for children ex-periencing or at risk of developing mental health disorders. The Committee is concerned that there has not been a sufficient focus on this population. The Committee strongly urges States to dedi-cate a portion of their MHBG funding through the new Prevention and Early Intervention Set-Aside for services and activities related to infants and toddlers, such as expanding the infant and early childhood mental health workforce; improving the quality of serv-ices available to children and families; increasing knowledge of in-fant and early childhood mental health among professionals who see children most; and strengthening systems and networks for identification and referral to reach more young children in need. The Committee directs SAMHSA to provide a report, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, on the portion of MHBG funding that States are allocating to services and activities for infants and toddlers. Mental Health Disparities. \u2014The Committee believes that ad- dressing health care disparities experienced by racial and ethnic minorities should be a priority in programs funded by Federal agencies, including programs funded in whole or part by the Com-munity Mental Health Services Block Grant authorized under 42 U.S.C. 300x 1. The Committee directs SAMHSA to require, in the reporting mandated of states receiving funds under 42 U.S.C. 300x 1, that State Mental Health Agencies report on the extent to which services are provided to individuals from racial and ethnic minori-ties and the outcomes experienced by those individuals. The Com-mittee directs that impact and outcomes should be reported for ra-cial and ethnic minority adults with serious mental illness and ra-cial and ethnic minority children with serious emotional disturb-ance in reports of data submitted relating to diversions from hos-pitalization, arrests, treatment for first episode psychosis, reduc-tions in suicide, response through crisis services, and treatment of homeless individuals. State Mental Health Agencies shall also re-port on outreach to, and the hiring of, racial and ethnic minority providers of mental health services. Mental Health Crisis Response Partnership Pilot Program. \u2014The Committee is aware that the lack of sufficient mental health care resources in communities too often results in law enforcement re-sponding to what is actually a mental health emergency. SAMHSA's ''National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care'' outline a roadmap for robust crisis care services that can divert people experiencing a mental health crisis from the criminal justice system into mental health treatment. The Committee has directed VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul significant resources to improve mental health crisis care and in- crease access to mental health services. However, the availability of mental health crisis care remains inconsistent across the United States, and first responders are not always trained and equipped to diffuse a mental health crisis, which can lead to tragic outcomes. Many communities are implementing model programs where men-tal health providers respond to mental health emergencies, some-times in partnership with law enforcement. To make these model programs more widely available, the Committee includes $100,000,000 for a pilot program for communities to create, or en-hance existing, mobile crisis response teams that divert the re-sponse for mental health crises from law enforcement to behavioral health teams. These teams may be composed of licensed counselors, clinical social workers, physicians, EMTs, crisis workers, and/or peers available to respond to people in crisis and provide imme-diate stabilization and referral to community-based mental health services and supports. The Committee encourages grantees to part-ner or co-respond with law enforcement to ensure community polic-ing meets the needs of everyone in the community. The Committee also directs the Department to provide a report, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, on existing steps being taken to strength-en partnerships between mental health providers, behavioral health teams, and first responders, as well as a report not later than one year following the obligation of awards in fiscal year 2022 for this pilot program, including best practices and recommenda-tions for subsequent grant cycles. National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative .\u2014The Committee in- cludes an increase of $28,113,000 for the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative. The Committee strongly supports the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN), which carries out es-sential work in building, evaluating, disseminating, and delivering evidence-based services and best practices, including through uni-versities, hospitals, and front-line providers, to prevent and miti-gate the impact of exposure to trauma among children and fami-lies. The Committee directs SAMHSA to ensure that the NCTSN maintains its focus on collaboration, data collection, and the provi-sion of direct services and that new grants should not be awarded as training only. Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) The Committee includes an increase of $10,000,000 for the PATH program, which supports grants to States and territories for assist-ance to individuals suffering from severe mental illness and/or sub-stance use disorders and who are experiencing homelessness or at imminent risk of becoming homeless. Grants may be used for out-reach, screening and diagnostic treatment services, rehabilitation services, community mental health services, alcohol or drug treat-ment services, training, case management services, supportive and supervisory services in residential settings, and a limited set of housing services. HUD/HHS Collaboration Supportive Housing for People with Mental Illness Pilot. \u2014The Committee is concerned that inadequate housing and support opportunities exist for people with serious mental health illness, which often results in people with serious mental illness cycling through hospitals and public institutions like VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul jails, prisons, and homeless shelters. This puts significant strain on public budgets while patients do not receive the robust behavioral health care they need. The Committee recognizes that housing sup-port paired with wraparound services is a successful model and ap-preciates that the fiscal year 2011 President's Budget supported the concept. In fiscal year 2021 the Committee requested a report from HUD and SAMHSA on the feasibility of such a program and received agency feedback for its creation. The Committee directs SAMHSA to work with HUD to establish a pilot program for PATH grantees to partner with public housing agencies to provide mental health, SUD and other supportive services for people experiencing homelessness, at imminent risk of becoming homeless, or in HUD- assisted housing. The Committee directs SAMHSA to use no less than $5,000,000 of the funds made available for the PATH program for this pilot. Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness. \u2014 The Committee includes an increase of $3,854,000, for the Protec-tion and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness program, which ensures that the rights of mentally ill individuals are pro-tected while they are patients in all public and private facilities or while they are living in the community. Funds are allocated to States according to a formula based on population and relative per capita incomes. Addressing Access to Firearms and Suicide Prevention Pro- grams. \u2014The Committee encourages SAMHSA to focus on suicide prevention policies that limit access to firearms and other lethal means when an individual is in crisis. The Committee urges SAMHSA to develop, adapt, and disseminate training on lethal means safety counseling for health care providers; to collaborate with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to develop gun storage maps, accessible by both VA health care providers and Crisis Center counselors, to facilitate temporary out-of-home firearm storage; and to encourage the incorporation of tools such as extreme risk laws into risk miti-gation and response plans. Behavioral Health Intervention Training. \u2014The Committee en- courages the Secretary, acting through the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, to develop school-based evi-dence-based best practices addressing behavioral health interven-tion training to support practices that assist children and youth with behavioral health needs. One potential best practice is behav-ioral intervention teams\u2014a team of qualified individuals who are responsible for identifying and assessing behaviors of concern and facilitating the implementation of evidence-based interventions. Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health of Older Americans. \u2014 The Committee recognizes the exacerbated impact of COVID-19 on older adults, who, being more susceptible to the virus, have experi-enced heightened isolation since the onset of the pandemic, which is linked to higher rates of loneliness, depression, suicidal ideation, and other mental health issues. Research shows that rates of anx-iety and depression among older adults during the pandemic are higher among female, Hispanic, and low-income seniors. In dis-bursing MHBG funds, the Committee encourages SAMHSA to work with States to address the impact of increased isolation of seniors. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Health Centers of Excellence. \u2014The Committee recognizes the need for more effective mental health programs and a need to better provide treatment recommendations to meet the needs of those experiencing mental illness. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to establish a center of excellence program focused on comprehensive mental health treatments. The Centers will focus on the development, evaluation, and distribution of evidence-based re-sources regarding comprehensive treatment recommendations for mental health patients that include supportive services, wrap-around services, and social determinants of health where applica-ble. The Centers will also work to disseminate treatment rec-ommendations to the broader network of mental health clinicians. Preference should be given to entities that can demonstrate exist-ing behavioral health medical home model services, CCBHC imple-mentation, work with HUD's Housing for Persons with Disabilities (Section 811) program, collaborative care agreements with primary care practices, and/or programs for supported living and supported employment. One grantee should be designated as the National Co-ordinating Center across the selected centers and provide technical expertise across all recipients. Perinatal Suicide Prevention. \u2014Perinatal suicides, which occur during pregnancy or up to one year postpartum, are a leading cause of maternal mortality in the United States. The prevalence of suicidal ideation among pregnant and postpartum individuals was five times higher in 2017 than in 2006, and during that period, Black pregnant and postpartum individuals experienced larger in-creases in suicidality than other racial and ethnic groups. Given these trends, the Committee urges SAMHSA to develop and imple-ment perinatal suicide prevention programs, including culturally appropriate resources and programs for Black and other at-risk pregnant and postpartum individuals. SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $3,854,756,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 5,511,943,000 Change from ......................................................... +1,657,187,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5897,000,000 Within the total provided for Programs of Regional and National Significance, the Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Capacity: Opioid Treatment Programs and Regulatory Activities ......................................................................... $13 ,086,000 Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment ........................................................................... Improving Access to Overdose Treatment Building Communities of Recovery ............................................................................................... ........ 20,000,000 Peer Support Technical Assistance Center Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Department Alternatives to and Workforce Support ..................................................................................... .. and Service: Addiction Technology 9,046,000 Minority Fellowship Program .................................................................................................... ............. 7,186,000 Building Communities of Recovery. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $10,000,000 to support the development, enhancement, expansion and delivery of recovery support services. Children and Families. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $592,000 for the Children and Families program, which makes ap-propriate treatment available to youth and their families or care-givers to reduce the impact of SUD and/or co-occurring mental and substance use disorders on communities in the U.S. Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers. \u2014The Committee in- cludes an increase of $2,000,000 for Comprehensive Opioid Recov-ery Centers, as authorized by section 7121 of the SUPPORT Act (P.L. 115-271), to help ensure that people with SUD can access proper treatment. Criminal Justice Activities and Drug Courts. \u2014The Committee in- cludes an increase of $35,380,000 for Criminal Justice activities. Of this amount, $35,000,000 is directed to Drug Court activities. The Committee continues to direct SAMHSA to ensure that all funding appropriated for drug treatment courts is allocated to serve people diagnosed with a substance use disorder as their primary condition. The Committee directs SAMHSA to ensure that all drug treatment court grant recipients work directly with the corresponding State substance abuse agency in the planning, implementation, and eval-uation of the grant. The Committee further directs SAMHSA to ex-pand training and technical assistance to drug treatment court grant recipients to ensure evidence-based practices are fully imple-mented. Emergency Department Alternatives to Opioids. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $3,000,000 for Emergency Department Al-ternatives to Opioids, as authorized by section 7091 of the SUP-PORT Act (P.L. 115-271). This program provides funding to hos-pitals and emergency departments to develop and implement alter-native pain management protocols and treatments that limit the prescribing of opioids in emergency departments. Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdose and First Responder Training. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $6,000,000 for Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Over-dose Deaths, and an increase of $21,000,000, for First Responder Training for Opioid Overdose Reversal Drugs, which includes an increase of $12,000,000 for a rural set-aside. The Committee directs that $6,500,000 of funds for First Responder Training be made available to SIREN grants. The Committee notes strong concerns about the increasing number of unintentional overdose deaths at-tributable to prescription and nonprescription opioids. The Com-mittee urges SAMHSA to take steps to encourage and support the VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul for opioid safety education and training, including ini- tiatives that improve access for licensed health care professionals, including paramedics, to emergency devices used to rapidly reverse the effects of opioid overdoses. Such initiatives should incorporate robust evidence-based intervention training and facilitate linkage to treatment and recovery services. Improving Access to Overdose Treatment. \u2014The Committee in- cludes an increase of $500,000 to train and support health care providers and pharmacists on the prescribing of FDA approved drugs or devices for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose. Minority AIDS Initiative. \u2014The Committee includes a total of $119,275,000, an increase of $3,276,000, to expand access to effec-tive, culturally competent, HIV/AIDS-related mental health serv-ices in racial and ethnic minority communities, for people living with an SMI and who are living with or are at high risk for HIV/ AIDS. Peer Support Technical Assistance Center. \u2014The Committee in- cludes an increase of $500,000 to provide technical assistance to re-covery community organizations and peer support networks. Pregnant and Postpartum Women SUD Treatment. \u2014The Com- mittee includes an increase of $16,466,000 for the Pregnant and Postpartum Women program and recognizes SAMSHA for its work managing this program, which utilizes a family-centered approach to provide comprehensive residential SUD treatment services for pregnant and postpartum women, their minor children and other family members. A provision in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) authorizes SAMSHA to allocate a portion of these resources for a pilot program to State alcohol and drug agen-cies to support outpatient, intensive outpatient and related services in a family centered approach. The Committee again encourages SAMHSA to fund an additional cohort of States above and beyond those pilots already funded. Recovery Community Services. \u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $2,717,000 to help recovery communities strengthen their infrastructure and provide peer recovery support services to those in or seeking recovery from SUD. The intent of the Recovery Com-munity Services Program Statewide Network (RSCP-SN) program is to strengthen the relationships between RCOs and their state-wide networks of recovery stakeholders as key partners in the de-livery of state and local treatment and recovery support services (RSS), as well as allied health systems through collaboration, sys-tems improvement, public health messaging, and training con-ducted for (or with) key recovery stakeholder organizations. RCSP- SN grantees collaborate with traditional SUD treatment providers and other purchasers of PRSS to strengthen and embed these crit-ical service elements as fixtures on the Recovery Oriented Systems of Care (ROSC) landscape. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT). \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $2,510,000, for SBIRT. The Committee recognizes that SBIRT is still not widely adopted by broader health care or social service networks, particu-larly in underserved communities. Failure to routinely screen youth and adults for early misuse of opioids and other substances is a missed opportunity to stem the substance misuse crisis. The Committee urges SAMHSA to continue working to ensure SBIRT VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 screening is more widely adopted by health providers, and directs this increase be used for implementing grants to pediatric health care providers in accordance with the specifications outlined in Sec-tion 9016 of P.L. 114-255, Sober Truth in Preventing Underage Drinking Reauthorization. Training grants should focus on screen-ing for underage drinking, opioid use, and other drug use, and be managed by CSAT within the existing SBIRT program. Targeted Capacity Expansion-Medication Assisted Treatment. \u2014 The Committee includes an increase of $56,500,000 for Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) for Prescription Drug and Opioid Addic-tion; an increase of $5,500,000, for grants to Indian tribes, tribal organizations, or consortia; and an increase of $224,000 for general Targeted Capacity Expansion activities. Treatment Systems for Homeless. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $3,728,000 to support services for people with alcohol or another SUD and who are experiencing homelessness, including youth, veterans, and families. Treatment, Recovery, and Workforce Support. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $3,000,000 for Treatment, Recovery, and Workforce Support, as authorized by section 7183 of the SUPPORT Act (P.L. 115-271). This program will help implement evidence- based programs to support individuals in substance use disorder treatment and recovery to live independently and participate in the workforce. State Opioid Response (SOR) Grants The Committee includes $2,000,000,000 for SOR grants, an in- crease of $500,000,000. The Committee directs SAMHSA to con-tinue supplemental grants in fiscal year 2022 to States whose award from the SOR formula grant declines by more than 40 per-cent in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2019. The Com-mittee further directs SAMHSA to ensure that these resources con-tinue to be managed by State alcohol and drug agencies defined as the agency that manages the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant under part B of title X of the Public Health Service Act. This approach will ensure continuity of funding, effec-tive coordination of efforts, and decrease fragmentation within each State system. SOR Funding Cliff. \u2014The Committee continues to include a 15 percent set-aside for States with the highest age-adjusted mortality rate related to opioid use disorders. The Committee remains con-cerned longstanding guidance to the Department to avoid a signifi-cant cliff between States with similar mortality rates was over-looked in the award for fiscal year 2020 funds. When the deter-mination of new award amounts is made in fiscal year 2022, the Committee directs the Assistant Secretary to award funds to avoid funding cliffs between States with similar mortality rates. The Committee notes that funding cliffs between grant cycles can pose a significant challenge for States seeking to maintain programs that were instrumental in reducing drug overdose fatalities. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on the extent to which such reductions to States in previous grant cycles affected outreach and provision of services, as well as treatment and recovery outcomes. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant The Committee includes a program level of $2,858,079,000 for the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SABG), an increase of $1,000,000,000. In addition, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $1,500,000,000 for the SABG. SABG provides funding to States to support alcohol and drug abuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services. The Committee recognizes the critical role the block grant plays in State systems across the country, giving States the flexibility to direct resources to address the most pressing needs of localities across the State. The Committee also recognizes that the 20 percent prevention set- aside within the SABG is a vital source of funding for primary pre-vention. The prevention set-aside represents an average of 62 per-cent of all State alcohol and drug agency's budget for primary pre-vention and is essential to ending the substance misuse crisis. SABG Recovery Set-Aside. \u2014The Committee establishes a ten per- cent set-aside within total SABG funding for the provision of evi-dence-informed SUD non-clinical recovery supports and services. The Committee directs SAMHSA to ensure that this set-aside shall support programs that: (1) develop local recovery community sup-port institutions including but not limited to recovery community centers, recovery homes, and recovery schools or programs to mobi-lize resources within and outside of the recovery community, to in-crease the prevalence and quality of long-term recovery from SUD; (2) provide peer-based recovery coaching, individual or group sup-ports, to individuals and families led by those with lived experience with SUD, delivered in person or using technology; (3) provide an-cillary community-based supports necessary to sustain recovery, in-cluding access to transportation, job training, and educational serv-ices; (4) provide activities to reduce SUD recovery-related stigma and discrimination at the local level; (5) provide technical assist-ance to organizations principally governed by people in recovery from SUD through facilitating financing, business functions and cross-training on evidence informed practices within the recovery community. The Committee directs SAMHSA to prioritize pro-grams for underserved populations, to promote health equity, and to support community-based strategies to increase recovery capital and support individuals to sustain long-term recovery, as identified at the local, regional and/or state level by the recovery community. Funds from the recovery set-aside will support operating costs for organizations that provide above services, prioritizing those with leadership, staffing and governance structures that include rep-resentation from those identified as in long-term recovery and im-pacted family members who reflect the community served. Block Grant Reporting Requirements. \u2014The Committee acknowl- edges the important role of the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grants in supporting States' efforts to provide resources for expanded mental health and substance use disorder treatment and prevention services. The Committee is concerned with the lack of transparency and informa-tion that is provided to Congress and the public about how States are distributing those funds and what programs or services they are going toward. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to begin implementing public reporting on their existing block grants. The Committee directs SAMHSA to submit a report, 180 days after the VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul enactment of this Act, to identify any staffing, IT infrastructure, legislative policies, or funding barriers that would prevent grantees and SAMHSA from collecting and providing outcome data on their block grant programs. Data Collection for SUD Grants to States. \u2014A December 2020 GAO report examining SUD grants to States found that SAMHSA does not have consistent, relevant, and timely data on the number of individuals provided treatment and recovery support through the SABG, State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis Grant (STR), and SOR programs. The Committee recognizes the challenges the lack of data poses in evaluating the effectiveness of these grants and encourages SAMHSA to adopt GAO's recommendation to iden-tify and implement changes to their data collection efforts to im-prove the consistency, relevance, and timeliness of data collected on the number of individuals who receive substance use disorder treatment and recovery support services with funding from the SABG and SOR programs. Evidence-Based Practices to Combat the Opioid Crisis. \u2014The CDC projects that more than 88,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States in the 12 months ending in August 2020, the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a 12-month pe-riod. Given the acceleration of the drug overdose epidemic, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Committee directs SAMSHA to encourage States to use grant funds provided to combat this sub-stance use disorder crisis to prioritize evidence-based best practices exemplified by the states, including but not limited to: Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND), Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT), Warm Handoff Protocols for Overdose Survivors Discharged from Emergency Rooms, and peer recovery support groups. The Committee directs that SAMHSA-funded SUD treat-ment and recovery activities shall include evidence-based, self-em-powering, mutual aid recovery support programs that expressly support MAT. Evidence-Based Programs for People Experiencing Homeless- ness. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of access to SUD treatment for individuals experiencing homelessness. The Com-mittee encourages SAMHSA to prioritize the development of evi-dence-based programs and treatments specifically tailored for those with alcohol and substance use disorder and who are at a high risk of becoming homeless, and to consider grant applications that in-clude targeting resources to address SUD within the homeless pop-ulation. National Recovery Month. \u2014The Committee recognizes that Na- tional Recovery Month is a meaningful observation to recognize in-dividuals in recovery from substance use disorders and mental ill- ness. Between September 2019 and August 2020, more than 85,000 people nationwide died from drug overdoses and 47,000 nationwide died from suicide in 2019. Promoting awareness of treatment for substance use and mental health disorders and combating stigma, both goals of National Recovery Month, are important steps to help prevent overdoses and suicide. The Committee recognizes SAMHSA as an important leader in National Recovery Month and encour-ages SAMHSA to maintain a leadership role in these efforts. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Committee recognizes that relapse might occur after opioid use disorder treatment. The Com-mittee appreciates SAMHSA's efforts to address this by empha-sizing the importance of adherence to evidence-based practices that have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of relapse to opioid de-pendence, and encourages SAMHSA to disseminate and emphasize implementation of these practices in all settings where treatment is offered, including rehabilitation and criminal justice settings. Substance Use Disorder Response in Rural America. \u2014The Com- mittee is aware that response to the SUD crisis continues to pose unique challenges for rural America, which suffers from problems related to limited access to both appropriate care and health pro-fessionals critical to diagnosing and treating patients along with supporting recovery. Rural America's unique challenges require a comprehensive approach, including training to provide care in a culturally responsive manner with an understanding of diverse populations; the use of technologies to ensure improved access to medically underserved areas through the use of telehealth; and workforce and skills development to advance data capture and ana-lytics. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to support initiatives to advance SUD objectives in rural areas, specifically focusing on addressing the needs of individuals with SUD in rural and medi-cally-underserved areas, and programs that stress a comprehensive community-based approach involving academic institutions, health care providers, and local criminal justice systems. Recovery Housing. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of recovery housing, in which individuals abstain from use of non-pre-scribed substances in a supportive environment. Research shows that individuals with SUD who live in recovery housing are more likely to maintain recovery, have higher rates of employment, and are less likely to become incarcerated. In order to increase the availability of high-quality recovery housing, the Committee en-courages SAMHSA to collaborate with other Federal agencies, in-cluding HUD, the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, to coordinate activities across the Federal government and develop recommendations to improve poli-cies on recovery housing. SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $208,219,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 243,503,000 Change from ......................................................... +35,284,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +26,836,000 Within the total provided for Programs of Regional and National Significance, the Committee provides the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Capacity: Strategic Preventing Underage Drinking .................................................................................... 15,000,000 National Adult-Oriented Media Public Service Campaign Community Based Coalition Enhancement Grants ...................................................................... 11,500,000 11 2014 FY 2022 Committee Interagency Coordinating Committee to Prevent Underage Drinking .......................................... 1,000,000 Tribal Behavioral Health Grants ................................................................................................ ........... 25,000,000 At-Home Drug Disposal Demonstration ............................................................................ 3,0 00,000 Science and Service: Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies ........................................................................ 7, 493,000 Science and Service Program Coordination Minority Fellowship Program .................................................................................................... Drug Disposal Demonstration and Evalua- tion.\u2014The Committee is aware that many unused and unwanted prescription opioids and other powerful medications remain in homes and are subject to diversion. This is too often the beginning of a pathway to dependence, substance use disorder, and overdose. Furthermore, medication take-back programs are difficult to access for many Americans and inadequate to broadly impact disposal be-havior. Newer technologies to deactivate and safely dispose of pre-scription drugs in the home have been shown through independent research to lead to improved outcomes. The Committee includes $3,000,000 for an at-home drug deactivation and disposal dem-onstration and evaluation initiative and urges SAMHSA to make a diverse selection of grantees including urban, rural, and tribal government partners. The initiative will assess the effectiveness of drug disposal technologies that meet the standard in Section 3032 of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1(e)(4)(B)). Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies. \u2014The Com- mittee encourages SAMHSA to ensure eligibility for private, non- profit, and regional organizations, including faith-based organiza-tions, for the Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies. The broad coalitions orchestrated by these regional organizations are uniquely positioned to supplement the work already being done by the state, tribal, and community organizations currently author-ized for such grants. Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking (STOP) Act. \u2014The Committee includes $15,000,000, an increase of $5,000,000, for the STOP Act. Of this amount, $11,500,000 is for the Community Based Enhancement Grant Program to help community coalitions address underage drinking; $2,500,000 is for an annual public serv-ice campaign on underage drinking; and $1,000,000 is for the ICCPUD to carry out its reporting and coordination responsibil-ities. The Committee is disappointed that SAMHSA has not re-leased a new Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) for the STOP Act Community Based Enhancement Grant program since 2019 and directs SAMHSA to ensure a new FOA for this program is released in fiscal year 2022. Strategic Prevention Framework. \u2014The Committee provides $139,484,000, an increase of $20,000,000, for the Strategic Preven-tion Framework (SPF). Of the total provided, $124,484,000 is for SPF-Partnerships for Success (SPF-PFS) and $15,000,000 is for SPF-Rx. The Committee strongly believes that investing in preven-tion is essential to ending the substance misuse crisis, and sup-ports the SPF-PFS program, which is designed to prevent the onset of substance misuse, while strengthening prevention capacity and infrastructure. The Committee intends that this program sup- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 substance use prevention strate- gies to stop or delay the age of initiation of each State or local ap-plicant's most pressing substance use issues, as determined by the State and/or local epidemiological data. The Committee directs SAMHSA to issue a report, within 120 days of enactment of this Act, assessing the extent to which the work of local grantees com-plements and align with the primary prevention efforts led by the corresponding State alcohol and drug agency. SUD Prevention Workforce. \u2014The Committee recognizes that the nation's work on SUD prevention relies on an adequate supply of educated prevention professionals. The Committee is aware that more data and information is needed about the SUD prevention workforce. Therefore, the Committee directs SAMHSA to conduct a comprehensive national study regarding the substance use preven-tion workforce. The study should include an environmental scan of the existing workforce, salaries, current challenges in maintaining support for an adequate workforce, a plan to address these chal-lenges and potential federal programming to help implement the plan. The Committee directs SAMHSA to develop the study in con-sultation with relevant stakeholders, including the association rep-resenting State alcohol and drug agencies, researchers, and others. Tribal Behavioral Grants. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $4,250,000 to expand efforts to address the high incidence of substance misuse and suicide among American Indian/Alaska Na-tive populations.

Health Surveillance. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $337,000 to support activities of the Center for Behavioral Health VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul and Quality and an increase of $200,000 for Performance and Quality Information Systems. Program Support. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $5,316,000 for SAMHSA personnel costs, the first increase in four years, to ensure SAMHSA has the resources to respond to the growing mental health and substance use crises. Public Awareness and Support. \u2014The Committee includes an in- crease of $260,000 to raise awareness and understanding of mental and substance use disorders. Data on Substance Misuse in the U.S. Territories. \u2014The Com- mittee has serious concerns about the limited availability of data regarding drug and substance misuse in Puerto Rico and the rest of the U.S. territories. The Committee is particularly concerned that the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) does not include statistics from these jurisdictions. The Committee therefore encourages SAMHSA to take all reasonable steps to in-clude Puerto Rico and the rest of the territories in the NSDUH, in the same manner that data is collected and published for the 50 States and the District of Columbia, and to submit a report detail-ing its efforts not later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act. PTSD in First Responders. \u2014The Committee is aware of research indicating that individuals working in the civilian first responder disciplines of law enforcement, fire services, and emergency med-ical services are at greater risk for full or partial post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than most other occupations because their responsibilities routinely entail confrontation with traumatic stressors. Within the funds provided for Health Surveillance and Program Support, the Committee directs SAMHSA to sponsor a re-port that examines what is known and where there are gaps re-garding trauma and stressor-related disorders among this popu-lation, including prevalence rate, risk factors, symptom presen-tation, course, comorbidities, and rates of suicidal thoughts and ac-tions, barriers to accessing and seeking care. This report would serve as a foundation for future surveillance ad program opportuni-ties. State Opioid Response Network-Technical Assistance. \u2014The Com- mittee to continue funding the State Opioid Re-sponse Network-Technical Assistance grant that funds the Opioid Response Network to provide locally based technically assistance teams within the Administrative portion of the appropriated amounts for SOR grants. The Committee recognizes the essential work currently being done by the Opioid Response Network in de-livering technical assistance to SOR grantees, sub-recipients and others addressing opioid use disorder and stimulant use disorder in their communities. A GENCY FORHEALTHCARE RESEARCH ANDQUALITY HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY Appropriation, fiscal ......................................................... $338,000,000 udget 380,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +34,650,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Committee includes $380,000,000 in program level funding for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), $34,650,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The total includes $250,792,000 in discretionary budget authority and $129,208,000 in PHS Act section 241 evaluation set-aside transfers. AHRQ's mission is to produce evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable, and to work within HHS and with other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used. AHRQ conducts, supports, and disseminates scientific and policy-relevant research on topics such as promoting high-quality care, eliminating health care disparities, using information technology, and evaluating the effectiveness of clinical services. Within the total for AHRQ, the House includes the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Scientific Support for the US Preventive Services Task Force ................................................................... ... 11,542,000 Digital Health Care Safety Research ........................................................................................................ ......................... Research, Data, and Dissemination 127,053,000 Medical Expenditure ....................... 73,300,000 Antimicrobial Committee continues to provide no less than $10,000,000 for activities related to combating anti-biotic-resistant bacteria. Accessibility of Online Telehealth Platforms. \u2014The Committee recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic led to the increased use of online portals and web services for patients seeking information, scheduling, and accessing remote services. However, the Committee is concerned that many online platforms are not user-friendly, es-pecially for less digitally literate communities, including seniors. The Committee urges AHRQ to coordinate with ONC, CMS, and OCR on any Federal efforts that could be made to evaluate the ac-cessibility of digital health platforms for Federally-supported pro-viders, including any assessments of how seniors and persons with disabilities are included in the design and testing of the platforms. Further, the Committee urges AHRQ to work with ONC, CMS and OCR to establish best practices for health care providers to im-prove their online telehealth platforms for seniors, individuals with disabilities, and individuals with limited English proficiency. Cardiovascular Clinical Outcomes. \u2014The Committee looks for- ward to receiving the study requested in the Consolidated Appro-priations Act, 2021 that assesses the current evidence for lipid con-trol and cardiovascular event reduction and quality measures for the improvement of clinical outcomes (e.g. coronary heart disease death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or urgent coronary revascularization procedure). The Committee also encourages AHRQ to develop and disseminate education resources and mate-rials about improving cardiovascular clinical outcomes. Center for Primary Care Research. \u2014The Committee includes $5,000,000 to establish the Center for Primary Care Research au-thorized at 42 USC 299b-4(b). AHRQ is uniquely positioned to sup-port primary care clinical and practice research and to help dis- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 nationwide. The 2021 NASEM report on High Quality Primary Care supported the importance of targeted funding for Primary Care Research (PCR) and recommended prioritization of funding for AHRQ's Center for Excellence in Pri-mary Care Research. In 2020, the RAND Corporation published a report requested by Congress that emphasized the significant role AHRQ plays in PCR and recommended providing targeted funds to create a proper hub for Federal PCR. The areas of focus could in-clude strategies to improve primary care delivery, including through the use of clinical pharmacists and inter-professional; team-based care; advancing the development of primary care re-searchers; expanding research on persons with multiple co-morbid conditions; and improving primary care in rural and underserved areas, especially in remote and non-contiguous States. Research on Health Equity. \u2014The Committee includes an increase of $3,000,000 for AHRQ to support investigator-initiated research grants related to health equity and an additional $1,000,000 to support research supplements related to health equity, the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Health System Innovations Responding to COVID-19. \u2014The Com- mittee includes an additional $5,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to support new investigator-initiated re-search grants related to COVID-19, including grants focused on improving the quality of care and patient outcomes; improving pa-tient safety; understanding the pandemic's impact on socially vul-nerable populations and people with multiple chronic conditions; and understanding how digital health innovations such as tele-health contributed to the health system response to COVID-19. Improving Maternal Morbidity and Mortality State and Local Data. \u2014The Committee includes $7,350,000, the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to improve the provision of timely and accurate data about maternal health and the health care system to policymakers, health care providers, and the public. Kratom. \u2014The Committee directs the Secretary to maintain cur- rent Agency policy to not recommend that the substances mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, known as kratom, be per-manently controlled in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, either temporarily or permanently, until scientific research can suf-ficiently support such an action. The Committee encourages AHRQ to continue to fund research on natural products that are used by many to treat pain in place of opioids, including kratom. Given the wide availability and increased use of these substances, it is imper-ative to know more about potential risks or benefits, and whether they can have a role in finding new and effective non-opioid meth-ods to treat pain. The Committee recommends an additional $3,000,000 for this research and directs AHRQ to make center- based grants to address research which will lead to clinical trials in geographic regions which are among the hardest hit by the opioid crisis. Lyme and Other Tick-Borne Diseases (TBD). \u2014The Committee is concerned about the experiences of low-income, minority, and mi-grant populations with Lyme and other TBD and believes that bet-ter data should be developed on the incidence of TBD in these pop-ulations and the experiences of those populations in accessing care for suspected TBD, including provider awareness of TBD, diag- VerDate Sep 11 protocols, and health outcomes. The Com- mittee directs AHRQ to coordinate with HRSA and its Bureau of Primary Health Care and the Office of Rural Health Policy, other HRSA Bureaus and Offices as appropriate, and the Indian Health Service to develop a plan for exploratory research to assess the ex-tent of the problem of TBD in the low income, minority, and mi-grant populations and in the national network of clinics and health centers which provide health care, and which in turn receive a large portion of payments from CMS. Opioids Research. \u2014The Committee includes $5,000,000, an in- crease of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $5,000,000 below the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to support expanded research related to opioid use and misuse, including re-search focused on increasing equity in treatment access and out-comes, accelerating implementation of effective evidence-based care in primary and ambulatory care, and developing whole person mod-els of care that address the social factors which shape treatment and adherence and long-term recovery. Patient Safety Risks and Harms. \u2014The Committee recognizes the seriousness of diagnostic errors in the health care system. Diag-nostic error has been under-recognized and leads to a quarter-mil-lion inpatients experiencing serious hardship each year, including approximately 100,000 deaths. The Committee provides an increase of $8,000,000 for researching diagnostic error and associated risk to patient safety. Prenatal Care for Pregnant Individuals. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes the Department's ongoing efforts to address the pressing pub-lic health issue of rising maternal mortality. Research shows pre-natal care is a critical component of preventative care for pregnant individuals. The Committee includes no less than $500,000, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level, for research that exam-ines the potential cost savings to the public health system of pro-viding a special enrollment period for pregnant individuals, as well as the impact of a special enrollment period on the private insur-ance market. Statewide Surgical Quality Initiatives. \u2014The Committee is aware that several States have moved aggressively to combine the knowl-edge, skills, and resources of diverse hospitals across the State with the expertise of foundations, hospitals associations, and other outside stakeholders to identify and disseminate best practices in surgical care. The goals of the collaborative are to improve surgical outcomes, improve the value of surgical care, and decrease dispari-ties in care. The Committee urges ARHQ to prioritize grants to States that have developed such collaborations and intend to ex-pand by adding more hospitals and incorporate telehealth and mo-bile solutions into higher-value care. Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care. \u2014The Com- mittee provides total funding of $2,000,000 for the purposes author-ized under the Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care Act to establish a pilot program for the creation, distribution, and eval-uation of best practices for medical professionals to identify and re-spond to victims of human trafficking. Medical professionals are in a unique position to identify abuse and help victims of trafficking. Funding this program will ensure they are adequately trained to do so. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Committee is concerned about sig- nificant deficiencies in the process and structure of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as illustrated by its recommendations concerning screening mammography and cer-vical cancer screening. Comprehensive USPSTF reform is nec-essary to ensure that its recommendations further public health for all Americans and address health inequities. USPSTF's process needs to be revised to provide timely recommendations, be fully transparent, afford ample opportunity for public comment at each stage, make such comments publicly available, and provide mean-ingful responses to such comments. The comment process for USPSTF must provide a more robust and transparent opportunity for and public disclosure of expert and patient input, as well as an external advisory board of clinical experts that serves as a check, throughout the process. Moreover, USPSTF's methodologies should be firmly grounded in evidence that most accurately represents the Nation's racial and ethnic subpopulations; this evidence must in-clude high quality real-world data sets and longitudinal or observa-tional studies and not just randomized controlled trials. Specifi-cally, the Committee calls for action on the established lack of data specific to health equity and racial diversity to more clearly inform the USPSTF decision-making. Furthermore, USPSTF should re-view a recommendation upon a showing of new evidence. In addi-tion, USPSTF's composition should reflect an appropriate breadth of practicing physician expertise, including specialist expertise, as well as public input reflecting diverse patient populations. The Committee encourages the USPSTF to adopt these reforms to its process for developing recommendations. C ENTERS FOR MEDICARE & M EDICAID SERVICES GRANTS TO STATES FOR MEDICAID Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ............................................. $313,904,098,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ........................................... ................................................. 368,666,106,000 Change from enacted level ............................................. +54,762,007,000 Change from budget request .......................................... - - - Medicaid provides health coverage to eligible populations, includ- ing eligible low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults, and people with disabilities. Medicaid is administered by States, according to Federal requirements. The program is funded jointly by States and the Federal government. This amount does not include $148,732,315,000, which was pro- vided as advance funding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. In addition, the Committee recommends an advance appropriation of $165,722,018,000 for program costs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, to remain available until expended. The Committee continues bill language providing indefinite budget authority for unanticipated costs in fiscal year 2022. Fed-eral Medicaid grants reimburse States for a portion of their ex-penditures in providing health care for individuals whose income and resources fall below specified levels. Subject to certain min-imum requirements, States are provided certain limited authority within the law to set eligibility, coverage, and payment levels. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul PAYMENTS TO THE HEALTH CARE TRUST FUNDS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ............................................. 439,514,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ........................................... ................................................. 487,862,000,000 Change from enacted level ............................................. +48,348,000,000 Change from budget request .......................................... - - - This account includes the general fund subsidy to the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for Medicare Part B benefits, and Medicare drug benefits and administration, as well as other reimbursements to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for benefits and related to administrative costs, which have not been financed by payroll taxes or premium contributions. The Committee continues bill language providing indefinite authority to pay the general revenue portion of the Medicare Part B premium match and providing resources for the Medicare Part D drug ben-efit program in the event that the annual appropriation is insuffi-cient. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $3,669,744,000 Budget fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 4,315,843,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +646,099,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - Program Operations The Committee includes $4,315,843,000 for Program Operations, which is $646,099,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This appropria-tion includes $25,400,000 for Research, Demonstration and Evalua-tion, which was previously funded on its own line. This office ad-ministers the programs under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), funds beneficiary outreach and education, main-tains information technology infrastructure needed to support var-ious claims processing systems, and supports other programmatic improvements. In addition, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $500,000,000 for the survey and certification program, for strike teams to provide onsite technical assistance and education to nurs-ing homes to reduce transmission and spread of COVID-19. Addressing Domestic Violence and Homelessness. \u2014The Com- mittee recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased both domestic violence and homelessness, as the pandemic has placed great stress on families. CMS has recognized both homelessness and domestic violence as social determinants of health impacting Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries. Model interventions such as Domestic Violence Housing First programs can address this chal-lenge. The Committee requests, within 120 days of enactment of this Act, a report outlining the actions the agency is taking to ad-dress the combination of homelessness and domestic violence, in-cluding how the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) and other parts of CMS are considering the feasibility of creating demonstration programs, in collaboration with the Admin- istration for Children and Families and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, that will engage Medicare and Medicaid providers to address this dual problem. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Childhood Experiences. \u2014The Committee is aware that childhood trauma and toxic stress have been linked to negative health outcomes through adulthood, including higher rates of dia-betes, stroke, depression, lapses in cognitive abilities, develop-mental delays, suicide, and substance misuse, among others. Low- income children are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of ad-verse childhood experiences (ACEs). The Committee directs CMS to comply with the language included in H. Rept. 116-450 which re-quires the agency to work with the National Child Traumatic Stress Network and the CDC to provide a report, no later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, that evaluates how Medicaid could be further leveraged to screen, diagnose, and provide evi-dence-based interventions to children ages 0-21 suffering from ad-verse childhood experiences. Ambulatory Surgical Centers. \u2014The Committee looks forward to receiving the report on ambulatory surgical centers, as requested in H. Rept. 116-450. Antimicrobial Resistance. \u2014The Committee recognizes anti- microbial resistance is a serious threat to seniors. Medicare bene-ficiaries are more likely than the general population to become acutely ill with a multi-drug resistant bacterial infection and are potentially more susceptible to adverse events associated with older antibiotics used in the current standard of care. The Committee supports the ability of seniors to receive access to the most clini-cally appropriate antibiotic therapies available. Blue Button. \u2014The Committee believes that the Blue Button pro- gram can play an important patient safety and care coordination role for Medicare beneficiaries and their health care providers, par-ticularly in relation to COVID-19 vaccination efforts and the in-creasing use of telehealth. Unfortunately, Blue Button has had a low participation rate. The Committee urges the Secretary to exam-ine barriers to participation, including health and technology re-lated inequities, and widely educate beneficiaries about Blue But-ton. CMS Contact Center Operations (CCO). \u2014The Committee under- stands that the CCO is one of the largest federal service contracts, and that CMS is anticipating awarding another 10-year contract for these critical services. The Committee is concerned that there has been insufficient competition for the CCO contract, and the Beneficiary Contact Center contract that preceded it, over the past 15 years. The Committee includes a provision to prevent fiscal year 2022 funds from being used for a new CCO contract or to issue any solicitation for a contract with a performance period of more than 24 months. In addition, the Committee directs CMS to conduct a review of the acquisition strategy for the CCO services to ensure genuine full and open competition for the award of a new definitive CCO contract, and to ensure this contract is structured to guar-antee that taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly and with account-ability. The Committee requests a report on the results of this re-view within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Community Health Workers. \u2014The Committee recognizes the im- portance of community health workers, who are trusted members of their communities and comprise a vital frontline health work-force that help to address social, economic, behavioral and preven-tive health needs, and appreciates CMS highlighting their role in VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul January 7, 2021 letter to State Health Officials. The Committee further recognizes the ongoing role of community health workers in an equitable, resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and in achieving long-term, sustainable health equity. Given their prov-en effectiveness in improving health outcomes, reducing costs in underserved communities, and advancing health equity, the Com-mittee urges CMS to continue to work with States, in partnership with community health workers and their professional organiza-tions, to incorporate community health workers into coverage in a way that aligns with scientific evidence and fully leverages their expertise and skills. Complex Rehabilitation Technology. \u2014The Committee is aware that provisions in P.L. 116-94 were intended to empower Medicare beneficiaries with severe disabilities through improved access to specialized Complex Rehabilitation Technology (CRT) manual wheelchairs and accessories. The Committee encourages CMS to provide adequate and equal access to users of CRT manual wheel-chairs and accessories and to consider making that protection per-manent. Compounded Medications. \u2014The Committee requests a report, within 120 days of enactment of this Act, assessing Medicare's cur-rent policy for reimbursement to Part D plans for medications com-pounded using bulk drug ingredients. Consensus on Assessing Mobility. \u2014The Committee encourages CMS and other stakeholders to promote development of consensus around a mobility assessment that is validated and clinically mean-ingful to providers and patients. In addition, CMS should evaluate feasibility of a mobility quality measure to incentivize providers to actively intervene to prevent mobility loss among hospitalized older adults. Consumer Assistance Program. \u2014The Committee encourages the Secretary to allocate up to $400,000,000 derived from Affordable Care Act (ACA) user fees to restore Consumer Assistance Program (CAP) grants under section 1002 of the ACA. Cost-Sharing for Vaccines. \u2014The Committee notes that mini- mizing cost sharing with Medicare Part D is critical to ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to vaccines that can pre-vent serious disease. Studies have shown a direct correlation be-tween cost sharing and increased abandonment rates of vaccines. To help reduce these barriers, the Committee encourages CMS to update the Medicare plan finder to clearly designate to consumers the plans that cover vaccines at no cost. Critical Access Hospitals and Sole Community Hospitals. \u2014The Committee looks forward to receiving the GAO study requested in H. Rept. 116-450, which will examine the cost of emergency mental and behavioral health services provided at Critical Access Hos-pitals (CAH). Behavioral health providers are scarcer in rural areas, but more patients are suffering from mental health concerns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, new treatment path-ways (such as tele-mental health care) are not always accessible in rural areas. The Committee requests HHS provide a briefing on be-havioral health services furnished at CAHs, sole community and other rural hospitals, whether the mix of services furnished at these hospitals changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and iden-tify opportunities to improve mental health care in these settings. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Training Benefit. \u2014The Committee is aware that one in four health care dollars in the U.S. is spent on people living with diabetes, totaling more than $300 billion a year. Nearly 70 percent of that cost is provided by federal health care programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE). The Committee is also aware that 13 percent of all adults and nearly one-third of in-dividuals aged 65 years or older are living with diabetes. Given the prevalence and cost of diabetes, particularly among communities of color, the Committee is concerned that barriers to accessing the Medicare diabetes self-management training benefit have resulted in utilization by only 5 percent of newly diagnosed Medicare bene-ficiaries. The Committee encourages CMS to explore the barriers to accessing the diabetes self-management training benefit and to pro-vide a report, within 120 days of enactment, on efforts to address these barriers. Disproportionate Share Hospitals. \u2014The Committee again encour- ages CMS to compile publicly available information on hospitals that receive payments under Medicaid as disproportionate share hospitals. Such information shall include the Medicaid inpatient utilization rate and low-income utilization rate. Within each cat-egory, CMS should further identify such hospitals by rural or urban status; number of beds; and status as a major teaching hos-pital. Drug Quality. \u2014The Committee is deeply concerned about the discovery of dangerous levels of carcinogens in frequently pre-scribed medications, including angiotensin II like losartan valsartan, ranitidine, and metformin. As two of the country's largest payers for prescription medication, Medicare and Medicaid have a responsibility to help ensure the safety and quality of prescribed therapies. The Committee requests a report, within 180 days of enactment, on the amount that the Medicare and Medicaid programs spent on medication in the pre-vious three fiscal years that was subsequently recalled by manufac-turers. The Committee also requests that CMS consider the poten-tial value of increased chemical testing of medication in the U.S. supply chain and quality rating systems for drug manufacturers. Evidence-Based Home Visiting Programs. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes the wide range of improved outcomes and cost-savings that evidence-based home visiting programs provide to first-time moth-ers and their children. Additionally, in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on care and the rising rates of maternal and infant health disparities among families of color, the need for qual-ity supports in the home is even greater, especially for mothers and babies. The Committee is pleased that CMS is assisting States that choose to design a Medicaid benefit package to provide home vis-iting services for pregnant and postpartum women, and for families with young children. The Committee urges CMS to continue to build upon its 2016 Joint Informational Bulletin to clearly articu-late how Medicaid dollars can be blended and braided appro-priately in home visiting programs to reach eligible families, pro-vide streamlined coverage options for home visiting services, and cover specific components of home visiting programs. Fraud and Abuse in Electrodiagnostic (EDX) Medicine. \u2014The Committee notes the ongoing investment in activities to address health care fraud and abuse along with enhanced interagency co- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul ordination. The Committee encourages HHS and the Department of Justice to continue working with the stakeholder community, as they do through the Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership, on innovative strategies to address persistent forms of fraud and abuse that exploit gaps in the current oversight framework and un-dermine quality patient care throughout the health care system, in-cluding systemic efforts by criminal actors and mobile labs in EDX testing. Finding Alternatives to Use of Quality-Adjusted Life Years for Drug Price Indexing. \u2014The Committee encourages CMS to study appropriate alternatives for using Quality-Adjusted Life Years in determining indexes for prices and coverage for medications, treat-ments, and other services. The Committee supports the National Council on Disability's analysis in its 2019 report, ''Quality-Ad-justed Life Years and the Devaluation of Life with Disability,'' and recognizes the significance of determining alternative methodolo-gies for establishing pricing mechanisms that are not discrimina-tory to individuals with disabilities. The Committee requests a re-port within 180 days of enactment of this Act on alternative meth-odologies, including analysis as to whether or not these alter-natives themselves may be discriminatory if used incorrectly, as well as if there are different best practices which can and should be used separately for the pricing of medications and treatments versus decisions related to benefits and coverage. Geographic Practice Cost Index. \u2014The Committee encourages CMS to publish its work on a rationale for current methodology for the Geographic Practice Cost Index so that the various inputs can be better understood. Hospitals in the U.S. Virgin Islands. \u2014The Committee remains concerned that Medicare payments for hospitals in the U.S. Virgin Islands are calculated using out-of-date payment data and formulas under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). The two hospitals in the U.S. Virgin Islands are reim-bursed based on 1982 and 1996 costs. As a result, patients are forced to travel outside the territory for necessary services, includ-ing total joint replacements and chemotherapy, often at great ex-pense and personal hardship. The Committee encourages CMS to update the TEFRA base period for these hospitals to more accu-rately reflect current conditions and costs. IMD Exclusion Pilot Program. \u2014The Committee is aware that al- though HHS allows waivers to States allowing short-term stays in Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) for mental health treatment, there are IMDs that provide care to thousands of individuals in acute psychiatric distress located in States without waivers. Con-gress urges CMS to pursue a pilot program allowing select IMDs that provide the majority of their care to those suffering from acute psychiatric distress to receive Medicaid funding. CMS should focus on the institutions that receive the largest volumes of cases in States that do not currently have the mental health treatment waiver and which offer longstanding, effective treatment regimens. IMD Exclusion Report. \u2014The Committee requests a report, within 2 years of enactment of this Act, examining how repealing Medic-aid's IMD exclusion could affect access to and quality of mental health services, including mental health services for nonelderly, VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 The report should include a cost estimate for repealing the exclusion. Implementation of Medicaid PDMP Expansion. \u2014Data show that prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) integrated into state Medicaid systems can reduce over-prescribing and misuse of opiates and other prescription drugs. The Committee requests a re-port, within one year of enactment of this Act, on the interoper-ability of existing state PDMP infrastructure, the status of imple-mentation of Sec. 5042 of the SUPPORT for Patients and Commu-nities Act, the actions being taken to further improve interoper-ability, and how CMS intends build on existing interoperability in-frastructure to avoid duplication and waste of allocated funding. Kidney Transplant Availability, Recovery, Long-Term Out- comes. \u2014The Committee recognizes the significant costs to the Medicare program resulting from care for end-stage renal disease and kidney dialysis and supports the goal of significantly reducing dialysis use. The Committee supports efforts to identify ways to in-crease kidney transplant availability and to improve recovery and long-term outcomes. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on recommendations for quality measures to be implemented for improved studying and tracking long-term kidney transplant outcomes, including for patients transitioning between Medicare and commercial coverage, as well as means of improving data interoperability in order to facilitate long-term tracking of long-term transplant patient data. Limited Wraparound Coverage. \u2014The Committee remains con- cerned that the previous Administration allowed the limited wrap-around coverage pilot program to expire. This failure has caused significant uncertainty for patients who depended on this program for several years. The Committee requests a report, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, outlining a plan to ensure that partici-pants impacted by the expiration of the pilot program will receive benefits equivalent to those of the limited wraparound coverage program. This report should include an analysis of the outcomes of the pilot program and an explanation for CMS' decision not to ex-tend it. The Committee continues to recommend this pilot program be made permanent and encourages CMS to restore the program. Long Term Care Facility Licensing. \u2014The Committee is aware that certain facilities that are owned or operated by individuals who have been denied by their respective state licensing body can still receive CMS funds. The Committee directs CMS to provide a publicly available report, no later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, on the number of long term care facilities that receive CMS funds that are owned and or operated by individuals who have been denied licenses to do so by their respective state licens-ing body. Lung Cancer Screening. \u2014The Committee is concerned with the persistently low rate of lung cancer screening across the United States. Lung cancer remains the deadliest form of cancer, with sig-nificant racial disparities in outcomes. People of color are more likely to be diagnosed with and die from lung cancer, but they are also less likely to undergo screening. In March 2021, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) revised its rec-ommendations on lung cancer screening eligibility, significantly in-creasing the number of individuals who should be screened. The VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Committee encourages CMS to evaluate what steps it can take to improve access to lung cancer screening, including decreasing the cost to participate in registries, expanding the number of CMS-ap-proved lung cancer screening registries, and promoting the develop-ment of quality measures in lung cancer screening and care to focus on reducing racial disparities in lung cancer screening. The Committee requests CMS provide a report within 120 days of en-actment of this Act on its findings from this evaluation. Medicaid Dental Audits. \u2014The Committee has previously raised concerns that failure to use professional guidelines or established state Medicaid manual parameters in the auditing process can re-sult in inaccurate Medicaid dental audits, negatively impacting dentist participation in the program and impeding patient access to care. While State Medicaid agencies (SMA) have significant re-sponsibility in managing provider audits, the Committee believes that as part of CMS oversight of the Medicaid program it is appro-priate to issue guidance to SMAs concerning best practices in den-tal audits and offer training in such practices. The Committee again urges CMS to develop such guidance for SMAs and report within 90 days of enactment of this Act on steps taken to develop such guidance. Medicare Advantage and Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals (LTCHs). \u2014The Committee is aware there is concern that there are more barriers to LTCHs and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRFs) in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans as compared to tradi-tional Medicare. The Committee requests CMS review whether MA plan pre-authorization requirements and their use of proprietary or home-grown algorithms or admission criteria are consistent with current Medicare Part A coverage policy to protect MA enrollees' statutory right to comparable benefits. The review should also de-termine the validity of Medicare Advantage Plans denials of admis-sions to LTCH and IRF based on not offering the benefit of a Medi-care approved level of care; verify that personnel being utilized by MA plans for pre-authorizations and denials have the necessary specialized rehabilitation education and training when requests from LTCHs and IRFs are being reviewed; review MA plans' proc-ess to provide pre-authorization review and appeals for denials within reasonable amount of time of planned discharge, including weekends, to allow for accelerated transfer to LTCHs and IRFs when necessary; review transparency of MA plans on how they de-termine medical necessity, as well as the specific standards and guidelines that lead to a denial; review transparency of MA Plans with regard to medical necessity, the number of initial pre-author-ization denials, the number of initial denials overturned, and the number of second level appeals for pre-authorization for LTCHs and IRFs. Medicare Appropriate Use Criteria Program. \u2014The Committee is aware that the Protecting Access to Medicare Act established the Medicare Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) Program for advanced di-agnostic imaging. While the Committee recognizes the value of en-couraging physicians and other health care professionals to consult AUC and clinical guidelines to support medical decision making, more than seven years have passed since Congress created the AUC program, which has not advanced beyond educational and op-erations testing. The Committee requests a report within 180 days VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul of enactment of this Act on implementation of this program, includ- ing challenges and successes. In this report, CMS shall consider ex-isting quality improvement programs and relevant models author-ized under Sec.1115A of the Social Security Act and their influence on encouraging appropriate use of advanced diagnostic imaging. The Committee directs CMS to consult with stakeholders, including medical professional societies and developers of AUC and clinical guidelines, when formulating its report. Medicare Promotion. \u2014The Committee reiterates its direction that CMS avoid taking any action that actively promotes one form of Medicare coverage over another, particularly with respect to the choice between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage. The Committee further directs CMS to design and maintain its online coverage options tool in a manner that provides complete and unbi-ased information, particularly as CMS works to replace the Medi-care Plan Finder with the new Medicare Coverage Tools platform. CMS should remain objective and neutral in its education and out-reach materials concerning options that beneficiaries have during the open enrollment period and at any other time. Molecular Diagnostics. \u2014More than 550,000 Americans are diag- nosed with a rare form of cancer every year. Rare cancers account for 380 of 400 distinct forms of cancer and almost one-third of all diagnoses and include all pediatric-specific cancers. Molecular diagnostics are an important part of determining the form of cancer and which treatment is the best option. Each subtype of cancer re-quires a targeted therapy in order to save a life or to significantly improve life span, and data is required for each cancer to inform where targeted therapies can be used. However, this data is fre-quently lacking for rare cancers, leading to the use of older and less effective therapies. The Committee understands that CMS has established Medicare national coverage policies for molecular diagnostics at the time of diagnosis for only certain cancers. The Committee encourages CMS to issue guidance to their plans on how to determine if molecular diagnostics are reasonable and nec-essary, and update the Medicare coverage guidelines for molecular diagnostics for all cancers where it is determined to be reasonable and necessary at the time of diagnosis. Navigators. \u2014The Committee strongly supports the Navigators program, which helps consumers understand their health coverage options and sign up for health insurance coverage during enroll-ment periods. The Committee urges CMS to return to providing ro-bust funding for Navigator activities. Nuclear Medicine Quality Improvement. \u2014The Committee is aware of evidence demonstrating the occurrence and consequence of extravasations in nuclear medicine procedures. These events can harm patients through compromised imaging that negatively af-fects care, repeated or additional procedures, increased costs, and unintended irradiation to patient tissue. The Committee supports CMS engagement with outside stakeholders on the issue and en-courages CMS to explore the development of a MIPS quality im-provement activity related to nuclear medicine injection quality as well as the feasibility of a MIPS quality measure to allow for the meaningful evaluation and improvement of nuclear medicine injec-tion quality. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 encourages CMS to coordi- nate with the HRSA to develop recommendations for expanded nu-trition education in medical school and graduate medical education curricula. Nursing and Allied Health Workforce Shortages. \u2014The Committee notes that in a March 2021 survey conducted by the HHS Office of the Inspector General, hospitals reported that nursing shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly strained health care delivery and were a significant obstacle to addressing the public health emergency. The survey found that these shortages exacer-bated longstanding challenges in health care delivery, access to care, and health outcomes. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act addressing the role of Medicare funding in supporting the training of nursing and allied health pro-fessionals. Such report should also include an assessment of how CMS can exercise its discretion under existing payment rules to further address shortfalls in the nursing and allied health work-force. Oral Health Services. \u2014The Committee is pleased that CMS is moving forward to fill the Chief Dental Officer position, which has been vacant since October 2017. This left a significant gap of clin-ical oral health expertise within CMS. Medicaid provides oral health services to millions of people, including vulnerable popu-lations such as children (including those with special health care needs), pregnant women, and disabled adults. The Committee notes that States have flexibility to determine dental benefits for adult Medicaid enrollees and while most States provide at least emer-gency dental services for adults, less than half currently provide comprehensive dental care. The Committee urges the Chief Dental Officer to examine opportunities within existing statutory authority to expand Medicare coverage of dental services. The Committee also urges CMS to provide recommendations no later than one year after enactment of this Act regarding policies to increase coverage of, and access to, comprehensive dental benefits for adults in State Medicaid programs. Patient Access to Home Health Care. \u2014The Committee supports the intent of the network adequacy rules of CMS for Medicare Ad-vantage organizations under 42 C.F.R. 417 and 422 and for Med-icaid managed care organizations under 42 C.F.R. 438 and 457 as maintaining a network of qualified providers sufficient to provide adequate access for covered services to meet the health care needs of the patient population served. Payment Structures Impact on ESRD Patients. \u2014The Committee is concerned that patient outcomes may be negatively impacted by dialysis provider behaviors resulting from the 2021 bundled pay-ment change affecting calcimimetics. Absent calcimimetic thera-pies, patients being treated for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) are at greater risk of requiring parathyroid surgeries, exposing them to further health care risk while shifting dialysis providers' financial burden to the federal government. Like ESRD, such out-comes are likely to impact marginalized and communities of color disproportionately. The Committee requests CMS monitor utiliza-tion and certain beneficiary health outcomes under the ESRD PPS resulting from the 2021 bundled payment change. The Committee encourages CMS to consider issuing a report highlighting statis- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 the clinical administration of calcimimetic thera- pies (including on marginalized and communities of color sub-populations), any instances of incentive payment structures from dialysis providers, and any recommendations on treatment proto-cols or policy changes. Peripheral Artery Disease. \u2014The Committee is aware that an esti- mated 20 million Americans have peripheral artery disease and about 200,000 of them, disproportionately people of color, suffer avoidable amputations every year as a result. The Committee urges CMS to raise public awareness in Medicare beneficiaries and pro-viders of racial disparities in amputations due to peripheral artery disease, diabetes, and related comorbidities through a nationwide awareness and education campaign. Further, the Committee en-courages the Secretary to establish an interagency working group in coordination with CMS, the Indian Health Service (IHS), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and to study the imple-mentation of a comprehensive amputation reduction program with-in CMS and IHS based on the VA Preventing Amputations in Vet-erans Everywhere Program. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide recommendations on how to reduce amputations no later than one year after enactment of this Act. Pharmacists and COVID-19 Authorities. \u2014The Committee is pleased with CMS' clarification that medication management serv-ices provided by pharmacists services incident to physicians and other qualified health care professionals (QHPs) are covered under Medicare Part B. This clarification was designed to encourage team-based care during the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) and increase access of individuals with substance use dis-order to services. The Committee appreciates CMS' recognition of the expanding roles of pharmacists with broadened scopes of prac-tice. The Committee requests CMS hear from physicians, phar-macists, and other qualified health professionals on their efforts to work with the American Medical Association (AMA) CPT Editorial Panel to develop mechanisms to attribute, report, and sustain pharmacists' medication management and other patient care con-tributions to beneficiaries in the Medicare Part B program. In addi-tion, the Committee is aware of the Secretary's request for informa-tion to determine whether regulatory actions taken by HHS to ex-pand clinician's authorities to mitigate and prevent COVID-19 dur-ing the PHE should be made permanent. The Committee requests the Secretary report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on the outcomes that pharmacists and pharmacies provided during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacists and Patient Care Services. \u2014The Committee is aware that certain Medicare Part B services and care frameworks have provisions to include pharmacists and their patient care serv-ices. However, CMS has few mechanisms to identify and evaluate the contributions of pharmacists to patient care and outcomes or to identify barriers within current service requirements that prevent scalable involvement of pharmacists. The Committee encourages CMS to create a mechanism to provide greater visibility into the scope and outcomes of the Medicare services currently provided by pharmacists. Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly. \u2014The Committee notes during the COVID-19 pandemic, Programs of All-Inclusive VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Care for the Elderly (PACE) have been effective in keeping their medically complex, nursing home eligible population safe at home. PACE organizations furnish all Medicare and Medicaid covered services, long term care and supports, meals and other services as needed by participants, principally in participants homes. PACE participants have had one-third the COVID-19 cases and deaths as compared to the rates of nursing home residents. The Committee urges CMS to consider moving forward on PACE-specific pilots in fiscal year 2022, so this community-based model of care may be evaluated as to whether it increases access and affordability for Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. Radiation Oncology (RO) Model .\u2014Despite the delay in implemen- tation, the Committee is concerned that the RO model as currently proposed could potentially reduce access to certain types of radi-ation therapy and negatively affect patient outcomes. The Com-mittee looks forward to the report on the RO model requested in H. Rpt. 116-450. Regulatory and Payment Reforms. \u2014The Committee urges CMS to work with hospitals, community-based organizations, and other stakeholders to identify substantive regulatory delivery and pay-ment reforms that integrate behavioral health in primary care; cre-ate new and evaluate existing delivery models to improve efficiency and value-based care; and incentivize the health care workforce to meet the unmet care needs of Medicare beneficiaries in under-served areas. Robotic Stereotactic Radiosurgery. \u2014The Committee continues to support robotic stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The Committee urges CMS to maintain sufficient payment for SRS and SBRT to ensure viability in both the freestanding and hospital outpatient setting. Screening and Diagnostic Testing in Cancer Treatment. \u2014The Committee understands that the use of pre-treatment interven-tions, such as screening for signs of cancer or testing with a com-panion diagnostic to determine a specific cancer type, can help health care providers select treatment options with a greater prob-ability of success, leading to better outcomes for patients. The Com-mittee also recognizes that the use of these interventions can re-duce unnecessary health care costs by avoiding ineffective treat-ments and that awareness of genetic risk factors can encourage preventive care and early diagnosis. This is particularly important now, as the Committee recognizes that during the COVID-19 pan-demic, providers and hospitals have reported a decrease in non- COVID related patient visits, including vital cancer screenings and follow-up appointments. The Committee urges CMS to identify ways to expand access to screening and testing, especially among the most at-risk patient populations, eligibility criteria for testing and screenings recommended by USPSTF and relevant medical so-cieties, and increase public and health care provider awareness of the importance of appropriate testing and diagnostics. Sepsis. \u2014The Committee requests that CMS task their contracted Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) to engage with hos-pitals to provide technical assistance that reflects recent advances in sepsis treatment to help them comply and report SEP-1 stand-ards of care. The Committee further requests that CMS report to the Committee within one year of enactment of this Act with an VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul the impact of the QIO engagement on SEP-1 rates and with feedback on any revisions to the SEP-1 standards of care that will improve treatment of sepsis by U.S. hospitals. Site Neutral Reimbursement. \u2014The Committee encourages CMS to evaluate the financial impacts on rural hospitals and Critical Ac-cess Hospitals in all rulemaking relating to payment rates, includ-ing all pending rules relating to CMS outpatient prospective pay-ment system and the Medicare ambulatory surgical center payment system. Social Determinants of Health. \u2014The Committee is aware that so- cial determinants of health are critical drivers of health outcomes and health care costs and that early childhood development is af-fected by social factors. The Committee commends CMS for the guidance on social determinants issued to States in January 2021 and encourages CMS to continue to clarify and disseminate strate-gies that States can implement under current Medicaid and CHIP authority, or through waivers, to address social determinants of health in the provision of health care, including strategies specifi-cally targeting the pediatric population. This should include guid-ance on how States can encourage and incentivize managed care organizations to address social determinants of health through con-tracts. Specimen Collection and Counseling Services for Pharmacist-De- livered COVID-19 Testing. \u2014The Committee is aware that CMS made it easier for pharmacies to enroll in Medicare as independent clinical laboratories and permitted any health care professional au-thorized under state law to order COVID-19 tests (and influenza and RSV tests when conducted concurrently with COVID-19 tests) during the COVID-19 public health emergency. The Committee is aware that CMS clarified coding for symptom assessment, speci-men collection, and patient counseling, all standard components of COVID-19 testing services conducted by other health care profes-sionals. However, CMS' only option for symptom assessment, speci-men collection, and patient counseling by pharmacists is to enter into an incident to arrangement with a physician or non-physician practitioner (NPP). The Committee is concerned that most commu-nity pharmacists do not have incident to arrangements with physi-cian practices or NPPs, which inhibits the goal of widely accessible COVID-19 testing in community pharmacies. The Committee re-quests CMS hear from physicians and other qualified health care professionals on their efforts to work with the AMA CPT Editorial Panel to develop coding options for pharmacists provision of symp-tom assessment, specimen collection, and patient counseling, when ordering and administering COVID-19 point of care tests at com-munity pharmacies equivalent to all other health care profes-sionals. Step-Down Care for Psychiatric Patients. \u2014The Committee is aware of the potential health benefits and cost savings of step- down care options for inpatient psychiatric care as it relates to an overall consumption of health services and costs without increased hospital admissions while also freeing up much needed inpatient beds. The lack of step-down care and housing options for psy-chiatric patients being discharged from local hospitals has led to long and expensive waits in hospitals that burden patients, fami-lies and hospital staff. The Committee requests CMS to, within 180 VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul days of enactment of this Act, conduct an assessment of the bene- fits of step-down care options for patient care and consideration of payment policy. STI Screening and Treatment Initiative. \u2014The Committee con- tinues to be concerned with the high rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among young adults and pregnant women. As STIs continue to rise, reaching this vulnerable population is critical to curb the spread of these diseases. The Committee urges CMS to collaborate with the CDC's Division of STD Prevention to develop a screening, treatment, and education initiative under the Medicaid program. Telehealth and Homelessness. \u2014The Committee recognizes the role that behavioral and mental illnesses play in the homeless pop-ulation and that telehealth offers a unique possibility to meet these individuals where they are in providing all health services, but par-ticularly for mental health. The Committee encourages CMS to identify and share with States best practices regarding ways in which telehealth and remote patient monitoring can be leveraged through the Medicaid and Medicare programs for the homeless population. This should include identification of barriers to mental health services via telehealth coverage, as well as strategies to ad-dress those barriers. Telehealth for Pediatric ESRD. \u2014The Committee understands that due to the scarcity of pediatric nephrologists and precautions following the COVID-19 pandemic, more children are successfully receiving care for end stage renal disease at home through tele-health technology. However, persistent inequalities in access to broadband and information technology prevent many children from accessing this technology. The Committee requests that, within 120 days of enactment of this Act, the Secretary provide a report on the usage of telehealth technology for pediatric end stage renal disease patients covered by Medicare and Medicaid during the COVID-19 pandemic, including an analysis of use in HRSA-designated rural counties and designated eligible census tracts in metropolitan coun-ties and HRSA-designated medically underserved areas. Zero Trust Program. \u2014The Committee encourages CMS to in- crease support for the Zero Trust Program for CMS health informa-tion and data security modernization to address, mitigate, and re-duce security risks. State Survey and Certification The Committee provides $472,163,000 for State Survey and Cer- tification activities, which is $74,829,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget request. State Survey and Certification supports certifications of Medicare and Medicaid certified health care facilities to ensure that bene-ficiaries receive care at facilities that meet health, safety, and qual-ity standards required by CMS. Federal Administration The Committee provides $864,000,000 for Federal Administration activities related to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which is $91,467,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Federal Administration fund-ing supports CMS staff, along with operating and administrative VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul expenses for information technology, communication, utilities, rent and space requirements, as well as administrative contracts. Quality Improvement Organizations .\u2014The Committee does not support the Administration's proposal to shift personnel costs to the Federal Administration account that have previously been funded by a mandatory appropriation. H EALTH CAREFRAUD AND ABUSE CONTROL ACCOUNT Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $807,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 872,793,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +65,793,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account (HCFAC) supports activities conducted by CMS, the HHS Office of Inspector General, and the Department of Justice (DOJ). This appropriation includes a base amount of $317,000,000 and an additional $555,793,000 through a discretionary budget cap adjustment pro-vided to meet the terms of H. Res. 467. This is $65,793,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This funding is in addition to other mandatory funding provided through authorizing legislation. The funding will provide resources to continue efforts for Medicaid program integrity activities, for safeguarding the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the Medi-care Advantage program, and for program integrity efforts related to these programs carried out by the DOJ. Senior Medicare Patrol. \u2014The Committee includes $30,000,000, an increase of $10,000,000, for the Senior Medicare Patrol program. The Committee continues to include modified bill language to en-able the Secretary to fund the Senior Medicare Patrol, which is ad-ministered by the Administration for Community Living, from ei-ther discretionary or mandatory funds provided to this account. Health Care Fraud Unit. \u2014These units prosecute health care fraud-related cases involving patient harm or large financial loss to the public fisc. Protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring pro-gram integrity lie at the core of their work. The strike force model involves a cross-agency collaborative approach, bringing together both investigative and analytical resources of several Federal agen-cies, along with the prosecutorial resources of U.S. Attorney's Of-fices and state and local law enforcement partners. The Committee includes an increase to expand offices into more areas in the west-ern United States. A DMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AND FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAMS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $3,039,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ...................................................... 2,795,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... \u00a5245,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Committee also recommends $1,300,000,000 in advance funding, as requested, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 to en-sure timely payments for Child Support Enforcement programs. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul programs support State-administered programs of financial assistance and services for low-income families to promote their economic security and self-sufficiency. LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $3,750,304,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 3,900,304,000 Change from ......................................................... +150,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +50,000,000 The Committee recommends $3,900,304,000 for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program, which is $150,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $50,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) supports eligible families and households through programs providing assistance with energy costs. In addition, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (P.L. 116-136) included $900,000,000 and the Amer-ican Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $4,500,000,000 in funding to support eligible families with home energy costs. Hold Harmless. \u2014While the Committee recognizes that progress has been made in recent years to limit annual decreases in State allocations to no more than three percent of what a State received in the previous year, the Committee continues to believe that all States have unmet needs and that all States benefit from the con-sistency of annual appropriations when the overall account is un-changed or increased. To correct this volatility and hold States, ter-ritories, and Tribes (funded through the States) harmless from an-nual reductions, the bill includes language directing the Adminis-tration for Children and Families (ACF) to distribute, at a min-imum, the same amount of funding to each State, territory, and Tribe as was appropriated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Formula and Allocations Report. \u2014The Committee continues to express strong support for LIHEAP, but remains concerned about the complexities of the LIHEAP formulation process. The Com-mittee strongly urges ACF to explore ways to simplify and auto-mate its funding formula calculations to increase the ability of staff to complete calculations quickly, and administer funding more readily. Given the significant amount of spending dedicated to LIHEAP in fiscal years 2020 and 2021, including emergency fund-ing from the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) and the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2), the Committee directs ACF to submit, and make publicly available on its website, a report detailing the program's formula and State allocations for each source of funding from fiscal years 2020 and 2021. ACF is encouraged to include any additional information that may provide context for funding allocations. REFUGEE AND ENTRANT ASSISTANCE Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $1,910,201,000 Budget year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 4,504,947,000 Change from ......................................................... +2,594,746,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +100,000,000 The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) programs are designed to help refugees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, and traf- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 become employed and self-sufficient. These pro- grams also provide for care of unaccompanied children in Federal custody and survivors of torture. Funding for several of the programs within this account is highly dependent on estimates and as such, it is critical that ORR commu-nicate changes to estimated numbers of arrivals and costs as they become available. The Committee directs ORR to provide monthly updates of arrivals each month by category, including refugees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, Special Immigrant Visas, and unaccompanied children, and to include any updates in estimated funding needs as a result of changes in trends in those categories. In times of sudden reductions in refugee arrivals, the Committee encourages HHS, to the extent practicable, to ensure that resettle-ment agencies are able to maintain their infrastructure and capac-ity at a level to continue to serve new refugees, previously arrived refugees, and other populations of concern who remain statutorily eligible for integration services, and to ensure that there is capacity for future arrivals to be adequately served. Within the total, the Committee includes the following: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Transitional and Medical ................... $605,000,000 27,000,000 Transitional and Medical Services The Committee includes $605,000,000, which is $251,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Transitional and Medical Services (TAMS) program provides grants to States and nonprofit organiza-tions to provide refugees and other eligible populations with up to eight months of cash and medical assistance. Victims of Trafficking The Committee includes $39,480,000 for the Victims of Traf- ficking program, which is $10,725,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The recommendation includes $4,500,000 for the National Human Traf-ficking Hotline. The Committee encourages ACF to use a portion of increased funding for legal services for victims, increasing funds equally for services for both foreign national victims and U.S. citizen and legal permanent resident victims, consistent with demonstrated need. Refugee Support Services The recommendation includes $450,000,000, which is $242,799,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Refugee Support Services (RSS) program provides formula and competitive grants to States and nonprofit organizations to address barriers to employment and help refugees become self-sufficient. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Committee includes $3,383,467,000 for the Unaccompanied Children (UC) Program, which is $2,080,222,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $100,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee urges ORR to redesign the UC program with an increased focus on compassionately caring for unaccompanied children in State-licensed, small-scale, and commu-nity-based settings, and safely and expeditiously discharging chil- dren to vetted sponsors. The Committee is extremely concerned about reliance on expensive, unlicensed facilities when capacity is strained. The Committee appreciates that the increase requested in the budget is intended to avoid continued reliance on unlicensed fa-cilities, but is concerned that budget estimates may not adequately reflect the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have on State-licensed capacity. The Committee expects HHS to continue to refine estimates as it recovers from the pandemic. The Com-mittee recommends additional funding above the fiscal year 2022 budget request and includes directives in this report for ORR to raise standards of care; expand services for children; rebuild, sup-port and train staff on trauma-informed care; establish an inde-pendent office to better serve children in ORR's care; and increase planning for future humanitarian responses at the border. The Committee recognizes the critical importance of post-release legal and social services and child advocates, and notes that the Congressional Budget Justification did not include sufficient details of ORR's plans for providing such priority services to children in fiscal year 2022. The Committee directs ORR to significantly in-crease services for children, and includes not less than $300,000,000, an increase of $88,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level, for legal services, post-release services, and child ad-vocates. The Committee recognizes that increased referrals of chil-dren during fiscal year 2021 may require ORR to expend greater sums in fiscal year 2022, and the Committee encourages the pro-gram to spend additional funds on such services, as necessary, com-mensurate with referrals from U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and the needs of the children, including the need for legal services for children after their release from ORR custody. It is critical that ORR report regularly to the Committee and include in its required spend plans, the number of referrals from CBP, the number of children receiving services from legal service providers, the number receiving post-release legal and social services, and the number who are appointed child advocates, including the number of children on the waitlist for any of these services. The Committee expects ORR to set targets for the number and percentage of chil-dren that will be provided such services, and to regularly commu-nicate with the Committee to ensure that the number of children with access to such services significantly increases over fiscal year 2021. Age-Outs .\u2014The Committee directs ORR to develop tangible post- 18 plans for every 17-year-old unaccompanied child in ORR care at least two weeks in advance of their 18th birthday to ensure that an appropriate non-secure placement has been identified for the child, along with any necessary social support services, prior to dis-charge from ORR. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Hearings and Placement Reviews. \u2014The Committee believes it is incumbent upon HHS to ensure that children's rights to place-ment in the least restrictive setting are protected, and strongly supports an unaccompanied child's right to challenge their place-ment in restrictive settings in front of the HHS Departmental Ap-peals Board (DAB) with representation of legal counsel and with an ORR-appointed child advocate. The Committee expects the HHS DAB to ensure that administrative law judges (ALJs) for UC hear-ings operate separate and apart from all ORR staff who take part in, review, or adjudicate placement of unaccompanied children, and that they will have training and expertise on the Flores Settlement Agreement, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, and the particular vulnerabilities of unaccompanied children. In addition, the Committee understands that ORR recently launched a Placement Review Panel (PRP) pilot, with the intent of providing unaccompanied children who are placed in secure and residential treatment center programs a venue by which to request a review of their ORR placement in such facilities. The Committee does not expect this PRP to replace or in any way limit a child's right to appeal their placement before any U.S. District Court with jurisdiction over the child. However, if the PRP can serve as an ad-ditional venue for children to challenge their placement, the Com-mittee expects the participants on the panel to operate separate and apart from ORR staff who take part in, review, or adjudicate placement of unaccompanied children, and requests that ORR brief the Committee within 60 days of enactment of this Act on the role of the PRP, and the distinction between the PRP and the DAB. Case Management and Community Support Services. \u2014To expand the scope of case management programs and to increase participa-tion in these services, the Committee directs HHS to coordinate with DHS to provide an analysis of existing programs, including existing case management services funded through U.S. Immigra-tion and Customs Enforcement, as well as the recently funded Al-ternatives to Detention Case Management Pilot Program to provide these services though FEMA-administered grants to community- based organizations, which will be overseen by the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. Further, the Committee directs HHS and DHS to explore the feasibility of funding and managing case management services currently offered by DHS through agen-cies or offices within HHS that serve similar populations and to provide the Committee a briefing within 180 days of enactment of this Act on the results of the analysis and their evaluation, which shall also include a recommendation for the appropriate organiza-tional placement for case management services to serve additional populations through community-based organizations seeking to pro-vide case management and social services focused on fair and equi-table outcomes for individuals and families. The briefing shall out-line the risks and opportunities associated with existing and pro-posed programs, and mitigation strategies that could be deployed to address those, along with any funding and staffing impacts. Child Advocates. \u2014The recommendation includes funding for ORR to expand Child Advocate services and to ensure that child advocates are appointed to particularly vulnerable children, includ-ing victims of abuse or trafficking, children 12 years old and young-er, children in residential treatment centers, children seeking re- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul view of their release or placement, and to children who are ex- pected to remain in ORR custody for prolonged periods of time. The Committee directs ORR to ensure the continued independence of the Child Advocate program from other contracted service pro-viders to avoid any conflicts of interest. To ensure that child advocates have the visibility and capacity to be appointed to the most pressing cases in ORR custody, the Com-mittee strongly urges ORR to proactively share census data from each facility with child advocates on a consistent basis. Such cen-sus should list the names, ages, countries of origins, languages, and lengths of stay of each child in the program, which will help child advocates identify the children in greatest need. Children in Prolonged Detention. \u2014The Committee continues to direct ORR to submit a report every six months on the number of children who have been in ORR custody longer than a year. Such report should include how long each child has been in ORR custody and a status update on their case, including whether the child has any family or other potential sponsor(s) in the United States and a summary of ORR's efforts to place the child with a sponsor or in a long-term foster care setting. The Committee directs ORR to en-sure that a care provider is taking all steps necessary to place every child in a home as expeditiously as possible and that no child is unaccounted for, resulting in prolonged detention. Communicating with Congress. \u2014The Committee expects HHS to notify the Committee prior to making any administrative or policy changes expected to impact the number of children in ORR custody; shelter operations; the placement of children with sponsors; or any post-release services. Community-Based Facilities. \u2014The Committee directs ORR to prioritize new grant or contract funding to small-scale, community- based residential care placements. As ORR adds State-licensed ca-pacity to its network, the Committee expects that no less than 50 percent of beds added to the network be in small-scale shelters, transitional foster care, small group homes, or long-term foster care. The Committee further directs ORR to ensure there is an ade-quate supply of long-term foster care beds in the network to mini-mize the time it takes for a child to be moved to this least restric-tive placement. Finally, ORR is directed to notify the Committee prior to all new funding opportunity announcements, grant or con-tract awards, or plans to release or acquire property. Facility Oversight. \u2014The Committee expects ORR to maintain strict oversight of all ORR-funded care provider facilities and to correct violations of Federal, State or local codes related to the standards of childcare or the well-being of children, as well as vio-lations of ORR policies and procedures, or any requirements as list-ed in the Flores Settlement Agreement, regardless of the status of the underlying agreement. The Committee directs ORR to submit, within 60 days of enactment of this Act, an updated version of the report submitted to the Committee pursuant to House Report 115- 862. The updated report should include new or updated informa-tion on facility violations, and any systemic trends in noncompli-ance, along with efforts to remedy noncompliance across the pro-vider facility network. Humanitarian Response Operating Plan. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes the challenges that ORR has with quickly adding personnel VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul and building capacity to meet demands during significant increases of unaccompanied children at the border. The Committee directs HHS and ORR to coordinate with DHS, FEMA, CBP, USCIS, and relevant stakeholders to develop a Humanitarian Response Oper-ating Plan for how priority personnel from across the government, in coordination with national and local non-government organiza-tions, can be rapidly deployed to the southern border as necessary during migration surges. The plan should assess the existing capa-bilities and capacity of HHS, DHS, and relevant stakeholders to provide the specialized services necessary to prioritize the welfare of children while they are in government custody, and to avoid un-necessary delays in releasing children safely to vetted sponsors. The plan should identify mechanisms for participating Federal agencies to identify and quickly deploy, in coordination with af-fected State and local jurisdictions and national and local non-gov-ernment humanitarian organizations, priority personnel licensed in case management, social work, and child welfare, along with an es-timate of the funding requirements associated with such deploy-ments. The Committee expects any groups identified as potential deployment resources to be trained in providing trauma-informed care. In developing the plan, HHS and DHS should consult with expe- rienced caseworkers, social workers, and child welfare experts to incorporate best practices into the plan. The Committee directs HHS to submit the plan to the Committee within 180 days of en-actment of this Act, and to update it annually to reflect new infor-mation and lessons learned. As part of the plan, the Committee re-quests a cost estimate for the resources necessary to keep identified personnel sufficiently trained, to fund rapid deployments to the border, and to have emergency case management contracts or grants available to deploy additional case managers or other pri-ority services. In-Kind Donations .\u2014The Committee continues to request ORR include information on the use of this provision in future Congres-sional Budget Justifications, including examples of donations that are offered, donations that are accepted, and donations that care providers believe they cannot accept. Legal Services. \u2014The Committee supports the continued expan- sion of independent legal services for unaccompanied children and notes that services provided by qualified and independent legal counsel to unaccompanied children can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of immigration proceedings, significantly reduce the failure-to-appear rate of children who are released from HHS cus-tody, and help relieve the immigration court backlog. The rec-ommendation includes funding and direction for ORR to ensure in- person ''Know Your Rights'' and legal screenings for every child in custody, and for the continued expansion of direct representation for released unaccompanied children. Post-release direct represen-tation shall be made available to children up to funded capacity, without restrictions related to age while in ORR care; release date; estimated time to conclude a case; or other characteristics, provided the representation is initiated while the individual is still a minor. In addition, the Committee strongly encourages ORR to work with legal service providers to develop a strategy to minimize the risks of any child having to go to immigration court without inde- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 legal counsel. Within the amount for services for children, the recommendation includes $5,500,000 for legal service providers to recruit and train additional attorneys for the purposes of build-ing the capacity necessary to provide independent representation to unaccompanied children with pending immigration cases. Mental Health Services. \u2014The Committee appreciates the steps that ORR has taken to improve mental health services for children in its custody, and urges expansion of such services, including con-tracting with governmental and non-governmental entities, while instituting policies that prevent disclosure of this information to immigration enforcement officials. These services shall include mental health services which are developmentally appropriate for children and which assist staff to respond to trauma based on age and the nature of the trauma given the diversity of children in cus-tody. In response to the growing number of children with specialized needs in ORR custody, including children under 12, children with disabilities, and children with mental health needs, the Committee expects ORR to further expand mental health services and the use of other interventions, in consultation with context-focused special-ists and experts in early childhood development, the needs of chil-dren with disabilities, mental health, child trauma and immigra-tion trauma, and to provide in-person and continuous training to ORR-contracted staff on these specialized needs. Further, the Com-mittee directs ORR to work with residential care service providers, child welfare experts, and other stakeholders with relevant exper-tise to ensure compliance with Federal, State and local codes re-lated to the standards of care or the well-being of young children and children with disabilities, and to develop policy guidelines re-garding residential care and specialized, trauma-informed practices for the groups of children listed in this paragraph, including re-garding appropriateness of residential treatment centers as a form of residential care. The Committee directs ORR to include in its fis-cal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification information on these efforts, including details and metrics on the types of training offered to staff to ensure appropriate care is available for young children, children with disabilities, and children with mental health needs. Non-Parental Relatives. \u2014The Committee recognizes that a num- ber of children referred to ORR from CBP as unaccompanied were traveling with a non-parental relative, and believes there may be opportunities to collaborate with DHS in order to significantly re-duce the amount of time a child may be separated from a family member. The Committee directs HHS, in coordination with DHS, to develop a mechanism for reporting the number of children who were processed by CBP with adults claiming a relationship as non- parental relatives but referred to ORR as unaccompanied. The Committee directs ORR to submit a report within 120 days of en- actment of this Act proposing any process changes, IT modifica-tions, or authorities that would be necessary for ORR to regularly report the number of children referred from CBP who were proc-essed with Category 2a or 2b relatives, and for HHS and ORR case managers to have the visibility necessary to locate, with DHS co-operation, a non-parental relative that arrived with a child at the VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul border so that HHS can begin the process of verifying the relation- ship and assessing that adult for sponsor suitability. Office of the Ombudsperson. \u2014The Committee directs ORR to es- tablish an Office of the Ombudsperson within HHS to act as an ad-vocate for upholding the rights of immigrant children in custody, and to independently advise the Secretary on the challenges of, and ways to systemically evaluate, refocus and rebuild, the UC pro-gram. The Office shall be headed by an Ombudsperson, who should have demonstrated experience in immigration law and child advo-cacy or child welfare, and shall be appointed by, and report directly to the Secretary of HHS. The Committee requests a briefing within 120 days of enactment of this Act on a strategy for establishment of such an Office, including any actions the Secretary will take to position the Ombudsperson within ORR in such a way that does not duplicate existing functions of other independent offices, includ-ing the Office of Inspector General and the Office of Civil Rights. The Ombudsperson shall have access to information on unaccom- panied children in HHS's care in order to identify trends or to fur-ther investigate cases that may need additional resources in order to shorten a child's length of stay. Additionally, the Ombudsperson shall have access to facilities data, reviews, and recommendations of the HHS Office of Inspector General, in order to investigate sys-temic issues or improvements of facilities or grantees. The Com-mittee urges the Ombudsperson to regularly meet with stake-holders, to ensure they are aware of stakeholder concerns and pri-orities, and to provide feedback on stakeholder requests. The Committee directs the Ombudsperson to submit a report to Congress no less than once each fiscal year on the accomplishments and challenges of the UC program, highlighting trends and rec-ommendations for future actions and improvements, and outlining the activities of the Ombudsperson for the next fiscal year. Operational Directives and Field Guidance for Safe, Expeditious Discharge. \u2014The Committee believes the operational directives issued in response to the previous Administration's misguided Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on Information Sharing re-duced the damage that had been done to the sponsor suitability de-termination process and appropriately reduced the length of time children spent in ORR's care. The Committee expects ORR to re-tain and improve on such policies to place children safely and expe-ditiously with vetted sponsors. The Committee recognizes that ORR has issued a series of field guidance documents to its care provider network to further expedite safe discharge to sponsors. The Com-mittee directs ORR to continue to review any policies that may be prolonging a child's stay in custody, including those related to the sponsorship review process, and to work with child welfare experts as it continues to evaluate ways to safely reduce a child's time in care. Policies for Engaging with Law Enforcement. \u2014The Committee believes that it is critical for ORR to have policies in place for staff to use for when it is appropriate to contact local law enforcement, as well as policies that stipulate how local law enforcement should engage with children in ORR's care to ensure that those inter-actions account for the trauma a child might be facing. The Com-mittee urges ORR to create and make publicly available the poli- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 procedures for staff and children's interactions with local law enforcement. Post-Release Services .\u2014The Committee includes an increase in funding for post-releases services to enhance and extend case man-agement services to more children to assist them with school en-rollment; access to legal services, health care, mental health and community services; and to provide counseling to the child and families in the initial period after release. The Committee urges ORR to engage with current family reunification service providers, post-release service providers, and recently released children and sponsors to discuss needed services, the length of services, and how to improve coordination between shelters, providers and other com-munity services providers, to help evaluate the current program, and to identify new risks and opportunities for improvement. In addition to children already designated under law or policy to receive such services, the Committee encourages ORR to ensure that all pregnant or parenting teens, children whose primary lan-guage is neither English nor Spanish, as well as children who faced separation from a parent or legal guardian at the U.S.-Mexico bor-der, are referred for post-release services. ORR should arrange for such services to be provided by non-governmental organizations with experience and expertise in working with these children. The Committee requests ORR develop and make public on its website the criteria for how children are prioritized for post-release serv-ices, and the number of children receiving services in each fiscal year. Protection of Genetic Information. \u2014The Committee continues to prohibit any governmental agency or private entity from accessing, using, or storing any genetic material, data, or information col-lected in this reunification effort, including for the purpose of crimi-nal or immigration enforcement. Any genetic material, data, or in-formation obtained by a government agency or private entity should be destroyed after testing and the probability of a genetic relationship is calculated. The entities conducting DNA testing shall obtain the consent of any individual over age 18 prior to test-ing, and shall make every effort to obtain the consent of a guardian prior to testing anyone under age 18. The Committee requests ORR continue to include in its annual Congressional Budget Justifica-tion the steps it is taking to protect the privacy and genetic mate-rial and data of individuals who are being tested as part of reunifi-cation efforts. Separated Families Services Fund. \u2014The Committee strongly supports the mission and efforts of the Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families and includes $30,000,000, as re-quested, to support ongoing mental health and other supportive services for children, parents, and legal guardians who were sepa-rated at the U.S.-Mexico border under the previous administration. Spend Plan. \u2014The bill includes a general provision requiring the Secretary of HHS to continue to submit a comprehensive spend plan to the Committee every 60 days. The plan should continue to include a report on facilities, by facility type, including facility-spe-cific data including number of licensed beds; operating status (open or not yet open); whether a facility is operated by a for-profit or non-profit company; and the availability of such facilities to legal, medical and social service resources. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Age Children. \u2014The Committee directs ORR to include in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification information on efforts to ensure developmentally appropriate care is available for tender age children. The justification should detail how place-ment options, services, and staff training are tailored for tender age children, as well as an assessment of the circumstances under which very young children are referred to ORR. Unlicensed Facilities. \u2014The Committee notes that HHS has sig- nificantly expanded its unlicensed shelter capacity as high num-bers of children have sought protection at the Southern border and amid ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee recognizes and shares HHS's commitment to ensuring that unaccompanied children are not subject to prolonged detention in U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities\u2014however, the Committee continues to have serious concerns about HHS's continued reliance on unlicensed facilities, including ''emergency in-take sites'', that lack critical services and safeguards. The Com-mittee strongly supports the medical, psychological, and child wel-fare advocacy communities in their compelling arguments against, and well-founded reasons to limit, the use of any unlicensed facili-ties, especially large capacity shelters where a substantial number of children reside in the same room. The Committee directs ORR to submit, within 30 days of enactment of this Act, its plan for dis-continuing use of any open unlicensed facilities, including the an-ticipated closure dates for each unlicensed facility, and the target dates by which each such facility will comply with required stand-ards while in use. The Committee expects ORR to adopt systemic changes to elimi- nate future reliance on unlicensed facilities and directs ORR to en-sure sufficient bed capacity for unaccompanied children in perma-nent, small, State-licensed shelters, group homes, and transitional and long-term foster care. The Committee directs ORR to submit a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on strategies ORR can pursue to ensure that ORR maintains access to, and can expeditiously activate as necessary, sufficient licensed bed capacity to serve unaccompanied children during periods of higher referrals or emergencies. The report should also assess ORR's ability to ad-dress any staffing issues, or add case management and other pri-ority services for children placed in reactivated licensed settings. Survivors of Torture The Committee includes $27,000,000 for the Survivors of Torture program, which is $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The program funds non-profit organizations providing healing and support serv-ices to refugees, asylees and asylum seekers, who need help over-coming the effects of torture. PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $5,911,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 7,377,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +1,466,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Committee recommends $7,377,000,000 for the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program, which is $1,466,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee strongly supports the commitment in the budget to allot three percent for Indian Tribes, in addition to the $177,330,000 set-aside included in the accompanying bill. The CCDBG provides funds according to a formula to States, territories, and Tribes to provide financial assist-ance to help low-income working families and families engaged in training or education activities access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children. In addition, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act (P.L. 116-260) included $10,000,000,000 and (P.L. 117-2) in-cluded $39,000,000,000 in CCDBG funding to support children, families, and child care providers during the pandemic, and to sta-bilize the child care industry with flexible funding that could be used for personnel costs, rent, cleaning supplies, and mental health support for children and staff. Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation/CCDBG Eligi- bility and Receipt. \u2014The Committee expects HHS ASPE to provide and make publicly accessible updated annual estimates and fact-sheets of Child Care Eligibility and Receipt under Federal and State rules as promptly as practicable. Within six months of enact-ment of this Act, the Committee directs ASPE to post on its website estimates and factsheets for fiscal year 2018, along with a timeline for when the agency intends to provide updates for 2019 and subsequent years. Child Care Facilities Needs Assessment. \u2014The Committee appre- ciates that ACF is in the process of conducting a feasibility study to determine how States could conduct needs assessments of their child care and early education facilities. The Committee directs ACF to continue to dedicate a portion of Federal CCDBG research funding (42 U.S.C. 9858m) as it evaluates possible methodologies for conducting facilities needs assessments and prepares cost esti-mates for the funding that would be necessary for experts to con-duct Statewide needs assessments. As part of that evaluation, the Committee expects the Office of Child Care (OCC) to engage with key experts and stakeholders who have worked on recent facilities standards reports, conducted Statewide facilities needs assess-ments, and who have experience in conducting Statewide needs as-sessments or working on child care and early childhood education facilities issues. OCC shall brief the Committee on its findings as soon as practicable, and include the recommended methodology, along with the resources that would be necessary to fund such Statewide needs assessments in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. The Committee encourages HHS to coordinate with the Depart- ment of Housing and Urban Development and the Bureau of Indian Affairs as it assesses the child care infrastructure and early learn-ing needs in underserved rural and tribal communities, including for Head Start and early Head Start facilities. Further, the Com-mittee encourages HHS to consult with the Department of Agri-culture Rural Development, Small Business Administration, and the Department of Treasury Community Development Financial In- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Fund, on potential opportunities to leverage resources available to bolster early childhood learning and development in rural America. Child Care Relief and Recovery GAO Study. \u2014The Committee di- rects GAO to study the State implementation of the various coronavirus relief and recovery packages to identify long-term strategies for improving the child care industry and supporting child care businesses including the use of grants and/or contracts, improving payment practices, and strategies to recruit and retain the workforce. Homelessness Data. \u2014The Committee encourages OCC to provide technical assistance to States to improve the quality and complete-ness of the data States are required to collect on the homelessness status of children receiving childcare subsidies. The Committee ex-pects OCC to annually publish on its website data gathered regard-ing homelessness status and related demographic data. SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANT Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $1,700,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 1,900,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +200,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +200,000,000 The Social Services Block Grants provides grants to States by formula. States have the flexibility to determine what services and activities are supported, provided they are targeted at a broad set of goals, including reducing or eliminating poverty, achieving or maintaining self-sufficiency, and preventing neglect, abuse, or ex-ploitation of children and adults. In addition, the bill includes $200,000,000 for the purposes of creating a diaper distribution grant program, to provide much- needed resources to social service agencies or other non-profit orga-nizations specifically for diaper and diapering supply needs. CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SERVICES PROGRAMS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $13,040,511,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 15,232,981,000 Change from ......................................................... +2,192,470,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +330,221,000 The Children and Families Services programs fund activities serving children, youth, families, the developmentally disabled, Na-tive Americans, victims of child abuse and neglect and domestic vi-olence, and other vulnerable populations. The Committee recommends the following amounts: Budget Activity FY 2022 Committee Programs for Children, Youth, and Families: Head .................. 23,000,000 State Child Abuse Prevention ................................................................................................... Social Programs ....................................................................................................... Community Services Block 800,000,000 Community Economic ................................................................................................ 2 3,000,000 Training Vouchers Program Direction .............................................................................................................. ....................... 227,000,000 Head Start The Committee recommends $12,182,095,000 for the Head Start program, which is $1,434,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and $250,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. Head Start and Early Head Start promote school readiness of children under 5 from low-income families through education, health, social and other services. Cost of Living Adjustment. \u2014The Committee recommends $234,000,000 for a cost-of-living adjustment. Early Head Start (EHS) Expansion and Early Head Start-Child Care (EHS-CC) Partnerships. \u2014The Committee provides $750,000,000 to expand Head Start and Early Head Start programs for eligible children and families. The Committee understands that the EHS-CC Partnership grant program was designed to enhance the quality of child care to better meet the needs of working fami-lies, and supports the program's appreciation for how Head Start can be critically helpful to meeting those needs. However, the Com-mittee is aware of certain communities for which there are signifi-cant barriers to establishing the EHS-CCP model and expects grants for EHS expansion or EHS-CC partnerships to be awarded based on the unique needs of each community with due consider-ation of local feasibility. The Committee requests a briefing within 45 days of enactment of this Act on how the Office of Head Start intends to award EHS expansion funding, including EHS-CCP funds, without making awards based on a predetermined spending level, and in a way that does not disadvantage communities where EHS-CCP is infeasible. The Committee urges OHS to ensure that the program is not expanded in a way that excludes children and babies whose parents do not qualify for child care, or pregnant women. The Committee continues to direct ACF to include in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification and each Congres-sional Budget Justification thereafter, the actual and estimated number of funded slots for each of the following: Head Start, EHS, and EHS-CC Partnerships. Extended Duration. \u2014The Committee understands the need for Head Start programs to offer longer hours of service to better align with K-12 schedules and support working parents, and includes $200,000,000 for programs to expand program hours of service con-sistent with the 2016 Head Start Program Performance Standards. Migrant and Seasonal Head Start (MSHS) Eligibility Require- ments. \u2014The Committee remains concerned about how enrollment and eligibility requirements for the MSHS program may act as bar- VerDate Sep 11 2014 families seeking MSHS services. The Committee reiterates the need for the report on the Impact of the Federal Poverty Guideline, as requested in House Report 116- 450, including the section examining how such requirements may be affecting MSHS. The Committee expects the OHS to brief the Committees on the findings and recommendations of that report as soon as practicable, but not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, so that it can continue to discuss possible solutions to ex-pand access to such families. In addition, the Committee is concerned that families applying for MSHS services may be deemed ineligible based on the disrup-tion to the lives of agricultural workers as a result of the COVID- 19 pandemic. The Committee understands that several flexibilities exist with regard to how a farmworker can demonstrate eligibility for MSHS programs, and directs OHS to issue guidance within 30 days of enactment of this Act on the flexibilities MSHS programs can offer farmworker families with regard to demonstrating income eligibility, or residency, if they were unable to migrate as a result of the pandemic. Most Vulnerable Communities GAO Study. \u2014The Committee di- rects GAO to conduct a study identifying whether Head Start meets the needs of the most vulnerable children and communities around the country, or whether flexibility could be given in order to allocate funds to communities, age groups, or families that are in greatest need around the country.

VerDate Sep 11 2014 and Homeless Youth The Committee recommends $149,787,000 for the Runaway and Homeless Youth (RHY) program, which is $13,007,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $4,800,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee supports the ability of grantees to provide pre- vention services regardless of enrollment in residential services, and urges the program to remind grantees that they are not re-quired to enroll a young person in shelter or residential services, nor require the young person to physically travel to the grantee's location, in order for the young person who is deemed at risk of running away or becoming homeless to be eligible to receive pre-vention and supportive services, including counseling and case management. The program is encouraged to notify applicants if grant applica- tions were successful at least 30 days before the grant is to begin, or no less than 30 days before an existing grant is set to end. The Committee strongly urges the program to ensure that service delivery and staff training comprehensively address the individual strengths and needs of youth, as well as be language appropriate, gender appropriate (interventions that are sensitive to the diverse experiences of male, female, and transgender youth and consistent with the gender identity of participating youth), and culturally sen-sitive and respectful of the complex social identities of youth (i.e., race, ethnicity, nationality, age, religion/spirituality, gender iden-tity/expression, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, physical or cognitive ability, language, beliefs, values, behavior patterns, or customs). The Committee strongly believes that no runaway youth or homeless youth should be excluded from participation in, be de-nied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under, any pro-gram or activity funded in whole or in part under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, based on any of the conditions outlined in this paragraph.

These formula grants support community-based ap-proaches to child abuse and neglect prevention. The Committee believes that communities can help build strong families and improve their capacity to nurture the healthy develop-ment of their children by providing ready access to online informa-tion about the full range of public and private resources available to them. The Committee encourages ACF to provide technical as-sistance to State lead agencies on how they may use funds provided under this account to help local governments and communities to develop (or maintain) websites that provide current and regularly updated information on family, youth, and community resources, including programs and services provided through nonprofits; com-munity organizations; the Federal Government; and State and local governments.

The recommendation includes $1,000,000 for a pilot project to explore best practices, intervention, and prevention methods, and establish a hotline to reduce incidents of domestic violence by addressing people that cause harm.

Access to Integrated Health Care Services. \u2014The Committee sup- ports the proposal to partner health care providers with domestic violence service providers to provide families with access to pri-mary health care, vaccinations, and behavioral health services at a local shelter, transitional housing program, or safe home. The recommendation includes $20,000,000, as requested, for demonstra-tion grants and technical assistance for local domestic violence pro-grams and Tribes to provide access to integrated health care serv-ices, including mobile health units for families experiencing domes-tic violence who are living in shelters or placed in temporary hous-ing within their local communities. Culturally Specific Services for Domestic Violence and Sexual As- sault. \u2014The Committee recognizes that current public health and social pandemics have disproportionally impacted communities of color, leaving women and girls of color more vulnerable to incidents of domestic violence and sexual assault, and yet survivors of color have limited access to services that incorporate culturally specific healing modalities by providers who reflect their cultural commu-nity. The Committee believes that the needs of women of color intersect with broader public health and social issues including ac-cess to health care, transportation, safe and affordable housing, and economic equity, and includes $35,000,000 for culturally spe-cific communities of color organizations to develop or enhance ap-propriate services that are specific to their community. National Domestic Violence Prevention Action Plan. \u2014The Com- mittee recognizes that the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification invests in efforts to end gender-based violence across multiple Federal agencies, and notes that the United Nations has urged countries to adopt national action plans to combat gender- based violence and violence against women, including domestic vio-lence. The Committee directs ACF to coordinate with CDC to cre-ate a National Domestic Violence Prevention Action Plan to ex-pand, intensify, and coordinate domestic violence prevention efforts among Federal, State, local, and tribal government agencies and with other relevant stakeholders to ensure a whole-of-government, goal-oriented, community-informed, forward looking approach in addressing domestic violence prevention in the U.S. and report the plan to the Committee no later than one year after enactment of this Act.

Mental Health Screenings for Foster Youth. \u2014The Committee rec- ognizes that States are required to develop a plan for the ongoing oversight and coordination of health care services for any child in a foster care placement and emphasizes the importance of includ-ing mental health as part of these screenings within the first 30 days of entering foster care. The Committee urges HHS to provide technical assistance to States as they incorporate mental health screenings into State oversight plans.

VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabili- tation Research The Committee recommends $124,800,000 for the National Insti- tute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Re-search (NIDILRR), which is $11,830,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $6,181,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. NIDILRR generates knowledge and promotes its effective use to enhance the abilities of people with disabilities to perform activities of their choice in the community and to expand society's capacity to provide full opportunities for its citizens with disabil-ities. The recommendation includes funds to increase annual grant funding to competitively funded model systems centers, and a $100,000 increase for the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems National Data and Statistical Center (NDSC). Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems (SCIMS). \u2014The Committee is concerned with the growing number of people living with a spinal cord injury in the U.S. and recommends $2,000,000 to increase the number of Federally-funded SCIMS Centers. The for Assistive Tech- nology, which is $6,500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Assistive Tech-nology (AT) supports programs providing grants to States for ad-dressing assistive technology needs of individuals with disabilities. The goal is to increase awareness of and access to assistive tech-nology devices and services that may help with education, employ-ment, daily activities, and inclusion of people with disabilities in their communities. The Committee continues to provide $2,000,000 for competitive grants to support existing and new alternative financing programs that provide for the purchase of AT devices. Program Administration The Committee recommends $47,063,000 for Program Adminis- tration, which is $6,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This funding supports Federal administrative costs associated with admin-istering ACL's programs. Congressional Budget Justification Accessibility. \u2014The Committee appreciates efforts by ACL to make Congressional Budget Justifica-tions compliant with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. However, in recent fiscal years, such justifications have not been made available online at the same time as justifications for the other operating divisions of HHS. The Committee requests ACL post on its website a version of its fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification at the same time other justifications for other operating divisions of HHS become available, and to post justifica-tions compliant with section 508 as soon as practicable thereafter. Interagency Committee on Disability Research. \u2014In 2014, Con- gress enacted bipartisan legislation mandating the design and im-plementation of a Government-Wide Strategic Plan for Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (''the Plan'') to maximize the Federal return on investment in this crucial area of research. Congress directed the Secretary of Health and Human VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Services in his capacity as chair of the Interagency Committee on Disability Research to fulfill this mandate. The Committee urges the Secretary to emphasize ICDR's importance to the field of dis-ability research and to continue to acknowledge role in promoting interagency collaboration to carry out the Administration's prior-ities including the Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity. The Committee also urges the ICDR to promote the work of the Federal Equitable Data Working Group to coordinate the collection of disability-specific data. Simplifying State Program Reports. \u2014As a result of the COVID- 19 pandemic, States and area agencies on aging face an unprece-dented reporting challenge during fiscal year 2022. These entities will be responsible for reporting on Federal fiscal year 2020 and fis-cal year 2021 regular appropriations spending, as well as spending related to the four COVID-19 emergency funding packages. The Committee urges ACL to explore ways to facilitate and simplify re-porting requirements to alleviate burdens that could impact the im-portant work of providing needed services to older adults. O FFICE OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $550,622,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 657,809,000 Change from ......................................................... +107,187,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a53,500,000 Of the funds provided, $74,828,000 shall be derived from evalua- tion set-aside funds available under section 241 of the Public Health Service Act, which is $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $9,500,000 below the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. This appropriation supports activities that are associated with the Secretary's roles as policy officer and general manager of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Office of the Secretary also implements administration and Congressional directives, and provides assistance, direction, and coordination to the headquarters, regions, and field organizations of the depart-ment. In addition, this funding supports the Office of the Surgeon General and several other health promotion and disease prevention activities that are centrally administered. Advertising Contracts for Small Business Owners. \u2014The Com- mittee understands that, as the largest advertiser in the United States, the federal government should work to ensure fair access to its advertising contracts, including outdoor advertising, for small disadvantaged businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women. The Committee directs each department and agency to in-clude the following information in its fiscal year 2023 Congres-sional Budget Justification: expenditures for fiscal year 2021 and expected expenditures for fiscal year 2023 for (1) all contracts for advertising services; and (2) contracts for the advertising services of (I) socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses con-cerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637 (a)(4)); and (II) women- and minority-owned businesses. 11 \u2014The Committee is aware that treat- ment regimens and care plans for autism will continue throughout the life of the patient and that clinicians often spend additional time on patient care by providing supportive services or helping caregivers connect with additional specialists and resources. These additional services are not typically reimbursable. The Committee directs the Secretary to identify the supportive services that are most beneficial to improved outcomes for autism patients, review existing coverage policies for these services, and provide a report on its interim findings no later than 180 days after the date of en-actment of this Act. Behavioral Science and the COVID-19 National Strategy. \u2014The Committee applauds the Administration's robust National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness and ap-preciates that the strategy reflects the best advice of scientists and public health experts. As our success in these areas depends on our scientific understanding of human behavior, the Committee urges the Department to include psychological scientists at every level of the Department's response to COVID-19 and future public health emergencies to most effectively meet these common goals. Cancer Risk Study on Populations Near Commercial Nuclear Power Plants. \u2014The Committee encourages the Department to con- tract with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to carry out a pilot study of cancer risk in populations near nuclear facilities, which was recommended by the NAS in a May 2012 study entitled ''Analysis of Cancer Risks in Populations Near Nuclear Facilities.'' Children's Interagency Coordinating Council. \u2014The Committee notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a further decline in the economic standing, education, and physical and men-tal health status of low-income children, particularly among chil-dren in Hispanic, African American, and American Indian/Alaska Native families. Data shows that COVID-19 is causing more chil-dren to experience poverty and resulting in additional hardships including educational gaps and negative mental health impacts. The Committee supports collaboration amongst HHS, the Depart-ment of Energy, the Department of Justice, the Department of Ag-riculture (USDA), USAID and other federal agencies to address these pressing problems. To foster greater coordination, collabora-tion, and transparency on child policy across agency lines, the Com-mittee directs the Secretary to establish a Children's Interagency Coordinating Council. Among other tasks, the Council shall enter into an agreement with the NAS to provide an annual report to Congress analyzing and monitoring how existing and emerging fed-eral policies have affected child poverty using the U.S. Census Bu-reau Supplemental Poverty Measure. In addition, the Council will examine and periodically report on a broad array of comprehensive and cross-cutting issues affecting child well-being. COVID-19 Services for Medically Underserved Communities. \u2014 The Committee is concerned about the high rate of COVID-19-re-lated cases, hospitalizations, and deaths of historically medically underserved communities. According to HRSA, more than 18 mil-lion people reside in medically underserved areas or populations across the United States. The Committee recognizes that targeted resources and services\u2014such as mobile and pop-up clinics and con-nections to housing, food, and other forms of support\u2014for commu- VerDate Sep 11 2014 most affected by COVID-19 is essential to enable many low- income individuals to successfully isolate and quarantine. In addi-tion, to deliver on vaccine equity, outreach, and social determinants of health, investment in trusted messengers such as faith leaders, community health workers, direct care workers, social support spe-cialists, and navigators employed by community-based organiza-tions, faith-based organizations, and nonprofit organizations are necessary to reach medically underserved communities. The Com-mittee urges the Secretary develop a strategy to dedicate a specific percentage of COVID-19 funding to community-based organiza-tions proportional to the needs of people living in medically under-served areas. Data Collection to Measure Disparities. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes that geographic place is a powerful predictor of social deter-minants of health. The Committee is concerned that due to residen-tial segregation and subsequent disinvestment, the lack of access to health care, safe recreational facilities, quality education, and other resources, is often magnified in highly segregated commu-nities. To fully assess population health, distribution of disease, and the extent of health disparities, health services data should be collected based on residency as opposed to where services are pro-vided. A similar approach was taken to address the HIV/AIDS epi-demic. The Committee recommends that all health services data in-clude racial and ethnic data by subgroup, geographic indicators to the lowest levels (i.e., zip code tabulation area), nationality, sex, age, and primary language. This data should be collected in a standardized, uniform manner and include with it the capacity for linkages to various federal data sets. The Committee requests a re-port within 120 days of enactment of this Act describing the spe-cific steps taken to ensure that geographic disparities were meas-ured in COVID-19 data collection, documentation, and reporting from health care providers to public health agencies. The report shall also include recommendations to sustain data harmonization efforts to expand reporting for all infectious diseases and chronic health conditions and to address emergency prevention prepared-ness and response in the event of additional future pandemics and other catastrophes. Early Detection of Brain Aneurysms. \u2014The Committee recognizes that although one in 50 Americans has a brain aneurysm, there are typically no warning signs or symptoms unless the aneurysm rup-tures. Up to 50 percent of patients will not survive such a hemor-rhage. Even when an aneurysm has ruptured, the symptoms are not widely known among health care professionals. The Committee reiterates the language included in H. Rept. 115-862 directing the Secretary, in consultation with appropriate stakeholders\u2014including health care providers, brain aneurysm patient advocacy founda-tions, brain aneurysm survivors, and caregivers\u2014to facilitate the development of best practices on brain aneurysm detection and rupture for first responders, emergency room physicians, primary care physicians, nurses, and advanced practice providers. The Com-mittee encourages the Secretary to consider incorporating topics in-cluding, but not limited to, the symptoms of brain aneurysms, evi-dence-based risk factors for brain aneurysms, appropriate utiliza-tion of medical testing and diagnostic equipment, and screening recommendations. The Secretary shall consult with appropriate VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul stakeholders to develop a strategy for disseminating information about the best practices and begin implementing this strategy within one year after enactment of this Act. The Secretary shall re-view research on brain aneurysm detection and diagnosis and up-date the best practices every three years, as appropriate. Embryo Adoption Awareness Campaign. \u2014The Committee in- cludes $1,000,000 for the Embryo Adoption Awareness Campaign to educate Americans about the existence of frozen human embryos (resulting from in-vitro fertilization), which may be available for donation/adoption to help other couples build their families. The Committee includes bill language permitting these funds also to be used to provide medical and administrative services to individuals adopting embryos, deemed necessary for such adoptions, consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations. Fair Access to Science and Technology Research. \u2014The Committee commends the HHS agencies\u2014the Administration for Community Living (ACL), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Assist-ant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Institutes for Health (NIH)\u2014that have issued plans in re-sponse to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Directive issued on February 22, 2013. The Committee urges these agencies to continue their efforts toward full implementation of the plan and requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Global Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Action Plan. \u2014The Committee urges the Secretary to enter into negotiations with the World Health Organization to implement a plan for addressing Alz-heimer's Disease and other forms of dementia globally, to be known as the Global Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Action Plan, fo-cused on the following areas: research, including the development of a stable and sustained international commitment to research; regulatory issues; clinical care; supportive services for patients and caregivers, including innovative technologies; prevention and health promotion; public awareness and education, particularly ef-forts aimed at reducing stigmas, and increasing the inclusion of persons with Alzheimer's disease and dementia within civil society. Global Health Research. \u2014The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on how CDC, FDA, BARDA, and NIH\u2014including the Fogarty International Center\u2014jointly coordinate global health research activities with specific measurable metrics used to track progress and collabora-tion toward agreed upon health goals. Health Benefits of Proper Nutrition. \u2014The Committee continues to recognize the value of proper nutrition and understands that many chronic medical conditions can be managed cost effectively by improved nutrition. The Committee again encourages the Secretary to establish an interagency collaboration with the Department of Education and the USDA to enhance nutritional education in K- 12 schools and urges the Secretary to be proactive in promoting disease prevention by providing a plan to expand nutritional edu-cation and to increase access to nutritional foods for students. The Committee also requests a strategic plan led by HHS in partner-ship with the USDA on how culturally appropriate, food-based so-lutions can improve health outcomes and save money. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul of COVID-19 on Health Care Personnel. \u2014The Committee recognizes the incredible sacrifice that health care and direct care workers have made on the frontlines to care for Americans with COVID-19. Investigative journalists have revealed through track-ing obituaries that 3,600 U.S. health care workers died from COVID-19. Two-thirds of these casualties are among people of color. Lower paid workers, including nurses, support staff, and nursing home employees, were the most likely to pass away from COVID-19. During the pandemic, the federal government did not comprehensively track the number of lives lost among health care workers and support staff. The Committee directs HHS to under-take a comprehensive count of the total number of lives lost among health care workers and direct service workers at health care facili-ties, nursing homes, and long-term care facilities and emergency care providers, including paramedics and medical personnel who transport patients to the hospital. The Committee directs HHS, in coordination with OSHA, to develop and submit to the Committee a plan within 90 days of enactment of this Act for how it will col-lect, record, and report health care worker mortality and morbidity data associated with COVID-19, including suicides connected to the mental health impact of the pandemic. The Committee further directs the Secretary to submit a report within 180 days of enact-ment of this Act on initial findings of the long-term health impacts of the pandemic on health care workers, including physical health, mental trauma leading to disability, and contraction of COVID-19. Improving Accuracy of Diagnosis of Rare Diseases. \u2014The Com- mittee is aware that the lack of a precise diagnostic code makes disease surveillance, including understanding the true prevalence of a condition, more difficult and hinders diagnosis, treatment, and access to approved therapies. The Committee encourages HHS to work with federal agency partners to establish a pathway for rare disease stakeholders to pursue a diagnosis code, including re-sources to advise stakeholders as to data and other needs and to help facilitate the application process for rare disease codes. LymeX Innovation Accelerator. \u2014The Committee commends the Office of the Secretary and its Chief Technology Officer for the Lyme Innovation Initiative, launched November 2018, and the LymeX Innovation Accelerator announced in October 2020. LymeX is a $25,000,000 public-private partnership between HHS and the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation to accelerate innovation in prevention, diagnostics, and treatments for Lyme and other tick- borne diseases. The Committee looks forward to receiving the multi-year plan outlining innovation initiatives for conquering Lyme disease, which is due in December 2021. Maximizing Syringe Safety. \u2014The Committee is concerned that on COVID-19 vaccine deployment, administrative inconsistencies with procured syringes have resulted in wasted vaccine doses while potentially exposing front line health care workers to bloodborne pathogens; both of which could impede efforts for a thorough, safe, and timely administration of FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines. The Committee directs the Secretary, in consultation with relevant agencies within HHS who maintain jurisdiction in the administra-tion of vaccines including FDA, NIH, ASPR, Office of Minority Health, and Office on Women's Health to submit a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the specific steps the Depart- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 is taking to ensure that procurement of syringes for the de- ployment and administration of COVID-19 vaccines provide the maximum dose while ensuring our frontline health care workers re-main safe from the risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Mental Health Parity. \u2014The Committee continues to be concerned that 12 years since enactment of the Mental Health Parity and Ad-diction Equity Act (MHPAEA), there is still a lack of oversight and compliance among insurance companies and health plans not ade-quately covering mental and behavioral health services and pro-viders. In December 2019, the GAO reported that this lack of com-pliance extends beyond plans investigated by the Department of Labor (DOL) and includes plans over which HHS has oversight au-thority. The Committee urges the HHS Secretary, jointly with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of the Treasury, to establish a process through which employer-sponsored health plans and health insurance issuers subject to MHPAEA may submit a public report regarding nonquantitative treatment limitations while en-suring that any personal or confidential consumer information is protected. The Secretaries shall also report annually any auditing and enforcement of all plans and issuers within the jurisdiction of the respective Department. National Center on Antiracism and Health Equity. \u2014The Com- mittee strongly supports efforts to advance health equity and re-duce disparities for communities of color. Persistent racial and eth-nic health disparities can be largely attributed to poor social and physical determinants of health in these communities. Advancing health equity requires a multifactorial response to address issues such as high unemployment, inadequate housing, lack of quality education, and inability to access health care. Reducing health dis-parities also requires solutions that are informed by and tailored to the specific racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic commu-nities at which they are aimed. The Committee supports the Office of Minority Health (OMH) and its efforts to advance health eq-uity\u2014however, the Committee believes the OMH currently lacks sufficient capacity to lead a broad and bold effort to address health disparities and that HHS should establish a National Center on Antiracism and Health Equity (Center) within the Department to lead efforts to identify and understand the policies and practices that have a disparate impact on the health and well-being of com-munities of color. The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a report, not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, that provides detailed proposals to establish a National Center on Antiracism and Health Equity within the Department. The pro-posals shall include (1) a charter and goals for a National Center on Antiracism and Health Equity; (2) rationale for creating a new entity within the Department or restructuring an existing entity; (3) budgetary resources necessary to establish the Center; (4) the number of full-time equivalent employees needed to effectively carry out the Center's mission; (5) the resources needed for the Center to establish, through grants or cooperative agreements, at least three regional centers of excellence, located in racial and eth-nic minority communities; (6) the resources needed to award grants and cooperative agreements to eligible public and nonprofit private entities, including community-based organizations, to collaborate with underserved communities and for research and collection, VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul analysis, and reporting of data on the public health impacts of health disparities; and (7) the resources needed for the Center to work with eligible public and nonprofit private entities, including community-based organizations, to provide information and edu-cation to the public on the public health impacts of health dispari-ties and on health equity interventions, among other details. National Health Care Workforce Commission. \u2014The Committee includes $3,000,000 to establish the National Health Care Work-force Commission, as authorized by the Affordable Care Act. The Commission is intended to serve as a resource on health care work-force policy for Congress, the Administration, States, and localities and is tasked with evaluating health care workforce needs, assess-ing education and training activities, identifying barriers to im-proved coordination at the Federal, State, and local levels and rec-ommending changes to address those barriers. National Poverty Center Cooperative Agreement. \u2014The Committee includes sufficient funding for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation to fund a Poverty Research Center co-operative agreement in fiscal year 2022, in an amount not less than the current level of funding. One Health Federal Interagency Network. \u2014The Committee un- derstands that despite unprecedented efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic, many questions remain about the prevention of future pandemics, especially those caused by zoonotic disease transmission. The Committee recognizes that current federal ef-forts regarding a One Health approach to preventing and respond-ing to pandemics stemming from zoonotic disease, vector-borne dis-ease, and antimicrobial-resistant pathogens is inadequate, frag-mented, and associated with limited coordination and collaboration within and across Federal agencies. The Committee supports a One Health approach to pandemic prevention that recognizes that human, animal, and environmental health are fundamentally inter-connected. The Committee directs the Secretary or his designee to formalize the One Health Network and to provide a professional judgement within 180 days of enactment of this Act regarding the Network's funding and resource requirements. This report shall also include an assessment of current agency capabilities, as well as current and planned activities related to pandemic preparedness and One Health, particularly regarding the Network's efforts to ex-pand, integrate, and enhance support for global surveillance efforts to effectively and efficiently implement early detection and rapid response measures. The Committee further directs HHS to include a cross-cut budget of current One Health activities being imple-mented. Pain Management. \u2014The Committee has previously expressed concern about the public health epidemic of acute and chronic pain, including its inter-relationship with the opioid crisis. The COVID- 19 pandemic has exacerbated each of these problems. As rec-ommended in the CARA-mandated HHS Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force report, the Committee urges the Department to coordinate with the Department of Defense (DOD) and the VA to launch a public awareness campaign to educate Americans about the differences between acute and chronic pain and available evidence-based non-opioid treatment options. The Committee again urges the Department to widely disseminate the VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul of individual- ized, multidisciplinary, patient-centered care in the treatment of pain to health care providers and other public health stakeholders, and to update relevant pain management policies and educational tools to reflect Task Force recommended best practices across all relevant HHS agencies, including the CDC, CMS and SAMHSA. The Committee urges the Department to include an update on dis-semination of these materials and progress on the public awareness campaign in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justifica-tion. Plasma Protein Therapies. \u2014The Committee recognizes that plas- ma protein therapies are unique and non-interchangeable treat-ments for individuals afflicted with a variety of rare chronic and life-threatening conditions. The availability of plasma protein therapies is dependent on the collection of donated plasma which is developed into plasma protein therapies. The Committee urges the Department to conduct an education and awareness campaign on the importance of source plasma donation and the safety of the process as part of the larger campaign around the safety of blood donation broadly. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. \u2014The Committee requests a report, not later than one year after enactment of this Act, outlining the number of women in America currently suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); the annual cost to patients for treatment of PCOS; the annual cost to patients resulting from misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis of PCOS; the economic burden of PCOS on the United States; the effectiveness of current testing methods for PCOS; recommended ages for testing of PCOS; cost benefits of test-ing all women at recommended age; and feasibility of testing for PCOS before symptoms are present. Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome Advisory Committee. \u2014The Com- mittee encourages HHS to foster interagency and stakeholder col-laboration in addressing the crisis of post-acute COVID-19 syn-drome by forming the Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome Advisory Committee. Preventing Mental Health and Substance Use Crises. \u2014The Com- mittee recognizes that the severity of the mental health and sub-stance use crises has worsened during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Research showing increases in anxiety, depression, sui-cidal ideation, and substance use warrant further examination and the development of a response plan for the next public health emer-gency. The Committee requests an assessment of the response of the Federal government with respect to mental health and sub-stance use during and after the onset of the COVID-19 public health emergency, as well as recommendations for a national strat-egy for preventing mental health and substance use crises during a future public health emergency. Repatriation. \u2014An April 2021 GAO report on HHS's COVID-19 emergency repatriation efforts found that HHS experienced coordi-nation and safety issues that put repatriates, HHS personnel, and nearby communities at risk. The Committee directs HHS to revise or develop emergency preparedness and response plans to include the U.S. Repatriation Program and other human services pro-grams, and to further clarify agency roles and responsibilities, in-cluding safety protocol for an evacuation and quarantine, during a VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul pandemic. The Committee also directs the Department to plan and conduct regular exercises with relevant stakeholders\u2014including federal partners, State, local, territorial, and tribal governments\u2014 to test repatriation plans in response to a pandemic and update rel-evant plans based on lessons learned. Report on the Effects of Social Media Use. \u2014The Committee con- tinues to support efforts by the Secretary to investigate whether there is a relationship between the use of social media and nega-tive social and individual outcomes, including clinical and undiagnosed depression; self-harm, such as suicide, attempted sui-cide, and suicidal ideation; harm to others; cyber bullying; chronic anxiety; or social isolation. Such investigation should consider the role of content and presentation in social media that is linked to negative outcomes, as well as the design of algorithms to prioritize user engagement. In addition, the report should include consider-ation of the following questions: what type of content drives user participation on these platforms; how is that content most fre-quently presented to users on these platforms; and does that pres-entation lead to negative physical, mental or emotional health out-comes; what types of emotions characterize social media inter-actions; how do these companies design their algorithms to engage users; and is that design prioritizing engagement over user well- being. The Committee encourages the Secretary to provide a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the continued progress in this research area. Research on Pregnant and Lactating Women .\u2014The Committee encourages the Secretary to work with the NIH, FDA, the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP), and other relevant agen-cies to implement recommendations from the Task Force on Re-search Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women (PRGLAC). The Committee encourages the Secretary to direct NIH and FDA to implement guidance and templates surrounding the in-clusion of pregnant and lactating individuals within clinical trials in order to require justification for the exclusion of these popu-lations within clinical trials, and to clarify that exclusion of these populations within clinical trials should not be the default practice in the development and evaluation of drugs and therapeutics. The Secretary should work with OHRP and FDA to harmonize FDA regulations with changes to the protected status of pregnant women in federally funded research included in the 2018 revisions to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. Social Determinants of Health Council. \u2014The Committee directs the Social Determinants Council created by H. Rpt. 116-450 to con-tinue to provide technical assistance to State, local, and tribal ju-risdictions seeking to develop Social Determinants Accelerator Plans. The Committee directs a report be submitted, no later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, regarding the status of the se-lection of all Council members outlined in H. Rpt. 116-450. Stigmatizing Language. \u2014The Committee recognizes stigma and discrimination against individuals with a substance use disorder is a barrier to accessing treatment and supports removing stigma-tizing language from the U.S. Code and federal agency and pro-gram names. To support these efforts, the Committee encourages the Secretary to identify names of agencies, institutes, centers, and programs that include stigmatizing language and to develop a VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul strategy to remove language with a negative bias from these names. Stillbirth Task Force. \u2014Stillbirth affects one in 160 pregnancies, with 24,000 babies stillborn each year. Despite medical advances, the rate of early stillbirth has remained the same over the past 30 years. The Committee provides $1,000,000 for the Secretary to de-velop a task force on stillbirth in the United States. The task force should include the CDC, NIH, outside specialty organizations, and maternal and fetal medicine specialists. The task force should focus on the current barriers to collecting data on stillbirths throughout the United States, communities at higher risk of stillbirth, the psy-chological impact and treatment for mothers following stillbirth, and known risk factors for stillbirth. The task force should provide a report on these issues within one year of enactment of this Act. Study on Animal Abuse and Future Acts of Violence. \u2014The Com- mittee is concerned about the link between animal abuse and fu-ture violence, and recognizes the need for further study into the underlying factors that contribute to acts of violence against ani-mals and animal violence as a predictor of future violence against humans. The Committee directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), and includes $1,000,000 for the NASEM to conduct a study on the underlying factors that contribute to one's decision to commit acts of violence against animals; and ana-lyzes acts of violence against animals as a predictor of future vio-lence against humans. Study on Child Marriages. \u2014The Committee requests a report, within one year of enactment of this Act, on the status of child marriages in the United States, including information on the prev-alence of child marriages that have received exceptions through pa-rental consent, judicial approval, emancipation, or pregnancy. The report should include information on the prevalence of child mar-riages that take place under force, fraud, or coercion and a study of provisions that States have enacted to help identify and prevent the marriage of minors due to force, fraud, or coercion. Finally, the report shall outline the impact of state-wide legislative reforms on the number of marriage licenses given to minors. The Committee requests a briefing on the report findings within 30 days of its sub-mission. Study on the Manufacture and Sale of Nitrous Oxide. \u2014The Com- mittee understands that more than one million adolescents and young adults in the United States have used nitrous oxide illicitly for recreational purposes. This can cause headaches, drowsiness, breathing difficulty, or asphyxia, which can lead to a lapse into un-consciousness or death. The FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations has investigated businesses that purport to sell nitrous oxide for car racing applications but knowingly sell it for recreational drug use. The Committee believes that studying the effectiveness of state laws prohibiting the recreational use of nitrous oxide is a nec-essary first step in examining what role the Federal government should play to protect the public health in regard to recreational use of nitrous oxide. The Committee directs the Department, in consultation with CDC, FDA, SAMHSA, EPA, and CPSC, to submit a report containing (1) the results of a study of State regulatory re-quirements with respect to nitrous oxide that is manufactured and VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul sold for use in consumer applications and (2) recommendations for Federal requirements with respect to such manufacture and sale that are needed to protect human health and safety. Supporting Community Violence Intervention Programs. \u2014HHS and its agencies, including CDC and SAMHSA, have a critical role to play in supporting community violence intervention, including by providing grant funding to eligible programs and technical assist-ance to grant recipients, and through evaluating the implementa-tion of community violence intervention programs. The Committee urges the Department to evaluate its existing grant programs to determine which can be used to support community-based violence intervention programs and ensure that relevant funding oppor-tunity announcements clearly articulate that they can fund commu-nity violence interventions. The Committee also urges the Depart-ment to conduct outreach to raise awareness about the funding available for community violence intervention programs, provide technical assistance to grant recipients and conduct research into program efficacy and implementation. Tardive Dyskinesia (TD). \u2014The Committee understands that TD is a persistent, irreversible, and potentially disabling neurological condition that is associated with prolonged exposure to antipsychotics and other dopamine receptor blocking agents. It is characterized by involuntary movements and affects at least 500,000 people in the U.S. TD can significantly disrupt a patient's life, not only due to the symptoms themselves, but also the impact these symptoms have on social and emotional well-being and men-tal health. The Committee encourages HHS to prioritize the impor-tance of screening, diagnosing, and treating TD as part of one's mental health. The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a re-port, no later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act, which (1) outlines the Department's existing resources for patients, pro-viders, and caregivers related to TD, (2) identifies opportunities to update and expand such resources, and (3) lays out the Depart-ment's strategy to carry out this paragraph. Teacher Stress. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the high lev- els of stress our nation's teachers have gone through both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee directs the Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Education, to con-duct a study within one year of enactment of this Act on teacher stress and increasing teacher retention and well-being. This study should look at the effectiveness of some of the following programs in reducing stress and increasing retention: workplace wellness programs that improve teacher health, social emotional learning programs, mentoring and induction programs for teachers through-out the year, other evidence based approaches to reducing stress and increasing well-being. Telehealth Standards. \u2014The Committee believes that the flexi- bility afforded to telehealth providers has played an essential role in ensuring that Americans receive timely and quality care throughout the COVID-19 pandemic; however, quality standards remain important no matter the health care delivery method to en-sure quality and safety. The Committee urges the Secretary to es-tablish an advisory group to study issues relating to the provision of telehealth and associated quality of care. Such a study should generate recommendations regarding the applicability of telehealth VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 various clinical scenarios. The Secretary shall assem- ble a technical advisory group that includes experts in the delivery of telehealth services. The advisory group shall also evaluate whether equity exists in access to appropriate telehealth modalities throughout the country, including broadband, computers, smartphones, landline telephones, and cell phones that only allow for audio-only communications. The Committee requests the Sec-retary deliver a report from the advisory group, no later than one year after enactment of this Act, with recommendations as to whether quality of care criteria should be applied to the specific use of any telehealth modality in different clinical scenarios. Tribal Set-Aside. \u2014The Committee notes that according to the CDC, HIV-positive status among Native Americans is increasing and nearly one-in-five HIV-positive Native Americans is unaware of their status. In addition, only three-in-five receive care and less than half are virally suppressed. To increase access to HIV/AIDS testing, prevention, and treatment, the Committee includes $3,000,000 as a tribal set-aside within the Minority HIV/AIDS Pre-vention and Treatment program. U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission Vaccine Deployment Strategy. \u2014The Committee recognizes the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on communities along the Southern border, which are interconnected with their Mexican sister cities, with thousands of people and billions of dollars in trade crossing daily regardless of border closures. To ensure a full economic recovery both in border communities and nationally, the U.S. must work with Mexico to implement a binational COVID-19 strategy. The Committee encourages the U.S. section of the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission to engage with their Mexican counterparts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine deployment strategy for communities on both sides of the border. U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission. \u2014The Committee recog- nizes the important role the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commis-sion plays in promoting solutions to health issues unique to the Southern border. The Committee includes $2,000,000 for the Com-mission, an increase of $900,000. Further, the Committee urges the Secretary to build upon the framework established by Healthy Bor-der 2020 for border region public health goals and the actions need-ed to improve the health of U.S. and Mexico border residents, and to commence work on Healthy Border 2030 as part of the Depart-ment's Healthy People 2030 initiative with a focus on addressing health disparities and to help border communities become more re-silient to public health threats. USPSTF Clinical Data. \u2014The Committee encourages the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to ensure that its recommendations further public health for all Americans and ad-dress health inequities. USPSTF should strive to provide timely recommendations, be fully transparent, and allow for public com-ment. USPSTF's methodologies should be firmly grounded in evi-dence and consider data specific to health equity and racial diver-sity to inform its decision making. Furthermore, USPSTF should review a recommendation upon a showing of new evidence. In addi-tion, USPSTF's composition should reflect an appropriate breadth of practicing physician expertise, including specialist expertise, as well as public input reflecting diverse patient populations. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Strategic Plan. \u2014The Committee ap- plauds the Department's update of the Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan, which was released in January 2021. The Viral Hepatitis Plan sets clear goals on how the United States can pre-vent, diagnose, treat, and manage viral hepatitis. The Committee urges the Department to implement the strategies laid out in this plan to reverse the rates of viral hepatitis, prevent new infections, improve care and treatment, and ultimately eliminate viral hepa-titis as a public health threat. White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI). \u2014The Committee includes funding to support the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, led by the Secretary of HHS, to advance health equity and economic justice for AANHPI commu-nities that continue to face racism, nativism, and xenophobia. Zoonotic and Vector-Borne Disease Prevention, Early Detection, and Warning System Strategy. \u2014The Committee directs the Sec- retary or his designee to work with the One Health Network to es-tablish a 5-year strategy and framework for contributing to the building and implementation of the Zoonotic and Vector-Borne Dis-ease Prevention, Early Detection, and Warning System (System), and to report on the status of such effort within 120 days of enact-ment of this Act. The strategy should identify the knowledge and information needs that the System will meet; key indicators (in-cluding indicators that span human, animal, and ecological deter-minants of spillover); existing domestic and international data sources (including basic data sources such as wastewater moni-toring); knowledge and data gaps; plans for harnessing and strengthening existing domestic and international data sources; plans for building and strengthening new domestic and inter-national data sources, triangulating data, plans for making the System and its data and analyses widely available and easily ac-cessible to policy and programming decision makers and the gen-eral public; plans for strengthening the capacity of intergovern-mental, nonprofit and other institutions to collect, analyze, and use relevant data and the overall system, especially in low- and middle- income countries; plans for harnessing and contributing to global private and public activities and partnerships; and plans for com-municating findings, especially when a spillover event is imminent or detected. The Committee recognizes that some countries are not accessible or open to data collection, and therefore encourages part-nerships with other organizations, including intergovernmental or-ganizations, to support data collection and collaboration. Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS). \u2014The Committee urges the Department to ensure that the Commissioned Corps' policies on the inclusion of employees with chronic hepatitis B are consistent with up-to-date medical knowledge and that the USPHS adopt comprehensive, evidence- based HBV policies consistent with CDC recommendations for cur-rent and incoming personnel. Dietary Guidelines for Americans. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of communicating the new 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans to health care providers in order to VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul the intended population impact, particularly given the in- troduction of new nutrition recommendations for children from birth through 24 months and pregnant and lactating women. The Committee encourages the Department to develop materials for a comprehensive public education campaign aimed at educating health care professionals on how to talk with their patients about aligning their dietary choices with the Dietary Guidelines. The campaign should be informed by scientific research on health be-havior change, as well as input from key stakeholder groups, in-cluding nutrition assistance program participants and administra-tors, health care providers, community leaders, and health and nu-trition advocates. The campaign should incorporate educational materials representing wide diversity of cultural food preferences and should be available in languages that meet the needs of popu-lations at risk for diet-related disease. The Office of Disease Pre-vention and Health Promotion should work in collaboration with the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion to develop this campaign. Health and Housing Initiatives. \u2014The Committee is aware of promising initiatives developed by non-profit community groups in collaboration with local health systems and housing authorities that are targeted at homeless and precariously housed individuals who are high utilizers of medical care provided at hospital emer-gency departments. These programs work across different areas of core competency to provide safe, affordable housing together with ancillary medical, behavioral, substance use disorder, nutritional and employment or job training services. Participants demonstrate significant improvements in their health, sustainable incomes, and reduced use of emergency department and other expensive medical services. The Committee encourages the Department to support these types of initiatives through research, innovation models, health workforce and homeless programs, and other appropriate initiatives. National Strategy for Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Types 1 and 2.\u2014The Committee recognizes that an estimated 1 in 3 Americans has Herpes, and that most Americans with HSV do not have symp-toms and do not realize they have it. In light of the national prioritization of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic, maternal health, neonatal health, and the all-time high of STIs, the Committee urges the Assistant Secretary for Health to develop a national strategy and strategic plan for the treatment and prevention of HSV types 1 and 2. Public Health Service Corps Eligibility Requirements. \u2014The Com- mittee is concerned that the Office of the Surgeon General has not complied with language in the Joint Explanatory Statement for P.L. 116-260 which encouraged the Secretary to update accredita-tion and eligibility requirements for the Public Health Service Corps to allow access to the best qualified applicants, including those who graduate from Psychological Clinical Science Accredita-tion System programs. The Committee urges the Department to make the necessary changes to its eligibility requirements. Teen Pregnancy Prevention. \u2014The Committee strongly supports the Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) Program and provides $130,000,000, an increase of $29,000,000 over the enacted level. The TPP Program has been widely cited as a high-quality evidence- VerDate Sep 11 2014 including by the bipartisan Commission on Evi- dence-Based Policymaking. Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program Evidence Review. \u2014The Committee includes $900,000 for the Assistant Secretary for Plan-ning and Evaluation to reactivate the TPP Evidence Review. The Evidence Review is an independent, systematic, rigorous review of evaluation studies that inform grantmaking and provide a clearing-house of evidence-based programs for other Federal, State, and community initiatives. Office of Minority Health The Committee includes $75,835,000 for the Office of Minority Health (OMH), which is $14,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The OMH works with U.S. Public Health Service agencies and other agencies of the Department to address the health status and quality of life for racial and ethnic minority populations in the United States. OMH develops and implements new policies; partners with States, tribes, and communities through cooperative agreements; supports research, demonstration, and evaluation projects; and disseminates information. Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health Equity. \u2014The Com- mittee continues to recognize the importance of advancing Indige-nous solutions to achieve health equity. The Committee includes $3,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000 to support the work of the Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health Equity. The Com-mittee continues to urge HHS to consider partnering with univer-sities with a focus on Indigenous health research and policy among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, as well as universities with a focus on Indigenous health policy and innovation among Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders. Public Health Pilot Program to Address Structural Racism in Public Health. \u2014The Committee strongly supports OMH grant pro- grams that support public and non-profit entities, including com-munity-based organizations, to build and strengthen coalitions fo-cused on addressing structural racism in public health. The Com-mittee directs the OMH to establish a pilot program to advance these goals and includes $10,000,000 to fund 20 eligible applicants. The OMH Director shall submit a report to the Committee, not later than 180 days of enactment of this Act, on the progress of this pilot program. The Committee is concerned that current grants to advance health equity and reduce disparities are not as targeted as nec-essary to address structural racism in public health and promote policies and practices that counter the disparate impact on the health and well-being of communities of color. Therefore, the Com-mittee directs the Secretary to submit a report, not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, providing details on entities awarded funding in prior fiscal years for efforts that address struc-tural racism in public health, selection criteria used, and the fund-ing amount for each grant or contract. In addition, the report shall detail steps the OMH plans to take to ensure grant funding is awarded to public and non-profit entities, including community- based organizations, that demonstrate the ability to implement in-novative models to address structural racism. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Services. \u2014The Committee includes $3,000,000 to research, develop, and test methods of informing limited English proficient (LEP) individuals about their right to and the avail-ability of language access services, including considerations related to literacy levels of LEP populations, the needs of older adults and speakers of indigenous languages, readability, and the usage of symbols, taglines, translated materials and other methodologies. OMH shall consult external experts and organizations with knowl-edge on or connections to LEP communities and partner with non-profit community-based organizations to test solutions and solicit feedback from LEP populations. The Committee requests a briefing on this initiative within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Physician Shortage Report. \u2014The Committee directs the Advisory Committee on Minority Health to issue a report advising HHS on the best efforts to create pipeline programs that start with pre-med students in underserved areas and end in more graduate medical education training programs in those underserved areas. The Com-mittee recognizes the need to build and strengthen the pipeline for physicians who practice in medically underserved areas. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed how fragile the frontline provider workforce is because of the physician shortage crisis, and it is most pronounced in medically underserved areas. Vaccine and Testing Equity Study. \u2014The Committee recognizes that Hispanic and immigrant communities face unique barriers re-garding COVID-19 vaccination and testing, including a lack of reli-able information in their languages, misinformation, and fear of de-portations. The Committee requests a study by the Advisory Com-mittee on Minority Health, within 120 days of enactment of this Act, on further steps and recommendations that can help HHS ad-dress vaccine and testing equity in Hispanic and immigrant com-munities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Office on Women's Health The Committee includes $42,140,000 for the Office on Women's Health (OWH), which is $7,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Combatting Violence Against Women. \u2014The Committee includes $10,000,000 to combat violence against women through the State partnership initiative and directs the OWH to work in conjunction with the Family Violence Prevention and Services Program office. This program provides funding to State-level public and private health programs to partner with domestic and sexual violence orga-nizations to improve health care providers ability to help victims of violence and improve prevention programs. In addition, the Com-mittee continues to recommend OWH create a State-level pilot pro-gram to incentivize substance use disorder treatment providers to be trained on intimate partner violence. Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Promotion of Optimal Birth Outcomes. \u2014The Committee includes $2,000,000 for the OWH to convene an Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Pro-motion of Optimal Birth Outcomes to oversee and coordinate the HHS Action Plan to Improve Maternal Health in America. The Co-ordinating Committee shall meet biannually and shall include, but not be limited to, the Administrators of HRSA, CDC, CMS, ACF, ACL, SAMHSA, the Indian Health Service, and the Secretaries of VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul the VA and DOD. The Coordinating Committee shall produce an annual progress report that reports on activities and outcomes of the HHS programs directed toward improving maternity outcomes. MEDICARE HEARINGS AND APPEALS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $191,881,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 196,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... 4,119,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - This appropriation supports activities carried out by two Office of the Secretary Staff Divisions. The Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals supports Medicare appeals at the administrative law judge level, the third level of Medicare claims appeals. The Depart-mental Appeals Board represents the fourth level of the Medicare appeals process and provides impartial, independent hearings and appellate reviews. Bond Hearings and Placement Reviews. \u2014The Committee believes it is incumbent upon HHS to ensure that children's rights to place-ment in the least restrictive setting are protected, and strongly supports the right of an unaccompanied child (UC) to challenge their placement in restrictive settings in front of the HHS Depart-mental Appeals Board (DAB) with representation of legal counsel, and with an ORR-appointed child advocate. The Committee expects that the HHS DAB will ensure that the Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) for UC hearings will operate separate and apart from all ORR staff who take part in, review, or adjudicate place-ment of unaccompanied children and that they will have training and expertise on the Flores Settlement Agreement, the Trafficking Victim Protection Reauthorization Act, and the particular vulnerabilities of unaccompanied children. OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $62,367,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 86,614,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +24,247,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) is the principal Federal entity charged with coordinating efforts to implement and use health information technology and exchange electronically health information. Accessibility of Online Telehealth Platforms. \u2014The Committee recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic led to the increased use of online portals and web services for patients seeking information, scheduling, and accessing remote services. However, the Committee is concerned that many online platforms are not user-friendly, es-pecially for less digitally literate communities, including seniors. The Committee urges the Secretary, working through ONC, to co-ordinate with the Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality (AHRQ), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on any Federal efforts that can be made to evaluate the accessibility of digital health platforms for Federally-supported providers, including any assessments of how VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul seniors and persons with disabilities are included in the design and testing of the platforms. Further, the Committee directs the Sec-retary, working through ONC, AHRQ, CMS, and OCR, to establish best practices for healthcare providers to improve their online tele-health platforms for seniors, individuals with disabilities, and indi-viduals with limited English proficiency. Public Health Data Utility. \u2014The Committee notes the COVID- 19 pandemic has exposed serious gaps in our health care system and the challenges of responding to major public health threats. Real-time data is essential for responding to a pandemic and for improving public health outcomes broadly. The Committee ac-knowledges some States have advanced capacities to collect and share real-time data and effectively respond to public health threats through their Health Information Exchange (HIE). These States can lead the way by maximizing current capabilities and sharing across the Nation. The Committee encourages the Office of the National Coordinator, in coordination with the Assistant Sec-retary for Preparedness and Response, to coordinate with State- based health data utilities to better plan and prepare for a public health threat. Recording Vaping in Electronic Health Records. \u2014The Committee understands that despite the prevalence of e-cigarette use among youths and the potential risk of serious side effects, consensus on how to screen adolescents for e-cigarette use is lacking. Providers may not ask about use of these devices, and electronic health records (EHRs) currently do not provide options for recording use of e-cigarettes, water pipes, and other types of smoking in con-sistent computable ways, potentially resulting in underreporting, and a dearth of data that can be used to understand long-term health outcomes. The Committee urges the Secretary, working through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, and ONC, to consider developing strategies to enhance accurate data collection and timely reporting of e-ciga-rette use, including consideration of the role of EHRs, as aligned with applicable clinicalpractice guidelines. Standards for Interoperability. \u2014The recommendation includes not less than $5,000,000 to support Fast Healthcare Interoper-ability Resource standards-related activities needed to successfully achieve interoperability and information sharing for better health and health care. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $80,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 100,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +20,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Committee recommends $100,000,000 for the Office of In- spector General (OIG), which is $20,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. The bill includes language making a portion of funding available for two years, as requested in the Congressional Budget Justification, for the investigation and enforcement of information blocking. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul In addition, within the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) program discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2022, the Committee provides the OIG with $109,145,000. Mandatory ap-propriations for this office also are contained in the HCFAC pro-gram and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $38,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 47,931,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +9,133,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for enforcing civil rights statutes that prohibit discrimination in health and human services programs. OCR implements the civil rights laws through a compliance program designed to generate voluntary compliance among all HHS recipients. Disability Ombudsperson. \u2014The Committee encourages OCR to recommend that hospitals create a disability ombudsperson posi-tion who is authorized to facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients with disabilities or their proxies and advocate on the patient's behalf, when required, to ensure that all clinical and long-term services and support options and choices are made available. Rehabilitation Act. \u2014The Committee directs the Secretary to fully enforce the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Dis-abilities Act. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on enforcement of section 504 of the Rehabili-tation Act. Where available, the Department shall disaggregate data by age. RETIREMENT PAY AND MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR COMMISSIONED OFFICERS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $653,023,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 656,504,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +3,481,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Committee provides for retirement pay and medical benefits of Public Health Service Commissioned Officers, for payments under the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan, and for medical care of dependents and retired personnel. PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES EMERGENCY FUND Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $2,847,458,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 3,518,036,000 Change from ......................................................... +670,578,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a55,080,000 This account supports the activities of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and other components within the Office of the Secretary to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the health consequences of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies, including pandemic influenza. It also includes funding for the Department's cybersecurity efforts. VerDate Sep 11 2014 Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260) provided $19,695,000,000 for the manufacturing and procurement of vaccines and thera-peutics, as well as ancillary supplies necessary for the administra-tion of vaccines and therapeutics. The American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) provided $6,050,000,000 for research, development, manu-facturing, production, and the purchase of vaccines, therapeutics, and ancillary medical products and supplies to prevent, prepare, or respond to COVID-19 or any disease with potential for creating a pandemic. Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response The Committee provides $2,997,937,000 for activities adminis- tered by ASPR. ASPR is responsible for coordinating national poli-cies and plans for medical and public health preparedness and for administering a variety of public health preparedness programs. BARDA and BioShield Professional Judgement Budget. \u2014The Committee directs ASPR to submit a report to the Committee in conjunction with the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Jus-tification detailing a professional judgement on the necessary budg-et and infrastructure requirements to fully operationalize these programs in fiscal year 2023. This report shall also include an as-sessment of current agency capabilities, as well as current and planned activities related to pandemic preparedness. Cold Chain Technologies. \u2014The Committee recognizes the limita- tions that are presented by cold chain requirements for vaccine dis-tribution and storage. The Committee directs the Secretary to ex-plore opportunities for new technologies such as dry power ap-proaches or thin-film freeze drying that allow for vaccines to be physiochemically stable for an extended period without causing degradation or reduction in immunogenicity. The Committee re-quests an update on such efforts in the fiscal year 2023 Congres-sional Budget Justification. Far-Forward Patient Care. \u2014The Committee recognizes that con- ducting traditional medical care closer to the point of injury can have many positive effects. ASPR is encouraged to consider estab-lishing a Federally Funded Research and Development Center in partnership with an academic medical center to improve far-for-ward care, transportation and coordination, and advanced tech-nology that can provide additional solutions to future patient care. Freeze-Dried Hemostatic Products. \u2014The Committee encourages the further development of freeze-dried hemostatic products, espe-cially platelet-derived products, to include a wide range of indica-tions. Modeling and Simulation. \u2014The Committee encourages ASPR to support the development and study of in silico approaches to accel-erate vaccines for emerging infectious diseases including, but not limited to, computational simulation, data analytics, and the digital patient model, with the objective of reducing the time to market for virus vaccines. Pandemic Preparedness. \u2014The Committee encourages efforts to partner with one or more academic health centers leading regional coordination efforts through the existing Regional Disaster Health Response System. The Committee encourages efforts to expand co-operative agreements for pilots to advance comprehensive regional VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul preparedness built on real time data and convening of relevant stakeholders from local, State, and Federal governments, and civic and corporate leaders to improve pandemic preparedness and re-sponse. These pilots would allow for an integrated plan for pre-paredness and response including recommendations for table-top exercises to assure future systems are in place to respond to pandemics. In addition, the Committee encourages the consider-ation of improved airborne infectious disease monitoring capabili-ties. State Emergency Operations Centers. \u2014The Committee urges ASPR, in coordination with other relevant agencies, to conduct a study to examine the differences in State emergency operation cen-ter responses to the COVID-19 pandemic to identify best practices to inform future public health emergency preparedness and re-sponse. Operations The Committee includes $32,176,000, an increase of $1,238,000, for activities within the Assistant Secretary's Immediate Office; the Office of the Chief Operating Officer; the Office of Acquisitions Management, Contracts, and Grants; and the Office of Financial Planning and Analysis. Preparedness and Emergency Operations The Committee includes $25,640,000, an increase of $986,000, for Preparedness and Emergency Operations. The Preparedness and Emergency Operations account funds the Office of Emergency Man-agement, which supports a full spectrum of emergency manage-ment responsibilities, including planning, coordination, logistics, training, and responding to planned events and unplanned inci-dents. National Disaster Medical System The Committee includes $91,807,000, an increase of $28,403,000, for the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS). NDMS deploys trained medical teams to communities impacted by public health and medical emergencies due to natural and man-made incidents. Mission Zero .\u2014The Committee includes $5,000,000 for civilian trauma centers to train and incorporate military trauma care pro-viders and teams into care centers. Pediatric Disaster Care. \u2014The Committee includes $6,000,000 for the continuation pediatric disaster care program. Hospital Preparedness Program The Committee includes $319,777,000, an increase of $39,222,000, for the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP). HPP supports a variety of programs to strengthen the preparedness and response of the health care sector. Hospital Preparedness Program Cooperative Agreements. \u2014The Committee includes $240,000,000, an increase of $8,500,000, for critical support to State, local and regional partners to advance health care system preparedness and response. Locally-based Health Response. \u2014The Committee recognizes the lack of essential health services is often a significant impediment to economic development and prosperity for low-income commu- VerDate Sep 11 2014 rural areas and regions of persistent poverty. Stra- tegically placed and locally driven health response stations could help these communities overcome barriers. The Committee encour-ages ASPR to address health disparities in emergency health re-sponse. National Special Pathogen System. \u2014The Committee recognizes that our national health care readiness capacity and capabilities were severely tested by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee commends ASPR for establishing the National Special Pathogen System of Care (NSPS), working with the National Emerging Spe-cial Pathogens Training and Education Center (NETEC) to set the NSPS strategy and implementation plan. To ensure coordination, the Committee directs NETEC to serve as the coordinating body. The Committee includes $8,000,000, an increase of $3,000,000, for the NETEC. In addition, given the knowledge and expertise gen-erated over the course of the pandemic, now is an opportune time to expand the regional network to include additional centers with a proven track record in combatting emerging infectious diseases. To that end, the Committee includes $31,000,000, an increase of $25,000,000, to increase the number of Regional Ebola and Other Special Pathogen Treatment Centers (RESPTCs) to improve pre-paredness for future pandemic threats. The RESPTC expansion shall be a competitive process and health care entities applying to join the RESPTC system must demonstrate a commitment to health equity and delivery of health care services to diverse and under-served low-income populations; an emphasis on population health; the capacity to serve pediatric patients; and the ability to translate lessons observed and health systems research into action-able health care emergency response implementation plans. The Committee requests both a written report and a briefing, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, on progress in establishing a robust NSPS and integrating NSPS with other health care delivery sys-tems of care for emergencies, such as the trauma system. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority The Committee includes $823,380,000, an increase of $226,680,000, for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Develop-ment Authority (BARDA). BARDA, through the Strategic Investor Program and other efforts, supports the advanced development of vaccines, drugs, and therapeutics for potential serious public health threats, including chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, pandemic influenza, and emerging and re-emerging infec-tious diseases. BARDA has played an essential role in the response to COVID-19. The Committee encourages BARDA to expand its portfolio of partnerships for broader success. Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. \u2014The Committee is concerned with the national security risk of our increased reliance on foreign- based sources of active pharmaceutical ingredients, their chemical components, and off-shore drug production. The Committee recog-nizes the importance of domestic drug manufacturing and onshore production of medicine and provided supplemental emergency fund-ing in pandemic relief legislation to support increased U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities. The successful work of BARDA in ad-dressing public health vulnerabilities and securing a national stockpile of drugs has unique potential to consider program expan- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 at-risk drug ingredients. The Committee urges BARDA to engage in public-private partnerships for U.S.-based ad-vanced manufacturing for active pharmaceutical ingredients includ-ing their chemical precursors for the Strategic National Stockpile. The Committee directs BARDA to provide a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act detailing their efforts to promote domestic drug manufacturing, including efforts during the COVID-19 public health emergency, and recommendations for Congress to support onshore pharmaceutical production. Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Technologies. \u2014The Committee encourages BARDA to support the research, develop-ment and facilitation of novel pharmaceutical manufacturing tech-nologies that provide flexible systems for the production of medical countermeasures at a lower cost than traditional manufacturing processes, including technologies that utilize agricultural cell line development. The Committee urges BARDA to partner with domes-tic manufacturers to bolster U.S. supply chains to enhance our do-mestic capacity to respond to a variety of new threats more effec-tively in the future. At-Home Rapid COVID Tests. \u2014The Committee urges BARDA to continue efforts on Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) to continue innovation to make at-home rapid COVID tests accessible. Broad Spectrum Antimicrobials and CARB-X. \u2014The Committee urges the Secretary to update the scope of support for the CARB- X program to include pathogens listed in the 2019 CDC Antibiotic Resistant Threats report, which includes products that target fungal pathogens. BARDA's Broad Spectrum Antimicrobials pro-gram is developing medical countermeasures that counter identi-fied biothreats and address healthcare and community-acquired multi-drug resistant pathogens.These programs leverage public/pri-vate partnerships to develop products that directly support the gov-ernment wide National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Re-sistant Bacteria and have a proven track record in developing new FDA approved antibiotics. Ebola. \u2014The Committee recognizes BARDA's efforts to address the threat of Ebola with an active portfolio of therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines. Pathogen-Reduced Red Blood Cell Technology .\u2014The Committee recognizes BARDA's investments for clinical trial development of nucleic acid targeted pathogen reduction technology to improve red blood cell transfusion safety. Such investments will ensure protec-tion for blood products in the nation's blood supply. The Committee requests an update of these activities in the fiscal year 2023 Con-gressional Budget Justification. Strengthening Domestic Medical Manufacturing and Produc- tion.\u2014The Committee is concerned about the nation's limited infra- structure to produce essential products such as medical devices, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and personal protective equipment. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the weak-nesses in the U.S. supply chain and the dependence of the U.S. healthcare system on other countries. The Committee remains con-cerned that there could be shortages of products and components, including elastomeric components. The Committee is also con-cerned about the emergence of counterfeit personal protective equipment products. This is a safety and public health risk. The VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Committee recognizes the importance of domestic manufacturing and raw materials, supported by $10,000,000,000 in the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) for the Defense Production Act, and urges HHS to undertake efforts to ensure a long-term sustainable domes-tic supply chain for medical products. Use of Funds. \u2014The Committee awaits the results of the HHS in- ternal review of the use of advanced research and development funding, and the external audit of the use of ASPR funds for ad-ministrative services. The Committee requests a briefing on the findings, recommendations, and corrective action plan no later than 30 days after enactment of this Act. Policy and Planning The Committee includes $19,917,000, an increase of $5,040,000, for Policy and Planning. The Office of Policy and Planning leads the Department's emergency preparedness and response strategic direction and policy coordination. Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund The Committee includes $770,000,000 for Project BioShield. These funds support the acquisition of promising medical counter-measures developed through BARDA contracts for the most serious public health threats. Strategic National Stockpile The Committee includes $905,000,000, an increase of $200,000,000, for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). In addi-tion, the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) included up to $16,000,000,000 and the Coronavirus Response Relief Supplemental Appropria-tions Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260) included $3,250,000,000 for the SNS. CDC Engagement. \u2014The Committee directs ASPR to support the significant role of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the SNS by providing scientific expertise in decision-making re-lated to procurement of countermeasures, and maintaining strong relationships with State and local public health departments to fa-cilitate efficient deployment of countermeasures in public health emergencies. COVID-19 Variant Therapeutics. \u2014The Committee recognizes that COVID-19 variants present a public health challenge even as more Americans become vaccinated. The Committee encourages the SNS to have a sufficient stockpile of monoclonal antibody thera-peutics for the treatment of COVID-19 emerging variants, and strongly encourages the acquisition of therapeutics that will pro-vide effective treatment for the broadest possible range of new variants. Influenza Antivirals. \u2014The Committee remains concerned about the perennial threat of pandemic influenza. In addition to vaccines, antivirals are a critical medical countermeasure. Currently, the SNS includes only one type of influenza antiviral. The Committee urges ASPR to review this strategy. Re-Envisioning the Strategic National Stockpile. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the mission and operations of the SNS. Early in the pandemic, there was extensive confusion about the role of the SNS, the content of the SNS inventory, and policies and proc-esses for distribution of SNS inventory. The U.S. must maintain VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul transparent, elastic, and highly available health assets, medical countermeasures framework and associated supply chains to effec-tively plan and respond as needed. The Committee is aware of cur-rent review efforts being conducted by the HHS Office of Inspector General, Government Accountability Office, and non-governmental entities. To benefit from these external reviews and to improve ef-forts, the Committee directs the Secretary to engage in a re-envi-sioning process considering a variety of topics including real-time inventory transparency; data and analytics to enhance evidenced- based policy decisions and risk mitigation strategies; elasticity to readily scale responses; modeling and simulation to plan and exer-cise; supply chain risk management, including the identification and mitigation of over-reliance on foreign sources of critical sup-plies; and revolving management of inventory. The Committee re-quests a report and briefing on these efforts, including a timeline of key activities and an update on activities required by Executive Order 14001 within 60 days of enactment of this Act. Saline. \u2014The Committee encourages the review of the stockpile quantity of normal IV saline and related medical supplies, and to include an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Strategic National Stockpile Supplies. \u2014Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, and monthly thereafter until the public health emergency related to COVID-19 is no longer in effect, the Secretary shall report to the Committee on the current inventory of ventilators and personal protective equipment in the SNS, including the numbers of face shields, gloves, goggles and glasses, gowns, head covers, masks, and respirators, as well as deployment of ventilators and personal protective equipment dur-ing the previous month, reported by State and other jurisdiction. Further, the Committee directs the Assistant Secretary to ensure that the working group under section 319F(a) of the Public Health Service Act and the Public Health Emergency Medical Counter-measures Enterprise (PHEMCE) established under section 2811-1 of such Act includes expenditures necessary to maintain the min-imum level of relevant supplies in the SNS, including in case of a significant pandemic, in the yearly submission of the PHEMCE multi-year budget. Medical Reserve Corps The Committee includes $6,240,000, an increase of $240,000, for the Medical Reserve Corps program, which is a network of local volunteers made up of doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and other community members who work to strengthen the public health infrastructure and preparedness capabilities of their com-munities. Preparedness and Response Innovation The Committee provides $4,000,000, an increase of $2,000,000, for a bilateral cooperative program with the Government of Israel for the development of health technologies. Cybersecurity The Committee provides $159,116,000, an increase of $101,296,000, for information technology cybersecurity in the Office VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Information Officer and HHS-wide to strengthen the Department's cybersecurity posture. The Committee does not in-clude funding to continue HHS Protect, as capabilities shall no longer be duplicated at the Departmental level or shall be dele-gated to the appropriate operating division. Office of National Security The Committee provides $8,983,000, an increase of $473,000, for the Office of National Security to maintain the security of the De-partment's personnel, systems, and critical infrastructure. Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health The Committee provides $17,000,000 for preparedness and readi- ness. Interagency COVID-19 Testing Strategy. \u2014The Committee pro- vided significant investments for COVID-19 testing in multiple supplemental appropriations bills, including the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2), and understands a robust COVID-19 testing strategy is necessary for sustained normalcy and to prevent and re-spond to future outbreaks. Therefore, the Committee urges HHS to develop an interagency testing strategy. Recognizing the impor-tance of partnerships and coordination across agencies, and the vital accomplishments of the Testing and Diagnostics Working Group, including the Industry Engagement and Industrial Base Ex-pansion teams, coordination across HHS and with other depart-ments is necessary to ensure corresponding comprehensive guid-ance. Readiness and Training Programs. \u2014The Committee requests an assessment of HHS deployable personnel, including but not limited to Public Health Service Commission Corps Officers and National Disaster Medical System intermittent personnel. The assessment should include the coordination of established forces and identifica-tion of remaining gaps. The report is to be submitted with the fis-cal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Pandemic Influenza Preparedness The Committee includes $335,000,000, an increase of $48,000,000, for the pandemic influenza preparedness program. This funding supports efforts to modernize influenza research and development of vaccines and the next-generation influenza medical countermeasures, preparedness testing and evaluation, and stock-piling, as well as critical domestic vaccine manufacturing infra-structure.

TITLE III\u2014DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EDUCATION FOR THE DISADVANTAGED Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $17,226,790,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 36,756,790,000 Change from ......................................................... +19,530,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5490,000,000 This account provides foundational funding to help ensure all children receive a fair, equitable and high-quality education. Of the total amount available, $25,813,490,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2022 for obligation on or after July 1, 2023 and $10,841,177,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2022 for obligation on or after October 1, 2023. Grants to Local Educational Agencies For fiscal year 2022, the Committee recommends $36,036,802,000 for Title I grants to LEAs, an increase of $19,500,000,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $500,000,000 below the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Title I is the cornerstone of federal K- 12 education programs and critical to the nation's collective efforts to ensure that every child has the opportunity to obtain a high- quality education. The program serves an estimated 25 million stu-dents in nearly 90 percent of school districts and nearly 60 percent of all public schools. Providing additional resources so that children can succeed in school and in life is one of the Committee's highest priorities in the bill. Of the amounts provided for Title I programs, $6,459,401,000 is available for Basic Grants to Local Educational Agencies (LEAs or school districts), which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. Basic grants are awarded to school districts with at least 10 low-income children who make up more than two percent of the school-age population. Within the amount for Title I Basic Grants, up to $5,000,000 is made available to the Secretary of Education (Secretary) on Octo- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 to obtain annually-updated LEA-level poverty data from the Bureau of the Census. The Committee recommends $1,362,301,000 for Title I Con- centration Grants, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level. Concentration Grants target funds to school districts in which the number of low-income children exceeds 6,500 or 15 per-cent of the total school age population. The Committee recommends $14,107,550,000 for Title I Targeted Grants, which is $9,750,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. Targeted Grants provide higher payments to school districts with high numbers or percentages of low-income students. The Committee recommends $14,107,550,000 for Title I Edu- cation Finance Incentive Grants (EFIGs) which is $9,750,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. EFIGs provide payments to States and school districts that incorporate equity and effort fac-tors to improve the equity of State funding systems. Equity. \u2014The Committee is supportive of the fiscal year 2022 budget request's goals of improving educator compensation, ex-panding access to high-quality pre-K, and improving the equity and adequacy of State and local school finance systems. In addition, the Committee strongly supports the Department's efforts to close funding gaps between high- and low-poverty school districts and schools. The Committee agrees there is merit in exploring how State and local funding structures impact school resource equity, which approaches have most effectively decreased inequities, and what reforms could help further address longstanding equity and opportunity gaps experienced by students from low-income back-grounds and students of color in high-poverty districts and schools. The Committee therefore encourages the Department to continue its efforts in this area and to develop further recommendations, in-cluding recommendations on effective methods for promoting a more equitable distribution of State and local funds. Reservation for Homeless Students. \u2014The Committee urges that the Department support LEAs' development of plans under section 1112(b)(6) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) that describe the amount of funds for homeless students reserved under section 1113(c)(3)(A) of the ESEA, how such amount was de-termined, and the amount of the prior year's reservation that was spent on homeless students. The Committee further urges that the Department support SEAs' development of plans under section 1111(g)(1)(F) of the ESEA that describe how the SEA will monitor the amount and use of funds reserved for homeless students under section 1113(c)(3)(A) and provide technical assistance to assist LEAs in effectively using such funds to support homeless students. Diverse Texts in School Libraries. \u2014The Committee believes that all students should be able to access texts that reflect their inter-ests and diverse cultures. Unfortunately, too many Black, Latino, Asian-American, and Native students are unable to access such books and printed materials in their classrooms and school librar-ies. To address this challenge, the Committee supports classroom and school libraries that seek to include content that reflects the history and diversity of their student populations. School Names. \u2014The Committee supports efforts by school dis- tricts that are home to populations of Latino, Black, Asian-Amer-ican, and Native students to ensure public schools reflect the diver- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 of their districts, which may extend to the naming of schools to highlight the achievements of members from Latino, Black, Asian-American, and Native communities. History and Cultural Contributions of Racial and Ethnic Minori- ties.\u2014The Committee recognizes the increasing diversity of student populations attending K-12 public schools in the United States, and the value in developing curricula that fully capture the history and cultural contributions of racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. The Committee supports efforts by the Department to provide technical assistance to K-12 public schools and educators inter-ested in developing such courses and curricula for their students. The Committee also supports efforts by the Department to provide technical assistance around professional development for K-12 edu-cators to develop, implement, and teach these emerging curricula using research-based, culturally responsive teaching methods and best practices. The Committee recognizes that well-taught and well-designed courses highlighting the history and cultural con-tributions of diverse populations provide academic benefits to all students and contribute to students' sense of self and belonging in school. Military Student Identifier. \u2014The Committee notes that the ESEA recognizes military-connected students as a distinct sub-group of students. More than 80 percent of military-connected chil-dren attend public schools. Students with parents/guardians who serve full-time in the military move and change schools frequently. In addition, they may experience trauma resulting from separa-tions from a parent/guardian due to their parents' service to the U.S. Military. The Military Student Identifier provides educators, school leaders, and policymakers with critical information to per-sonalize attention and direct resources to better support military dependent children. Current law directs the Military Student Iden-tifier toward the children of active duty families, leaving out the nearly one-half million children of the reserve component, both Na-tional Guard and Reserves. The Committee supports efforts to ad-dress the unique needs of children whose parents/guardians serve in the National Guard and reserve components. Transportation and School Improvement. \u2014The Committee recog- nized a longstanding barrier to the implementation of strategies to increase student diversity as a means of school improvement in the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2019 when it re-moved two decades-old prohibitions on the use of Federal funds for transportation costs to carry out school desegregation efforts. Sub-sequently, in the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2021, the Committee removed the last of these long-standing prohi-bitions in the Federal code in the General Education Provisions Act. With the recent removal of these prohibitions, the Committee is concerned many States and districts may be unaware of their ability to use ESEA funding to support voluntary school integration efforts. In response, the Committee directs the Department to pro-vide technical assistance to school districts regarding the use of school improvement funds under Title I, Part A for transportation to support voluntary school integration efforts. Comprehensive and Targeted Support and Improvement. \u2014The Committee notes that an increase in Title I funding overall also in-creases aid for the Section 1003 Title I set-aside which provides VerDate Sep 11 2014 for schools identified for comprehensive and targeted sup- port and improvement. The Committee notes that funds under Sec-tion 1003 can be used to support socioeconomic and racial integra-tion in schools as an evidence-based strategy to improve schools identified for improvement under ESEA. The Committee encour-ages the Department to provide technical assistance to school dis-tricts on how Section 1003 funds can be used to make progress on these critical goals. Increasing Equity in Advanced Coursework. \u2014Research shows that Black, Latino, and Native American students, students with disabilities, and students from low-income families are underrep-resented in advanced programs and courses (gifted and talented, advanced placement, international baccalaureate, honors courses, dual enrollment). A major barrier for these students is the over-re-liance on subjective criteria not proven to predict course success. The Committee is encouraged by recent State and district actions to lessen these disparities, including the implementation of open enrollment, automatic enrollment for students who have dem-onstrated readiness, and/or universal screening for gifted and tal-ented programs. The Committee notes that funds under ESEA may be used to implement open enrollment, automatic enrollment, and/ or universal screening practices; as well as use these funds to in-crease course access and success, provide coaching and training for educators, purchase materials, and/or cover exam fees for under-represented students. To ensure these resources advance student outcomes for historically undeserved students, the Committee en-courages the Department to resume collecting data on passing rates for all Advanced Placement subject areas. Comprehensive Literacy Development Grants The Committee recommends $192,000,000 for Comprehensive Literacy Development Grants, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the 2022 budget request. Funds are award-ed to States to subgrant to school districts and/or early education programs to improve literacy instruction for disadvantaged stu-dents. Innovative Approaches to Literacy The Committee recommends $31,000,000 for Innovative Ap- proaches to Literacy (IAL), which is $3,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 request. IAL funds support competitive grants to school libraries and national not-for- profit organizations to provide books and literacy activities to chil-dren and families in high-need communities. Underserved Urban School Districts. \u2014The Committee directs the Department in the fiscal year 2022 competition to continue prioritizing underserved communities in urban school districts in which students from low-income families make up at least 50 per-cent of enrollment. State Agency Programs: Migrant The Committee recommends $382,626,000 for the State Agency Program for Migrant Education, which is $7,000,000 above the fis-cal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 request. This program supports special educational and related services for chil- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul of migrant agricultural workers and fishermen, including: (1) supplementary academic education; (2) remedial or compensatory instruction; (3) English for limited English proficient students; (4) testing; (5) guidance counseling; and (6) other activities to promote coordination of services across States for migrant children whose education is interrupted by frequent moves. State Agency Programs: Neglected and Delinquent For the State Agency Program for Neglected and Delinquent Children, the Committee recommends $48,239,000, the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 request. This formula grant program supports educational services for children and youth under age 21 in State-run institutions, attending com-munity day programs, and in correctional facilities. A portion of these funds is provided for projects that support the successful re- entry of youth from the criminal justice system into postsecondary and vocational programs. Special Programs for Migrant Students The Committee recommends $66,123,000 for the Special Pro- grams for Migrant Students, which is $20,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budg-et request. These programs make grants to colleges, universities, and nonprofit organizations to support educational programs de-signed for students who are engaged in migrant and other seasonal farm work. The High School Equivalency Program (HEP) recruits migrant students age 16 and over and provides academic and sup-port services to help those students obtain a high school equiva-lency certificate and subsequently to gain employment or admission to a postsecondary institution or training program. The College As-sistance Migrant Program (CAMP) provides tutoring and coun-seling services to first-year, undergraduate migrant students and assists those students in obtaining student financial aid for their remaining undergraduate years. IMPACT AID Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $1,501,112,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 1,552,112,000 Change from ......................................................... +51,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +11,000,000 This account supports payments to school districts affected by Federal activities, such as those that educate children whose fami-lies are connected with the military or who live on Indian land. Basic Support Payments The Committee recommends $1,404,242,000 for Basic Support Payments to LEAs, which is $50,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. Basic Support Payments compensate school districts for lost tax revenue and are made on behalf of Federally-connected chil-dren, such as children of members of the uniformed services who live on Federal property. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul for Children with Disabilities The Committee recommends $48,316,000 for Payments for Chil- dren with Disabilities, which is the same as both the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. These payments compensate school districts for the increased costs of serving Federally-connected children with disabilities. Facilities Maintenance The Committee recommends $4,835,000 for Facilities Mainte- nance, which is the same as both the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. These capital payments are authorized for maintenance of certain facilities owned by the Department. Construction The Committee recommends $17,406,000 for the Construction program, which is the same as both the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Funding is allocated by formula to eligible LEAs for school construction activities under section 7007(b) of ESEA. Payments for Federal Property The Committee recommends $77,313,000 for Payments for Fed- eral Property, which is $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Funds are awarded to school districts to compensate for lost tax revenue as the result of Federal acquisition of real property since 1938. Data for Eligible Communities. \u2014The reporting method used to calculate the amount of Impact Aid a school receives is critical to ensuring accurate data for eligible communities. Correct student counts ensure adequate resources are provided for students. The Committee appreciates the Department's assessment of Impact Aid surveying flexibilities for the 2020-2021 school year included in the fiscal year 2022 Congressional Budget Justification and requests that the Department assess the merits of such flexibilities in future years, along with other potential process modifications, in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. In addition, the Committee requests recommendations for helping LEAs plan for discrepancies between estimated and actual award levels. SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $5,444,217,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 5,803,539,000 Change from ......................................................... +359,322,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +270,864,000 The Committee recommendation includes $5,803,539,000 for the School Improvement Programs account. Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants The Committee recommends $2,293,080,000 for Supporting Effec- tive Instruction State Grants (Title II-A), which is $150,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $144,500,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Title II-A grants provide States and school districts with a flexible source of funding to VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul strengthen the skills and knowledge of teachers, principals, and ad- ministrators to enable them to improve student achievement. Whole Child Professional Development. \u2014The Committee notes that Title II, Part A funds can be targeted toward effective prepa-ration and professional development designs that enable teachers and school leaders to expand their knowledge and skills regarding the sciences of child and adolescent learning and development, in-cluding teaching challenging content, teaching diverse learners, and supporting social-emotional and academic development in cul-turally and linguistically responsive ways. Materials from Teacher Professional Development. \u2014Given the importance of funds under Title II, Part A in helping teachers ad-vance their own professional development and meet the needs of their students, the Committee encourages the Department to issue guidance clarifying allowable uses of funds. Teachers often take professional development training that, in turn, requires access to additional funding for instructional materials to be able to utilize their training in the classroom. But the funding streams for profes-sional development and associated instructional materials are mis-aligned, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, which can result in teachers participating in profes-sional development programs that they are unable to share with their students. The Committee supports efforts by the Secretary to offer guidance on how an LEA may use Title II, Part A funds on instructional materials that are directly connected to teacher pro-fessional development training. In addition, the Committee notes the benefits of posting guidance online and communicating about guidance with outside stakeholders, particularly district super-intendents. Supplemental Education Grants The Committee recommends $23,021,000 for Supplemental Edu- cation Grants to the Federated States of Micronesia and the Re-public of the Marshall Islands, which is $6,322,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $3,364,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-188) authorizes these entities to receive funding for general education assistance. The Committee provides sufficient funding to meet authorized funding levels estab-lished in P.L. 108-188. Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers The Committee recommends $1,359,673,000 for Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers, $100,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $50,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Funds are awarded by formula to States, which in turn distribute funds on a competitive basis to local school districts, nonprofit organizations, and other public enti-ties. The Committee notes that only one in three 21st Century Com- munity Learning Centers grant applications is awarded, reflecting substantial unmet demand for these opportunities. The $100,000,000 increase over fiscal year 2021 will help communities providing afterschool programs serve 120,000 more students than in fiscal year 2021. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Assessments The Committee recommends $378,000,000 for State Assessments, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fis-cal year 2022 budget request. Funds are available to develop and implement academic standards and assessments. The program in-cludes a set-aside for audits to identify and eliminate low-quality or duplicative assessments. Education for Homeless Children and Youth The Committee recommends $116,500,000 for the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program, which is $10,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Grants are allocated to States in proportion to the total each State receives under the Title I program. Training and Advisory Services The Committee recommends $6,575,000 for Training and Advi- sory Services authorized by Title IV-A of the Civil Rights Act, which is the same as both the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Title IV-A authorizes technical assistance and training services for school districts to address prob-lems associated with desegregation on the basis of race, sex, or na-tional origin. The Department awards three-year grants to regional Equity Assistance Centers (EACs) located in each of the 10 Depart-ment of Education regions. The EACs provide services to school districts upon request. Typical activities include disseminating in-formation on successful education practices and legal requirements related to nondiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, and national origin in educational programs. Countering Anti-Semitism .\u2014The Committee supports efforts by the Department to ensure the services available through EACs in-clude training, developing materials, strategies, and professional development activities to assist schools and communities in pre-venting and countering anti-Semitic harassment. Education for Native Hawaiians The Committee recommends $40,397,000 for the Education for Native Hawaiian program, which is $3,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Funds are used to provide competitive awards for supplemental education services to the Native Hawaiian population. Alaska Native Education Equity The Committee recommends $36,453,000 for the Alaska Native Education Equity program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Funds are used to provide competitive awards for supplemental education services to the Alaska Native population. Rural Education The Committee recommends $192,840,000 for Rural Education programs, which is $5,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. There are two dedicated programs to assist rural school districts with improving teaching and learning in their schools: the Small, VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Rural Schools Achievement program, which provides funds to rural districts that serve a small number of students; and the Rural and Low-Income Schools program, which provides funds to rural dis-tricts that serve concentrations of poor students, regardless of the number of students served by the district. Funds appropriated for Rural Education shall be divided equally between these two pro-grams. Comprehensive Centers The Committee recommends $52,000,000 for Comprehensive Centers, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Comprehensive Cen-ters program includes support for regional centers that provide training, technical assistance, and professional development to build State capacity to provide high-quality education to all stu-dents. The Committee notes the critical role Comprehensive Cen-ters play in helping States vet evidence and strategies to imple-ment ESEA and provide children with a high-quality education. Student Support and Academic Enrichment State Grants The Committee recommends $1,305,000,000 for Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE) State Grants, which is $85,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. SSAE grants provide SEAs and LEAs with flexible resources that provide students with access to a well- rounded education, including rigorous coursework, and improve school conditions and the use of technology. Arts and Entertainment Pipeline Programs .\u2014The Committee en- courages the Department to work with States and school districts that serve diverse youth to explore using SSAE funding to support and create youth pipeline programs in the arts and entertainment industries. The Committee is aware of programs that focus on clos-ing student opportunity gaps by bringing filmmakers into Title I schools to partner with teachers to expand access to the arts, im-plement social and emotional learning strategies, and support rig-orous academic curricula. A 2019 evaluation by the Stanford Cen-ter for Assessment, Learning, and Equity found that such pro-grams create a positive environment and learning community, pro-mote active and social learning, provide in-depth instruction of vo-cabulary practices, and cultivate social and emotional learning competencies. Accelerated Learning Programs .\u2014The Committee supports efforts by States and LEAs to increase diversity in accelerated student learning programs, such as advanced placement courses, gifted and talented classes and honors programs. The Committee supports the use of ESEA funding to create State or local equity offices. Equity offices could evaluate current data on the students enrolled in ac-celerated student learning programs and use such data to inform recommendations to LEAs on how to improve the diversity of those programs. The Committee recognizes that Black, Latino, and Na-tive students, students living in poverty, and English Learners are historically underrepresented in accelerated learning programs. Re-search shows that developing targeted recruitment and outreach plans, as well as universal screening for talented and gifted pro-grams help address inequitable access that lock students out of op- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul engage them more meaningfully in school and ex- pand their postsecondary success. Menstrual Health .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the dis- ruptions to educational opportunities that children living in period poverty experience. Industry reports found that one in five school age children have missed school due to lack of access to safe and affordable menstrual products. The Committee directs the Sec-retary to provide technical assistance to LEAs and SEAs on effec-tive strategies for offering information about free menstrual prod-uct programs, as an option for safe and healthy student program-ming under SSAE. Safe and Healthy Learning Environments .\u2014The Committee con- tinues to note that SEAs and LEAs can use SSAE funds for activi-ties that contribute to a well-rounded education, including supports for safe, culturally responsive classroom communities. The Com-mittee also notes that SSAE funds can support implementation of the effective community school model by using funds for desig-nating a site resource coordinator at a school or LEA, expanding school-based mental health services, and providing integrated sys-tems of student and family support. The Committee believes the use of funds on strategies that improve school climate are vital in reducing harmful, disproportionate suspensions, expulsions, and ar-rests of students of color. Computer Science and Art .\u2014The Committee notes that States and school districts may use funds available under the SSAE grant program to strengthen instruction in science, technology, engineer-ing, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) fields, including computer science, and improve access to Pre-K 12 computer science and STEAM programming for underserved students, such as minorities, girls, and youth from families living at or below the poverty line. The Committee recognizes that supporting education in the STEAM fields, particularly computer science, is critical to ensuring that our nation continues to lead in innovation. As computer science is a basic skill in the 21st century global economy, the Committee intends for investments in Title IV-A to reduce the computer science enrollment and achievement gaps. School Diversity .\u2014The Committee strongly encourages the De- partment to use the two percent set-aside for technical assistance and capacity building under SSAE to award capacity-building grants to LEAs and SEAs to reduce racial and socioeconomic seg-regation across and within school districts. INDIAN EDUCATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $181,239,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 187,739,000 Change from ......................................................... +6,500,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +1,500,000 This account supports programs authorized by part A of title VI of the ESEA. Grants to Local Educational Agencies The Committee recommends $110,381,000 for Grants to Local Educational Agencies, which is $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and same as the fiscal year 2022 budget re- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 quest. This program provides assistance through formula grants to school districts and schools supported or operated by the Bureau of Indian Education. The purpose of this program is to improve ele-mentary and secondary school programs that serve American In-dian students, including preschool children. Grantees must develop a comprehensive plan and ensure that the programs they carry out will help Indian students reach the same challenging standards that apply to all students. This program supplements the regular school program to help American Indian children sharpen their academic skills, bolster their self-confidence, and participate in en-richment activities that would otherwise be unavailable. Special Programs for Indian Children The Committee recommends $67,993,000 for Special Programs for Indian Children, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. These pro-grams make competitive awards to improve the quality of edu-cation for American Indian students. The program also funds the American Indian Teacher Corps and the American Indian Adminis-trator Corps to recruit and support American Indians as teachers and school administrators. National Activities The Committee recommends $9,365,000 for National Activities, which is $1,500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The fiscal year 2022 increase to National Activities is directed to support the Department's Na-tive American language immersion grant program and to the State- Tribal Education Partnership program. Within this account, funding is provided for grants to Tribes for education administrative planning, development, and coordination, grants to support Native language immersion schools and pro-grams. Funds under this authority also support research, evalua-tion and data collection to provide information about the edu-cational status of Indian students and the effectiveness of Indian education programs. INNOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $1,114,250,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 1,385,286,000 Change from ......................................................... +271,036,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +101,036,000 The Committee recommends $1,385,286,000 for programs within the Innovation and Improvement account. Education Innovation and Research The Committee recommends $254,000,000 for the Education In- novation and Research (EIR) program, which is $60,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program makes competitive grants to support the replication and scaling-up of evidence-based education innovations. Social and Emotional Learning .\u2014Within the total for EIR, the agreement includes $112,000,000, $45 million above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level, to provide grants for social and emotional VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul and provide evidence-based, field-ini- tiated innovations that address student social, emotional, and cog-nitive needs. A 2019 National Commission on Social, Emotional and Academic Development report chronicles decades of research showing ''that the social, emotional, and cognitive dimensions of learning are deeply linked'' and that educating the whole student involves integrating and sustaining these dimensions throughout the day. In addition, the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning found that students who received SEL inter-ventions showed lasting positive impacts on variables such as high school graduation rates and college attendance and lower likelihoods of being arrested or being diagnosed with a clinical mental health disorder. Further, RAND Corporation finds that there are at least 60 SEL interventions that have been evaluated and that meet the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) evidence re-quirements. The Committee is encouraged by the robust, growing evidence base behind SEL strategies, trauma-informed services, and whole child approaches to learning, and makes funding for these inter-ventions a top priority. Children across the country have been sig-nificantly impacted by disruptions related to COVID-19. The in-crease to EIR in fiscal year 2022 for SEL is intended to address these concerns and provide additional support for the SEL initia-tive, which can include trauma-informed practices and services within schools. To fulfill the SEL set-aside, the Committee urges prioritization of SEL or both the early- and mid-phase evidence tiers. The Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this Act on plans for carrying out the SEL competition. In addi-tion, the Department shall provide notice to the Committees at least seven days before grantees are announced. STEAM and Computer Science .\u2014In addition, within the total for EIR, the Committee recommendation includes $82,000,000 for States, school districts, and school-based afterschool programs to provide or strengthen instruction in STEAM fields, including com-puter science, $15 million above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. Within the STEAM and computer science set-aside, awards should expand opportunities for underrepresented students such as mi-norities, girls, and youth from families living at or below the pov-erty line to help reduce the enrollment and achievement gap. Publicizing Research Findings .\u2014Given the significant Federal in- vestment in the EIR program (and its predecessor program, Invest-ing in Innovation), the Committee encourages the Department to take stronger steps to publicly release and widely publicize the re-search findings from this critical program. More specifically, the Department is encouraged to post research findings on its own website and issue related press releases and Dear Colleague let-ters. The Department is also encouraged to provide summaries of the research findings to the Committees on Appropriations. The Committee encourages the Secretary to better showcase those pro-grams that have demonstrated, through rigorous research as re-quired by the ESEA, that their innovations show specific evidence of achievement in educational outcomes. The Department is also encouraged to communicate any research findings that dem-onstrate successful outcomes to outside stakeholders, particularly VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul State school officers and district superintendents. The Com- mittee believes that publicizing these research findings will provide critical information for State governments, State and local edu-cation agencies, and others, particularly in unserved and under-served communities. Educator Preparation .\u2014Within EIR, the Committee is supportive of efforts to provide grants to eligible institutions that will seek to reform educator preparation at institutions of higher education for preservice teachers and leaders or to reform professional develop-ment for current educators by applying research about student learning and development to their preparation and professional de-velopment. The Committee is supportive of efforts for grantees to develop partnerships between state education agencies, the Bureau of Indian Education or high-need local education agencies and in-stitutions of higher education with educator preparation programs. Teacher and School Leader Incentive Grants The Committee recommends $200,000,000 for the Teacher and School Leader Incentive Grants program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. This program provides grants to States, school districts, and partnerships to develop, implement, improve, or expand human capital management systems or performance-based compensation systems in schools. American History and Civics Academies The Committee recommends $6,500,000 for American History and Civics Academies, which is $3,250,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. American History and Civics National Activities The Committee recommends $4,000,000 for American History and Civics National Activities, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. Diverse Representations in History .\u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of incorporating diverse stories of American history and leaders that have been absent in history and civics education. Accurate portrayals of history that include diverse representation are essential for combating stereotypes and myths about racial and ethnic groups. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Depart-ment to promote diversity in the teaching of American history and civics programs. Supporting Effective Educator Development The Committee recommends $90,000,000 for the Supporting Ef- fective Educator Development (SEED) grant program, which is $10,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. SEED provides competitive grants to support alternative certification and other professional development and enrichment activities for teachers, principals, and other school leaders. Funds are included to fully support continuation costs for grants made in prior years. SEL and Whole Child Education .\u2014Within SEED, the Depart- ment is directed to support professional development that helps VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul incorporate SEL practices into teaching, and to support pathways into teaching that provide a strong foundation in child development and learning, including skills for implementing SEL strategies in the classroom. The Committee is supportive of the De-partment's competitive preference priority for SEL in the fiscal year 2020 SEED competition and directs the Department to include a similar competitive preference priority in any new SEED com-petition in fiscal year 2022. The Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this Act on plans for carrying out the SEL competitive pref-erence priority in SEED. In addition, the Department shall provide notice to the Committees at least seven days before grantees are announced. Diverse Entities .\u2014The Committee encourages the Department to ensure that SEED grants are awarded to a diverse set of eligible entities, including national nonprofit organizations implementing evidence-based activities (as defined in section 8101(21)(A)(i) of the ESEA) across a number of sites which can help bring to scale evi-dence-based programs of national significance across the country. Computer Science and Native Students .\u2014The Committee encour- ages the Department, through the SEED program, to fund projects that increase the number of teachers with computer science certifi-cations with a priority to increase the number of such teachers in rural public schools and public schools serving high percentages of Native students. Charter Schools Grants The Committee recommends $400,000,000 for Charter School Program (CSP) Grants, which is $40,000,000 below the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. CSP awards grants to SEAs or, if a State's SEA chooses not to participate, to charter school developers to support the develop-ment and initial implementation of public charter schools. State Facilities Incentive Grants and Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities awards help charter schools obtain adequate school facilities. These programs work in tandem to support the de-velopment and operation of charter schools. For-profit Entities .\u2014The Committee is concerned by a recent re- port that identified more than 440 charter schools operated by for- profit entities that received CSP grants totaling approximately $158 million between 2006 and 2017. The Committee believes that Federal funding for K-12 education should strengthen and improve our public systems and should not enrich private entities with a profit motive. In response, the Committee includes new bill lan-guage preventing Federal funds from being awarded to charter schools run by for-profit entities. GAO Mandate from House Report 116-450 .\u2014The Committee is supportive of GAO's initial work on the mandate included in House Report 116-450 regarding the Department's oversight over CSP and whether the program is being implemented effectively among grantees and subgrantees. The Committee is particularly interested in the issue of CSP-funded schools that eventually closed or re-ceived funds but never opened; the relationships between charter schools supported by CSP grants and charter management organi-zations; and enrollment patterns at these schools, especially for VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul students with disabilities. In addition, the Committee is interested in recommendations on potential legislative changes to the pro-gram that would reduce the potential for mismanagement and inef-fective operations. Oversight from the Office of Inspector General .\u2014The Committee supports efforts by the Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) to examine grantee administration of Replication and Expan-sion Grants, including charter management organization grantees. The Committee also supports the OIG's efforts to evaluate whether the Department adequately monitored grantees' performance and uses of funds for CSP competitions. Charter School Effects on School Segregation .\u2014The Committee is concerned by findings from a 2019 Urban Institute report which concluded that growth in charter school enrollment increases the segregation of Black, Latino, and white students. To address this concern, the Committee urges the Department to give priority to applicants that plan to use CSP funds to operate or manage char-ter schools intentionally designed to be racially and socioeconomically diverse. National Activities .\u2014The Committee recognizes that one purpose of CSP is to evaluate the impact of charter schools on student achievement, families, and communities, and share best practices between charter schools and other public schools. The Committee encourages the Department to use funding within CSP National Activities to prepare a report summarizing grant recipients re-sponses to reporting requirements in ESEA, regarding the identi-fication or sharing of best practices between charter schools and other public schools, and the extent to which such practices were adopted and implemented by other public schools. The Committee encourages the Department to examine these responses in light of the student populations served. Students with Disabilities .\u2014The Committee encourages the De- partment to continue including in their evaluation of State CSP grants the extent to which State entities are utilizing the seven percent of funding received under the program to ensure that char-ter schools receiving CSP grants are equipped to appropriately serve students with disabilities and, by extension, prepared to be-come high-quality charter schools. Magnet Schools Assistance The Committee recommends $149,000,000 for the Magnet Schools Assistance program (MSAP), which is $40,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2021 budget request. This program makes competitive grants to support the establishment and operation of magnet schools that are a part of a court-ordered or Federally-approved voluntary de-segregation plan. Inter-district Magnet Schools .\u2014A 2019 report by Urban Institute finds that two-thirds of total school segregation in metropolitan areas is due to segregation between, rather than within, school dis-tricts. Consortia of LEAs and regional education services agencies are eligible to receive MSAP grants to establish magnet schools that address inter-district school segregation; however, the Com-mittee is concerned that these critical projects are infrequently funded. To address the urgent issue of inter-district segregation, VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 the Committee directs the Department to include a priority for ap- plicants seeking to establish new inter-district magnet schools. Whole School Magnet Programs .\u2014A recent Learning Policy Insti- tute report finds that whole school magnet programs are more ef-fective at fostering diversity than in-school magnet programs, which can create separate tracks and programs for different stu-dent populations. The Committee urges the Department to prioritize applicants seeking to establish and operate whole school magnet programs. Ready to Learn Programming The Committee recommends $31,776,000 for Ready to Learn Pro- gramming, which is $2,276,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program supports the development and distribution of educational video pro-gramming for preschool and elementary school children and their parents, caregivers, and teachers. Arts in Education The Committee recommends $33,000,000 for Arts in Education, which is $2,500,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program provides competitive grants to support professional development and the development of instructional materials and programming that integrate the arts into the curricula. Javits Gifted and Talented Education The Committee recommends $15,500,000 for the Javits Gifted and Talented Education Program, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Funds are awarded through grants and contracts to States, schools districts, and other organizations to support a co-ordinated program of research, demonstration projects, innovative strategies, and other activities to help schools identify gifted and talented students and address their unique educational needs. Underrepresented Populations .\u2014The Committee encourages the Department to use funds to increase the number of grants that as-sist schools in the identification of, and provision of services to, gifted and talented students who may not be identified and served through traditional assessment methods, such as children with dis-abilities, English learners, children of color, and economically dis-advantaged students. Statewide Family Engagement Centers The Committee recommends $13,500,000 for the Statewide Fam- ily Engagement Centers program, which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Funds are awarded through grants to organizations to pro-vide technical assistance and training to State and local edu-cational agencies in the implementation and enhancement of sys-temic and effective family engagement policies, programs, and ac-tivities that lead to improvements in student development and aca-demic achievement. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Diverse Schools The Committee includes $100,000,000 for a new competitive grant program, Fostering Diverse Schools, the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The program establishes competitive grants to local educational agencies and State educational agencies to reduce racial and socioeconomic segregation across and within school districts. A 2019 report by Urban Institute finds that two- thirds of total school segregation in metropolitan areas is due to segregation between, rather than within, school districts. In re-sponse to this concerning dynamic, the Committee directs the De-partment to prioritize resources to address segregation across dis-tricts. The Committee notes the promise of strategies and models such as inter-district magnet schools, voluntary two-way transfer programs between segregated districts, district regionalization, and regional education service agency governance structures. The State of School District Secessions .\u2014The Committee is con- cerned by research indicating that more than 128 school districts have attempted to break off, or ''secede'', from their school districts since the year 2000, and the likelihood of this trend increasing school segregation throughout the United States. The Committee, encourages the Department, in consultation with the Department of Justice, to issue a report describing the scope of the issue of school district ''secession'' and its impact on school segregation. Such a report could note which districts are party to federal deseg-regation orders and explain whether these secessions are in viola-tion of those orders. The report could also note what oversight ex- ists on the part of State agencies regarding school district secession in the States where they have occurred. Fund for the Improvement of Education The Committee includes $88,010,000 for early learning, elemen- tary, and secondary education activities. The bill includes funding for the following projects in the following amounts: Project Amount Achievable Dream, Newport News, VA for extended learning and whole child supports ............................. $900,000 Albright College, Reading, PA for STEAM learning ............................................................................... ......... 1,450,000 Aliento Education Fund, Mesa, AZ for student support and college access programs ............................... 300,000 An Achievable Dream Certified Academy at Highland Springs Elementary, Highland Springs, VA for stu- dent wrap-around services and supports ......................................................................................... ........ 1,500,000 Arab Community Center for Economic & Social Services, Dearborn, MI for integrated services, literacy education, and social and emotional learning ................................................................................... ...... 1,000,000 Austin People's Action Center, Chicago, IL for technology skills instruction ............................................... 450, 000 Bayshore Jointure Commission, Tinton Falls, NJ for a life skills and training program .............................. 60,000 Best Buddies International, Friday Harbor, WA for services for students with intellectual and develop- mental disabilities ............................................................................................................ ......................... 75,000 Best Buddies International, Las Vegas, NV for inclusion programs supporting students with intellectual and developmental disabilities ................................................................................................. ................ 125,000 Best Buddies, Spokane, WA for a mentor program ................................................................................. ...... 55,000 Big Brothers, Big Sisters, Santa Fe, NM for mentoring services and social programs ............................... 225,000 Boys & Girls Club of Burbank and Greater East Valley, Burbank, CA for education technology ................ 250,000 Boys & Girls Club of San Fernando Valley, Pacoima, CA for STEM and SEL programs .............................. 450,000 Boys & Girls Clubs of Dundee Township, Carpentersville, IL for an academic and SEL support program 250,000 Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Anaheim-Cypress, Cypress, CA for academic support and youth engage- ment ........................................................................................................................... ................................ 1,000,000 Boys & Girls Clubs of the Los Angeles Harbor, San Pedro, CA for the Wilmington College Bound Pro- gram ........................................................................................................................... ................................ 500,000 Boys & Girls Club of Palm Beach County, West Palm Beach, FL for its College and Work Readiness STEM program ................................................................................................................... ......................... 525,000 Boys & Girls Clubs of Rochester, NY for a comprehensive afterschool and summer program ................... 100,000 VerDate Sep 11 2014 Amount Bright Leadership Institute, Chicago, IL for youth mentoring and enrichment activities ............................ 500,000 Broward County Public Schools, Ft.

............................................................. 1,666,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +1,449,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +16,000,000 The Committee recommends a total of $1,666,000,000 for activi- ties to promote safe schools, healthy students, and citizenship edu-cation, which is $1,449,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and $16,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Promise Neighborhoods The Committee recommends $96,000,000 for Promise Neighbor- hoods, which is $15,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Promise Neighborhoods supports grants to nonprofit, community- based organizations for the development of comprehensive neigh-borhood programs designed to combat the effects of poverty and im-prove educational outcomes for children and youth, from birth through college. Planning Grants .\u2014Within the funding provided for Promise Neighborhoods, the Committee recommendation includes $5,000,000 and new bill language for planning grants intended to strengthen communities' abilities to scale city and regional rein-vestment strategies and allow for direct services. These planning grants will support the alignment of resources and efforts across multiple sectors and focus on measurable shared goals. School Safety National Activities The Committee recommends $1,127,000,000 for School Safety National Activities, which is $1,021,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $11,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee's recommendation provides up to $5,000,000 for the Project School Emergency Response to Vio-lence (Project SERV) program. School-based Mental Health Professionals .\u2014The Committee ap- plies the $1,000,000,000 fiscal year 2022 budget request for school- based mental health professionals to the Mental Health Services Professional Demonstration Grants program established in the De-partment of Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and the School- Based Mental Health Services Grants program established in the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2020. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul that the School-Based Mental Health Serv- ices Grants program was created to award grants to SEAs, LEAs, or consortia of LEAs to increase the number of qualified, well- trained mental health professionals in schools. To achieve this crit-ical goal, the Committee urges the Department to focus the fiscal year 2022 competition on directly increasing the number of these vital mental health professionals, including school counselors, so-cial workers, psychologists, or other mental health professionals qualified to provide school-based mental health services. The Com-mittee notes that the explanatory statement accompanying the De-partment of Education Appropriations Act, 2020 seeks to promote the sustainability of these services, by requiring that awards in-clude a 25 percent match from grantees and by requiring that the awards do not supplant existing mental health funding. The Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this Act on plans for carrying out the fiscal year 2022 Mental Health Services Professional Demonstration Grants and the School- Based Mental Health Services Grants competitions. In addition, the Department shall provide notice to the Committees at least seven days before grantees are announced. Project SERV .\u2014The Project SERV program provides counseling and referral to mental health services as well as other education- related services to LEAs and IHEs in which the learning environ-ment has been disrupted by a violent or traumatic crisis. The Com-mittee directs the Department to report to the Committees on Ap-propriations within 180 days of enactment of this Act on how fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020 grant recipients used Project SERV funds; recommendations from grant recipients on how the program could be improved; and, information on how these funds helped them recover from a violent or traumatic crisis. Active Shooter Drills .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the possible mental, emotional, and behavioral health effects on stu-dents and staff resulting from lockdown drills and active shooter drills conducted in elementary and secondary schools. In response, the Committee provides $1,000,000 for the Department to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engi-neering, and Medicine (National Academies) under which the Na-tional Academies will conduct a study to assess the science on the potential mental, emotional, and behavioral health effects of fire-arm violence prevention activities on students and staff in elemen-tary and secondary school settings. The study and subsequent re-port should include an analysis of the effects of active shooter sim-ulations, full-scale lockdowns, secured-perimeter lockouts, and other school security measures (e.g. metal detectors, visibility of po-lice/policing on campus) and their mental, emotional and behav-ioral consequences. The assessment should review the potential ef-fects on children and youth of different ages and on students with disabilities. The National Academies report should identify prac-tices and procedures that can minimize any adverse mental, emo-tional, and behavioral health effects on children, youth, and staff in elementary and secondary schools resulting from the drills and make recommendations where appropriate. School Climate and Safety Pilot .\u2014Within the fiscal year 2022 in- crease to School Safety National Activities, the Committee rec-ommends $10,000,000 to establish a pilot program that would pro- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul competitive grants to States to develop comprehensive school climate and safety plans that include effective, culturally com-petent, and evidence-based initiatives to strengthen, promote, and enhance school climates, affirm identities, and ensure school safety. Grant applications should be designed and submitted in consulta-tion with a State multidisciplinary team of education and mental health professionals and should maintain the rights and dignity of all students. Once awarded, States should provide competitive grants to LEAs to implement the plan developed by the State and preference LEAs that utilize alternatives to exclusionary discipline, culturally sustaining education programs, community-based pro-grams, and alternatives to law enforcement involvement. Adverse Childhood Experience .\u2014The Committee recognizes that the ratio of school-based mental health care professionals to stu-dents is not sufficient to meet students' mental health needs in schools. Research shows one in three children under 18 has suf-fered at least one adverse childhood experience (ACE) in their life-time and 14 percent experienced two or more ACEs. However, only about 20 percent of children with mental, emotional, or behavioral disorders receive care from a specialized mental health care pro-vider. The Committee encourages the Department to develop strat-egies to increase the training and hiring of counselors and other mental health providers in educational settings. Digital Citizenship Education .\u2014Technology has become an inte- gral part of classroom learning, and students of all ages have ac-cess to digital media and devices at school. This dynamic highlights a significant need for students to partake in educational opportuni-ties within the school setting focused on digital citizenship edu-cation, such as screen time balance, privacy and security, digital footprint, online relationships and communication, cyberbullying, civic engagement and news and media literacy, among other topics. The Committee recognizes the increased need to provide students with the tools and skills necessary to participate safely and respon-sibly in the digital world. To ensure the digital safety and well- being of K-12 students, the Committee strongly urges the Depart-ment to raise awareness of digital citizenship education and iden-tify opportunities to improve and expand digital citizenship edu-cation in K-12 schools. Mental Health Services .\u2014The Committee recognizes that even prior to COVID-19, significant need existed among students for mental health services, while schools faced critical shortages of open positions and qualified practitioners, which includes school counselors, school psychologists, and school social workers. As schools reopen and efforts are underway to meet the academic needs of students, capacity to address their mental and emotional well-being is imperative. Adequate access to school-employed men-tal health professionals improves delivery and integration of school- wide programming to foster positive school climate, prevent vio-lence, and balance physical and psychological safety. Without a highly qualified workforce of school-employed mental health profes-sionals, schools lack the capacity to provide comprehensive social and emotional learning and mental, behavioral, and academic interventions and supports. The Committee's robust investments in initiatives to increase the amount of school-based mental health professionals and related programs that recruit, train, and retain VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul profes- sionals are a high priority in this bill. Grants for Student Trauma Support and Mental Health .\u2014The Committee notes that the SUPPORT Act (P.L. 115-271) created new grants to expand evidence-based trauma support services in schools to improve access to research-supported interventions. The SUPPORT Act authorizes the Secretary, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary of Mental Health and Substance Use, to use grants to link educational agencies with mental health systems, in-creasing student access to evidence-based services to help prevent and mitigate trauma that youth experience. The Committee en-courages the Department to support these activities in fiscal year 2022. Full-Service Community Schools The Committee recommends $443,000,000 for Full-Service Com- munity Schools, which is $413,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program makes competitive grants to support school-based comprehensive services for students, families, and communities. Technical Assistance .\u2014The Full-Service Community Schools pro- gram supports evidence-based models to meet the holistic needs of children and families. The Committee is encouraged by research that shows comprehensive community schools as a strategy that can improve educational quality and equity for students from di-verse backgrounds. Therefore, the Committee urges the Depart-ment to provide technical assistance to SEAs and LEAs that are in-terested in leveraging Full-Service Community Schools grants to meet local school improvement needs. ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACQUISITION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $797,400,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 1,000,000,000 Change from ......................................................... +202,600,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +82,600,000 This program provides formula grants to States to serve Limited English Proficient (LEP) students. Grants are based on each State's share of the National LEP students and recent immigrant student population. Funds under this account also support professional de-velopment to increase the pool of teachers prepared to serve LEP students as well as evaluation activities. The bill continues lan- guage to calculate all State awards based on a three-year average of data from the American Community Survey. The Committee recommends $1,000,000,000 for English Lan- guage Acquisition in fiscal year 2022, which is $202,600,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $82,600,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Federal data shows that significant achievement gaps exist between English learners (ELs) and their peers. Since fiscal year 2020, the Committee has increased support for EL students by $60,000,000; however, at a time when many States and school districts have experienced rapid growth in their EL populations, the Committee remains concerned that services and supports for EL students are not adequately funded. Providing VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul increased resources to improve educational quality for EL students is a top priority for the Committee in fiscal year 2022. Office of English Language Acquisition (OELA) .\u2014The Committee understands that the nation's EL student population is rapidly growing and becoming more diverse. The Committee is deeply con-cerned by the academic achievement gap that persists between ELs and their peers and understands that addressing this challenge has been difficult for many States. These States rely on Federal tech-nical assistance in crafting and administering their State and local plans under Title III of the ESEA, and the Committee recognizes the need to provide them with timely, accurate guidance. OELA al-ready disseminates research and resources for teaching ELs and has the expertise needed to provide this guidance to States. There-fore, the Committee strongly encourages all assistance duties re-quired under section 6823(f) of the ESEA to be conducted by OELA. Children from Puerto Rico .\u2014The Committee is aware that chil- dren and youth who relocate from the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where Spanish is the primary language of instruction, to one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia are not counted in the statu-tory formula used to make English Language Acquisition allot-ments to States, set forth in section 3111(c) of the ESEA. Seal of Biliteracy Programs .\u2014The Committee recognizes that State seal of biliteracy programs, adopted and implemented in more than 80 percent of the States, enrich society by encouraging bilingual and multilingual education and demonstrating to employ-ers and higher education institutions that students have attained proficiency in English and one other language. The Committee rec-ognizes that ELs and heritage language learners lag behind world language students in attaining seals of biliteracy. To that end, the Committee is strongly supportive of LEAs using funds available under ESEA for costs associated with seal of biliteracy benchmark proficiency assessments and final assessments for EL and heritage language learners. The Committee notes that funds available under ESEA may be used to purchase the hardware and software nec- essary to administer these critical assessments. Translation and Interpretation Services .\u2014The Committee recog- nizes that parents of ELs often need translation and interpretation services to stay abreast of school activities, help with homework, and support their children's college and career readiness goals. Many schools lack dedicated funding for translation and interpreta-tion services, despite a growing EL population. In response to these concerns, the Committee encourages OELA to support LEAs and SEAs in providing robust translation and interpretation services for parents and guardians of ELs. SPECIAL EDUCATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $14,070,743,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 17,200,256,000 Change from ......................................................... +3,129,513,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +7,000,000 Of the total amount available, $7,488,516,000 is available for ob- ligation on July 1, 2022, and $9,283,383,000 is available for obliga-tion on October 1, 2022. These grants help States and localities pay VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul for a free, appropriate education for students with disabilities aged 3 through 21. Grants to States This program provides formula grants to assist States in meeting the costs of providing special education and related services to chil-dren with disabilities. States generally transfer most of the funds to LEAs; however, they can reserve some funds for program moni-toring, technical assistance, and other related activities. In order to be eligible for funds, States must make free appropriate public edu-cation available to all children with disabilities. The Committee recommends $15,537,429,000 for Part B Grants to States, which is $2,599,972,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Preschool Grants The Committee recommends $502,620,000 for Preschool Grants, which is $105,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. These funds pro-vide additional assistance to States to help them make free, appro-priate public education available to children with disabilities ages 3 through 5. Grants for Infants and Families The Committee recommends $731,850,000 for Grants for Infants and Families, which is $250,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. These funds provide additional assistance to States to help them make free, appropriate public education available to children with disabilities from birth through age 2. The Committee recommendation includes new bill language to increase access for infants and families who have been traditionally underrepresented in the program, eliminate out-of-pocket costs for participating families, and promote continuity of services for eligi-ble infants and their families. IDEA National Activities The Committee recommends $428,357,000 for IDEA National Ac- tivities, which is $174,541,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $7,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The IDEA National Activities programs support State efforts to im-prove early intervention and education results for children with disabilities. Educational Technology, Media, and Materials .\u2014The Committee recommends $31,547,000 for Educational Technology, Media, and Materials, which is $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program makes competitive awards to support the development, demonstration, and use of technology and educational media activities of edu-cational value to children with disabilities. The Committee continues to recognize the ongoing progress made with the tools and services provided under this program that have allowed more than 620,000 students with disabilities free access to more than 700,000 books in digitally accessible formats. The Com- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 encourages continued effort to expand this pro- gram's reach to K-12 students in underserved areas. Parent Information Centers .\u2014The Committee recommends $30,152,000 for Parent Information Centers, which is $2,741,000 above the 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program makes awards to parent organiza-tions to support Parent Training and Information Centers, includ-ing community parent resource centers. These centers provide training and information to meet the needs of parents of children with disabilities living in the areas served by the centers, particu-larly underserved parents and parents of children who may be in-appropriately identified. Technical assistance is also provided under this program for developing, assisting, and coordinating cen-ters receiving assistance under this program. Personnel Preparation .\u2014The Committee recommends $250,000,000 for Personnel Preparation, which is $159,800,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program supports competitive awards to help address State-identified needs for qualified per-sonnel to work with children with disabilities, and to ensure that those personnel have the necessary skills and knowledge to serve children with special needs. Awards focus on addressing the need for leadership and personnel to serve low-incidence populations. Funds are included to fully support continuation costs for grants made in prior years. The Committee notes the critical role the Per-sonnel Preparation program plays in helping to address the na-tion's shortage of teachers for students with disabilities. The Committee is strongly supportive of the fiscal year 2022 pro- posed increase within Personnel Preparation for doctoral-level per-sonnel preparation in special education. The Committee agrees that this investment would expand the teacher preparation pipeline and ensure that more well-prepared special education teachers enter the classroom per year than ever before. As LEAs make determinations about how to invest Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds, the Com-mittee encourages the Department to provide technical assistance to LEAs and highlight the benefits of partnerships with educator preparation programs in higher education to address the shortage of special educators. The Committee notes that residency programs, grow-your-own programs, and special education preparation pro-grams are allowable uses of funds under ESSER. Such programs allow candidates to be supported so that school districts will be able to address their needs for fully-prepared special educators. State Personnel Development .\u2014The Committee recommends $38,630,000 for State Personnel Development, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program supports grants to States to assist with im-proving personnel preparation and professional development re-lated to early intervention and educational and transition services that improve outcomes for students with disabilities. Funds are in-cluded to fully support continuation costs for grants made in prior years. Technical Assistance and Dissemination .\u2014The Committee rec- ommends $49,345,000 for Technical Assistance and Dissemination, which is $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Funding supports technical assistance, demonstration projects, and information dis-semination. These funds support efforts by State and local edu-cational agencies, IHEs, and other entities to build State and local capacity to make systemic changes and improve results for children with disabilities. Special Olympics Education Programs .\u2014The Committee rec- ommends $28,683,000 for Special Olympics Education Programs, which is $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to support activities authorized by the Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act, including Project UNIFY. This funding supports efforts to expand Special Olympics programs and the design and implementation of Special Olympics education programs that can be integrated into classroom instruction and are consistent with academic content standards. Autism .\u2014The Committee supports efforts by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) to disseminate re-search and best practices to LEAs and SEAs regarding services and improving results for children with autism. The Committee is sup-portive of efforts to share new knowledge, integrate research and practice, and work with LEAs and SEAs on high-quality implemen-tation of research. Assistive Technology Usage. \u2014The Committee notes that assistive technology (AT) is an essential tool for students with disabilities. As mandated under IDEA, assistive technology must be made available to all children with a disability needing AT as determined by the team developing the student's Individualized Education Pro-gram (IEP). However, too little is known regarding access to and use of assistive technology for students who require it. The Com-mittee is concerned that children with disabilities who could ben-efit from the use of AT are not accessing these resources. The Com-mittee encourages OSERS to study State and district practices in making AT available to students; the percentage of students with IEPs by disability category accessing AT; the availability of train-ing for school personnel and parents to support a child's use of AT; budgeting practices regarding the annual acquisition of AT for eli-gible children; and, any other factors impacting the policies and practices of providing AT so that all children with disabilities have equitable access to grade-level curriculum, assessments and the learning environment commensurate with their peers. In addition, the Committee encourages OSERS to issue guidance to States that: clarifies the requirements of the IDEA regarding providing AT to children with disabilities; assures States have updated plans to provide technical assistance to district leaders in the financing and acquisition of AT; provides training to IEP teams in determining whether a child qualifies for AT; and trains all school personnel in-volved, including the child's parents, on the use of the AT to ensure children with disabilities have equitable access to grade-level cur-riculum, assessment, and the learning environment commensurate with their peers. Special Education Expenditure Project. \u2014The Committee notes that no data has been collected by the Federal government on spe-cial education expenditures since 2004 when the Department re-leased the Special Education Expenditure Project (SEEP). To assist policymakers and advocates with critical questions regarding spe- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 education spending, the Committee encourages the Department to conduct a large-scale, nationally representative study of special education expenditures of similar scale, scope, and design as the 1999-2004 SEEP. Prohibition on Use of Federal Funds for Electric Shock Devices. \u2014 The Committee is deeply concerned that Federal funds support services for children at private schools that use electric shock de-vices and equipment for student discipline and conditioning. The Committee includes new bill language to prohibit Federal funds from supporting institutions that carry out this horrific practice. REHABILITATION SERVICES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $3,814,220,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 3,896,820,000 Change from ......................................................... +82,600,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +2,000,000 The programs in this account are authorized by the Rehabilita- tion Act of 1973, the Helen Keller National Center Act, and the Randolph-Sheppard Act. Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants The Committee recommends $3,719,121,000 in mandatory fund- ing for Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) State Grants, which is $44,100,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program supports vocational rehabilitation services through formula grants to States. These grants support a wide range of services designed to help persons with physical and mental disabil-ities prepare for and engage in gainful employment to the extent of their capabilities. Emphasis is placed on providing vocational re-habilitation services to persons with the most significant disabil-ities. The Committee's recommendation provides the cost-of-living adjustment for Vocational Rehabilitation Grants to States, as au-thorized. Client Assistance State Grants The Committee recommends $13,000,000 for Client Assistance State Grants, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Client Assistance State Grants support services for eligible individuals and appli-cants of the VR State Grants program, and other programs, projects, and services funded under the Rehabilitation Act. These formula grants are used to help persons with disabilities overcome problems with the service delivery system and improve their under-standing of services available to them under the Rehabilitation Act. Training The Committee recommends $29,388,000 for the Training pro- gram, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The program supports long- term and short-term training, in-service personnel training, and training of interpreters for deaf persons. Projects in a broad array of disciplines are funded to ensure that skilled personnel are avail-able to serve the vocational needs of persons with disabilities. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Funds are included to fully support continuation costs for grants made in prior years. Demonstration and Training Programs The Committee recommends $40,796,000 for Demonstration and Training Programs, which is $35,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. These programs support activities designed to increase employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities by expanding and im-proving the availability and provision of rehabilitation and other services. The Committee recommendation includes no less than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level for parent information and training programs. Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights The Committee recommends $20,150,000 for Protection and Ad- vocacy of Individual Rights, which is $2,000,000 more than the fis-cal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Grants are awarded to entities that have the authority to pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies to protect and advocate for the rights of persons with disabilities. Supported Employment State Grants The Committee recommends $22,548,000 for Supported Employ- ment State Grants, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. These formula grants assist States in developing collaborative programs with pub-lic agencies and nonprofit agencies for training and post-employ-ment services leading to supported employment. In supported em-ployment programs, persons with the most significant disabilities are given special supervision and assistance to enable them to work in integrated settings. Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind The Committee recommends $33,317,000 for Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind, which is the same as both the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Funds are distributed to States according to a for-mula based on the population of individuals who are 55 or older and provide support for services to persons 55 years old or over whose severe visual impairment makes gainful employment ex-tremely difficult to obtain, but for whom independent living goals are feasible. Helen Keller National Center The Committee recommends $18,500,000 for the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youth and Adults, which is $1,500,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. These funds are used for the operation of a national center that provides intensive serv-ices for deaf-blind individuals and their families at Sands Point, New York, and a network of ten regional offices that provide refer-ral, counseling, transition services, and technical assistance to serv-ice providers. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $256,292,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 265,292,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +9,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Committee recommends $265,292,000 for Special Institu- tions for Persons with Disabilities, which is $9,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. AMERICAN PRINTING HOUSE FOR THE BLIND Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $34,431,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 37,431,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +3,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - This funding subsidizes the production of educational materials for legally blind persons enrolled in pre-college programs. The American Printing House for the Blind (Printing House), which is chartered by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, manufactures and maintains an inventory of educational materials in accessible for-mats that are distributed free of charge to schools and States based on the number of blind students in each State. The Printing House also conducts research and field activities to inform educators about the availability of materials and how to use them. The Committee applauds the Printing House for rapidly devel- oping training resources to assist schools, teachers, parents, and students to adapt to the changes in education brought about be-cause of the COVID pandemic. The increase in funding will help provide the resources necessary to develop and distribute assistive technologies, books in accessible formats and specially designed educational aids that will allow students who are blind or visually impaired to fully participate in and benefit from education pro-grams. NATIONAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE FOR THE DEAF Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $81,500,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 84,500,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +3,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - Congress established the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (Institute) in 1965 to provide a residential facility for postsec-ondary technical training and education for deaf persons with the purpose of promoting the employment of these individuals. The In-stitute also conducts applied research and provides training related to various aspects of deafness. The Secretary of Education admin-isters these activities through a contract with the Rochester Insti-tute of Technology in Rochester, New York. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 143,361,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +3,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - Gallaudet is a private, non-profit educational institution Feder- ally chartered in 1864 providing elementary, secondary, under-graduate, and continuing education for deaf persons. In addition, the University offers graduate programs in fields related to deaf-ness for deaf and hearing students, conducts research on deafness, and provides public service programs for deaf persons. CAREER , TECHNICAL , AND ADULT EDUCATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $2,030,936,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 2,238,981,000 Change from ......................................................... +208,045,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +55,045,000 This account includes vocational education programs authorized by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, as recently reauthorized by the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, and the Adult Edu-cation and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA). Career and Technical Education: State Grants The Committee recommends $1,384,848,000 for Career and Tech- nical Education (CTE) State Grants, which is $50,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $30,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Of these funds, $593,848,000 will become available on July 1, 2022, and $791,000,000 will become available for obligation on October 1, 2022. State Grants support a variety of career and technical education programs developed in accordance with the State plan. This pro-gram focuses Federal resources on institutions with high concentra-tions of low-income students. The populations assisted by State Grants range from secondary students in prevocational courses to adults who need retraining to adapt to changing technological and labor markets. Funding for State Grants will continue support for state-of-the art career and technical training to students in sec-ondary schools and community and technical colleges. National Programs The Committee recommends $115,421,000 for National Pro- grams, which is $108,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The recommendation includes new language supporting the Admin-istration's proposal for Innovation and Modernization grants. Improved Coordination between Career and Technical Education and Adult Education. \u2014To ensure that individuals can succeed in today's economy, the Committee encourages the Department to identify and pursue opportunities to better align the postsecondary career and technical education (CTE) system with the adult edu-cation system. Adult education can be an effective on-ramp to post-secondary CTE and a valuable partner in designing and imple- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 that blend basic skills instruction and occupa- tional training to expand equitable access to skills training, high- quality credentials and family-supporting careers. Adult Basic and Literacy Education State Grants The Committee recommends $700,000,000 for Adult Basic and Literacy Education State Grants, which is $25,045,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. State formula grants, authorized under the AEFLA, sup-port programs to enable adults to acquire basic literacy skills, to enable those who so desire to complete secondary education, and to make available to adults the means to become more employable, productive, and responsible citizens. Adult Education National Leadership Activities The Committee recommends $38,712,000 for National Leadership Activities, which is $25,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program supports applied research, development, dissemina-tion, evaluation, and program improvement efforts to strengthen the quality of adult education services. The Committee encourages the provision of technical assistance to States to foster and scale IET models by ensuring collaboration with CTE providers. IET is a service approach that provides adult education and literacy activities concurrently and contextually with workforce preparation for a specific occupation or occupational clus-ter for the purpose of educational and career advancement. STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $24,545,352,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 27,187,352,000 Change from ......................................................... +2,642,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5358,000,000 Pell Grants The Committee recommends $24,725,352,000 in discretionary funding for the Pell Grant program, which is $2,250,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $750,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. These funds will support Pell grants to students for the 2022-2023 academic year. Combined with mandatory funding streams, the Committee rec- ommendation supports a maximum Pell Grant in academic year 2022-2023 of $6,895, a $400 increase over fiscal year 2021 and the same as the fiscal year 2022 discretionary budget request. Pell Grants help to ensure access to educational and economic opportunities for low-and middle-income students by providing need-based financial assistance. Grants are determined according to a statutory formula, which considers income, assets, household size, and the number of family members in college, among other factors. Pell Grants are the foundation of Federal postsecondary student aid programs. In keeping with the fiscal year 2022 budget request, the recommendation includes new language extending eli-gibility for DACA-eligible students. The Committee recognizes that Pell Grants help to ensure access to education and economic opportunities for low-and-middle-income VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 providing need-based financial assistance. The Com- mittee requests a briefing within 180 days of enactment of this Act on expanding eligibility for Pell Grants to provide better access to higher education opportunities and better serve a modernized econ-omy and diverse workforce, including recent experimental site ini-tiatives. Second Chance Pell. \u2014The Committee notes Pell grants are now available for incarcerated individuals. The Committee supports ef-forts to ensure those who are eligible are provided opportunities to access the financial assistance. The Committee requests an update on this effort in the fiscal year 2023 congressional justification. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants The Committee recommends $1,028,000,000 for the Federal Sup- plemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG) program, which is $148,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. SEOG provides funds to postsecondary institutions for need- based grants of up to $4,000 to undergraduate students, with pri-ority given to students who are Pell-eligible. Approximately 69 per-cent of dependent recipients have annual family incomes under $30,000 and nearly 71 percent of independent SEOG recipients have annual family incomes under $20,000. Institutions must con-tribute a 25 percent match toward their SEOG allocation. Federal Work-Study The Committee recommends $1,434,000,000 for the Federal Work-Study program, which is $244,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Federal Work-Study funds are provided through institutions to students who work part-time. The funds assist with paying for the cost of education. Approximately 3,200 colleges and universities re-ceive funding, according to a statutory formula, and may allocate it for job location and development centers. Work-study jobs must pay at least the Federal minimum wage and institutions must pro-vide 25 percent of student earnings. The Committee recommendation continues funding for the Work Colleges program, which supports institutions that require all resi-dent students to participate in a work-learning program. For-profit College Accountability. \u2014The 85/15 Rule was first im- plemented in 1992 as a bipartisan amendment to the Higher Edu-cation Act (HEA). It is based on the rationale that if an institution provides a quality education, individuals without access to Federal funding sources should be willing to pay for it. The rule prevented for-profit postsecondary institutions from deriving more than 85 percent of revenues from Title IV of the HEA. It was based on a longstanding principle first enacted in 1952 to protect veterans from for-profit college abuses dating back to the original GI Bill (the Servicemen's Readjustment Act) in 1944, and was in response to widespread reports that many for-profit colleges were using ag-gressive, sometimes fraudulent recruiting tactics in order to profit off of students with access to Federal student aid funding. In 1998, the rule was amended to allow for-profits to derive an extra five percent of their revenue from Title IV and became known as the 90/10 Rule. Since that time, thousands of students have been de- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 by schools that have since gone out of business. Students who graduate from these schools can obtain degrees that often offer little value. A 2016 National Bureau of Economic Research study using data from the Department and the Internal Revenue Service found that the earnings of students who attend for-profit colleges or universities are lower than if they had never enrolled at all. Given these deeply disappointing outcomes, the Committee be- lieves that reverting back to the 85/15 ratio is a critical step in holding for-profit colleges accountable and protecting students from predatory practices and taxpayer dollars from being wasted. There-fore, the Committee includes new bill language requiring that for- profit institutions of higher education receive not more than 85 per-cent of their revenue from Federal sources. F EDERAL DIRECT STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $50,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 25,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... \u00a525,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Committee recommendation includes $25,000,000 for the Federal Direct Student Loan Program Account program (also known as Temporary Extended Public Service Loan Forgiveness or TEPSLF). Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program in 2007 to provide loan relief to borrowers pur-suing careers in public service. After making 120 qualifying pay-ments, the equivalent of 10 years, borrowers first became eligible for forgiveness under the program in 2017. TEPSLF was established to address the administrative chal- lenges associated with the PSLF program. This account provides funding for loan forgiveness for borrowers who were led to believe they qualified for PSLF by their loan servicers but were denied for-giveness. While approximately $800,000,000 has been provided for TEPSLF since fiscal year 2018, only $129,970,490 has been used for borrower discharges as of April 2021. The Committee encour-ages the Department to improve the administration of this pro-gram. The Committee appreciates the Department's briefing on actions planned or taken to address and implement recommendations out-lined in a GAO report entitled ''Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Improving the Temporary Expanded Process Could Help Reduce Borrower Confusion'' (GA0-19-595). The Committee directs the De-partment to include an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congres-sional Budget Justification identifying areas where the Department can further improve the administration of the PSLF and TEPSLF programs. The Committee notes that many physicians are excluded from re- ceiving forgiveness under section 455(m)(3) of the HEA as they are prohibited from direct employment with private, non-physician, cor-porate entities within their States. As such, the Committee encour-ages the Secretary to provide full-time borrowers who are engaged in health care practitioner occupations in such States, including California and Texas, with loan cancellations that are consistent with the Department's ongoing loan cancellations for health care practitioners across the country. Further, the Committee encour- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 the Department to explore this issue through negotiated rule- making this year. STUDENT AIDADMINISTRATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $1,853,943,000 Budget 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 2,053,943,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... 200,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - Programs administered under Student Aid Administration (SAA) include Pell Grants, campus-based programs, Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) grants, and Federal student loan programs. Salaries and Expenses. \u2014Within the total provided for SAA, the Committee recommends $975,000,000 for salaries and expenses, which is the same as the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fis-cal year 2022 request. Loan Servicing Activities. \u2014Within the total provided for SAA, the Committee recommends $1,078,943,000 for Loan Servicing Ac-tivities, which is $200,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 en- acted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 request. In addition, the American Rescue Plan Act (P.L. 117-2) included $91,130,000 for administrative expenses to support changes to the student aid programs to assist students and borrowers in response to COVID-19. State and Nonprofit Subcontracting \u2014The Committee believes that State and nonprofit organizations can assist Federal student loan servicers in providing important services to struggling bor-rowers who need access to more specialized support services throughout their postsecondary education to help them understand their financial decisions and act as advocates to help struggling borrowers understand the student loan repayment process and op-tions that may be available to them to help mitigate delinquencies and defaults. The Committee urges the Department to explore in-centives for Federal student loan servicers to subcontract with qualified State and nonprofit organizations as well as small busi-nesses. Next Generation Servicing Environment. \u2014In 2017, the Depart- ment initiated the Next Generation Processing and Servicing Envi-ronment (Next Gen). Since that time, Congress has provided sig-nificant resources for Student Aid Administration activities, includ-ing the development and implementation of Next Gen. Given these resources, the Committee remains concerned with the current state of student loan servicing. The recommendation continues to include bill language requiring FSA to submit a detailed spend plan of an-ticipated uses. Transparency in College Costs. \u2014The Committee notes the per- sistent lack of transparency around the costs of college and its det-rimental impact on the ability of individuals and families to make informed financial decisions around higher education. Therefore, the Committee urges the Department to work with institutions of higher education to improve college cost transparency, and requests a briefing on these efforts no later than 120 days after enactment of this Act. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Data Retrieval Tool for the U.S. Territories. \u2014The Committee notes that students or parents who file a Puerto Rico or other U.S. territory tax return are currently unable to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to complete the Free Application for Fed-eral Student Aid (FAFSA) form. Instead, they must enter their tax return information manually. The Committee is interested in sim-plifying the FAFSA process for applicants in Puerto Rico and the other U.S. territories, in the same manner available to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax filers residing in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. The Committee therefore encourages the De-partment of Education to work with the IRS and the tax authori-ties of the five U.S. territories to explore options that would allow applicants in these jurisdictions to import their tax income infor-mation directly into the FAFSA form, including the feasibility of utilizing the existing IRS Data Retrieval Tool or a similar mecha-nism. COVID-19 Impacts to PSLF. \u2014The Committee directs the De- partment to include an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congres-sional Budget Justification on how COVID-19 has impacted the PSLF program and how the Department of Education is addressing concerns of COVID-19's impact, if any, on an applicant's ability to apply and qualify for PSLF.

In addition, the American Rescue Plan Act (P.L. 117-2) included $559,256,000 for the Developing HSIs program to directly support students and institutions addressing effects of COVID-19. GAO report on Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) Facilities. \u2014 The Committee recognizes the importance of underrepresented groups having access to institutions of higher education that pro-mote student achievement, workforce development, and career op-portunities. As such, the Committee directs the GAO to provide a report to the Committee on infrastructure needs\u2014both physical and digital\u2014at HSIs. In this report, the GAO should include, but is not limited to, a review and analysis of the condition of HSI fa-cilities, capital financing challenges facing HSIs, and how to help HSIs better serve Hispanic communities. The Committee expects to receive regular updates from GAO about the status of the report and any initial critical findings that would allow the Committee to address the financial needs of HSIs. Graduation Rates. \u2014The Committee notes that HSIs provide many benefits and educational opportunities to their students. However, the Committee is concerned that students at HSIs may be graduating at lower rates than students at non-HSIs. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to provide an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on graduation rates, retention rates, and persistence rates for students at HSIs, including a strategy on how to improve overall postsecondary com-pletion at HSIs.

The TRIO programs provide a variety of outreach and support services to en-courage low-income, first-generation college students and individ-uals with disabilities to enter and complete college. Discretionary grants of up to four or five years are awarded competitively to IHEs and other nonprofit organizations. At least two thirds of the eligible participants in TRIO must be low-income, first-generation college students. VerDate Sep 11 2014 Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Pro- grams The Committee recommends $408,000,000 for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP), which is $40,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. GEAR UP provides grants to States and partnerships of low-income mid-dle and high schools, IHEs, and community organizations to target entire grades of students and give them the skills, encouragement, and scholarships to pursue successfully postsecondary education. The Committee continues bill language allowing the Department to maintain the GEAR UP evaluation set-aside at 1.5 percent to work with the GEAR UP community and grantees to standardize data collection, including through the use of third-party data sys-tems. Furthermore, the Committee directs the Department to announce Notices Inviting Applications for New Awards for State Grants and Partnership Grants in the Federal Register. In such notice for State grants, the Committee directs the Department to uphold the long-standing guidance that States may only administer one active State GEAR UP grant at a time. The Secretary is directed to pro-vide written guidance in the Federal Register notifying applicants that only States without an active State GEAR UP grant, or States that have an active State GEAR UP grant that is scheduled to end prior to October 1, 2022, will be eligible to receive a new State GEAR UP award funded in whole or in part by this appropriation. The Secretary is further directed to ensure that no request from a State Grant applicant to receive an exception to the GEAR UP scholarship (as described in section 404E(b)(2) of the HEA) shall be denied on the basis of 34 CFR 694.14(c)(3). Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need The Committee recommends $25,547,000 for the Graduate As- sistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) program, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fis-cal year 2022 budget request. GAANN provides fellowships through grants to degree granting postsecondary institutions, for students of high financial need studying in areas of national need. The De-partment consults with appropriate agencies and organizations to designate the fields of study ''in areas of national need.'' GAANN offers innovative graduate education programs, with associated fel-lowship opportunities, at the intersection of humanities, arts, STEM, and health associated fields in order to prepare our national graduate students for increasingly interdisciplinary global chal-lenges. Recent examples include engineering, nursing, and physics. The Committee encourages the Secretary to consider the inclu- sion of ''Computer Science + X'' (CS+X) programs (also referred to as Applied Computer Science and Data Literacy Programs), aimed at integrating the humanities and computer science, in order to provide technology-focused students in need with the broader skill set required for high tech jobs. Teacher Quality Partnership Grants The Committee recommends $132,092,000 for the Teacher Qual- ity Partnerships (TQP) program, which is $80,000,000 more than VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The TQP program helps improve the quality of teachers working in high-need schools and early childhood edu-cation programs by creating model teacher preparation and resi-dency programs. The Committee recognizes the importance of State teaching fel- lowship programs and encourages the Department to continue to work with eligible State teaching fellowship programs that wish to apply for the TQP program. The Committee recognizes the needs of the nation's growing English learner (EL) student population, including a robust teacher workforce equipped with the skills to teach them. The Committee is concerned by the shortage of EL teachers in the majority of States, as well the academic achievement gap between ELs and their native English-speaking peers. Therefore, the Committee rec-ommends the Secretary support the development and strength-ening of high-quality teacher preparation programs that enable graduates to meet licensure or certification requirements to teach ELs. The Committee notes that high-quality teacher residency pro- grams prepare diverse cohorts of teachers to serve high-need schools, improve teacher efficacy in the classroom, and are a high- retention teacher preparation pathway. In fact, 49 percent of resi-dents are teachers of color, while only 20 percent of all teachers na-tionally are teachers of color. Further, a review of teacher residency programs shows that residents tend to have higher retention rates over time than nonresident teachers. As such, the Committee en-courages the Department of Education to prioritize grants under the Teacher Quality Partnership Grant Program for applicants that apply to fund high-quality teacher residency programs as author-ized under Section 202(e) of the Higher Education Act. The Depart-ment is further encouraged to include a priority for teacher resi-dency program applicants that include explicit admissions goals and priorities, as permitted under Section 202(e)(2)(A)(vi)(II), for the consideration of teacher residency applicants from underrep-resented populations in the teaching profession. Child Care Access Means Parents in School The Committee recommends $95,000,000 for the Child Care Ac- cess Means Parents in School program, which is $40,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program makes competitive grants to colleges and universities to support or establish a campus-based childcare program primarily serving the needs of low-income stu-dents enrolled at the institution. Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education The Committee recommendation includes $168,015,000 for the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, which is $127,015,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $92,015,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Centers of Excellence for Student Veteran Success Program. \u2014The Committee includes $15,000,000 to support existing and new grant-ees for the Centers of Excellence for Student Veterans Success Pro-gram, as authorized by section 873 of the HEA. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Over one million veterans attend college every year and often need assistance receiving their benefits or transitioning to student life. Student Veteran Centers provide a one-stop-shop for academic support, networking opportunities, peer mentorship, financial as-sistance, counseling, and career services. The Department should ensure that this program continues to support comprehensive services including veteran benefits assist-ance, tutoring, counseling, and housing. The Committee directs the Department to brief the Committees on Appropriations no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on its plan to continue to carry out this program, as well as a plan for evaluation and ac-countability, and to notify the Committees no later than 15 days in advance of making any new grant award or changes to the pro-grams. Basic Needs Grants. \u2014The Committee recognizes that many col- lege and graduate students are unable to achieve academic success because they cannot afford to meet their basic needs, such as hous-ing, food, transportation, and access to physical and mental health services. The Committee includes $8,000,000 for competitive grants to at least eight institutions of higher education, as defined by sec-tion 101 of the HEA, to support programs that address the basic needs of students and report on best practices. In order to qualify, grantees must use funds to carry out or expand at least two of the following activities: to fund basic needs programs that support tem-porary housing, secure sleeping arrangements, provide free or sub-sidized food, access to on-campus childcare, and/or other basic needs to eligible students; conduct outreach to students to encour-age participation in basic needs programs and services; help eligi-ble students apply for and enroll in local, State, and Federal public assistance programs; or coordinate and collaborate with govern-ment and/or community-based organizations. At least 25 percent of grants must go to community colleges. Grant priority will go to in-stitutions with 25 percent or higher Pell enrollment, HBCUs, HSIs, and other MSIs. Transitioning Gang-Involved Youth to Higher Education. \u2014The Committee directs the Department to work in conjunction with the Department of Labor to allocate no less than $1,000,000 to provide a funding opportunity for organizations that work directly with gang involved youth to help such youth pursue higher education opportunities. Modeling and Simulation Programs. \u2014The Committee includes $10,000,000 for Modeling and Simulation Programs as authorized under section 891 of the HEA. Modeling and simulation technology has numerous applications for Federal and State governments and their partners in the defense, education, gaming, shipbuilding, and workforce training sectors, allowing them to generate data to help make decisions or predictions about their systems. Open Textbook Pilot. \u2014The Committee includes $12,000,000 to continue the Open Textbook Pilot and fund a new grant competi-tion in fiscal year 2022. The Department shall issue a notice invit-ing applications consistent with notice and comment procedures and allow for a 60-day application period. This funding should sup-port a significant number of grant awards to IHEs as defined by 20 U.S.C. 1001, a group of IHEs, or State higher education agen-cies that lead the activities of (and serve as fiscal agent for) a con- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Funding should be used to create new open textbooks and expand the use of open textbooks in courses that are part of a de-gree granting program, and particularly those with high enroll-ments. Allowable uses of funds should include professional develop-ment for faculty and staff, including relating to the search for and review of open textbooks; the creation or adaptation of open text-books; development or improvement of tools and informational re-sources that support the use of open textbooks, including accessible instructional materials for students with disabilities; and research evaluating the efficacy of the use of open textbooks for achieving savings for students and the impact on instruction and student learning outcomes. The Secretary shall require that any open text-books created with these funds shall be released to the public under a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable li-cense to exercise any of the rights under copyright conditioned only on the requirement that attribution be given as directed by the copyright owner. Further, any tools, technologies, or other re-sources that are created, developed, or improved wholly or in part with these funds for use with any open textbook must be similarly licensed. Any eligible entity receiving a grant through the Open Textbooks Pilot, upon completion of the supported project, shall re-port to the Secretary regarding the effectiveness of the project in expanding the use of open textbooks and in achieving savings for students; the impact of the project on expanding the use of open textbooks at IHEs outside of the institution receiving the grant; open textbooks created or adapted under the grant, including in-structions on where the public can access each open textbook; the impact of the project on instruction and student learning outcomes; and all project costs, including the value of any volunteer labor and institutional capital used for the project. The Secretary shall make such reports publicly available. Center of Excellence in Spatial Computing. \u2014The Committee is increasingly concerned about the lack of highly-qualified Americans available for hire within the high-tech labor pool. The technology sector is the fastest growing market within the United States, with a growing need for a spatial computing workforce to remain com-petitive. Therefore, the Committee includes $5,000,000 to establish a Center of Excellence in Spatial Computing designation, allowing institutions of higher education the opportunity to qualify for fed-eral funding to teach students the necessary skills to succeed in an ever-evolving high tech economy. In order to receive this designation, institutions must: (i) create a consortium of multiple institutions of higher education capable of supporting the advancement of spatial computing in our nation's colleges and universities, including the development of best prac-tices and curricula that can be shared with computer science and other relevant programs; (ii) establish U.S. leadership and competi-tiveness by promoting innovative processes for domestic manufac- turing of spatial computing technology products in a rapidly devel-oping global market; (iii) create educational and work placement opportunity programs to recruit, train, and retain underserved pop-ulations in the technology sector; and (iv) develop case studies and skill-based workforce training and company-based education pro-grams in spatial computing. VerDate Sep 11 2014 Products Programs. \u2014Congress recognizes that the lack of access to menstrual products impedes the academic success of many college and graduate students as well as impacts their physical and mental well-being. Congress includes $5,000,000 for competitive grants to at least ten institutions of higher education, as defined by section 101 of the HEA, to support institutional pro-grams that provide free menstrual products to students, as well as report on best practices. In order to qualify, grantees must agree to use funds to carry out or expand activities that fund programs that support direct provision of menstrual products in appropriate campus locations including, but not limited to, campus restroom fa-cilities, wellness centers, on campus residential buildings; conduct outreach to students to encourage participation in menstrual equity programs and services; help eligible students apply for and enroll in local, State, and Federal public assistance programs; or coordi-nate and collaborate with government and/or community-based or-ganizations. At least 50 percent of grants must go to community colleges. Grant priority will go to institutions with 25 percent or higher Pell enrollment, HBCUs, HSIs, AANAPISIs, and other MSIs. Distributed Higher Education Digital Infrastructure Pilot. \u2014The Committee includes $5,000,000 to establish a pilot program for an institution of higher education with established remote learning in-frastructure to work with Minority-Serving Institutions in the grantee's region to provide support and technical assistance to ex-pand MSI digital learning infrastructure.

Hawkins Centers of Excellence The Committee recommends $20,000,000 for the Hawkins Cen- ters of Excellence program, which is $20,000,000 more than the fis-cal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 budget request. This program will provide five year competitive grants to eligible institutions (HBCUs, HSIs, TCUs, and other Mi-nority Serving Institutions) to establish centers of excellence. These centers will help strengthen and improve teacher preparation pro-grams, increase the availability of educators from diverse back-grounds, and aid in the retention of teachers and principals of color. HOWARD UNIVERSITY Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $251,018,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 411,018,000 Change from ......................................................... +160,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +150,000,000 Howard University is a leading research university located in the District of Columbia and provides undergraduate liberal arts, grad-uate and professional instruction to students. Within the amount provided, the Committee recommends $184,325,000 for the Howard University Hospital, which is $150,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The hospital serves as a major acute and ambulatory care center for the District of Columbia, and functions as a teaching facility. To continue this vital function, the Committee includes $150,000,000 to modernize the hospital's facili-ties. In addition, the American Rescue Plan Act (P.L. 117-2) included $35,000,000 for Howard University to prevent, prepare for, and re-spond to coronavirus, including support for students. COLLEGE HOUSING AND ACADEMIC FACILITIES LOANS PROGRAM Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $435,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... Recommendation ............................................................. 435,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - Previously, these programs helped to ensure that postsecondary institutions were able to make necessary capital improvements to maintain and increase their ability to provide a high-quality edu-cation. Since 1994, no new loans have been made, and the Depart-ment's role has been to manage the outstanding loans. HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAPITAL FINANCING PROGRAM ACCOUNT Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $48,484,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 24,484,000 Change from ......................................................... \u00a524,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +4,000,000 The Committee recommends $24,484,000 for the HBCU Capital Financing program, which is $24,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $4,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program is authorized under part D of Title III of the HEA and makes capital available for repair and renova-tion of facilities at HBCUs. In exceptional circumstances, capital provided under the program can be used for construction or acqui-sition of facilities. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 total provided for this program, the Committee rec- ommendation includes $334,000 for the administrative expenses to carry out the program and $24,150,000 for loan subsidy costs, which will be sufficient to guarantee up to $328,571,000 in new loans in fiscal year 2022, an increase of $50,305,000 in new loan volume over the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The FAFSA Sim-plification Act provided debt discharges for approximately 45 HBCUs under the HBCU Capital Financing program. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 provided two-year au-thority for deferments. As such, the recommendation does not in-clude deferments for fiscal year 2022. INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SCIENCES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $642,462,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 762,465,000 Change from ......................................................... +120,003,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +25,000,000 The Committee recommends $762,465,000 for the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), $120,003,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $25,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. In addition, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $100,000,000 for Institute of Education Sciences to carry out re-search related to addressing learning loss caused by COVID-19. Research, Development, and Dissemination The Committee recommends $260,880,000 for Research, Develop- ment, and Dissemination, which is $63,003,000 more that the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $7,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This account supports research, development, and national dissemination activities that are aimed at expanding fundamental knowledge of education and promoting the use of re-search and development findings in the design of efforts to improve education. Statistics The Committee recommends $114,500,000 for the activities of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which is $3,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fis-cal year 2022 budget request. Statistics activities are authorized under Title I of the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002. NCES collects, analyzes, and reports statistics on all levels of education in the U.S. Activities are carried out directly and through grants and contracts and include projections of enrollments, teacher sup-ply and demand, and educational expenditures. NCES also pro-vides technical assistance to State and local educational agencies and postsecondary institutions. The Committee recommends that NCES collect and publish data for Puerto Rico in the same manner it collects and publishes data for States. Regional Educational Laboratories The Committee recommends $59,022,000 for Regional Edu- cational Laboratories (RELs), which is $2,000,000 more than the Sep 11 2014 22:39 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget re- quest. This program supports a network of 10 laboratories that pro-mote the use and development of knowledge and evidence to in-crease student learning and further school improvement efforts. The Committee notes the critical role RELs play in helping to translate education research to policymakers and practitioners, which assists SEAs and LEAs in implementing ESSA and pro-viding a high-quality education for more children. Research in Special Education The Committee recommends $59,500,000 for Research in Special Education, which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program supports competitive awards to produce and advance the use of knowledge to improve services and results for children with disabil-ities. The program focuses on producing new knowledge, inte-grating research and practice, and improving the use of knowledge. Special Education Studies and Evaluations The Committee recommends $21,318,000 for Special Education Studies and Evaluations, which is $10,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budg-et request. This program awards competitive grants, contracts and cooperative agreements to assess the implementation of the IDEA and the effectiveness of State and local efforts to provide special education and early intervention programs and services to infants, toddlers, and children with disabilities. Statewide Data Systems The Committee recommends $34,500,000 for Statewide Data Sys- tems, which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Competitive grants under this authority are made to SEAs to help them manage, ana-lyze, disaggregate and use student data consistent with the ESEA. Assessment The Committee recommends $212,745,000 for Assessment, which is $40,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $25,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This amount includes $7,745,000 for the National Assessment Gov-erning Board (NAGB), which is the same as both the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the only nationally representative and continuing survey of educational ability and achievement of students in the U.S. The primary goal of the assessment is to determine and report the status and trends of the knowledge and skills of students, subject by subject. Subject areas assessed in the past have included reading, writing, mathe-matics, science, history, civics, literature, art, and music. The NAEP is operated by contractors through competitive awards made by the NCES. The NAGB formulates the policy guidelines for the program. The Committee includes $25,000,000 to conduct the Civics as- sessment in 2024 and to ensure this assessment has a sufficient sample size to provide State-level data for each State to better un- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul student performance in civics. The provision of state level data from the NAEPs gives state and local education policymakers the insights into student achievement required to understand and respond to the need for civic education in the communities they serve. DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $624,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 694,115,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +70,115,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - These activities are authorized by the Department of Education Organization Act (P.L. 96-88) and include costs associated with the management and operation of the Department as well as separate costs associated with the Office for Civil Rights and the Office of Inspector General. Program Administration The Committee recommends $480,000,000 for Program Adminis- tration, which is $50,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. These funds support the staff and other costs of administering pro-grams and activities at the Department. Items include personnel compensation, health, retirement, and other benefits as well as travel, rent, telephones, utilities, postage fees, data processing, printing, equipment, supplies, technology training, consultants, and other contractual services. In addition, the American Rescue Plan Act (P.L. 117-2) included $15,000,000 for Program Administration to help implement and ad-minister grant programs supporting students and schools respond-ing to COVID-19. Advertising Contracts. \u2014The Committee understands that, as the largest advertiser in the U.S., the Federal Government should work to ensure fair access to its advertising contracts for small dis-advantaged businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women. The Committee directs the Department to include the fol-lowing information in its fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification: Expenditures for fiscal year 2021 and expected ex-penditures for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, respectively, for (1) all contracts for advertising services; and (2) contracts for the adver-tising services of (I) socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small Busi-ness Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)); and (II) women- and minority-owned businesses. Investments in Impoverished Areas. \u2014The Committee supports targeted investments in impoverished areas, particularly in per-sistent poverty counties and in other high poverty census tracts. To understand how programs funded through the Department are serving these particular areas, the Committee directs the Depart-ment to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations on the percentage of funds allocated by all competitive grant programs in fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 to serve K-12 students living in persistent poverty counties, as defined as a county that has had 20 percent or more of its population living in poverty over the past VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul as measured by the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses and the most recent Small Area Income and Poverty estimates, or any territory or possession of the United States, and high-poverty areas, as defined as any census tract with a poverty rate of at least 20 percent as measured by the 2014-2018 5-year data series avail-able from the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau. The Department shall report this information to the Committees within 90 days of such data being available and provide a briefing to the Committees not later than 180 days of enactment of this Act on how the Department is carrying out this directive. In the case of any competitive K-12 program for which at least 10 percent of the funds allocated were not allocated to persistent poverty coun-ties or for which the percentage allocated to high-poverty areas in fiscal year 2020 or 2021 was less than the average percentage of Federal assistance allocated to high-poverty areas awarded under the program in fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019, such report and briefing shall explain why such a benchmark is unable to be met. Lead Testing and Remediation. \u2014The Committee strongly agrees with recommendations from a 2018 GAO report, Lead Testing of School Drinking Water Would Benefit from Improved Federal Guidance, that the Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Sec-ondary Education should collaborate with the Environmental Pro-tection Agency (EPA) to disseminate guidance related to lead test-ing and remediation in schools. The Committee is aware that EPA has made available updated guidance and web-based toolkits for lead testing and remediation in schools. The Committee is also aware that EPA is soliciting applications from education officials to provide grant funds to assist States and local education agencies with testing and remediation efforts. The Committee appreciates the technical assistance provided by the Department to school dis-tricts in response to language included in House Report 116-62. The Committee directs the Department to continue coordinating with EPA in disseminating new guidance and resources, assisting school systems seeking to remediate lead contamination in working with EPA, and sharing best practices among States and local school systems. The Committee requests that the Department re-port on ongoing efforts on these issues in the fiscal year 2023 Con-gressional Budget Justification. Reopening Schools. \u2014In fiscal years 2020 and 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Congress provided significant Fed-eral resources for schools to sustain operations and continue pro-viding quality education to students. Much of this funding remains available to ensure schools can reopen safely and responsibly in the fall. The Committee supports efforts by the Department to ensure access to funds provided in prior fiscal years for use in reopening schools safely for all students in the fall. Defense Education and Workforce Pipeline Strategy. \u2014The Com- mittee recognizes that there are significant labor shortages in man-ufacturing, engineering, and information technology sectors and there is a need for the Federal government to support the coordina-tion of a pipeline of education and workforce development programs in early childhood, K-12, and higher education to prepare a suffi-cient national workforce. In addition, the Committee recognizes the need for greater coordination of existing federal CTE and STEAM programs and funding to support the pipeline for such high-de- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Moreover, the Committee recognizes the interdepart- mental and intergovernmental challenges the Department of Edu-cation, Department of Labor, and State, local, and tribal govern-ments face keeping track of the status of relevant program reau-thorizations, annual funding levels, grant eligibility and application processes, commonly-used terms in a field with multiple definitions across programs or funding, and data sharing practices. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Department of Education, in coordi-nation with the Department of Labor, to provide technical assist-ance to State, local, and Tribal governments to support curriculum development, instruction materials, facilities, and assessments for a pipeline of CTE, STEAM, and the intersection of CTE and STEAM programs in early childhood, K-12, and higher education to prepare a national workforce for high-demand careers in manu-facturing, engineering, and information technology. Additionally, the Committee recognizes that there is an acute need to improve the coordination of Federal efforts around the preparation of our national security and defense workforce. There-fore, the Committee strongly urges the Department of Education, including the Office of the Undersecretary, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, and Office of Career Technical and Adult Education, and the Department of Labor, including the Employ-ment and Training Administration and Veterans Employment and Training Service, to participate and coordinate as essential federal stakeholders with the Department of Defense as it leads efforts to establish a Defense Education and Workforce Pipeline Strategy. Foreign Language and Cultural Competency. \u2014The Committee is concerned that federal foreign language and cultural competency programs and funding do not adequately invest in civilian early childhood, K-12, and higher education programs. The Committee strongly encourages interdepartmental coordination between the Department of Education and the Department of Defense on the creation or modification of these programs, including efforts to es-tablish a Defense Foreign Language and Cultural Competency Education and Workforce Pipeline Strategy. National Center for Education Statistics Staffing. \u2014The Com- mittee is deeply concerned about the ongoing staffing crisis at NCES. The shortage of statisticians threatens the administration and dissemination of data collections and surveys that provide an assessment of and insight in the nation's systems of education. Furthermore, these collections and surveys guide policy and fund-ing decisions made by Congress. The Committee directs the De-partment to include an update in its fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification outlining how the Department will increase staffing at NCES as well as an analysis of funding for IES staff in an appropriations account outside of the Program Administration account. Further, the Committee directs the Department to provide quarterly updates on its efforts to carry out the staffing plan. FTE and Attrition Report. \u2014The Committee directs the Depart- ment to provide the Committees on Appropriations a report, not later than 30 days after the conclusion of each quarter, detailing the number of full-time equivalent employees and attrition by prin-cipal office and appropriations account. Protecting Scientific Research on Marihuana. \u2014Through scientific research, institutions of higher education advance our under- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 standing and knowledge of various aspects of our world. Moreover, when in the public interest, such institutions should be able to con-duct such research without fear of reprisal or loss of Federal fund-ing. This includes research on cannabis, a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. As more States and localities move to legalize cannabis, many institutions of high-er education are expanding the knowledge-base on this controlled substance. As a result, the Committee notes that such research is in the public interest, and the recommendation includes new bill language prohibiting the Department from penalizing institutions of higher education that conduct scientific research on marihuana. Open Data Formats. \u2014The Department is encouraged to take nec- essary planning steps to facilitate the publication of any informa-tion that is publicly disclosed by the Department for the purpose of comparing IHEs, programs, and credentials (including their com-petencies) using open data standards, such as formats, schemas, and description languages. Such steps should enable public search and comparison through linked public data assets. The Department is further encouraged to submit a report to the Committees, within 120 days of enactment of this Act, outlining a plan for providing such data, including any challenges, barriers to implementation, as well as anticipated costs for IHEs and the Department. Evidence-based Grants and Policy. \u2014The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on implementation of the Foundations for Evidence-based Policy-making Act (P.L. 115-435) and implementation plans for the com-ing year. The Committee encourages the Secretary to develop guid-ance to ensure relevant participants and grantees are involved in the Department-wide process of prioritizing evidence needs, includ-ing participating in Department led evaluations. Consistent with program statutes, the Committee encourages the Secretary to en-sure that evidence of effectiveness is a consideration in grant op-portunities. Film Programs at Institutions of Higher Education. \u2014The Com- mittee recognizes the importance of ensuring diversity in student populations enrolled in film programs at Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) that receive any Federal funds and grants admin-istrated by the Department of Education. The Committee encour-ages IHEs to continue building on best practices in recruitment and retention to ensure student enrollment is reflective of the American population s diverse demographics. Customer Service. \u2014The Committee continues to support efforts to improve customer service in accordance with Executive Order 13571\u2014Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service. The Committee directs the Secretary to develop standards to improve customer service and incorporate the standards into the performance plans required under 31 U.S.C. 1115. The Committee further directs the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Performance Measures. \u2014The Committee directs the Department to comply with title 31 of the United States Code, including the de-velopment of organizational priority goals and outcomes such as performance outcome measures, output measures, efficiency meas-ures, and customer service measures. The Committee further di- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Supporting Students with Disabilities. \u2014The Committee ex- presses concerns over the accommodations for education media pro-vided to students with disabilities. The Committee directs the De-partment to include information detailing accommodations for edu-cational media that are available to students with disabilities at Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) in its fiscal year 2023 Con-gressional Budget Justification. Pandemic Related Resources in Higher Education. \u2014The Com- mittee is concerned with student challenges accessing mental health services and academic or career counseling services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of this problem on student retention and performance in higher education pro-grams. The Committee directs ED and SAMHSA to provide tech-nical assistance to state governments and higher education institu-tions on the use of existing federal funds and model programs to retain high-risk students or reach students who dropped out during the COVID-19 pandemic. Impediments to First Generation Students Graduating. \u2014First generation students comprise nearly a third of all college students, yet 33 percent of first generation students drop out of college by the three year mark. Given the Department's vested interest in en-suring successful outcomes for first generation students, the Com-mittee directs the Department to include an update in its fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on barriers to first generation college students success and contributing factors that lead to first generation students not graduating from college or uni-versity. Women's Colleges & Universities. \u2014The Committee recognizes the long time role the nation's women's colleges and universities play in advancing postsecondary diversity and inclusion for underserved populations while creating unique educational opportunities to em-power women. Further, the Committee is concerned with their fi-nancial stability and institutional well-being, especially post- COVID-19. The Committee directs the Department to include, in its fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification, information on the challenges women's colleges and universities face and rec-ommend how federal resources may be best allocated to ensure their resilience. Geographical Distribution of Grants and Poverty. \u2014The Com- mittee acknowledges the value of ensuring K-12 grant competi-tions support entities across geographically diverse areas, including urban, suburban, and rural areas; however, the Committee is con-cerned that, without careful consideration and planning, efforts to prioritize specific geographical areas may have unintended nega-tive consequences. The Department's 2021 Condition on Education finds that 41 percent of students attending public schools in cities attend high-poverty schools, compared with 20 percent of students who attend schools in towns, 17 percent of students who attend suburban schools, and 15 percent of students who attend rural schools. Given the significant differences in the share of students attending high-poverty schools across areas, the Committee urges the Department to consider the socioeconomic and racial equity im- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 of prioritizing specific geographic areas over cities in competitive grants. OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $131,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 144,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +13,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for enforcing laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, na-tional origin, sex, disability, and age in all programs and institu-tions that receive funds from the Department. These laws extend to SEAs, LEAs, and IHEs, including proprietary schools. They also extend to State rehabilitation agencies, libraries, museums, and other institutions receiving Federal funds. The Committee recommendation includes $144,000,000, which is $13,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Closing of Civil Rights Cases. \u2014The Committee is concerned by the number of civil rights cases, including racial discrimination and sexual harassment, that are closed without any findings of wrong-doing or corrective action, often due to insufficient evidence. The Committee directs the Department to include in its fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification the following information, bro-ken down by jurisdiction: (1) the number of civil rights complaints evaluated; (2) the number of civil rights complaints investigated; (3) the number of civil rights complaints monitored; (4) the number of civil rights complaints that resulted in enforcement action; and, (5) the number civil rights complaints not evaluated and the reason for not evaluating. Disaggregated Data Collection and Reporting on Bullying. \u2014The Committee is concerned about rates of bullying of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students during the COVID-19 pan-demic. There have been numerous reports of students being bullied, shunned, verbally abused, and in some cases, physically as-saulted due to them being scapegoated for the spread of COVID- 19. The Committee recognizes data collections by the Department, OCR and the NCES on student bullying insufficiently reflect diver-sity of AAPI sub-ethnic groups. However, AAPIs are diverse, and the U.S. Census Bureau reports data on at least 25 distinct AAPI ethnic groups. The Committee directs the Department to collect and report data on student bullying disaggregated by all racial and ethnic groups and sub-groups identified in the American Commu-nity Survey. The Committee further directs the Department to pro-vide a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this Act if such data are unable to be collected. Title IX Resources and Remote Learning. \u2014The Committee is con- cerned with the accessibility of Title IX coordinators, offices and re-sources during the period of remote learning brought on by the pandemic. Recognizing that harassment still occurs in virtual and remote learning environments, the Committee urges the Depart-ment to analyze and report on the rate of Title IX complaints filed, the number of investigations opened, the number of resolutions reached, and the number of student complainants who received VerDate Sep 11 2014 accommodations, or other supports during the 2020-2021 academic year from their school or Title IX coordinator. Racial and Economic Segregation in Schools. \u2014The Committee di- rects the Department to submit, not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, a report to the Committee that examines levels of racial and economic segregation within the United States education system, using data collected by the De-partment of Education. The report should include a description of the methodology and results of the analysis as well as a summary of the data. The Department of Education shall continue to update the Committee regarding its timeline and process for analyzing data, disaggregated by race and ethnicity for all the main cat-egories of indicators tracked, and for releasing the report publicly. The State of Desegregation Orders. \u2014The Committee is concerned by research from the UCLA Civil Rights Project indicating that schools and school districts are becoming increasingly racially and socioeconomically segregated across the country. At the same time, there is no clear or accurate reporting or transparency on the num-ber of federal desegregation orders, the status of these orders, or the impact they have had on segregation in districts. The Com-mittee, therefore, urges the Office for Civil Rights to make a report publicly available on the Department's website, detailing a com-prehensive list of all existing federal desegregation orders in the United States, their principle requirements, and the status of the affected districts' compliance with these orders. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $63,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 70,115,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +7,115,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has authority to inquire into all program and administrative activities of the Department as well as into related activities of grant and contract recipients.

The Committee recommendation continues bill language related to the availability of funds. In addition, the American Rescue Plan Act (P.L. 117-2) included $5,000,000 for audit and oversight activities supported with funds appropriated to the Department in response to COVID-19. The Committee continues to urge the OIG to ensure its focus re- mains on the primary missions of the Office. The Committee cau-tions the Office, when receiving requests from the Department for investigations, to consider the most effective and best use of its re-sources. G ENERAL PROVISIONS Sec. 301.

The increase supports the increased living allowance for AmeriCorps State and National and VISTA members that began in fiscal year 2021 and the increased hourly stipend for AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers and daily food allowance for AmeriCorps NCCC members, to begin this fiscal year. In addition, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $770,000,000 in funding to both stabilize and expand the national service programs that have been responding to communities hard hit by COVID-19 and to increase the living allowances of partici-pants and volunteers.

Accessibility. \u2014The Committee notes the importance of making sure all workers can access the NLRB's resources, including work-ers of color, immigrant workers, workers in rural communities or with limited access to transportation, and workers with disabilities. The Committee encourages NLRB to undertake efforts to improve accessibility of NLRB offices, translate NLRB documentation and signage into languages spoken by 5 percent or more of the popu-lation in a given NLRB region, and translate the NLRB's online webpages, complaint forms, and resources to match regional needs identified. In addition, the Committee encourages NLRB to estab-lish protocols that permit workers to participate in investigations and hearings remotely where appropriate. Community-based Organizations and Partnerships. \u2014The Com- mittee believes that community-based organizations are critical in establishing necessary trust, connecting workers with agencies, fa-cilitating communication between agencies and workers, and de-ploying enforcement resources strategically. Working with commu-nity-based organizations helps agencies cooperate with workers who might be otherwise difficult to reach, including workers em-ployed by small businesses, workers with literacy challenges, work-ers with limited access to broadband, and workers in high-hazard industries most vulnerable to wage violations. Therefore, the Com-mittee urges NLRB to increase its capacity to conduct outreach and collaborate with community-based organizations. N ATIONAL MEDIATION BOARD SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $14,300,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 15,542,000 Change from ......................................................... +1,242,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +1,000,000 The National Mediation Board (NMB) is an independent agency that coordinates labor-management relations within the U.S. rail-roads and airlines industries. The Committee includes $15,542,000 for the NMB, which is $1,242,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee urges NMB to use this increase to supplement, not supplant, existing re-sources devoted to Section 3 arbitrator salaries and expenses and to address the backlog of Section 3 arbitration cases at the NMB. The Committee has prioritized these additional funds to allow the Board to better accomplish its statutory mission in a timelier man-ner. VerDate Sep 11 2014 OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH REVIEW COMMISSION SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $13,225,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 15,028,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... +1,803,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission is an independent Federal agency, providing administrative trial and ap-pellate review, created to decide contests of citations or penalties resulting from OSHA inspections of American workplaces. R AILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD DUAL BENEFITS PAYMENTS ACCOUNT Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $13,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 11,000,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... \u00a52,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - This appropriation is authorized by the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 to fund vested dual benefits received by railroad retirees who, under prior law, would have become covered by both the rail-road retirement system and the Social Security system because railroad retirement was not fully coordinated with Social Security from 1937 to 1974. The Committee includes a provision permitting a portion of these funds to be derived from income tax receipts on dual benefits as authorized by law. The Railroad Retirement Board (''RRB'') estimates that approximately $1,000,000 may be derived in this manner. FEDERAL PAYMENT TO THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $150,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... 150,000 Committee Recommendation ............................................................. 150,000 Change from enacted level ......................................................... - - - Change from budget request ...................................................... - - - LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $123,500,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 130,049,000 Change from ......................................................... +6,549,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... +5,000,000 The Committee recommends $130,049,000 for Limitation on Ad- ministration, an increase of $6,549,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. The recommendation does not include a set-aside for RRB's fully funded information technology systems modernization efforts, increasing funding for administrative expenses by $15,549,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. The increased funding is in-tended to support the critical staffing needs at RRB. In addition, the American Rescue Plan (P.L. 117-2) included $27,975,000 in funding, of which $6,800,000 increased staffing lev-els in the Bureau of Field Service and the Sickness and Unemploy-ment Benefits Sections of the Office of Programs in order to man- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 resulting from the pandemic and $21,175,000 fully funded RRB's information technology systems modernization efforts.

SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME PROGRAM Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $40,158,768,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 46,167,573,000 Change from ......................................................... +6,008,805,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a542,683,000 The Committee recommends $15,600,000,000 in advance funding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, as requested. Research and Demonstration Section 1110 of the Social Security Act provides authority to the Social Security Administration (SSA) for conducting research and demonstration projects related to SSA's programs. Within the appropriation for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), the Committee recommends $86,000,000 for research and demonstration activities, which is equal to the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Administration Within the appropriation for SSI, the Committee recommends $4,785,431,000, which is $309,097,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $42,683,000 below the fiscal year 2022 budget re-quest. This funding is for payment to the Social Security trust funds for SSI's share of the administrative expenses of SSA. LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2021 ......................................................... $11,219,945,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022 ....................................................... ............................................................. 12,219,945,000 Change from ......................................................... +1,000,000,000 Change from budget request ...................................................... \u00a5121,951,000 The Limitation on Administrative Expenses (LAE) funds the ad- ministrative and operational costs for administering the Old Age and Survivors Insurance, Disability Insurance, and Supplemental Security Income programs, and associated costs for support to the VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in administering their programs. The Committee recognizes that Social Security is an essential component of the nation's economic security, and that SSA faces unprecedented challenges as it recovers from years of underfunding and a pandemic that severely disrupted its operations, closing of-fices to most in-person visitors and generating delays in services and decisions on disability claims. The Committee provides an in-crease of not less than $650,000,000 to support frontline operations in field offices, teleservice centers, and program service centers. In addition, the recommendation includes the increase requested in the budget to replace losses and build capacity at the State Dis-ability Determination Services (DDS) agencies that make disability determinations for SSA. Within the recommended funding level, the Committee provides $89,500,000 for SSA to mail paper statements to all contributors aged 25 and older not yet receiving benefits, in accordance with Section 1143 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-13). Administrative Appeals Hearings .\u2014The Committee considers the Final Rule ''Hearings Held by Administrative Appeals Judges of the Appeals Council'' (85 Fed. Reg. 73138, December 16, 2020) to be an unjustified erosion of due process for individuals who are ap-pealing a denial of Social Security or SSI benefits. As part of a beneficiary's right to an impartial appeal process, an on-the-record hearing, conducted by an impartial judge with decisional independ-ence, must be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act to ensure due process, without agency interference, or political bias. Replacing this appeals step and the role of inde-pendent administrative law judges (ALJs) with SSA employees jeopardizes the independence of the process. In light of the harm that would be caused by this policy change, the Committee strongly urges SSA not to exercise this authority. Administrative Law Judge Selection. \u2014The Committee continues to be deeply concerned about the impact of Presidential Executive Order 13843 (July 10, 2018) on the judicial independence of admin-istrative law judges (ALJs). The Order eliminates the competitive hiring process for ALJs and has the potential impact of converting independent adjudicators to political appointees, undermining long-standing principles of fair and unbiased consideration of matters of vital importance to the American people. ALJs must be inde-pendent decision-makers and it is the Committee's expectation that SSA maintain the highest standards for appointment of ALJs. Disability Case Processing System (DCPS). \u2014The Committee re- quests regular updates on the implementation of DCPS as addi-tional States enter new phases of production and rollout schedules. The updates should include cost data and anticipated timelines for the project. The Committee urges SSA to engage stakeholders throughout the process to understand any remaining barriers to implementation. Disability Claims Backlog. \u2014The Committee recognizes that the pandemic disrupted progress SSA made with its initial disability claims backlog, and remains concerned about the adverse impacts disability claim hearings backlogs have on an individual's ability to access their Social Security benefits. Accordingly, the Committee urges the Commissioner to prioritize the hiring of additional ad- VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul and requisite staff to adjudicate backlogged claims. In addition, the Committee directs the Commissioner to continue to prioritize efforts to reduce wait time disparities across the country by directing resources and workload assistance, as nec-essary, and to provide the Committee annual reports on efforts to reduce the hearing backlog for Hearing Offices in the bottom twen-ty of national ranking by average processing time. Disability Determinations .\u2014The Committee is concerned about the time it takes SSA to effectuate favorable SSI and/or SSDI dis-ability determinations and directs SSA to submit a report to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this Act, on SSA's pro-cedures for paying past-due and ongoing benefits after a claimant has been found disabled. The report should include the average number of calendar days from the date of the favorable decision to the date of the first monthly payment, and the average number days from favorable decision until retroactive benefits are paid (the first installment, for SSI payable in installments) for SSI, SSDI, and concurrent claims for each of the past five years plus the cur-rent year to date. The report should also discuss trends in effec-tuation time with respect to monthly benefits and past due benefits for claims awarded upon initial application and at other stages of appeal, the number of claimants who died between award and ef-fectuation each year, and any performance goals or initiatives SSA has regarding effectuating favorable decisions with respect to monthly benefits and past due benefits. Evaluation and Statistics Retirement and Disability Research Consortium (RDRC). \u2014The Committee supports the interdiscipli- nary extramural research program being conducted at the Retire-ment and Disability Research Consortium, and is particularly in-terested in the RDRC conducting more studies on financial insecu-rity, the role of social insurance and how public programs can bet-ter address wealth and income inequality facing vulnerable fami-lies. The Committee provides an additional $4,000,000 to increase funding at all four centers by $1,000,000 to allow for an increase in the number of projects across the RDRCs. Guardianship Report. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the sharp rise in fraud perpetrated against senior citizens who are wrongly brought under guardianship or have their assets, including Social Security payments, mismanaged, or stolen. The Committee directs SSA to submit a report to the Committee, within 180 days of enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, on the number of Social Security payments that are being diverted to non-family members as representative payees, and the number of cases of mis-use of benefits by non-family members as representative payees, as identified by SSA directly or through the representative payee monitoring program authorized under section 101 of the Strength-ening Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2018, bro-ken down by State. Information Technology. \u2014The Committee continues to monitor the Information Technology (IT) Modernization Plan and encour-ages SSA to focus on improvements to customer service and effi-ciency improvements for customers and employees as it makes up-dates to the plan. In addition, SSA should take steps to automate manual processes to reduce human error and improve processing VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 Jul The Committee requests an update of the plan referenced under this heading in House Report 114-699. Legal Assistants. \u2014The Committee understands that the Office of Hearings Operations (OHO) relies on legal assistants to conduct a broad range of work supporting hearings and reviewing work of its administrative law judges, and is concerned about reports that OHO recently consolidated duties from several specialized legal as-sistants, causing affected employees to perform more duties with-out increased compensation. The Committee strongly urges SSA to examine the position descriptions of legal assistants, pay and ac-tual work conducted since the consolidation, to ensure that job clas-sifications, and compensation, are commensurate with current du-ties. Pilot Program Metrics. \u2014The Committee expects SSA to continue to follow the guidance and directives under this heading in House Report 116-450 for fiscal year 2022, and to include descriptions of pilots and associated pilot program metrics in its fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. Professional Representatives. \u2014The Committee believes that qual- ity representation in matters with SSA assists claimants and bene-ficiaries, and can also help SSA work more accurately and effi-ciently. The Committee continues to support direct payment of fees to representatives, encourages the Commissioner to raise and index the cap on fees payable via fee agreement, and requests that the Commissioner add a Performance Measure on timely and accurate payment of representative fees to the Fiscal Year 2022 and subse-quent Annual Performance Plans. Report on LAE Expenditures. \u2014The Committee continues to re- quest that the data referenced under this heading in House Report 114-699 be included in future budget justifications. In addition, the Committee requests the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Jus-tification include a historical table of costs and fiscal year 2023 re-quests for personnel and benefits, by major SSA component to in-clude Operations (field offices, teleservice centers, processing cen-ters, and regional offices); Office of Hearings Operations; Systems; Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight; and Headquarters. Service to the Public. \u2014SSA uses Public Service Indicators to measure the agency's progress in meeting the needs of the public in local field offices and teleservice centers. The Committee under-stands that SSA has modified Public Service Indicators to reflect challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee directs SSA to submit to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act a report on Public Service Indicators for field offices and teleservice centers, providing the indicators and performance for Fiscal Years 2016 to 2021 and describing how the agency sets and modifies indicators, any changes made by the agency due the pan-demic, and any staffing needs and resources necessary in its field offices and teleservice centers to restore previous levels of public service. Telework. \u2014The Committee reiterates its support for well-man- aged telework programs in the Federal workplace, which have dem-onstrated benefits for human capital as well as continuity of oper-ations. The Committee expects SSA to implement telework policies that support these goals while also strengthening service to the American public, including in-person service in community-based VerDate Sep 11 2014 field offices. The Committee directs SSA to submit a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act detailing the agency's telework policies and identifying any positions for which telework has not been provided or has been reduced from pre-October 2019 levels, along with the reasons for any telework reductions. Video Hearings. \u2014The Committee understands that during the COVID-19 pandemic, SSA is providing claimants with the option of a video hearing, a telephone hearing, or a postponement if the individual would prefer to wait until an in-person hearing is avail-able. The Committee expects that once the COVID-19 pandemic ends, SSA will resume in-person hearings. The Committee con-tinues to encourage SSA to work with claimants who need addi-tional flexibility by allowing a claimant to choose to use video and telephone hearings on a voluntary basis or to have an in-person hearing or proceeding if the party chooses to do so. Work Incentives Planning and Assistance (WIPA) and Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security (PABSS). \u2014The recommendation includes $23,000,000 for WIPA grants and $10,000,000 for PABSS. The Committee notes that Federal Protec-tion and Advocacy (P&A) systems provide legal representation to people with disabilities in civil matters to protect and enforce their legal, civil, and human rights. The Committee understands that SSA recently changed security clearance requirements for staff that charge time to PABSS programs. Given the Federal and State laws required for P&A staff, the Committee urges SSA to reconsider changes that would require P&A staff to undergo any unnecessary SSA security clearances, so that they may be treated like any other attorney representing a person on SSA benefits. Social Security Advisory Board The Committee recommends $2,700,000 for the Social Security Advisory Board (SSAB), $200,000 above the fiscal year 2021 en-acted level and equal to the fiscal year 2022 budget request. User Fees In addition to the other amounts provided, the Committee rec- ommends $139,000,000 for administrative activities funded from user fees. Of this amount, $138,000,000 is derived from fees col-lected from States that request SSA to administer State SSI sup-plementary payments. The remaining $1,000,000 is derived from fees charged to non-attorneys who apply for certification to rep-resent claimants under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. Continuing Disability Reviews and Redeterminations The Committee recommends $1,708,000,000 for program integ- rity activities. This includes the maximum cap adjustment author-ized in the terms of section 1(k) of H. Res. 467 of the 117th Con-gress as engrossed in the House of Representatives on June 14, 2021. The bill includes language allowing for the transfer of up to $12,100,000 to the Office of the Inspector General for the cost of jointly operating co-operative disability investigation units.

To accomplish this mission, the OIG directs, conducts, and supervises audits, evaluations, and investigations relating to SSA's programs and operations. In addi-tion, the OIG searches for and reports on systemic weaknesses in SSA programs and operations, and makes recommendations for needed improvements and corrective actions. The bill includes $2,000,000, as requested, for information tech- nology modernization. TITLE V\u2014GENERAL PROVISIONS (TRANSFER OF FUNDS) Sec. 501.

FY 2021 Enacted -14 +11,112,288 (523) MINORITY VIEWS We appreciate the efforts of the Majority in producing a Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS) Appropriations bill that includes funding priorities of Members on both sides of the aisle. Despite the many good pro-grams supported in the bill, Republicans oppose this measure. In its current form, this bill is simply too extreme and out of step with the American people. First, the bill provides an unprecedented 36 percent, $60 billion, increase in funding over current levels. Instead of focusing on ur-gent priorities for all Americans, such as getting everyone back to work and back to school, the Majority party has followed the Presi-dent's unrealistic request in many areas and has also elevated con-troversial social policies in this bill. They have chosen to fund new, unauthorized programs over pressing needs like strengthening our national defense and bolstering tools to address and manage the crisis at our southern border. With China and Russia growing their militaries by the day, such a move is deeply misguided. The most egregious policy change included in this measure is the removal of the Hyde Amendment, which protects life and prevents federal taxpayer-funded abortions. Since it was first enacted in 1976, it is estimated that this provision has saved more than two million lives while protecting the conscience rights of the great ma-jority of Americans who are opposed to publicly funded abortions for religious, moral, or fiscal reasons. Republicans offered an amendment in full committee markup to reinstate the important Hyde language, as well as the language known as the ''Weldon Amendment'' that protects American doc-tors, nurses, and other health care professionals from participating in an abortion if they have a moral objection. The amendment was cosponsored by every Republican on the Committee, and Members made it clear in vigorous debate that the reinstatement of this lan-guage is the first step that must be taken to begin work toward a serious negotiation on a final spending bill. Disappointingly, the amendment to reinstate the Hyde/Weldon language was opposed by Committee Democrats and was defeated. Without agreement to in-clude this longstanding bipartisan provision, any serious discussion about the numerous other policy and spending problems in this measure is premature. Beyond the extreme position taken to require all Americans to pay for abortion on demand, and even requiring some people to di-rectly participate in abortions against their own moral beliefs and consciences, the bill as reported includes many other troubling poli-cies and provisions as well. Many of these are poison pills that must also be removed to achieve a final bipartisan spending agree-ment. VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:39 For example, the bill as drafted includes several new troubling and extreme labor policy riders, including language restricting tem-porary employment certifications (H2-B visas) for certain compa-nies. We were pleased that the Committee accepted a Republican amendment to strike the most concerning of these provisions that would have significantly harmed many seasonal and small busi-nesses by preventing them from meeting their workforce needs through the H-2B program. Republicans have numerous policy and programmatic concerns about this bill, as well as serious disagreements over the funding provided, which must be addressed. Including the longstanding bi-partisan Hyde/Weldon language related to abortions will be the first step in any negotiation\u2014it is just that simple. We urge the Majority to reverse course and not proceed with a bill that contains farreaching, extreme policies that are out of step with the Amer-ican people. In the weeks and months ahead, we hope the Majority will move toward the compromise they know is necessary to fund the govern-ment. Without a bipartisan agreement, this bill and other spending bills will not become law and our country could be forced into a year-long continuing resolution. Our goal should be to avoid that outcome and build on the progress we have made in the past by working together. K AYGRANGER . TOMCOLE. \u00c6 "}
