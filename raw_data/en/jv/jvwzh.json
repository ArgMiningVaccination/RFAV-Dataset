Palliative care focuses on several objectives including relief of symptoms and suffering, communication of prognosis and treatment options in the context of patients' goals, and coordination of care within and across healthcare settings. Palliative care is not synonymous with hospice or end- of-life care. Rather, palliative care addresses the spectrum of care for serious illness from diagnosis through terminal stages of diseases. Moreover, palliative care does not necessarily entail withholding or curbing treatment. Relief of symptoms, enhancing quality of life, and many other specific aspects of goal - concordant care may, in fact, involve optimal medical or surgical treatment of diseases. The expected outcome of integrating palliative care into the management of the patient's disease is a better quality of life, a realistic understanding of risks and benefits of treatment and interventions, and medical treatment decisions that align with the patient's goals, preferences, and values. Many heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) diseases, including heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, cystic life- limiting, non-curable illnesses. These and other HLBS diseases may benefit from care focused on improvement of symptoms and quality of life, in addition to care focused on slowing or halting progression of diseases. Integration of palliative care into cardiology, pulmonary, hematology, and critical care practice is recommended by multiple professi onal societies. 32NIH Funding Opportunities SPIN ID Program Title Sponsor Name Sponsor Number Deadline Date Funding Amount NIH Funding Opportunities Due: Jan 2021 Additionally, symptoms of HLBS diseases such as cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue may be especially burdensome, even in diseases that are not life-limiting.

However, such studies do not generally show which specific variants in genomic elements cause these effects, or how they result in differences in function. Similarly , genomic sequencing studies in clinical settings have identified many variants in healthy and diseased individuals. However, the pathogenicity of such variants is often unknown, leading to their classification as variants of uncertain significance (VUS), which makes clinical implementation difficult. This Program Announcement, which has companion R21 and R01 Program Announcements, aims to support the development of novel and generalizable commercial approaches to study how genetic variants lead to differences in function and to study how such functional differences affect human health and disease processes or how this knowledge can be used clinically. 100014 RFA-AI-20-055 -- Understanding Evolutionary Dynamics of Influenza to Inform and Improve Vaccine Strain Selection (R01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/NIH/DHHS RFA-AI- 20-055 11-Jan-2021 [Optional][LOI/Pre -App] Ph.D. Contact Telephone 301-761-6710 Contact Email brooke.bozick@nih.gov Sponsor Website Program URL Link to program URL Deadline Dates (ALL) 11-Jan-2021 [Optional][LOI/Pre -App], 11-Feb-2021 Synopsis The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support research to improve understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of seasonal influenza to increase our capacity to predict the emergence of new antigenic variants and more accurately select strains for use in the seasonal influenza vaccine. 100046 RFA-AI-20-057 -- Understanding the Role of the M.

Hamlet, PhD Contact Telephone 301-496-9623 Contact Email hamletm@mail.nih.gov Sponsor Website Program URL Link to program URL Deadline of the Research Enhancement Award Program (REAP) for Health Professional Schools and Graduate Schools is to stimulate basic and clinical research in educational institutions that provide baccalaureate or advanced degrees for a significant number of the Nation's research scientists, but that have not been major recipients of NIH support. REAP grants create opportunities for scientists and health professional institutions otherwise unlikely to participate extensively in NIH research programs to contribute to the Nation's biomedical and behavioral research effort. REAP grants are intended to support small- scale research projects proposed by faculty members of eligible, domestic institutions, to expose undergraduate and/or graduate students at health professional schools or graduate schools to meritorious research projects, and to strengthen the research environment of the applicant institution. ligible institutions (e.g., the university or college with a unique identifier number (such as DUNS) and a unique NIH Institutional Profile File (IPF) number)) must award NIH-relevant baccalaureate or advanced degrees in health professions and have received no more than $6 million per year of NIH support (in both direct and F&A/indirect costs) in 4 of the last 7 fiscal years. For institutions composed of multiple schools and colleges, the $6 million funding limit is based on the amount of NIH funding received by the institution as a whole (meaning all schools and colleges within an institution). In other words, the funding for a ll the institution's health professional schools, graduate schools, and colleges and all the institution's non-health professional schools and colleges that are part of the institution are considered together and summed as total NIH funding when determinin g institutional eligibility. For institutions with multiple campuses, eligibility can be considered for each individual campus (e.g. main, satellite, etc.) only if a unique identifier number or NIH IPF number is established for each campus. For institution s that use one identifier number or NIH IPF number for all campuses, eligibility is determined for all campuses (e.g. main, satellite, etc.) together. This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) supports investigator- initiated mechanistic and/or minimal risk clinical trials addressing the mission and research interests of the participating NIH institutes. Minimal risk clinical trials are defined as those that do not require FDA oversight, do not intend to formally establish efficacy, and have low risks to potentially cause physical or psychological harm. 098057 RFA-AG-21-021 -- Paul B.
