Tapping into the energy of abundance is a practice, and there are rituals and concrete actions you can take to practice opening yourself up to more of this potent energy. Attuning our energy to that of abundance through intentional practices and rituals makes it easier to call in what we desire and cultivate a deeper appreciation for what is already around us. Here are some of our favorite ways to access and facilitate more magnetic energy in your life. The energy of [appreciation](https://chopra.com/articles/the-neuroscience-behind-gratitude-how-does-cultivating-appreciation-affect-your-brain) helps magnetize us to attract more abundance. A gratitude practice is a powerful way to cultivate the energy of appreciation and recognize the abundance that surrounds us, while attracting more of what we desire. Create a habit of [gratitude](https://chopra.com/articles/6-proven-benefits-of-gratitude) journaling regularly. Write down five things you experienced recently that you are grateful for, taking a few moments to close your eyes and feel the energy of appreciation as you think of each item on your list. Do this a few times a week to open your heart and attract the kind of abundance you want into your life. Alters are powerful means of worshiping and calling in our desires. Think of what abundance feels and looks like to you. A bouquet of fresh flowers could make you feel abundant, or your favorite body oil. It could also be a certain kind of stone or your favorite quote. Compile a few items that feel like and signify what abundance means for you. Create an [altar](https://chopra.com/articles/8-vastu-altars-for-well-being-and-fulfillment) with these items somewhere you will see them regularly. Spend time appreciating the altar and tapping into how these items make you feel as you open your heart to receive. Our divine masculine is the part of us that is responsible for a healthy relationship to finances and material goods. If more financial freedom is the kind of abundance you're trying to call in, tending to your masculine side may be a good idea. A healthy [masculine](https://chopra.com/articles/how-to-balance-your-female-and-male-energy) energy can look like discipline, consistency, and healthy organization. Take note where in your life you may be slacking in those areas, and how you could invite some more structure and stability into your life to call in what you have been working toward. Meditation is a powerful way to lift our vibration and make us an energetic match for new aligned experiences. Dedication to a meditation practice helps us tap into the frequency of abundance and feel our best. Carve out time at least a few times a week to sit in silence with your breath, or try our creating abundance meditation program on the Chopra app. Abundance can look and feel different for everyone. While trying to cultivate more abundance in your life, it is important to take the time to appreciate the good that already surrounds you. Commit to cultivating this energy in a way that feels good to you and open your heart to receive.
