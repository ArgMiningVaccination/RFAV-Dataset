It is an Ayurvedic practice, in which edible oil is swished around the mouth and spat out. As per Ayurveda, the practice of oil pulling improves your oral and nasal immunity. It hydrates the mucus membrane which in turn protects you from the onslaught of bacteria, virus and fungus. It may also help reduce bad breath and prevent cavities. For oil pulling, take 1 table spoon sesame or coconut oil in mouth. Do not drink, swish in the mouth for 2-3 minutes and spit it off followed by warm water rinse.
