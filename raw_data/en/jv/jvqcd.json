Giussani Meeting Director September 2016 I am both proud and delighted to welcome you all to Cambridge for this 43rd International Annual Meeting of the Fetal and Neonatal Physiological Society. Cambridge is renowned, worldwide, as a seat of learning and it is entirely appropriate that this should be the venue for us to gather and exchange ideas on a range of topics relating to pregnanc y, maternal and infant health. In addition, the meeting celebrates the centenary of Sir Joseph Barcroft's research. An exciting scientific programme has been put together by the Organising Committee and this will be held in the Physiological Laboratory, wh ere Barcroft taught and worked. We were extremely gratified to note the record number of very high standard abstracts that were submitted. As a result, I am confident that our Meeting will be both informative as well as enjoyable. For those among you who have not previously visited Cambridge, I urge you to explore as much as possible. Situated in the rural East of England, and with its unique setting on the banks of the River Cam, Cambridge is one of the most beautiful cities in England. The University, wh ich comprises 31 separate colleges, incorporates some magnificent architecture - Kings College Chapel being a prime example. Cambridge has always enjoyed a reputation for being at the forefront of scientific research, and today it is also considered as a t hriving centre for hi -tech industries. I hope that all delegates leave at the end of the Meeting with excellent memories and a strong wish to visit again. In closing, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Kristin Giussani, the Meeting Organiser and to my colleagues on the Local Organising Committe e, whose input was invaluable. Many thanks also to our sponsors, whose generosity has contributed greatly to the quality of this event. I would also like to thank Dr Zhongchao Wang, Mr Christian Beck and Mr Roberto Ichingolo for their invaluable help with the website. 2 0 1 6 FNPS Mission Statement 4 The FNPS stimulates discussion and exchange of ideas between physiologists, obstetricians and neonatologists. The FNPS considers an informal gathering and presentations of new and preliminary data, especially by investigators in training, essential to achieve goals. The Society was founded in 1974 during an informal meeting in Oxford. Professor Geoffrey Dawes (1918 -1996) and Dr. Gerhard (Bo) Genn ser took the initiative and were made honorary members of the society in 1995. The name of the annual conference (and society) has changed several times, reflecting the widening scope of the society: 1974 -80 Conference on Fetal Breathing 1981 -83 Interna tional Conference on Fetal Breathing and other Movements 1984 -95 Society for the Study of Fetal Physiology 1996 -date Fetal and Neonatal Physiological Society Over the years the society has maintained its informal character and a lack of rigid structure s. Those who have attended at least one of the previous three meetings are members of the society and will be informed about the next meeting. Abstracts for the Annual Meeting are requested two months before the meeting and are compiled in the Book of Abst racts to encourage recent and preliminary data to be presented. The Organizational Coordinator will be selected by the Organizational Committee and shall serve the three years. The Organizational Committee shall consist of representatives from Africa, Asi a, Australia, Canada, continental Europe, South America, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and shall be selected by the committee. The Annual Meeting will be held in Europe, North America and the Southern Hemisphere, in June -September, a s determined by the Organizational Committee. Approximately half of the meetings will be held in Europe. Any residual funds from the prior meeting shall be passed on to the coordinator for the next meeting. Audit will not be required if the residual funds are less than 10,000 US$. The (local) Organizing Committee shall have the right to solicit funds in the name of the Society from organizations for the purpose of providing financial support for students and fellow -in-training to attend the meeting of the society. In Memoriam Dr. Julian T. (Bill) Parer (1934 -2016) 5 With great sadness I report to the Society that Professor Julian T (Bill) Parer, MD, PhD passed away on August 3 2016 while hiking with his dog on Mt. Tamalpais, near Phoenix Lake in Marin, California. Bill was born in Australia as the third of 4 boys to Stan and Irene Parer. He obtained a Bachelor of Agricultural Science degree from Melbourne University, a Master of Rural Science degree from the University of New England (Armidale, New South Wales). Bill then moved to the United States, whe re he received his PhD from Oregon State University in 1965 and an MD from the University of Washington in Seattle in 1971. He studied maternal and fetal physiology under the mentorship of Dr. James Metcalfe of the University of Oregon, and trained under Drs. Edward J. Quilligan and Edward Hon at the University of Southern California. After completing his OBGYN residency at the University of Southern California, Bill joined the faculty of the Department of OBGYN and Reproductive Sciences at the University o f California, San Francisco in 1974 as a perinatologist and a researcher, reaching the rank of Professor in 1982. He was the Director of the Division of Maternal -Fetal Medicine at UCSF, and for 33 years was in charge of the Maternal -Fetal Medicine Fellowsh ip at UCSF. Bill was a leading academic in the field of perinatal biology and medicine and a member of the FNPS for the past 40 years. Bill served as President of the Society from 2002 -2004 and as Scribe from 2005 -2007. Bill's research focused on fetal ph ysiology, with an emphasis on fetal responses to hypoxia and asphyxia, oxygen transport in pregnancy, fetal heart rate monitoring, and on the effects of high altitude on pregnancy and programming of pulmonary hypertension. Bill had long standing collaborat ions with Dr. Tomoaki Ikeda, University of Mie, Japan, and Dr Anibal Llano s of the Universidad de Chile. His pursuits resulted in more than 230 manuscripts and book chapters. He also cared for thousands of high -risk pregnant women in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond, providing perinatal care and unique services such as intrauterine fetal transfusion and abdominal cerclage. Bill created and directed a continuing medical education course for 40 years on antepartum and intrapartum management, which attrac ted attendees from around the globe. Bill was truly passionate about his clinical and scientific work, and served as a role model to many of us in the field and in our Society who were fortunate to work with hi m and/or to be trained by him. In addition to his highly significant scientific contributions, we will all remember Bill sitting in the front row at meetings, wearing shorts and a baseball cap, making incisive contributions while being extremely supportive to young investigators. He was an accomplish ed mountaineer and avid hiker, a fun -loving person and one of our greatest friends. Sincerely, Dino A.

Abstract 1 Glucocorticoids and programming of the fetal brain: multigenerational outcomes 39 Matthews, S.G. Departments of Physiology, Ob -Gyn and Medicine, Fraser Mustard Institute for Human Development, University of Toronto The developing fetal brain is responsive to endocrine, nutritional and chem ical cues. Glucocorticoids (GC) are critical for normal brain development and are tightly regulated at low levels for most of pregnancy in the fetus. Levels increase rapidly near term; a surge that is critical for lung development and maturation of other o rgan systems including the brain. We have shown that there are profound epigenetic changes in the developing hippocampu s at the time of the GC surge. Fetal GC levels can be elevated earlier in gestation as a result of maternal or fetal stress. In addition, a substantial number of human fetuses are exposed to high levels of synthetic glucocorticoid (sGC), in cases of threatened preterm birth. Fetal overexposure to GC can result in life -long changes in the regulation of hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) fu nction and behaviours in the offspring of several species. In animal models, these programming effects are associated with profound modification of the hippocampal and hypothalamic transcriptomes and epigenomes. Further, prenatal exposure to GC can have tr ansgenerational effects on growth, HPA function and behaviours. Importantly, effects of GC on endocrine function and behaviour appear to be paternally Abst ract 2 The TLR7 agonist from damage after asphyxia in the preterm fetal sheep 40 Department of Physiology, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand Dhillon SK, Gunn AJ, Jung Y, Mathai S, Bennet L, Fraser M 2015 Developm ental Neuroscience 37(6):497 -514.

Cell numbers are mean \u00b1 SEM. p< 0.05: and Fraser, M . Introduction: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), key regulators of innate immunity, are involved in brain injury both after infectious and non -infectious insults. While TLR activation, in particular that of TLR4, appears detrimental to the immature brain, our re cent studies have identified a candidate TLR pathway for protection involving upregulation of cerebral TLR7 (1). In the present study, we examined the potential of the TLR7 agonist, Gardiquimod (GDQ) to ameli orate cell profound asphyxia in preterm fetal sheep. Methods: Fetal sheep at 0.7 gestation (days 103 -104; term ~ 145 days) received a continuous intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of GDQ (1.11 mg/hour; GDQ -occlusion, n = 5) or vehicle (vehicle -occlusion, n = 9; vehicle sham -occlusion, n = 9) at a rate of 11.1\u00b5l/minute for 3 hours commencing 60 minutes after the end of a 25 minute umbilical cord occlusion (UCO). After 3 days recovery in utero, sheep were killed. Results : In the perive ntricular and intragyral white matter, GDQ improved survival of immature and mature oligodendrocytes (CNPase) and total oligodendrocytes (Oligo -2) -3) and astroglial activation (GFAP) (P < 0.05) . In regions of the grey matter, GDQ improved neuronal survival (P < 0.05) in the caudate nucleus, but not the putamen or the CA1/2, CA3, CA4, DG regions of the hippocampus and the thalamic nucleus. Conclusions: In conclusion, our studies provide the first evidence that in the preterm fetal sheep therapeutic manipulation through TLR7 signalling can reduce white matter damage, offering the potential to preserve myelination in a physiological manner. Further studie s, are needed to identify TLR7 signalling downstream mechanisms of protection and to assess the impact of GDQ on the development of the normal and injured preterm brain.

Alt hough magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used as a means to diagnose WMI, histopathological features of MRI signal abnormalities are not well understood. The aim of the current study was to determine the correlation between MRI signal abnormaliti es and histologically defined of intrauterine inflammation, haemodynamic insult, or sham surgery, underwent MRI within two hours after euthanasia. Th e gestational age and the body weight at MRI were 108.7 \u00b1 5.1 days and 1.51 \u00b1 0.50 kg, respectively (mean \u00b1 SEM). Subsequently, brains were perfusion -fixed, removed, and processed for histopathological examinations. WMI was determined histologically on the level of the frontal lobe, the anterior basal ganglia, the mammillary bodies, and the occipital lobe. Whether MRI could detect the histologically defined WMI lesions was statistically analysed. Results : Histologically, 9 foetuses had WMI lesions, whereas 8 foetuses had no WMI lesions in the brain. MRI showed signal abnormalities (high intensity lesions on T1 -weighted images and low intensity lesions on T2 -weighted images) in all the foetuses with WMI, whereas no signal abnormalities were detected in any foetuses without WMI (p < 0.01). While 87 lesions of coagulation necrosis were determined histologically, 80 lesions were detected with MRI (92.0%). Conclusions: It was suggested that WMI induced prenatally by intrauterine inflammation or haemodynamic insult could be accurately diagnosed with MRI at birth. Figure 1. MR Image and microgram of WMI.

Decreased complexity has been associated to aging and poor outcome. We applied Multiscale Entropy analysis to assess the complexity of systemic signals and the complexity of various cerebral near -infrared spectroscopy derived parameters. We further correlated the complexity index (CoI) of brain and system ic signals with outcome. Methods: Prospective observational study of 61 preterm infants with a median (range) gestation age (GA) of 26 (23 - 31) weeks with an indwelling arterial catheter. All infants were studied before 24 hours of age, following parenta l consent. A NIRS sensor (Hamamatsu Photonics, KK, Japan) was placed on the infant's temporoparietal area of the head. NIRS signals as oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO 2), deoxygenated haemoglobin (Hb), tissue oxygenation index (TOI) and tissue haemoglobin index (THI) and systemic signals as continuous mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), heart rate (HR) and arterial saturation (SaO 2) were collected using ICM+ software. Results Lower CoI -HbO 2, CoI -Hb and CoI -TOI those infants who developed intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) compared to those who did not and CoI -THI were lower in those infants who died compared to those who survived (P=0.002, P=0.004 and P=0.003, respectively). Co mplexity of HbO 2 was an independent predictor of IVH (P=0.010) and mortality (P=0.047). CoI -MABP was the only complexity index of systemic signals associated with outcome. Conclusions: This is the first study to apply Multiscale Entropy to assess the comp lexity of cerebral near-infrared signals in preterm infants. The results from our cohort revealed that decreased complexity of brain signals recorded within the first 24 hours of life was associated with mortality and brain injury in this population. Furt hermore, the complexity index of brain signals had better correlation with outcome than the complexity index of systemic physiological signals. Figure 1.

Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, New Zealand Introduction: Current hypothermia protocols for term infants affected by hypoxic -ischemic encephalopath y are incompletely neuroprotective. erythropoietin (rh -EPO) is neuroprotective through non -hematopoietic mechanisms. However, it remains unclear whether combined treatment with delayed cerebral hypothermia plus rh -EPO can further improve neural outcomes. Methods: Term -equivalent fetal sheep (at 0.8 gestation) received 30 min of global cerebral ischemia. From 3 to 72 hours after ischemia fetuses received either normothermia plus vehicle loading dose, then 5000 IU/kg every 6 hours, n=8), or combination treatment with plus rh-EPO (ischemia -EPO -hypo, n=8). after cerebral ischemia. Results: Cerebral ischemia was associated with marked neuronal induction of microglia in the parasagittal cortex. inductio n (p<0.01) in the parasagittal cortex, with greater overall recovery of EEG power and spectral edge frequency from 48 hours onwards (p<0.001). Ischemia -EPO was associated with of Iba1 -positive microgli a (p<0.001), and faster recovery of spectral edge frequency but not EEG power from 120 hours onwards, compared to ischemia -control (p<0.05). Ischemia -EPO -hypo was ischemia -hypo for any outcome. Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that delayed cerebral hypothermia and recombinant human erythropoietin are independently neuroprotective, but that delayed induction of combined hypothermia and rh -EPO after global cerebral is not associated with additive neuropr otection in near-term fetal sheep.

Abst ract 6 Effects of intrauterine growth restriction on brain development 47 Mallard , C. Perinatal Center, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology , Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Sweden Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), broadly describes the fetus that does not grow to its genetic potential and is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth and perinatal death. Furthermore, IUGR is strongly linked to neurodevelopmental deficits in surviving infants. Although the aetiology of IUGR is not fully understood, placental insufficien cy is considered an important underlying factor, where it leads to fetal hypoxemia and reduced nutrient availability. The spectrum of brain abnormalities associated with IUGR in the human is heterogeneous, probably reflecting the timing and severity of the in utero compromise. Late -onset IUGR is the most common form, where the compromise to the fetus becomes apparent in the third trimester of pregnancy. In IUGR, fetal growth is often asymmetric with a relative sparing of brain growth in relation to the grow th of the body. However, despite the relative sparing of brain growth, IUGR is often associated with both brain structural and functional deficits. In this seminar I will review experimental evidence that demonstrate the effects of IUGR on fetal brain development and potential underlying mechanisms. Abst ract 7 Development of neurovascular coupling in the fetal sheep and newborn lamb 48 Nakamaura S1,2, Walker D.2, Wong F.Y.1,3,4 1Department of P aediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan. 2 The Ritchie Cent re, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, 3 Department of Paediatrics, Monash University, Melbourne, 4 Monash Newborn, Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Aus tralia Introduction: Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is an important mechanism that provides increased cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygenation in response to increased neural activity. NVC has been extensively studied in animal and clinical studies, in both adult and paediatric populations. To date, there is no animal model of neurovascular coupling available for the fetal and preterm brain, and there is limited understanding of the perinatal development of NVC. We aimed to characterise the development o f NVC in the fetal and newborn sheep brain by measuring changes in cerebral oxy- and deoxy -haemoglobin (oxyHb and scalp EEG electrodes optodes were positioned bilaterally over the somatosensory cortex of fetal (128 -132 days gestation; n=7) and neonatal (4 -8 days old; n=8) sheep, and the left median nerve was stimulated via a cuff by trains of electrical pulses (3 -8mA, 2msec) of 3 diffe rent durations (1.8, 4.8 & 7.8s). The somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), oxyHb and deoxyHb were recorded. Results : In the fetuses, 1.8s stimulation always increased oxyHb in the contralateral cortex (a positive functional response, figure 1), whereas more prolonged stimulation (4.8s, 7.8s) mostly produced either a sustained decrease in contralateral oxyHb (negative response), or a biphasic response in which oxyHb showed an initial reduction followed by a later rise (4.8s: 86%; 7.8s: 75% of all stimu lations). In contrast, in neonatal lambs, 7.8s stimulation mostly produced positive response with increase in contralateral oxyHb (63% of all stimulations). The SEP pattern was unaltered by duration of stimuli. Conclusions: Prolonged somatosensory stimulation induced decreased cerebral oxygenation in the fetal brain, but increased cerebral oxygenation in the neonatal brain. Our results suggest immature NVC in the fetal brain, where oxygen delivery may not match the increased cerebral oxygen consumpt ion that occurs with neural activation. Figure 1.

A. 1, Chang, E. 1, Rodriguez, M. 2, Triplett, E. 2 & Wood, C. 1 1Department of Physiology and Functional Genomics, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, USA. 2Department of Microbiology & Cell Science, University of Florida Institute of F ood and Agricultural Sciences, Gainesville, FL, USA Introduction: Our lab has previously reported that fetal HH produces a robust inflammatory response characterized by an upregulation of inflammatory markers, and aggregation of macrophages in different brain regions, and other peripheral organs. Based on the interpretation of these results, we hypothesize that bacterial colonization is the main cause for this inflammatory cascade and cells infiltration in the brain cortex of fetuses subjected to HH. Meth ods: We used a total of 16 brain cortex and placenta samples of fetuses exposed to HH or normoxia (n=8 per group). Paraffin embedded brain cortex tissues were sectioned (5 um) and stained using the Gram technique for bacterial detection. Placenta and brain cortex snapped frozen samples were culture in brain heart infusion media, and collected for Gram staining and Sanger sequencing. DNA was extracted from brain cortex tissues for metagenomics sequencing. Results : We detected Gram (+) and, mostly, gram ( -) populations on bacteria in the histological brain cortex sections on the HH group, and this was validated (same morphology) by Gram staining of the harvested live bacterial colonies obtained from the cultured samples. HH placenta tissues also showed bacteri al colonies with very similar characteristics than the ones obtained from the HH brain samples. Sanger and metagenomics sequencing confirmed that predominant bacteria found in brain and placenta of fetuses subjected to HH belong to the Staphylococcus and Shigella genera . Other types of and Pseudomona . Normoxic brain and placenta tissues did not show any type of bacterial populations, and had negative results from Sanger or metagenomics sequencing. Conclusi ons: We conclude that HH induces bacterial invasion in the fetal cerebral cortex and placenta, particularly Staphylococcus and Shigella strains. This might lead to the activation of the immune system (macrophage aggregation), and inflammatory pathways prev iously observed in our work. The origin of this bacteria species and how they reach the fetal environment remains unclear and it might involve a maternal component. Figure 1. Bacterial Identification in fetal brain samples.

As a novel therapy, umbilical cord blood (UCB) stem cells could improve the structure and function of the brain. We investigated the effects of UCB cells in a fetal ovine model of FGR. Methods: Umbilical cord blood from term healthy sheep pregnancies was collected and cryopreserved. We in duced placental insufficiency and FGR in sheep 88d single umbilical artery ligation. UCB mononuclear cells (15x106 cells per estimated fetal weight) were administered iv to the fetus at 125d gestation, and the fetal brain collected for ana lysis at 135d gestation. We determined cell death (caspase -3) and oxidative DNA cell damage (8 -OHD) in the white matter using immunohistochemistry. We also determined the cell types affected via double label for either caspase -3 or 8 -OHD with NeuN (neurons or glucose transporter -1 (GLUT -1, endothelial cells). Results : Cell death was increased throughout the white matter (eg corpus callosum, CC; periventricular, PVWM; subcortical ntrol, control+UCB, and FGR+UCB (P<0.0001). Significant apoptotic cell death in dentate gyrus (DG) and subventricular zone (SVZ) of FGR brains two important proliferative areas. Within grey matter, increased caspase -3 was s een in the cortex and hippocampus (P<0.005). FGR+UCB therapy resulted in decreased cell death (to basal levels) throughout all brain regions examined. Double label showed moderate co -staining of caspase -3 with neurons (cortex and CA3), and high colocalisat ion in oligodendrocytes (PVWM & scWM) and in endothelial cells throughout the brain. Conclusions: UCB therapy in FGR protects against apoptotic cell death in both grey and white matter regions of the brain. UCB therapy was found to protect blood vessels b y preventing apoptosis in mature endothelial cells. In addition, UCB treatment has neuroprotective effects on two active neurogenic zones of the brain (SVZ and DG). Because the SVZ and DG contain resident stem cells, UCB therapy may enhance brain plasticit y by preventing apoptosis of multi -potent neural precursors cells. Figure 1. The effects of UCB cell therapy on cell death within the white matter. Shown are representative images of co -staining for oligodendrocytes and mature myelin (CNPase, red) together with apoptotic cell death (caspase -3, green). Cell death was upregulated in the white matter of the FGR brain, and prevented with administration of UCB stem cells.

Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA Introduction: Common metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity, are the result of interactions between genes and environment. It is well -recognized that the intrauterine envi ronment is an im portant modifier of this risk. Thus, fetuses carried by women who are obese, diabetic or suffer from suboptimal nutrition are at increased risk of insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cardiovascular disease as adults. Em erging data from murine models indicate that paternal metabolism, including obesity, diabetes, and prior nutritional exposures, also influence disease risk in subsequent generations. First generation male offspring of mothers undernourished (UN) during p regnancy (designated F1 -UN) are at risk of metabolic disease themselves, & produce second -generation (F2) & third -generation (F3) offspring that develop increased adiposity & impaired glucose tolerance as adults. Such disease phenotypes in F2/F3 mice indic ate F1 males can transmit heritable, non -genetic, traits created by this early in utero exposure to his offspring & grandoffspring. We hypothesize that these paternal effects are mediated via epigenetic mechanisms perturbing not only germ cells but also th e function of critical stem cell populations. In previous studies, we demonstrated that in utero exposure to undernutrition alters locus -specific DNA methylation in spermatozoa of adult males . Moreover, these changes are associated with persistent transc riptional dysregulation in multiple tissues of offspring mice. Methods: To determine whether phenotypes resulting from intrauterine exposures are cell autonomous, we harvested murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from both first -generation embryos (directly exposed to altered nutrition of mother) and second -generation embryos ( offspring of father exposed to altered nutrition during his intrauterine life). Proliferation, gene expression, and metabolism were analyzed. Results: Proliferation is reduced in MEFs harvested from both first and second generation embryos, with addit ional defects in cell cycle progression and metabolism observed in first generation MEFs. Conclusions: Even transient nutritional exposures or the legacy of prior paternal exposures can result in persistent cell autono mous defects in proliferation. Such defects may contribute to multi -organ phenotypes linked to metabolic disease risk. Abstract 11 Fat cell size distribution in male offspring (F1) of obese mothers: effects of matern al and offspring exercise M\u00e9dicas y Nutrici\u00f3n Salvador Zubir\u00e1n, Mexico City, DF, Mexico, 14000 and 2 Wyoming Pregnancy and Life Course Health Center, University of Wyoming, Laramie Wyoming, United States 82071 Introduction: Animal studies show that maternal obesity (MO) is associated with increased offspring (F1) adiposity. There are few data on effects of maternal (F0) or F1 exercise (Ex) intervention on F1 adipose tissue. Since increased fat cell size plays an important role in adverse metabolic effects programmed by MO we analysed F1 fat cell size distribution. Methods: Founder generation (F0) female Wistar rats were fed from weaning through pregnancy and lactation with chow (C) or high energy obesogenic diet (MO), and bred at PND 120. Half of the C and MO females wheel -ran (Ex) 30 min/day, 5x a week from PND 90 until the end ofpregnancy. Male F1(n=8 litter/group) were weaned to C die t at PND 21 (C,CF0 -Ex, MO and MO -F0Ex). One male F1 of C and MO litters wheel -ran 30 min/day 5x a week from PND 50 to 110 (C -F1Ex and MO -F1Ex). All F1 euthanized at PND 110, total adipose tissue was excised and fat cell size was determined as cross section al area in retroperitoneal adipose tissue depot and characterized by the gamma probability density function in all F1 groups. Results : At PND 110, body weight was similar among groups. The amount of fat was similar between C and MO and lower in CF0 -Ex and MO-F1Ex compared to MO. Greater fat cell size was found in all MO groups and more variability in MO and MOF0 -Ex (Fig. 1A, B). Maternal exercise reduces fat cell size in MO (MOFO -Ex) but not in C (CF0 -Ex) groups. F1 exercise reduces size and variability in MO (MOF1 -Ex) and variability in C (CF1 -Ex). Differences were observed in kurtosis and symmetry of the distribution when data were fitted by gamma distribution (Fig 1C, D) Conclusions: MO programs adipose tissue hypertrophy and greater fat cell size variabi lity, F0 and F1 exercise intervention have different beneficial effects related to fat cell size distribution.

E1., University of Southampton, UK, 2 Biological Sciences , University of Southampton, UK Introduction: The fetus is reliant on maternal vitamin D, and vitamin D deficiency (VDD) affects a substantial proportion of the human popul ation. Maternal VDD is linked to altered offspring brain development (1) and to impaired skeletal muscle structure and function (2, 3). In mice, we tested the idea that a maternal VDD diet would impair activity in young adult offspring. Methods: Female C57 BL/6J mice were fed a control (C; 1 IU/g vitamin D 3) or VDD (0 IU/g vitamin D 3) diet 6 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were weaned onto the C diet creating two diet groups: C/C and VDD/C (n=5 and n=7 per group, respe ctively). Open -field activity was assessed for 5 minutes in female 15wk offspring. Distance travelled, time ambulatory (period in which a mouse crossed more than 3 photo -beams in any two seconds), average velocity, vertical counts (number of times offsprin g reared onto hind limbs) and number of jumps were recorded. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM and were analysed by independent t -test. Results: VDD/C female offspring displayed a reduction in distance travelled (P<0.001) and time spent in ambulatory behaviour (P<0.01) compared to C/C offspring, but average velocity was not different between groups. Vertical counts and the number of jumps in this time period were significantly lower in the VDD/C compared to C/C offspring (P<0.01). Conclusions: The observed reduction in o ffspring activity with a maternal VDD diet may reflect altered anxiety or hindlimb strength. Underlying mechanisms could include impaired brain development and neurological function, and altered skeletal muscle fibre type composition, respectively. These c hanges in response to a maternal VDD diet may have implications for offspring age -related degeneration in neurological function and skeletal muscle strength.

We aim to determine the effects of maternal antioxidant t reatment with N -acetyl cysteine (NAC) on fetal endothelial function and eNOS programming in IUGR guinea pigs. Methods: Pregnant guinea pigs were submitted at mid gestation to a surgery for implanting ameroid constrictors at both uterine arteries (IUGR), o r a sham intervention (Control). Half of the sows of each group received NAC (500 mg \u00d7 Kg body weight-1 \u00d7 day-1) in the drinking water starting at day 34 until day 60. Fetal biometry and umbilical resistance (RI) and pulsatility (PI) indexes were followed by ultrasound in awake sows throughout gestation. At term (~ 60 days) fetuses and their placentae were extracte d by C -section, dissected and weight. Umbilical arteries and fetal aorta were isolated to assessed vascular function by wire -myography. Primary cultures of endothelial cells from fetal aorta, femoral and umbilical arteries were carried out to determine the levels of eNOS mRNA by qPCR and analyze the DNA methylation of 12 CpG sites in Nos3 promoter by pyrosequencing. Results: Doppler ultrasound measurements showed that NAC reduced placental vascular resistance in IUGR and this effect was associated with a re covery in fetal weight and increasing fetal -to-placental ratio at term (~40%) compared with untreated IUGR. Additionally, NAC restored eNOS -dependent relaxation determined by wire myography in aorta and umbilical arteries, and normalized eNOS mRNA levels i n primary cultures of endothelial cells (EC) from aorta, femoral and umbilical arteries. Pyrosequencing analysis showed that IUGR -derived EC have a decreased methylation (~30%) at CpG -170 (from the TSS) and this epigenetic signature was absent in fetuses treated with NAC. Conclusions: These data show that IUGR -EC have common molecular markers of programming in umbilical and systemic arteries. Notably, maternal treatment with NAC restores fetal growth by increasing placental efficiency and reversing the fun ctional and epigenetic programming of the endothelium in IUGR guinea pigs.

Medical Research Council, Mitochondr ial Biology Unit, Cambridge, UK Introduction: Chronic fetal hypoxia programmes car diovascular dysfunction via oxidative stress (1). In rodents, maternal treatment of hypoxic pregnancies with the antioxidant vitamin C is protective, however, only at concentration incompatible with human clinical translation (2,3). Here, we show in sheep that MitoQ is a suitable alternative therapeutic candidate. Methods: Singleton pregnant ewes with an indwelling femoral artery and vein catheter (surgically implanted at 100 days gestation; term ~145) were exposed to normoxia (N) or hypoxia (H; 10% O 2) with or maternal MitoQ treatment (Q; 1.2 mg/kg/day i.v. in saline) during days; n= N:10, H:10, HQ:7, NQ:9). After natural delivery, offspring were maintained until 9 months, and then chronically instrumented with vascular catheters and a femoral flow probe to determine in vivo cardiovascular function followed by ex vivo peripheral endothelial function (wire myography). Data were analysed by 2 -way ANOVA with repeated measures, as appropriate. Results : Offspring of hypoxic pregnancy were smaller Maternal MitoQ in hypoxic pregnancy restored the programmed hypertension in adult offspring. Adult offsp ring from MitoQ pregnancies showed increased in vivo NO bioavailability evidenced by a greater fall in femoral vascular conductance to NO blockade with LNAME (100 mg/kg i.a.; B) and by in vitro restoration of the programmed impaired femoral artery dilator sensitivity to SNP (C). Conclusions: Maternal MitoQ treatment in pregnancy complicated by chronic fetal hypoxia protects against programmed cardiovascular dysfunction in adulthood. The mechanism underlying this protection involves programmed increases in NO bioavailability and sensitivity in the cardiovascular system of the adult offspring.

Abstract 15 Maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) in guinea pigs leads to fetal growth restriction (FGR) with sex -related increases in tissue hypoxia 60 T.R.H., Richardson, B.S. . of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Physiology and Pharmacology, Biotron Research Centre, Children`s Health Research Institute, The University of Western Ontario, London, Canada Introduction: Maternal undernourishment can be causative for FGR with altered placental development and reduc ed nutrient transport for glucose, amino acids and lipids. However, whether oxygenation is also decreased as seen with placental insufficiency -related FGR, remains unknown. We have determined the extent to which MNR in guinea pigs as a causative factor for FGR impacts immunoreactivity (IR) for Hypoxyprobe -1 (HP -1), a widely used marker of tissue hypoxia. Methods : Guinea pigs were fed ad libitum (Control) or 70% of the control diet pre -pregnancy switching to 90% at mid -pregnancy (MNR). Near term, HP -1 was injected into pregnant sows with fetuses then necropsied for body/organ weights, and brain, liver, kidney and placental tissues were assessed for HP -1 IR. Statistical significance was assumed for p<.05. Results : FGR -MNR fetuses (8males/8females) were 36% s maller, while their brains and livers were 12% and 40% smaller, respectively, in comparison to the appropriate for gestational age (AGA) -Control fetuses (8males/8females). HP -1 IR in the male and female AGA -Controls was similar across the brain regions studied and throughout the liver, but increased in the renal proximal convoluted tubules vs the glomeruli, and in the placenta labyrinth lobules peripherally vs centrally, indicating regional differences in basal oxygenation. HP -1 IR was increased in the FGR -MNR fetuses by 2 -4X in the brain and more so in males than females, by ~4X in the liver and proximal convoluted tubules and ~15X in the glomeruli but with no sex differences evident, and with no changes in the placenta. Conclusions: MNR in guinea pigs results in asymmetric FGR with increased HP -1 IR as an index of local tissue hypoxia in the brain which was more so in males than females, and in the liver and kidneys which was similar for males and females, but with no changes in the placenta. As such, chronic hypoxia is likely to be an important signaling mechanism for the decreased fetal growth seen with maternal undernourishment and programming of related adverse outcomes, and appears to be largely post placental in nature. Moreover , there are sex -related differences in the brain which may contribute to the sex -specific expression of adverse neurodevelopment in FGR offspring.Abstract 16 In-vivo evidence for premature brain aging in old men prenatally exposed to the Dutch Famine 61 Franke, K ., Gaser, Ch., & T.J . Structural Brain Mapping Group, Dept. of Neurology, Uni versity Hospital Jena, Germany and Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands Introduction: Decreased fetal nutrient delivery is widespread in both developing and industrialized countries, leading to aberrant devel opmental programming, finally resulting in negative impacts on the general lifespan, lifelong health, disease outcomes, brain development, and cognitive functions. However, the effects of maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) during gestation on structural b rain aging in late life have not been explored yet. We hypothesized that offspring exposed to MNR would show altered brain structure resembling premature brain aging. Methods: Utilizing the MRI subsample ( n=118) of the Dutch famine birth cohort, this stud y implements an innovative, non -invasive in vivo MRI biomarker using pattern recognition to analyze structural brain aging and to subsequently evaluate the effects of MNR during early gestation on individual brain aging in the adult offspring (mean age 67 years). Results: We observed increased BrainAGE scores of more than 4 years ( p<0.05) in adult male offspring who were exposed to the Dutch famine in early gestation as compared to offspring born before the famine. Additionally, advanced brain aging corresp onded to worse performances in cognitive tests as well as increased depression scores. Conclusions: Future work will have to further explore the effects of a variety of developmental and environmental factors affecting early development on neuroanatomical maturation and degeneration, thus potentially facilitating early treatment and/or preventative interventions.

Abstract 17 Preterm lung injury in the delivery room: implications for multi -organ injury 65 Figure 1. Mechanisms underlying how the initial respiratory support in the delivery room can lead to down -stream inflammation and injury, particularly to the preterm brain. (Barton et al. Front Pediatr. 2015; 3: 97 ). Polglase, G.R. The Ritchie Centre, Monash University and Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia The initiation of respirato ry support in the delivery room is one of the most important but least controlled interventions a preterm infant will face. Tidal volumes (V T) used in the neonatal intensive care unit are carefully measured and adjusted. However, the V Ts that an infant rec eives during resuscitation are usually unmonitored and highly variable, and up to 80% receive excessively high VTs. It is now well established that exposure of the lungs to high V Ts elicits a profound pro -inflammatory response and up -regulation of key lung -injury genes, resulting in structural remodelling and long term adverse consequences including bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However this response is not isolated to the lungs. Studies in preterm lambs and infants have demonstrated that the initial respirat ory support results in a profound systemic inflammatory cascade, which has downstream effects on multiple organs, particularly the brain (Figure 1). Therefore any therapeutic strategies that can reduce lung inflammation and injury at birth are likely to al so have neuroprotective benefits. We have investigated a number of strategies t o reduce the regional inflammatory response of the lung to respiratory support. This includes the use of protective ventilation strategies including prophylactic surfactant, sustained inflations and different ventilation modalities. Pharmacologically, we h ave investigated a number of inflammatory cytokine blockers, and potential clinical therapies including Erythropoietin, Nanoparticles and human amnion epithelial cells. These therapies to date have had variable impact on lung inflammation and injury and ma y amplify the systemic inflammatory cascade resulting in increased brain inflammation and injury. Abstract 18 High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU): A method of non-invasive Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, UK ; 2 Institute of Developmental and Reproductive Biology, Imperial College London, UK ; 3Joint Department of Physics, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK Introduction: HIFU can non -invasively occlude blood vessels, thus may represent a lower risk method of placental vascular occlusion in complicated monochorionic pregnancy, compared to current invasive techniques. We have shown HIFU can safely and effectively occlude pla cental vasculature in the instrumented fetal sheep model when applied through the uterus with short term follow -up (Shaw et al. Sci. Transl. Med. in press). To further develop this technique, we applied HIFU through intact maternal abdominal skin and asse ssed subsequent fetal and maternal recovery up to term. Methods: Twelve pregnant sheep were anaesthetised at 116\u00b12d gestational age (term ~148d) and HIFU (n=6) or no (n=6) exposures of up to 6 placental vessels were performed through intact maternal abdom inal skin, targeted with colour Doppler. HIFU exposures -5000 and fetuses were subsequently surgically instrumented with vascular catheters and femoral flow probes and recovered from anaesth etic. A bespoke wireless data acquisition system (CamDAS), which records continuous maternal and fetal cardiovascular data, and daily blood sampling were used to assess recovery for 20 days. Results: Based on a comparison of pre and post treatment colour Doppler imaging, 92% (33/36) of placental vessels were occluded in a single HIFU exposure series; the remaining 3/36 vessels were occluded following a retreatment. All fetuses survived to the end of the 20 day follow -up period, and no differences in matern al or fetal blood pressure, heart rate, metabolic status or oxygenation was observed between treatment groups (fig 1a -d). The expected ontogenic changes in blood pressure, heart rate and femoral blood flow in the fetus occurred in both groups (fig 1b). Th ere were no significant adverse events. Conclusions: HIFU appears to be an effective method of placental vascular occlusion, and may be translatable to human pregnancy. Based on these findings, it is well tolerated by the mother and fetus.

Abstract 19 A case -control study on effect of a novel treatment administering tadalafil for fetal growth restriction 67 Kubo , M., Nii, M. , Maeda, Y., Umekawa, T., Kamimoto, Y. and Ikeda, T. Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mie University School of Medicine Introduction: In fetal growth restriction (FGR), clinicians are often forced to end the pregnancy for prematurity on the fetus with an associated high risk of adverse neonatal outcome. We used PDE -5 inhibitor, Tadalafil successfully in some cases of FGR. The aim of this retrospective case control study was to assess Tadalafil treatment in pregnant women with FGR in terms of maternal and neonatal outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 11 singleton pregnant women with FGR who received Tadalafil treatment along with conventional management for FGR (Tadalafil treatment group) compared with 14 control singleton pregnant women who only received the conventional management for FGR (conventional management group). The conventional management for FGR was performed on the basis of the guidelines for obstetrical practice in Japan. Results : Fetal growth velocity from enrollment to birth were s ignificantly higher in the Tadalafil treatment group than in the conventional management group (17.7 (95%Cl: 10.6 may be a novel treatment for FGR with growth arrest.

Abstract 20 Fetal ECG and h eart rate are a ltered in the perinatal period following exposure to chronic maternal hypercortisolemia 68 Antolic, A.1, Wood, C.E.2, & Keller -Wood, M.1 of Pharmacodynamics and Physiology and 2Functional Genomics Introduction: Experimental data from animal studies and clinical data from human studies indicate that the late gestation fetal heart may be particularly susceptible to either precocious or persistent glucocorticoid signalling. Our group has fou nd a marked increase in perinatal death, cardiac structural changes, and an increase in apoptosis of cardiac Purkinje fibers in an ovine model of chronic stress in late pregnancy. Thus, we investigated the effect of cortisol on fetal blood pressure and ECG . Methods: In this model, the ewe is infused with 1 mg\u00b7kg -1\u00b7day -1 cortisol gestation to term ewes with singleton fetuses were assign to CORT at 115 days of gestation. Five ewes were not treated. DSI radiotelemetry devices were impla nted into the fetuses at 119\u00b11d for continuous monitoring of ECG, HR, and aortic and amniotic fluid pressures through delivery. We used DSI software to analyze 24h means of MAP and HR after surgery and over the 14d before birth, 1h means in ECG and HRV par ameters on each day for 14d before birth, and 1h means during the last 24h of fetal life and 10m means in the final 1h before birth of HR, MAP, and ECG parameters. Data were analyzed using two -way ANOVA corrected for repeated measures across time with comp arison of individual time points by t -test with Bonferroni adjustment. Results : Maternal cortisol infusion had no significant effect on MAP, HR, or parameters of HRV (LF:HF) in the period from -14d to birth. CORT significantly prolonged the fetal P and P -R intervals of the ECG over the last 24h and 1h before birth. CORT also significantly reduced fetal HR in the last hour before birth, and increased P:PR interval and Tpe:QTcf ratio (interval from the peak to the end of the T wave relative to the corrected QT interval) in the hour before birth. Conclusions: Although higher doses of glucocorticoids induce fetal hypertension, this increase in CORT did not increase MAP. Nevertheless, CORT produced pathophysiological changes in the cardiac conduction system. P -R elongation also occurred during recovery from surgery, suggesting the maladaptive effects of CORT become evident during periods of cardiac stress. Table 1.

The Ritchie Centre, Hudson Institute of Medical Research and Department of Paediatrics Monash University, Melbourne, Australia Background: While apnoea of prematurity in preterm infants is usually resolved by near -term equivalent age, apnoea of shorter durations may persist during infancy. The aim of our study was to assess the incidence and impact of persistent apnoea on heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and brain tissue oxygenation index (TOI) over the first 6 months after term equivalent age. Methods: 24 preterm infants 13M/11F born between 27 -36 weeks of gestational age were studied with daytime polysomnograp hy at 2 -4 weeks, 2 -3 months and 5 -6 months post -term corrected age. Apnoeas lasting 3s were included and % changes in HR, SpO 2 and TOI (NIRO -200 Hamamatsu) from baseline were analysed. Results : 253 apnoeas were recorded at 2 -4 weeks, 203 at 2 -3 months and 148 at 5 -6 months. Infants had between 5 -27 apnoeas at 2 -4 weeks, 1 -27 at 2 -4 months and 1 -16 at 5 -6 months with an average of 3 per hour at all three studies. Apnoea duration was significantly longer at 2 -4 weeks (mean \u00b1 sem, 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 s) compared to 5-6 months (4.4 \u00b1 0.9 s, p<0.05). There was no effect of gestational age, sleep state or sleep position on apnoea duration, nadir HR, nadir SpO 2 or nadir TOI. At 2 -4 weeks nadirs in HR, SpO 2 and TOI were all positively nadirs in HR and TOI were nadir was positively correlated with apnoea duration (R=0.240, p<0.01). nadirs and TOI ( -2.7 \u00b1 0.2%) were significantly less than at HR -9.8 frequent and apnoea duration was correlated with falls in HR, SpO 2 and TOI over the first 6 months after term equivalent age. These short apnoeas were associated with decreases in cerebral oxygenation, which were more marked at 2 -3 months and 5 -6 months than at 2 -4 weeks. Although events were short they may contribute to the adverse neurocognitive outcomes which are common in ex -preterm children.

Abstract 22 Pregnancy complications and programming of cardiovascular dysfunction in adult offspring 73 Davidge, S.T. Women and Children's Health Research Institute, Departments of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Physiology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta Canada Abundant evidence exists that a compromised prenatal (and early postnatal) environment leads to an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular (CV) disease later in life. Our laboratory is focused on understanding the pathophysiological outcomes for offspring born from compromised in utero environments including prenatal hypoxia and maternal aging. We have focused on these pregnancy complications as fetal hypoxia is one of the most common consequences of complicated pregnancies worldwide and advanced maternal age is becoming increasingly common, and is associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Our studies show that adult offspring born from these co mplicated pregnancies have impaired endothelial -dependent vascular function, enhanced cardiac susceptibility to ischemia and reperfusion injury and indices of the metabolic syndrome when exposed to a high fat diet. Our laboratory has been focused on identi fying plausible mechanisms and implementing early life interventions to protect against adverse programming. Our data show that simultaneous resveratrol supplementation when exposed to a high -fat diet in early life prevented cardiac dysfunction after ische mia/reperfusion injury in adult male and female offspring exposed to prenatal hypoxia. We have also recently demonstrated a beneficial effect of resveratrol supplementation in later life at a time of known CV dysfunction in both male and female hypoxic ex posed offspring. However, resveratrol increased cardiac p -AMPK and SOD2 levels in only female offspring. We have also assessed a non -pharmacological interventional approach using exercise. Exercise is an effective preventive intervention for CV diseases; h owever, it may be detrimental in conditions of compromised health. With exercise training, we showed improved baseline cardiac performance in male control offspring but a reduced baseline cardiac performance in offspring exposed to prenatal hypoxia. Intere stingly, exercise decreased superoxide generation in control offspring while the polar opposite effect occurred in offspring exposed to prenatal hypoxia; thus for male offspring exposed to prenatal hypoxia, exercise may be a secondary stressor on cardiac f unction. Perspectives: There are several promising avenues of research into the mechanisms involved in the programming of CV diseases and potential treatment strategies, however understanding mechanisms and the impact of secondary stressors/co -morbidities is critical. Neverthel ess, the use of early postnatal intervention with antioxidants or resveratrol to improve health outcomes in adult offspring might prove to be beneficial in the reversal and/or prevention of CV disease originating from early life beginnings.Abstract 23 Vascular morphological and anti -proliferative changes induced by melatonin treatment in chronic hypoxic newborn lamb with pulmonary Chile, Santiago, Chile; 2Facultad de Medicina, Unive rsidad de los Andes Center for Andean Studies Corresponding author's address: eherrera@med.uchile.cl Introduction. Chronic hypoxia during gestation lead to neonatal pulmonary hypertension (NPH)1. Vascular remodeling is one of the main hallmarks of this disease and includes decreases in media/lumen ratio and increases smooth muscle cells (SMCS) proliferation2,3. These morphological changes have been associated with Melatonin is a neurohormone with important antioxidant studied the vascular anti-remodeling effects of melatonin in NPH induced by hypoxia. Twelve neonatal lambs were gestated in chronic hypobaric hypoxia and divided two groups: 6 control (CN, 1.4%, 0.5 EtOH 1,4%, 0,5 ml.kg-1.d-1 oral) between days 4 -11 of life. At 12 days old lambs were euthanized and pulmonary samples collected for histomorphometric study and determination of vascular remod eling markers such as -actin and myosin heavy chain (MHC). Proliferation were studied by immunohistochemistry (Ki67+ cells) and western blotting (p21 and Cyclin D1 expression). Bioethics Committee approved this study. Results and Discussion. Melatonin tre atment increases luminal area/vascular area ratio. Also, decreases -actin expression and ki67+ cells (%) without alters myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression. There were no changes in p21 and there is a trend in decreased expression of the Cyclin D1 that is why it is possible that this morphological and anti-proliferative changes have been regulated by others keys mediators. Conclusion . Postnatal melatonin treatment alters vascular remodeling by increasing luminal area/vascular area ratio and decreasing SMCs proliferation.

Department of Maternal and Fetal Medicine, Institute for Women's Health, University College London, 86 -96 Chenies Mews, WC1E 6HX, UK Introduction: Fetal growth increases perinatal mortality and lifelong cardiovascular disease risk1. In experimental animals with FGR, uterine artery Ad.VEGF -A165 gene therapy increases fetal growth velocity by improving uteroplacental perfusion2,3. This study aimed to determine the longer term effects of mid -gestation Ad.VEGF -A165 therapy on pregnancy outcome, postnatal growth and adult blood pressure in a guinea pig mo del of FGR. Methods: Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, pregnant Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs were fed ad libitum (control, n=7) or given 70% normal food intake to induce FGR4. On day ~30 of pregnancy, FGR dams received either Ad.VEGF -A165 (1x1010 viral particles, n=9) or vehicle (pluronic gel, n=7), delivered to the uterine arteries, via laparotomy. Controls were sham operated. Dams littered and pups were weighed at birth and weekly thereafter. Carotid arterial pressure was measured4 before necropsy at ~4 months of age. Results are mean\u00b1SEM. Results : Nineteen dams spontaneously delivered 60 pups at term. There was no difference between control, FGR and FGR+Ad.VEGF -A165 groups in litter size, gestational age at delivery, prenatal or post natal mortality (P>0.05 all cases, general linear model). The effect of prenatal treatment on birth weight depended upon the sex of the pup (P(interaction)=0.037), although both male and female FGR+Ad.VEGF -A165 pups (males 100\u00b14g, females 96\u00b13g) were heavi er than their untreated counterparts (males 97\u00b14g, females 95\u00b13g; control males 107\u00b14g, females 87\u00b13g). However, postnatal growth rate was similar in the three groups, irrespective of sex (P>0.05). When male and female offspring were combined, carotid arte rial pulse pressure was elevated in untreated FGR pups (3.3\u00b10.4mmHg), but not in FGR+Ad.VEGF -A165 pups (2.4\u00b10.4mmHg), compared to controls (1.6\u00b10.5mmHg). However, there was no effect of treatment on systolic, diastolic or mean arterial pressure (P>0.05). N either cardiac mass nor left and right ventricular wall thicknesses differed between control, FGR+vehicle and FGR+Ad.VEGF -A165 pups. Conclusions: Maternal uterine artery Ad.VEGF -A165 gene therapy does not adversely affect perinatal mortality or postnatal growth and may ameliorate the increase in adult blood pressure associated Barker (2006) Clin Obstet [3] Mehta et al (2014) PLoS Kind et al (2002) Exp Physiol 87:469. Abstract 25 Maternal obesity during pregnancy alters microRNAs that regulate circadian clock genes in the fetal mouse heart 76 Ashley, B. Hussain, S. Thomas, H. N. B. van Rijn, B. B. Cagampang, F. R. Cleal, J. K. Human Development and Health, Institute of Developmental Sciences, University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital (mailpoint 887), Southampton SO16 6Y D, UK Introduction: Maternal obesity and diabetes are prevalent during pregnancy and have long -term consequences on the offspring's health. Metformin (MET) is prescribed to treat gestational diabetes with unknown impact on the fetus. In pregnant mice, ma ternal obesity results in altered blood pressure and heart size in the adult offspring. Whether this originates during fetal development is unknown. A potential underlying mechanism involves microRNAs which are implicated in cardiac differentiation, remode lling and disease. We investigated whether high fat (HF) diet -induced maternal obesity with or without MET alters microRNA expression and expression of the target mRNAs within the fetal heart. Methods: Six weeks before conception and during pregnancy, fe male C57/BL6J mice were fed HF (45% kcal fat) or control (C, 7% kcal fat) diet with half of each group given MET in drinking water (250mg/kg bodyweight/day). This generated four groups (n=4 per group): C, C+MET, HF and HF+MET. On day 16 of pregnancy dams w ere killed and fetal hearts collected. MicroRNA expression was measured using small RNA sequencing (Illumina miRNA -Seq). Differential expression analysis identified up and down -regulated microRNAs and pathway analysis identified their target genes. Gene ex pression levels in HF 48 microRNAs in C+MET fetal hearts were expressed differentially compared to controls. Pathway analysis identified circadian rhythm as a potential microRNA regulated gene pathway altered by both maternal obesity and MET. Maternal ob esity reduced fetal heart mRNA expression of the clock genes Per2 , Cry1 and Cry2 vs lean mothers and MET reduced expression of Cry1 and Fto vs control mothers (p 0.05). Conclusion: This study identified microRNAs that alter the circadian rhythm pathway in fetal hearts in response to maternal obesity and MET. The circadian genes Per2, Cry1 and Cry2 are targets of these microRNAs. This suggests that maternal obesity during fetal development could alter the expression of microRNAs and their target genes in fet al heart. This may underlie the associated cardiovascular dysfunction in postnatal life.

The short -term morbidity associated with preterm birth is well described and, although the long -term cardiometabolic health risks in adults born preterm are recognised, their mechanistic basis is unc lear. Herein, we used a guinea pig model of medically induced moderate preterm birth, designed to closely relate to human preterm pregnancy by preserving maternal -infant bonding and antenatal corticosteroid exposure. Methods: Betamethasone (1 mg/kg) was administered to pregnant guinea pigs 48 and 24h before induction of preterm labour (62d gestation; term=69d; n=37), to mimic the gold -standard of care for women at risk of preterm delivery. The control group consisted of term -born pups with no betamethason e exposure (n=34). Cardiac tissue was collected at 28d (childhood) and 9 months (adulthood). qRT -PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression of molecules involved in the regulation of cardiac development. Data was analysed using a 3 way ANOVA (factors: preterm, age, sex). Results : Preterm birth did not alter the mRNA expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) or 11 -HSD2, which converts cortisol to cortisone, at either age. However, at 9 months of age, pups that were born preterm had an increase in the mRNA expression of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR; Figure 1) and 11 -HSD1, the cortisone to cortisol converting enzyme, compared to those born at term. MR is associated with fibrosis, however, there were no changes in the mRNA expression TGF - and MMP -2. Furthermore, these changes were consistent across both sexes. Conclusions: In this study, we have used an animal model that is closely comparable to human preterm birth to show show that adults born preterm have altered cardiac mRNA expression of MR an d 11 -HSD1. MR signalling has previously been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and the onset of fibrosis independent of increased blood pressure. Consequently, the finding that adults born preterm have increased cardiac mRNA expression of MR may shed some light on the molecular pathways involved in the cardiac changes underlying cardiometabolic risk found in preterm -born preterm -born adults. Further histological analysis to determine whether there is increased fibrosis in the myocardium is is underway. . Figure 1.

Abstract 27 In fetal cerebral arteries, chronic hypoxia attenuates NO - and cGMP -induced vasorelaxation by inhibiting PKG colocalization with BK channel proteins 81 Pearce, W. J. and Thorpe, R. B. Center for Perinatal Biology, Loma Linda University School of Medicine Loma Linda, California, 92350 USA Introduction: Chronic hypoxia attenuates nitric oxide (NO) and induced arteries. Because cGMP -dependent protein kinase (PKG) mediates much of NO and cGMP signaling in vascular smooth muscle, we tested the hypothesis that hypoxia diminishes the ability of PKG to regulate target proteins that cause vasorelaxation. Prominent among proteins that influence vascular tone is the large conductance calcium -sensitive potassium (BK) channel, which is a substrate for PKG and is responsive to phosphorylation on multiple serine/threonine residues. Gi ven the importance of this channel in the regulation of vascular tone, we also examined whether hypoxia attenuates PKG and BK channel protein abundances and PKG kinase activity. Methods: Middle cerebral arteries were harvested from normoxic and hypoxic (al titude of 3,820 m for 110 days) fetal and adult sheep. In fresh arteries we assessed effects of 8 -pCPT -cGMP and iberiotoxin on 5 -HT dose -response relations. From artery homogenates we measured PKG activity and abundances, and abundances of BK channel - and 1 -subunits. We quantified protein colocalization using confocal microscopy of fixed 5 \u00b5m sections following double immunostaining for various protein pairs. Results : The BK inhibitor iberiotoxin attenuated vasorelaxation induced by 8 -pCPT -cGMP in nor moxic but not hypoxic arteries in both age groups. Neither expression nor activity of PKG -I were significantly affected by chronic hypoxia in fetal or adult arteries. The spatial proximities of PKG with BK channel - and 1 -proteins strongly dissociat ed by hypoxia ( Fig.1 ). Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that in fetal lamb cerebral arteries, hypoxia reduces the ability of PKG to attenuate vasoconstriction in large part through suppression of the ability of PKG to associate with and th ereby activate BK channels. Figure 1. Chronic hypoxia attenuated colocalized pixels reveled that chronic hypoxia significantly reduced associations among all three protein pairs (BK with BK1, BK1, PKG with BK, and PKG with BK1 ) in both fetal and adult arteries. These data suggest that hypoxia reduces activation of BK channels by decreasing their spatial proximity to, and phosphorylation by, PKG. *=P<0.05).

We have shown that suboptimal B -vitamin nutrition around conception makes young adult offspring more obese, hypertensive and insulin resistant1. All these measured variables are markers of increased susceptibility to metabolic syndrome, which tends to develop with advanced age. In this study, we revisit the same population of animals as previously reported1, but at the more advanced age of 6 years (c.f. 1.5 - 2 years) to determin e whether their health has deteriorated to such an extent that clinical signs of disease are evident (e.g. further increases in blood pressure, or glucose intolerance and insulin resistance or development of osteoporosis). Methods: In all sheep, we chara cterised resting and stimulated cardiovascular function by telemetry, metabolic competence by GTT and ITT, body composition by DXA and, after euthanasia, conducted genome -wide analyses of methylated DNA (MBD -Seq) using in -house protocols. Results : In offs pring at 2 -years of age, w e demonstrated that physiologically relevant reductions in dietary supply of one-carbon metabolites can modify DNA methylation to influence offspring health and physiology (e.g. higher blood pressure in males)1. With advancing age , we find that such 'epigenetic -programming' does not always produce unidirectional adverse outcomes. Whilst age deteriorated some physiological functions in control animals (e.g. DBP increased from ~ 86\u00b12 to 108\u00b11), the phenotype of those exposed to a met hyl-deficient diet did not appear to have deteriorated; DBP remained stable at 96\u00b12 & 91\u00b11 mm Hg at 2 and 6 years, respectively with no marked change in glucose or insulin handling (see Figure). Nevertheless, aged sheep exposed to a methyl -deficient diet r etained an 'epigenetic imprint' of maternal diet. Conclusions: For the first time in a large animal model, we report that the direction of change of an adverse 'epigenetically -programmed' phenotype as individuals age is not necessarily unidirectional towa rds increased non-communicable disease. 1.

R1., Regnault, T.R.H. 2, * & Morrison, J.L.1, * 1Early Origins of Adult Health Research Group, School of Pharmacy & Medical Sciences, Sansom Institute for Health Research, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Western University, 1151 Richmond Street, London, ON, Canada Introduction: Low birth weight (LBW)/intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) as a result of an adverse in utero environment is a risk factor for the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adult life. These LBW offspring experience accelerated catch up growth after birth and exhibit metabolic inflexibility when consuming a high saturated fat and high sugar Western di et (WD), which is abundant in our society today. We assessed the independent and possibly additive effects of placental insufficiency induced LBW and a postnatal WD on the heart. Methods: LBW was induced by uterine artery ablation in guinea pigs at ~32 day s gestation (term=68 days). Resulting male and female pups were classified into normal birth weight (NBW; >85g), or LBW (<85g) groups, and weaned onto either a control diet (CD) or WD. Left ventricle tissue samples were collected at 150 days after birth an d qRT -PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression of key cardiac growth and metabolic genes. There was an effect of sex (3 way ANOVA) and thus, data was split by sex and a 2 way ANOVA performed. Results : LBW -WD males had increased cardiac IGF -2 WD males had increased IGF -2R mRNA expression independent of birth weight. In addition, MHC - and MMP -2 mRNA expression was also increased in WD males, and effect greater in LBW -WD males. WD fed males also displayed increased CPT -1 and PGC -1 (Figure 1) mRNA expression and again these effects were more pronounced in LBW -WD. Basal glucose transporter GLUT -1 mRNA expression was in LBW -WD males, but not in NBW -CD or WD males. Interestingly, there was no effect of diet on the expression of these molecules in females; however, LBW females had decreased expression of both CPT -1 and PGC -1 irrespective of diet. Conclusions: There appears to be a sexual dimorphism between the mRNA expression changes in cardiac growth and metabolic pathways a s a result of both birth weight and postnatal WD. WD changes the expression of signalling molecules in males and LBW may enhance these effects. The lack of changes in the female may suggest a detrimental detrimental failure to mount an appropriate metabolic response t o the WD. Figure 1.

J.1 1Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash University, Clayton, Australia; 2School of Anatomy, Physiology & Human Biology; and 3Centre for Neonatal Research and Education, School of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of We stern Australia, Perth, Australia Introduction: Cardiomyocytes , the functional units of the heart, undergo a process of maturation and differentiation during late gestation whereby they progressively lose their proliferative capacity. Preterm birth and ex posure to intrauterine inflammation (a common antecedent of preterm birth) have the potential to impact the proliferation and maturation of cardiomyocytes and ultimately the functionality of the heart. We hypothesised that normal cardiac development and ma turation is modified by prematurity and exposure to intrauterine inflammation. Methods: Date -mated merino ewes were randomised antenatally to injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (4mg, Escherichia coli ), to induce an intrauterine inflammatory response, or saline, as an experimental control, 48 hours before preterm delivery. Lambs were delivered preterm at 128d gestational age (GA) (term is 150d GA) and managed postnatally in the Preclinical Intensive Ca re Research Unit (PICRU) at the University of Western Australia. Postnatal care of lambs followed contemporary clinical management. At 7d postnatal age (135d postconceptional age) lambs were euthanised and the hearts excised and perfusion fixed. Fetal cont rol lambs were delivered at 135d GA and euthanised immediately. Cardiac tissue was randomly and systematically sampled for assessment of cardiac morphology, cardiomyocyte number, nuclearity and proliferation, and myocardial extracellular matrix deposition. Results : Antenatal LPS exposure did not result in gross morphological changes of the preterm heart at 7d postnatal age, including left ventricular wall thickness (P >0.05). The number of cardiomyocyte nuclei in the preterm heart at 7d postnatal age was n ot influenced by antenatal LPS exposure (P >0.05). The proportion of proliferating cardiomyocyte nuclei did not differ between preterm lambs antenatally exposed to LPS or saline (P >0.05). Conclusions: The findings suggest that antenatal LPS exposure does not lead to alterations in cardiomyocyte growth in the preterm lamb heart at 7d postnatal age. However, analysis of cardiomyocyte nuclearity (yet to be examined) may show differences in cardiomyocyte maturation following intrauterine inflammation, which would in turn, impact cardiomyocyte endowment. Abstract 31 The myths and physiology surrounding intrapartum decelerations - the critical role of the peripheral chemoreflex 85 Lear, C. A ., Galinsky, R., Wassink, G., Yamaguchi, K., Davidson, J.O., Westgate, J.A., Bennet, L., Gunn, A.J. The Fetal Physiology and Neuroscience Group, Department of Physiology, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand A distinctive pattern of recurrent rapid falls in fetal heart rate, called dec elerations, are commonly associated with uterine contractions during labour. These brief decelerations are mediated by vagal activation. The reflex triggering this vagal response has been variably attributed to a mechanoreceptor response to fetal head comp ression, to baroreflex activation following increased blood pressure during umbilical cord compression, and/or a Bezold -Jarisch reflex response to reduced venous return from the placenta. Although these complex explanations are still widespread today, ther e is no consistent evidence that they are common during labour. Instead, the only mechanism mechanism that has been systematically investigated, proven to be reliably active during labour and, crucially, capable of producing rapid decelerations is the peripheral che moreflex. The peripheral chemoreflex is triggered by transient periods of asphyxia that are a normal phenomenon associated with all uterine contractions. This should not not cause concern as the healthy fetus has a remarkable ability to adapt to these repeated but short periods of asphyxia. This means that the healthy fetus is typically not at risk of hypotension and injury during uncomplicated labour even during repeated brief decelerations. The physiologically incorrect theories surrounding decelerations that that ignore the natural occurrence of repeated asphyxia likely gained widespread support to help explain why many babies are born healthy despite repeated decelerations during labour. We propose that a unified and physiological understanding of intrapartum dec elerations that accepts the true nature of labour is critical to improve interpretation of of intrapartum fetal heart rate patterns. The role of the peripheral chemoreflex in intrapartum decelerations.

The main questions were directed to explain the periodicity of fetal breathing activity, its conversion to continuous breathing at birth and the influence of hypoxia on the control mechanisms. Relevant que stions which contributed to the understanding of apnea episodes during the neonatal period and SIDS. Besides he studied the influence of perinatal asphyxia and steroid (and neuroprotection) on developmental neurogenesis. During the last 10 years his intere sted shifted to the study of the mechanisms involved in the early origin of adult disease such us cardiovascular disease and obesity. He developed an original model for studying this question by using the chick embryo as a relatively independent embryo/fet us in development. Scenarios such as hypoxia, acute and chronic and malnutrion apply at different stages of development were created. This model allowed studying different organs, vessels and development after hatching providing insight onto the mechanisms involved for after birth diseases. Lately he became involved in developing projects (RCT) dealing with the prevention of obesity in teenagers. This group is targeted since they are the future parents and this is an ideal moment to empower them to make hea lthy life decisions.

Abstract 32 Developmental p rogramming of mitochondrial function by hypoxia: A cold-blooded perspective 89 G. J. , Crossley, J., Elsey, R., Dzialowski, E., Shiels, H. A., & Crossley, D. A. Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Core Technology Facility, 46 Grafton St, Manchester, M139NT Introduction: Due to the profound health implications of developmental programming, the impact of the prenatal environment on physiology has been extensively studied in mammals. Far less attention has been paid to ectothermic organisms which routinely develop in fluctuating environments. For example, crocodilians lay their eggs in subterranean nests where oxygen levels can ra nge from 10 -21%. Such severe levels of developmental hypoxia produce maladaptive phenotypes in mammals. In contrast, we hypothesised that hypoxia acts on developmental plasticity to produce novel, and possibly adaptive, phenotypes in embryonic organisms t hat regularly encounter hypoxia. To this end, we investigated the effects of developmental hypoxia on a fundamental aspect of alligator cellular function; mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. 10% oxyg en from 20 -90% of development. Embryos were either harvested at 90% development or allowed to hatch and then reared in 21% oxygen for 3 years. Ventricular mitochondria were isolated from embryonic/juvenile alligator hearts and mitochondrial respiration wa s measured in an Oroboros microrespirometer. Results: Developmental hypoxia had no effect on mitochondrial function in embryonic alligator hearts (Fig. 1A -C, black vs. white bars). However, at the juvenile life stage, animals from hypoxic incubatio ns had lower levels of leak respiration and higher respiratory control ratios (Fig. 1B -C, dark grey vs. light grey bars), which is indicative of enhanced mitochondrial efficiency. These results are in contrast to the mammalian paradigm where prenatal hypo xia leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and the development of cardiovascular disease. Conclusion: Here we show that mitochondrial function can be programmed in alligators by developmental hypoxia. The adaptive significance of the enhanced mitochondria l efficiency in the hypoxic phenotype is unknown; we speculate that it may provide an advantage when juveniles encounter hypoxic environments. Figure 1. Effect of ontogeny and developmental hypoxia on mitochondrial respiration. Mitochondria were isolated from alligator embryos exposed to 21% and 10% oxygen during development (black and white bars, respectively; n= 5) and their juvenile counterparts (dark and light grey bars, respectively; n = 6 -8) were subsequently raised in 21 % oxygen.

Introduction: Maternal smoking during pregnancy is known to be a key determinant of fetal ovarian reserve in human populations, however the underlying mechanism is unknown (Ruth et al., Sci Rep 6;24710, 2016). One possible candidate mechanism is chronic fetal hypoxia, which occurs with maternal smoking as a consequence of poor placentation (Kawasima et al., PLoS One 9(8);e106140, 2014). Chronic fetal hypoxia programmes cardiovascular dysfunction in the adult offspring (Giussani et al. PLoS One 7(2):e31017, 2012). Howeve r, whether chronic fetal hypoxia also programmes an impaired ovarian reserve in the adult female is unknown. The aim of this study was therefore to determine whether chronic fetal hypoxia has long -term effects on ovarian gene expression, oxidative stress and telomere length that could influence ovarian reserve. Methods: Wistar rat dams were subjected to normoxia (N, 21%) or hypoxia (H, 13%) from days 6 -21 of pregnancy. Offspring were raised under normoxic conditions. Ovaries were collected from 1 female pe r litter at 4 months of age, weighed and snap -frozen or fixed. Ovarian gene expression (q -rtPCR) and telomere length (Southern blotting) were determined.. Results: Chronic fetal hypoxia did not affect ovarian weight in female adult offspring (N: 0.08g\u00b10.01 vs. H: 0.07g\u00b10.01, p=0.17). Ovaries from adult offspring of hypoxic pregnancy showed up -regulation of components of NOX2 1B), reduced telomere length compared to controls (Fig 1C and 1D), and an overall effect of hypoxia on telomere length (p<0.05). Conclusions: We have demonstrated that exposure to chronic hypoxia during fetal development leads to oxidative stress and accelerated ovarian ageing in later life. These novel findings are in keeping with previous work suggesting that female reproductive physiology is exquisitely sensitive to the influence of the early -life environment. The major pathway affected by chronic fetal hypoxia in the ovary is NOX2 -mediated oxidative stress, which could contribute to a decrease in ovarian reserve.

Abstract 34 Compensatory alterations in fetal fractional oxygen extraction are dependant upon both gestational age and birth weight centile 91 Stark , M.J., Hodyl , N.A., Andersen , C.C. The Robinson Research Institute, School Of Medicine, University of Adelaide & Department of Neonatal Medicine, Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide, South Australi a Introduction: Fetal growth is linked to oxygen availability with fetal hypoxia associated with fetal growth restriction. In term infants fractional oxygen extraction (FOE) increases in response to hypoxia preventing anaerobic respiration. Whether this compensatory mechanism is consistent across gestation is not known. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of fetal growth restriction on fetal FOE from 23-41 weeks gestation. Methods: Umbilical cord arterial and venous blood sample s were collected from neonates born at tertiary neonatal centre between November 2015 and February 2016 (n=906). The population was divided into three gestational groups: 23 -29+6 weeks: 30 -36+6 weeks: and 37 weeks) and customized birth weight centile calc ulated for each infant. Umbilical arterial and venous cord gas parameters were measured by co-oximetry and FOE calculated from venous and arterial pO 2. Results : An inverse relationship between birth weight centile and FOE was seen for those infants < 30 weeks gestation (p=0.02). For these infants relationships between umbilical cord FOE and umbilical arterial lactate and pH were seen with arterial lactate increasing (p=0.03) and pH decreasing (p=0.02) with elevated FOE. These effects were not seen for the late preterm and term groups. Conclusions: Whilst chronic fetal hypoxia secondary to placental insufficiency results in a reduction in fetal growth, irrespective of gestational age, this adverse intra -uterine environment is well tolerated in the more matu re fetus. With greater immaturity the capacity for this compensatory adaptation to meet on -going systemic oxygen demands is limited, reaching a critical threshold. The relationship between FOE and arterial lactate in the very preterm growth restricted pret erm neonate suggests a lowered oxygen margin of safety with FOE failing to meet on -going consumption. This could contribute to the higher incidence of morbidity and mortality in this high -risk population . Figure 1.

Abstract 35 Epigenetic programming of vascular function by fetal growth trajectory: the placenta as the Gynecology & 2Department of Neonatology, Division of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile Introduction: The association of low and excessive fetal weight with cardiovascular risk are in the central interest of DOHaD. Aim: Due to the key role of endothelium in the umbilical vascular function we have studied markers of endothelial epigenetic he terogeneity in endothelium from umbilical arteries (HUAEC) and veins (HUVEC) from intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR), adequate for gestational age (AGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) fetuses. Methods: In HUAEC from IUGR, AGA and LGA fetuses eNOS, Arg2, NOX4, oxidative stress conditions. The methylation status (by pyrosecuencing) of the promoter of these genes as well as histone modifications (H3K4 Me2/H3K4 Me3/H3K9 Me2/H3K9 Ac/H4K12 Ac) was determined DNMT1 was performed to study methylation -dependent changes. Results: In IUGR and LGA -derived HUAEC there is an increase in the basal expression of eNOS. The mRNA of Arg2 and eNOS are induced by hyp oxia in AGA -HUAEC but no change is observed in IUGR or LGA-HUAEC. Both eNOS and NOX1 showed significant changes in the methylation status at their promoter region in IUGR and LGA. ChIP showed an important amount of opened chromatin markers (H3K9 Ac, H4K12 Ac) in the NOS3 promoter. Knockdown of DNMT1 modified the expression of eNOS in IUGR and LGA compared to AGA, and this was associated to changes in methylation in CpG -352 from TSS in NOS3 gene. Conclusion: In summary both extreme phenotypes (IUGR and LGA) show changes in some key endothelial genes. These changes are associated to epigenetic marks of vascular programming in fetuses in both extremes of the growth curve. Funded: Fondecyt from AEG, IUGR, LGA foetuses. A. The NOS3 gene promoter is hypomethylated in -352 from the TSS in IUGR and LGA -derived HUAEC, compared to AGA. This correlates with the overexpression of eNOS mRNA and protein (not shown ). B. This hypomethylation in -352 is reverted with DNMT1 knockdown.Abstract 36 Factors regulating the expression of the prorenin angiotensin Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, Hunter Medical Research Institute, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW 2035 Australia; 2School of Medical Sciences, University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; 3Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology , Nottingham, Nottingham NG5 PB, UK; 4School of Paediatrics and Reproductive Health, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia Introduction: The human placenta expresses all the genes of the prorenin receptor (PRR) -renin -angioten sin system (PRR -RAS) required to produce angiotensin II (Ang II), as well as both Ang II receptor subtypes. Ang II, acting via the AT 1 receptor, stimulates cytotrophoblast proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Expression of the PRR -RAS is gr eatest in early gestation placenta, but the mechanisms controlling its expression are unknown. We are investigating the role of cAMP, oxygen and miRNAs in regulating the placental PRR -RAS. Methods: The effects of 0.3 mM 8 -bromo -cAMP, or culture in differin g oxygen tensions (1, 5, and 20%) on expression of the PRR -RAS in HTR -8/SVneo cells were studied. HTR -8/SVneo cells are a transformed first trimester extravillous trophoblast cell line. Human placentae were collected between 8 -10 weeks, 12 -16 weeks, and at term (n=4 placentae per group) and screened for 2006 miRNAs using an Agilent microRNA array and analysed using the Partek Genomic suite to detect significant changes. miRNAs that were predicted to target the PRR -RAS were studied further. miRNA expression was validated in 8 placentae at each gestation. Vectors containing miRNAs were transfected into HTR -8/SVneo cells to determine their effects on prorenin gene and protein expression. Results : In HTR -8/SVneo cells, 0.3 mM 8 -bromo -cAMP stimulated prorenin, PRR, and AT1R, while incubation in 1% oxygen stimulated expression of AT 1R and VEGF genes and enhanced ACE protein levels. Renin gene and protein expression were greatest in early gestation placentae ( P<0.01). The miRNA hsa -miR-181a (shown to regulate human renal renin gene and protein expression) was, however, most highly expressed in term placentae ( P<0.01). There were also strong inverse correlations between and both renin gene expression and prorenin protein (both controls. Conclusions: Regulation of the placental PRR -RAS pathway in early gestation is complex involving the interaction of a low oxygen environment, miRNAs and cAMP. Abnormalities in its regulation could lead to poor placentation and abnormal pregnancy outcomes as well as a predisposition to disease in adult li fe. Abstract 37 IGF2 is essential for the expansion of the fetoplacental vasculature during late gestation development 97 Constancia, M., Fowden, A., Burton, G., Georgopoulou, A., Sferruzzi -Perri, A. & Sandovici, I. Centre for Trophoblast Research, University of Cambridge Introduction: In eutherian mammals the fetoplacental vascular tree grows and expands to meet nutrient demands of the fetus in late gestation. How genes specifically contribute to this expansion remains largely unknown. Also unkno wn is the extent to which endocrine signals emanating from the fetus might control this process. In this study, we investigated the contribution of paracrine and endocrine Igf2 in the growth of the placental vascular tree using genetically engineered mice. Methods: Mice with a global reduction of Igf2 levels in embryonic -derived cell types, but normal levels in extra -embryonic cells (Igf2 Meox2Cre k.o), and mice with a specific deletion in endothelial cells (Igf2 TekCre k.o) were generated. the number of placental endothelial cells and their proliferation by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, and performed RNA transcriptome studies. Results : Igf2 deletion from fetal organs leads to reduced fetal growth (57% of normal (N) by E19) and circulating Igf2 levels (32% N), and a disproportionately smaller labyrinthine layer of the placenta (57% N of labyrinthine volume) with reductions in fetal capillary volume, surface area, length (~50% N) and endothel ial cell number (29% N) at E19. Molecular signatures of abnormal angiogenesis were found by array and RNA Seq (e.g. reduced expression of Angpt1 and Tie2, Vegfb, Hey2). A selective loss of placental endothelial cells within the labyrinthine compartment was observed, associated with reduced endothelial cell proliferation and increased expression of the p21 cyclin -dependent kinase inhibitor. RNA Seq revealed top expressed gene in placental endothelial cells. Igf2 specific deletion from endoth elial cells leads to a much less pronounced growth and angiogenesis phenotypes compared to Igf2 Meox2 k.o. (i.e. 84%N reduction fetal growth, 83%N circulating Igf2 levels and 60%N in number of endothelial cells, at E19). Conclusions: Loss of Igf2 lea ds to severe impairment of placental endothelial cell expansion during late gestation through de -regulation of pro -angiogenic and anti -angiogenic factors, leading to defects in cell proliferation and number. The angiogenesis defects were more pronounced in mice that lack Igf2 in circulation, thus suggesting that endocrine Igf2 is required to stimulate placental angiogenesis/vascular tree expansion in late gestation. Abstract 38 Periconceptional alcohol exposure reduces trophoblast giant cell differentiation and outgrowth capacity in the rat 98 Kalisch -Smith, J.I ., Simmons, D.G., Queensland, Australia Introduction: Maternal periconceptional alcohol (PC -EtOH) exposure in the rat causes fetal growth restriction and sex -specific changes to placental morphology in late gestation. This may be the result of perturbations to pre -implantation embryo development and/or its c apacity to interact with the uterine cells and form a placenta. This study aimed to examine cell allocation in the pre -implantation embryo and behaviour of trophectodermal (TE) derivatives after PC a control diet from 4 days prior (E-4) to 4 days after conception (E4) in a liquid diet. Blastocysts were collected at E5 and assessed for total cell count and allocation to either the TE (CDX2 positive) or the inner cell mass (ICM) . A subset was also used to assess nuclear CDX2 expression in TE cells when stained control and PC -EtOH embryos were stained in tandem. To determine whether EtOH affects the differentiation capacity of in vivo derived embryos, a subset was flushed at E5 and cultured in vitro for 6 days to obtain trophoblast outgrowths. Outgrowths were immunolocalised for Pan -Cytokeratin to positively label trophoblasts, and counted for those forming parietal trophoblast giant c ells (nuclear area >1000um2). Results : No differences were found between control and PC -EtOH treatments in forming a competent blastocyst at E5, when assessed for total cell number and cell allocation to the TE or the ICM. However, PC-EtOH embryos showed s ignificant reductions in nuclear TE CDX2 fluorescence intensity (P<0.0001). Embryos exposed to in vivo PC-EtOH prior to culture in vitro showed reduced trophoblast outgrowth area (P<0.05), and formation of the parietal trophoblast giant cells (P=0.01). Conclusions: This study shows in vivo PC-EtOH can affect differentiation and behaviour of the TE lineage, which may contribute to altered placental development, fetal growth restriction and the programming of adult disease. Abstract 39 Therapeutic effect of human placental -derived mesenchymal stromal cells on a Sciences, Preeclampsia (PE), the most severe human pregnancy -related syndrome, is a leading cause of fetal-maternal mortality and morbidity and lacks of an effective therapy. Main hallmarks of PE are severe maternal hypertension and proteinuria, expression of a generalized endothelial damage and inflammation that could lead to Fetal Growth Restriction (F GR). Human Placenta -Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hPDMSCs) are well renowned for their pro -angiogenic and anti -inflammatory effects exerted via paracrine interactions. Herein, we tested the effects of hPDMSCs -derived soluble molecules on a mouse model of preeclampsia. Methods: An injectable bioactive formulation (CB -ChMF -11) trophic was kindly provided by Corion Biotech S.r.l. (Italy). Preeclampsia was induced in pregnant C57BL/6NCrl mice by endovenous bacterial Lipop olysaccharide (LPS) injection. Starting from d9, maternal blood pressure and proteinuria were monitored until d19. At d11 of pregnancy, dams were injected with E.Coli LPS (1\u00b5g/Kg). At d12, mice were randomly divided into two groups (n=7 each) and treated e ndovenous as follow: plain vehicle (300\u00b5l, placebo) and CB -ChMF -11 (300\u00b5l, treated). At d19, mice were sacrificed. Number of fetuses, FGR, fetal reabsorption and placental weight were evaluated. Next, placentae were processed for mRNA isolation and cDNA pr eparation. sFlt -1, IL -6 and TNF - gene expression were evaluated by Real Time PCR. Results : Injection of CB -ChMF -11 on d12 significantly decreased maternal systolic blood pressure (p<0.05) and proteinuria (p<0.05) by day 13 until term relative to placebo g roup. No FGR and/or reabsorbed fetuses were delivered by CB -ChMF -11 treated PE mice, while 5 FGR fetuses were found in the placebo group (p=0.02). No differences were found in placental weight between groups. CB -ChMF -11 treatment significantly decreased sFlt-1, IL -6 and TNF - mRNA levels (p<0.05) in PE mice relative to placebo group. Conclusions: Our data indicate that hPDMSCs -derived trophic mediators can reverse PE -like features during pregnancy, suggesting a therapeutic role for hPDMSCs for the treatment of preeclampsia.Abstract 40 Placental uptake and metabolism of vitamin D 100 Simner, C.L., Lewis, R.M., Cooper, C., Harvey, N.C., and Cleal , J.K. Institute of Developmental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK Introduction: Low vitamin D levels are common in pregnancy and are linked to suboptim al fetal growth. Maternal supplementation with inactive -25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is recommended. It is unclear whether both 25(OH)D and active -1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) are taken up by placenta. Vitamin D circulates bound to carrier protein s, vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and albumin, but their role in placental vitamin D uptake is unclear. We investigated whether both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D are taken up by human placenta, and whether carrier proteins impact upon uptake. Methods: Term hum an placentas were collected within 30 min of delivery. Placental villous fragments were cultured for 8 h in Tyrodes buffer containing 20 \u00b5M 25(OH)D (n=11). Endocy tic mechanisms of 1,25(OH)2D uptake were investigated by adding 5 mM amiloride (n=5) or 80 \u00b5M dynasore (n=5). mRNA expression of CYP24A1, a vitamin D responsive gene, was measured by qRT -PCR. Villous fragments were incubated 1 h at 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. Samples were fixed, stained with lectins, and viewed using confocal microscopy. Data were and compared to controls; this increased further of albumin (p=0.01). 1,25(OH)2D increased CYP24A1 mRNA expression (p<0.001) compared to did not increase further with albumin (p=0.16). FITC -albumin uptake increased with not at 4\u00b0C (p=0.004). Dynasore did not alter CYP24A1 expression compared with or without albumin. Amiloride reduced CYP24A1 mRNA to 1,25(OH)2D with without and als o reduced FITC -albumin uptake (p=0.03). Conclusion: These data suggest that both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D are taken up into the placenta and can induce vitamin D dependent gene expression, implying the placenta converts 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D. Furthermore upt ake of 25(OH)D may be enhanced by albumin, while amiloride inhibited albumin uptake and 1,25(OH)2D stimulated CYP24A1 expression, suggesting endocytic uptake.

Failure to achieve the right balance can lead to pregnancy complications and abnormal fetal development with long -term consequences for both maternal and offspring health. As the site of materno -fetal substrate transfer, the placenta is central this tug-of-war over nutrient allocation. Previous work indicates that the placenta can adapt dynamically to both fetal signals of nutrient demand and maternal signals of nutrient availability to ensure appropriate allocation of available resources (reviewed by Sferruzzi -Perri and Camm 2016). The fetus and mother therefore, have to cooperate to optimise both offspring and maternal fitness but, little is known about the relative importance of the fetal versus the maternal genome, in balancing resource allocation at the placental level. Methods: We used genetic inactivation of the growth and metabolism regulatory protein PI3K -p110 (/+) in mice as a tool to examine the interplay between the maternal and fetal genomes on placental phenotype. This was achieved by studying feto -placental growth, placental morphology and transport in litters of mixed genotype that were generated through reciprocal crosses of wildtype and /+ mice. Data were collected on days 16 and 19 (term=20 days). Results :Placental growth and structu re were impaired and associated with reduced growth of /+ fetuses at both days of pregnancy(Figure). Despite its defective development, the /+ placenta adapted functionally to increase the supply of maternal glucose and amino acid to the fetus, particula rly near term(Figure). The specific nature of these changes however, depended on whether the mother was /+ or wildtype and were related to alterations in endocrine and metabolic profile induced by maternal PI3K -p110 deficiency . Conclusions: Our findings show that the maternal genotype and environment programmes placental growth and function and identify the placenta as critical in integrating both intrinsic and extrinsic signals governing materno -fetal resource allocation. Furthermore, our study highlight s that the /+ mouse is a useful tool for investigating the mechanisms and role of maternal -fetal genome interactions in determining how health of offspring may be programmed by the maternal environment.

Abstract 42 Significance of the first hour of the fetal heart rate monitoring during labour: nonreactive vs. reactive initial trace 105 of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, University of Oxford Introduction: Fetal heart rate (FHR) 'cyclicity' is defined as alternating episodes of quiet sleep and reactivity (active sleep). Antepartum, a 'normal' trace require at least one episode of FHR reactivity in an hour. Du ring early labour, identification of the nonreactive FHR may also be informative owing to its association with pre -existing fetal compromise, such as neurological injury, infection or inflammation (Phelan & Kim, Seminar Perinatol 24;2000). We used comput erised methods to detect nonreactive FHR patterns at the onset of FHR monitoring in clinical practice and report their incidence and association with perinatal outcome. Methods: All singleton births at Oxford in Jan'93 -Dec'11, of gestation > 35 weeks with intrapartum FHR monitoring of 1 hour were included; excluded were breech presentations and congenital abnormalities. The first hour of the FHR was analysed. Nonreactive FHR was defined with computer ( Georgieva et al, BJOG 128;2014) and no accelerations during the first hour. Severe compromise was a composite outcome of stillbirth, neonatal death (<28 days), neonatal encephalopathy, seizures; or resuscitation at birth followed by 48hrs of intensive care. Results : In total 52,632 cases were included; 184 (0.34%) were nonreactive (34% before established labour, 57% in the first stage of labour). Their characteristics were compared with the remaining 52,448 births (Table 1). Those with nonreactive pattern s were three times more likely to have severe compromise. Table 1. Comparison of the cases with nonreactive initial FHR and the remaining deliveries. Nonreactive (n1 = 184) Remaining births (n2 = 2.39 27 (0.05%) - The sensitivity of the test was only 1.39%, but because a nonreactive FHR was so rare (0.34%), the false positive rate was also very low (about 3 in 1,000). The risk for severe compromise was 1 in 124 for the entire dataset, but increased to 1 in 31 in the nonreactive cases; and to 1 in 5 in the nonreactive cases with thick meconium. Conclusions: Persistently nonreactive FHR in the first hour of intrapartum monitoring is rare. Computerised FHR monitoring can reliably alert clinicians if such a pattern is present. Nonreactive initial FHR in the presence of thick meconium carries a 1 in 5 risk for s evere compromise, indicating the need for prompt intervention.Abstract 43 A heretical view: Placental 11 -HSD2 may not perform a placental protective function but rather act to provide substrate for fetal peripheral cortisol synthesis 106 Smith, A.M., Ghnenis, A.B., Odhiambo, J.F., Nathanielsz, P.W., Ford, S.P . Center for the Study of Fetal Programming, Department of Animal Science, University of Wyoming Introduction: Obese (OB) pregnant ewes and their fetuses display elevated blood cortisol from mid to late gestation. Cortisol levels higher than appropriate for the current stage of fetal development are associated with adverse development and postnatal offspring health . Elevated fetal cortisol in maternal OB occurs without increased fetal ACTH suggesting a nonadrenal source. This study was conducted to determine the source of this fetal cortisol rise, - fetal and/or maternal origin. Methods: Multiparous ewes ate eithe r 100% National Research (NRC) (CTR, n=7) or 150% NRC (OB, n=7) starting 60 days before conception until necropsy day 135, 0.9 gestation. At necropsy, maternal jugular and umbilical venous blood were collected. Fetal liver, perirena l fat and cotyledonary tissues were snap frozen. Cortisol concentrations in maternal plasma and cortisol and cortisone in fetal plasma were determined by 1 D), and 11 -HSD2 protein were determined by Western blot in fetal liver, perirenal fat and cotyledonary tissue. Group differences were determined via proc MIXED procedure of SAS. Data M + SEM. Results : At 0.9G, maternal plasma cortisol were higher in OB vs CTR, P<0.01. Expression of 11 -HSD2 (which converts cortisol to cortisone) was higher ( P<0.05) in cotyledo nary tissue of OB versus CTR fetuses (0.5 \u00b1 0.05 vs. 0.4 \u00b1 0.04 arbitrary units [au]). Expression of 11 -HSD1(which converts cortisone to cortisol in the presence of the cofactor, H6PD) was increased ( P<0.05) in OB versus CTR in fetal liver (0.7 \u00b10.13 vs. 0.3 \u00b1 0.13 au), and perirenal fat (1.7 \u00b1 0.17 vs 1.19 \u00b1 0.17 au). Fetal H6PD increased ( P<0.05) in OB vs. CTR perirenal fat (0.4 \u00b1 0.03 vs 0.3 \u00b1 0.03 au) and tended to increase in liver (0.7 \u00b1 0.06 vs. 0.5 \u00b1 0.05 au, P<0.10). Conclusions : Novel, heretic al hypothesis: In maternal OB, maternal cortisol is converted to cortisone by the placenta. Cortisone can then act as a substrate for peripheral fetal cortisol production. Figure 1. Maternal -placental and fetal glucocorticoid metabolism in OB . 11 -HSD2 up regulation within OB placental cotyledons converts elevated maternal cortisol to fetal cortisone. hepatic and peripheral adipose tissue11 -HSD1 and H6PD then use circulating fetal cortisone as a substrate to synthesize cortisol which may may act locally and/or systemically in the circulation. Abstract 44 Fetal g rowth and the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) in a prospective cohort study of Nulliparous women 107 Partap, U., Sovio, U., Smith, G.C.S. Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cambridge, Box 223, The Rosie H ospital, Cambridge, CB2 0SW, UK Background Previous studies have suggested an association between fetal growth restriction and the risk of sPTB. However, there are significant methodological hurdles to addressing this association. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of nulliparous women with a viable singleton pregnancy (Lancet 2015;386:2089 -97). Ultras onic fetal biometry was performed at 20 and 28 weeks of gestational age (wkGA). All biometric measurements were expressed as gestational age -adjusted z -scores. Fetal growth velocity was quantified by the change in z -score between 20 and 28wkGA. The outcome was sPTB, defined as delivery 28 and <37 weeks, associated with labour in the absence of a method of induction of labour. The risk of sPTB was analysed using Cox regression. Results There were 3,892 women eligible for the current analysis and 98 (2.5%) had a sPTB. There was a highly significant association between the growth velocity of the fetal femur between 20 and 28 weeks and the risk of sPTB (Figure): the lowest decile was associated with a of 2.37 (95% CI: 1.43 -3.93, P<0.001). Adjustme nt for maternal material effect (adjusted HR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.50-4.14, P<0.001). There were no significant associations between other fetal measurements and the risk of sPTB. Conclusions We conclude that fetal growth restriction is associated with an increased risk of sPTB and speculate that serial assessment of fetal growth may enhance prediction of the condition. Figure.

Sex differences are not taken into account when evaluating feto -placental hemodynamics. We hypothesized that placental blood flow is different between male and female fetuses. Our objective was to investigate gestationa l age-specific serial changes in umbilical vein blood flow (Q uv) during the second half of normal pregnancy and establish sex -specific reference ranges.\" Methods: This was a prospective longitudinal study of singleton low risk pregnancies. UV diameter and blood flow velocity were serially measured using ultrasonography at the intra -abdominal portion of the UV during 19 -40 weeks. Q uv was calculated as the product of mean velocity (0.5xV max) and cross -sectional area of the vessel, and normalized for estimate d fetal weight. Results : Of 179 women (87 male and 92 female fetuses) included in the final analysis,746 observations were used to construct sex -specific reference ranges. We found no statistically significant differences in UV diameter, V max, and absolute or normalized Q uv between male and female fetuses. However, they appeared to have some differences in the temporal development pattern of normalized Q uv during the second half of pregnancy with cross -overs at 24 and 32 weeks of gestation. Conclusions: Feto-placental blood flow is similar among male and female fetuses in quantitative terms, but the pattern of gestational age -dependent temporal changes may be different with important physiological implications in regards to in utero development and maturati on of feto -placental unit. Abstract 46 Changes in myometrial potassium channel function and expression in dysfunctional human labour 109 1Parkington, H. C ., 1Tonta, M. A., 2Stevenson, J., 1Goundar, C., 2Sheehan, P. M., 1Tare, M., 1Coleman, H. A. & 3Brennecke, S. P. 1Dept Physiology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia, 2Dept Perinatal Medicine, Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 3Dept Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Introduction: Strong labour contractions require calcium influx through voltage -gated calcium channels. Thus, myometrial smooth muscle membrane potential is criti cal for strong labour progress. Dysfunctional labour (DL) is a significant problem in the labour ward, and is the most common indication for caesarean delivery. We recently discovered a marked excessive negative membrane potential in myometrium of both lean and obese DL women. We hypothesized that abnormally high expression and/or activity of potassium channels leads to a large negative resting membrane potential which suppresses opening of voltage -gated calcium channels resulting in weak contractions and D L necessitating caesarean delivery. Methods: Electrophysiology was used to record membrane potential and K+ channel activity simultaneously with contraction in myometrial strips and isolated cells from women at term not -in-labour (NIL) and in labour (IL). K+ channel protein expression was determined using western blotting. Results : Myometrial strips from women progressing well IL had spontaneous contractions (n=7). DL strips did not contract spontaneously (n=9), although contraction could be achieved using experimental depolarizations. Resting membrane potential in myometrium from normally progressing women NIL was -58\u00b11mV (n=17) and IL was -58\u00b11mV (n=7). DL myometrium was significantly more negative IL ( n=9). Blockade of K V7 channels, using XE -991, returned resting potential to normal levels ( -61\u00b12mV) in high negative DL myometrium. Expression of K V7.1 protein did not change in myometrium from normally progressing women before versus in labour, but was significantly increased in DL (21.2\u00b12.4, n=5) versus normal progress IL (11.9\u00b11.6, n=5, p=0.02). Levels of K V7.4 protein were also significantly increase d in myometrium from DL IL women (1.18\u00b10.14, n=5) versus normally progressing labour (0.26\u00b10.04, n=5, p=0.0008). In acutely isolated myometrial cells the K V7 current (at 20mV) was enhanced in IL DL (6.1\u00b11.1pA/pF) versus normal progress (2.5\u00b10.5pA/pF, p=0.0 2). In DL myometrium, depolarization evoked by oxytocin (10nM) was 8\u00b12mV, insufficient to reach threshold for the opening of voltage -gated calcium channels and so did not cause contraction. Conclusions: KV7 channels have a major input into determining the level of membrane potential in human myometrium at term and increased expression of these channels induces excessive negativity resulting in the weak contractions of dysfunctional labour, necessitating caesarean delivery.

Abstract 47 Eating for two during pregnancy -Programming by maternal diet-induced obesity 113 Ozanne , S.E. Metabolic Research Laboratories, University of Cambridge, UK Obesity prevalence is increasing at an alarming rate in both the developed and developing world. This is observed in all groups within the population, including women of childbearing age. Indeed recent statistics demonstrate that over half of pregnant wome n in the UK are now either overweight or obese during pregnancy. Therefore for the first time being of healthy weight during pregnancy in the UK now places a woman in the minority. This is of particular concern as obesity during pregnancy not only has imme diate detrimental consequences for both mother and baby, there is growing evidence to suggest that developing in utero in an obesogenic environment has a long term impact on the metabolic and cardiovascular health of the child. These effects are not simply mediated by transmission of obesity genes from mother to child but occur through epigenetic mechanisms. This has been termed the developmental origins of health and disease and has been supported by studies in humans and in animal models. The strongest ev idence from humans to suggest that development in an obesogenic in utero environment \"programmes\" increased risk of obesity and cardio -metabolic disease has come from the study of siblings, living in the same household but born either before or after mater nal bariatric surgery. These studies revealed that the sibling born post surgery when the mother was leaner had reduced adiposity, lower blood pressure and increased insulin sensitivity compared to their sibling born prior to maternal weight reducing surge ry. We have used a mouse model of diet -induced obesity to define the mechanisms by which obesity during pregnancy impacts on the long -term cardio -metabolic health of the offspring. These studies have demonstrated that the offspring of obese dams develop insulin resistance, cardiac dysfunction and fatty liver even when weaned onto a healthy low fat diet. They are also more susceptible to diet -induced obesity that further exaggerates the detrimental health consequences of maternal obesity. Our studies have id entified maternal insulin as a key 'programming\" factor and therefore highlight it as an important target of interventions studies. Abstract 48 Maternal obesity (MO) programs dysfunction of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway producing oxidative stress (OS) and leads to hepatic steatosis in offspring (F1) male rats exacerbated by SZ, Mexico City, Mexico, 14080; 2 Texa s Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX, United States, 78227, 3Animal Science, University of Wyoming, La ramie, WY, United States, 82071 Introduction: MO predisposes F1 to later life metabolic disorders through several mechanisms. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the commonest liver disorder. With aging, the liver undergoes substantial changes in structure and function that are associated wi th significant impairment of hepatic metabolic activities. However, the mechanism (s) whereby MO and/or aging affect NAFLD development are poorly understood. A decline in oxidative phosphorylation is proposed as a mechanism central to limitation of life e xpectancy. We hypothesize that MO causes F1 liver electron transfer chain (ETC) gene down regulation, increasing ROS, leading to NAFLD. Methods: F0 female rats ate control (C) or obesogenic diet (MO) from weaning through lactation. After weaning F1 males a te C diet. At PND 110 and 650 serum and liver were collected for histology, liver triglycerides (TG) and OS parameters, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for sirtuin 2 (SIRT -2). We performed F1 liver transcriptomics (RNA -seq) for differentially expressed gene s (DEG) by age and diet . Data M \u00b1 SE, one -way ANOVA for all four groups for RNAseq, M\u00b1SE Log2. Results : MO F1 at 110d show impaired hepatic lipid function, increased NAFLD markers OS and serum lipid, exacerbated in MO at 650d vs. C 650d. MO liver lipoperox idation and ROS increased while antioxidant enzymes activity and gene expression decreased earlier than in C F1 (data not shown). We found DEG in natural aging (C 110 vs C 650) with 97% down regulated as well as DEG between F1 male C and MO livers also 95% down -regulated. We used KEGG to identify candidate pathways related to premature aging in F1 from MO. All oxidative phosphorylation complexes showed gene down regulation in F1 from MO at 110d (Fig 1A -1D). Sirtuins are anti -aging proteins. In MO 110d SIRT -2 mRNA and protein was decreased to levels seen in F1 at C650d indicating premature aging. Conclusions: MO programs F1 metabolic dysfunction and aging trajectory predisposing F1 to premature aging. MO increases F1 liver fat accumulation and increased ROS and decreased antioxidant enzymes, potential mechanisms for programming MO F1 life course metabolic dysfunction. Figure 1.

Creatine is obtained from a diet rich in fish, meat or dairy, or by endogenous synthesis from the amino acids arginine, glycine and methionine. When supplemented in pregnant animals, creatine prevents birth asphyxia induced damage to the fetus. Her e we present the first evidence for de novo placental creatine synthesis, and for altered creatine synthesis and transport in pregnancies with fetal growth restriction (FGR). Methods: These data were generated from 2 cohorts of placenta samples: (1) contr ol term caesarean section deliveries Medical (2) age -matched idiopathic FGR (n=13) and control (n=20) deliveries at 27 -40 weeks gestation from The Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne. In Cohort 1, creatine synthesis was determined by ex vivo biosynthesis assay with creatine concentrations slc6a8, determined immunohistochemistry. GAMT protein was identified by western blot . For Cohort 2, expression of AGAT, GAMT and slc6a8 were assessed using Fluidigm BioMark HD system TaqMan chemistry. Results : The term placenta synthesis creatine ex vivo and expresses the creatine transporter and AGAT enzyme on the syncytiotrophoblast lay P<0.01) and placenta. In FGR placenta, expression of AGAT and slc6a8 remained steady with advancing gestation and were 2 -fold hig her at any given gestational age than age matched controls. Conclusions: The human placenta is not only a site of creatine transport, but also of synthesis. We hypothesize that pregnancy results in displacement of creatine synthesis from the maternal renal -hepatic axis to the placenta, thus ensuring creatine supply to the fetus. An adaptation to FGR may include up-regulation of creatine synthesis and in and Medical Sciences, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, UK 2Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cam bridge, Cambridge, UK, 3School of Animal Biology, University of Western Australia, 6009 Crawley, Australia Introduction: Thyroid hormones are important regulators of fetal growth, although their mechanism of action remains unclear. In the sheep fetus, thyroid hormone deficiency increases plasma insulin and leptin concentrations. This study investigated the effects of hypoth yroidism on perirenal adipose tissue (PAT) development and adipose insulin signalling pathways in fetal sheep. Methods: All procedures were performed under the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. In 10 twin-bearing pregnant ewes at 105 -110 days of gestation (d; term~145d) and under general anaesthesia, one fetus was thyroidectomised (TX), while the other was sham -operated. After maternal and fetal euthanasia, PAT was collected from the fetuses at 143d, weighed, and frozen or processed for histology and stereological assessment. Protein and mRNA content was determined by Western blotting and qRT-PCR. Data (mean\u00b1SEM) were assessed by Student's t -test. Results : Absolute and relative PAT mass was increased in TX fetuses compared to sham fetuses due to a 2 -fold increase in absolute and relative mass of unilocular (absolute: no the multilocular (brown) adipocytes. Relative unilocular adipocyte mass correlated leptin P 0.002). Unilocular adipocyte perimeter was unaffected by TX which indicated that thyroid hormone deficiency in utero induced hyperplasia rather than hypertrophy of unilocular adipocytes. In PAT from TX fetuses, increases were observed in protein levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, the insulin -sensitive glucose transporter -4 and phosphorylated S6 -kinase, and in mRNA and protein levels of the differentiation marker, peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor - (P0.05). Conclusions: In the ovine fetus, development of unilocular adipocyte mass in PAT is sensitive to changes in thyroid hormones, which may be related, in part, to altered insulin concentrations in utero. These findings have implications for the control of adipose functio n and leptin secretion before and after birth.Abstract 51 Decreased substrate oxidation and increased lactate parallel hepatic glucose production in fetal sheep with intrauterine growth restriction 117 Hepatic Uptake mol/min/100g & Hay, W.W. Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, USA Introduction: Intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) fetal sheep have increased hepatic glucose production (HGP). IUGR fetal livers also have increased LDHA and PDK4 mRNA expression. Thus, we hypothesized that IUGR fetal livers would have increased lactate production an d utilization, increased amino acid uptake, and decreased substrate oxidation, which would support HGP. Methods: Placental insufficiency and IUGR fetal sheep were produced by exposure to elevated temperatures. Chronic hepatic catheterization was used to m easure fetal hepatic blood flow and net flux of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, amino acids, and oxygen across the left liver lobe (CON, n=7; IUGR, n=4). Fetal liver (CON, n=6; IUGR, n=7). hepatocytes wer e (CON, n=7; IUGR, n=12) and glucose production rate (GPR) was measured after 24h in basal media (minus glucose) or with substrates: lactate (Lac), pyruvate (Pyr), mixed amino acids (AA), or Lac+Pyr+AA. Results : IUGR fetuses weighed 40% less and had lower blood oxygen contents and plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, and higher plasma lactate concentrations (P<0.05). Hepatic blood flow, adjusted for liver weight, was similar, yet hepatic oxygen uptake was 40% lower in IUGR fetuses (Fig.1). CON fetuses had hepatic glucose uptake, which was negligible in IUGR fetuses (Fig.1). Hepatic lactate uptake and pyruvate release were similar between CON and IUGR fetuses, yet uptake of Gly, Ala, Met, Leu, Phe, and Lys were reduced in IUGR fetuses (P<0.05 ). IUGR livers had decreased metabolite concentrations of total nucleotides, ATP, and cholesterol, and increased concentrations of Ala, beta -hydroyxbutyrate, and N-acetylglutamate (P<0.05). In IUGR to CON. GPR was increased with Lac, Lac+Pyr, AA, and Lac+Pyr+AA in IUGR hepatocytes HGP in IUGR fetuses is associated with decreased hepatic oxygen uptake, amino acid uptake, and nu cleotide and ATP concentrations, indicating decreased substrate oxidation. Increased hepatic Ala concentrations and increased hepatocyte GPR with Lac and AA suggest use of these carbon substrates for HGP. We speculate that these glucogenic substrates are p roduced or alternatively metabolized, spared from oxidation, and thus used to fuel HGP in the IUGR fetus. Figure 1.

Abstract 52 Life at the limit -studies of human energy metabolism at extreme high altitude* 121 Murray, A.J. Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, UK * Dawes Lecture At high altitude, barometric pressure falls and with it inspired P O2, compromising oxygen delivery to the tissues. With sufficient acclimatisation, the erythropoietic response increases red blood cell mass such that arterial O 2 content is restored; however arterial O 2 pressure remains low, and the diffusion of O 2 from capillary to mitochondrion is impaired. Mitochondrial respiration and aerobic capacity are thus limited, whilst reactive oxygen species (ROS) production increases. Use of supplementary O 2 does not fully recover aerobic capacity, hinting at a lasting peripheral impairment. In 2007, as part of the Caudwell Xtreme Everest expedition we studied Lowlander mountaineers returning from extreme high altitude at the summit of Mt Everest (8848 m), and found that cardiac energy levels fell and altered skeletal muscle energetics were seen. This was accompanied by a loss of skeletal muscle mitochondrial density, which may explain the lasting peripheral impairment. In contrast with Lowlanders, the Himalayan Sherpas, a human population of Tibetan descent, are highly adapted to life in the hypobaric hypoxia of high altitude. Physiological features and genetic signals of Tibetan groups have hinted at adaptations in oxygen supply to the tissues, however little was known about oxygen utilisation. In 2013, we therefore investigated Sherpa and Lowlander subjects before and during exposure to hypobaric hypoxia during an ascent to Mount Evere st Base Camp (5300 m; Figure 1). Here we found that Sherpas have a metabolic adaptation to life at high altitude that is associated with enhanced efficiency of mitochondrial oxygen utilisation, improved muscle energetics and protection against oxidative stress compared with Lowlanders, in part associated with a putatively advantageous allele for the PPARA gene. Our work therefore suggests that metabolic adaptations underpin human evolution to life at high altitude, and could impact upon our understanding of human diseases where hypoxia is a feature.

Dr James Horscroft and Dr Aleksandra Kotwica carry out High Resolution Respirometry to measure mitochondrial function in biopsies of their own skeletal muscle at Mt Everest Base Camp, Nepal (5300 m above sea level), as part of Xtreme Everest 2 in 2013.

Structural Brain Mapping Group, Dept. of Neurology, University Hospital Jena, Germany and Southwest National Primate Research Center, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX , United States Introduction: Decreased fetal nutrient delivery is widespread worldwide, resulting in disturbances of early organizational processes in cerebral development, major impairment of fetal brain structure, and life -long cognitive alterations. This study applies our innovativ e, non -invasive in vivo MRI biomarker to evaluate effects of fetal undernutrition on individual brain aging in the closest available species for translation to human brain development, eliminating confounds occurring in epidemiological studies. We hypothes ized that subjects exposed to fetal undernutrition would show premature brain aging during adulthood. Methods: First, MRI data from 29 control subjects ( Papio hamadryas ; aged 4 -22y; human equivalent 16-88y) were used to construct a reference curve for brai n aging in baboons, applying our novel baboon -specific MRI preprocessing pipeline and pattern recognition algorithms. Second, individual deviations from normal brain aging were analyzed in 5 young adult female baboons (aged 4 -7y) that were exposed to fetal undernutrition, resulting in intra -uterine growth restriction (IUGR), and 5 same -aged female controls. Results : Premature brain aging by +2.7 years ( p<0.01) was observed in the sample of young adult female IUGR offspring. Conclusions: This study is the first to reveal premature brain aging during young adulthood resulting from developmental programming due to fetal undernutrition. Our innovative in-vivo biomarker will enable tracking longitudinal effects of (preventive) treatments, deve lopmental and environmental influences on individual brain aging. Figure 1.

Structural Brain Mapping Group, Dept. of Neurology, University Hospital Jena, Germany & Southwest National Primate Research Center, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San An tonio, TX, United States Introduction: Synthetic glucocorticoids (sGC) are administered to women threatening premature delivery to accelerate fetal lung maturation, a treatment with clear benefits on offspring morbidity and mortality. However, exposure to inappropriately high levels of sGC for the current stage of brain development has been shown to result in adverse outcomes of brain development in several species. In our baboon model of fetal sGC exposure we have already shown sex -specific behavioral eff ects in the juvenile offspring. This study examines brain aging of the sGC -exposed animals during mid - adulthood. Methods: First, in-vivo MRI data from 29 control baboons (aged 4 -22y; human equivalent 16 -88y) were used to construct a reference curve for br ain aging, applying our novel baboon -specific MRI preprocessing pipeline and pattern recognition algorithms. Second, individual deviations from normal brain aging were analyzed in 4 mid -adulthood male sGC baboons (10y; human equiv. 40y) with maternal treat ment of 3 courses of betamethasone (175 g/kg/day on two consecutive days) at 0.6, 0.64, and 0.68 gestation (human equiv. 24, 26, 28 weeks pregnancy) and 4 age -matched saline exposed male controls. Results : Premature brain aging by +1.3 years ( p<0.05) was observed in the male mid -adult offspring of mothers who received sGC treatment during pregnancy. Conclusions: This study is the first to reveal premature brain aging during adulthood resulting from developmental programming by sGC treatment during gestati on. There is a need for further studies on the brain tracking longitudinal effects of sGC exposure in the baboon model and human samples to enable early diagnosis and preventive treatment. Figure 1.

[Funding: RR021367 -01 gating deficits following pre and postnatal stress in guinea pig offspring 126 McInerney, K.M., Palliser, H.K., Shaw, J.C. and Hirst, J. J. Mothers and Babies Research Centre and School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia Introduction: Infants born following compromised pregnancies are often exposed to further stress, such as maternal separation, during their time in the NICU. Perinatal stress increases vulnerability to anxiety and other behavioural/attention disorders in childhood and beyond. Previous studies have shown that the long -term effects of prenatal stress on offspring behaviour are enhan ced by a range of postnatal maternal stressorsEmack and Matthews, 2011). Anxiety spectrum disorders and cognitive impairments are associated with sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition, PPI) deficits. Neurosteroids have been recently found to play an imp ortant role in the regulation of PPI and neurosteroid deficiencies have also been linked to perinatal stress and the development of these disorders. Our aim was to develop a model of prenatal maternal stress followed by postnatal separation stress in the guinea pigs that results in sensorimotor gating deficits for the future assessment of the neurosteroid based anxiolytics and their potential use as therapies for reducing behavioural disorders. Methods: Pregnant guinea pigs were exposed to psychosomatic str ess (strobe light exposure, 2hrs/day every 5 days, GA50 to term) or were subjected a control exposure (no light) before delivering spontaneously. Neonates from these psychosomatic stress, and a subset of control pregnancies underwent maternal and peer sepa ration from PND2 -8 (postnatal stress, 2hrs/day; pre + postnatal stress). Offspring underwent acoustic startle (SR -LABs) testing at 28 days of age. Acoustic startle testing involved measuring the startle response to a 120dB stimulus with and without presen tation of a low intensity, non -startling pulse (3 -15dB above background) immediately prior to the stimulus to assess prepulse inhibition (PPI). Results : Baseline startle response was inhibited in offspring from both the post and pre+post stress groups. P PI was disrupted in pre+post stressed offspring compared to controls (Figure). Conclusions: Dual (pre and postnatal) stress decreases sensorimotor gating in offspring that is consistent with an anxious phenotype. These findings indicate postnatal stress markedly potentiates the adverse effects of maternal stresses during late pregnancy and suggests this is a suitable model for the evaluation of therapeutic interventions. Further assessment of longer term behavioural and neurodevelopmental outcomes is wa rranted. Figure 1.

In particular, the syncithiotrophoblast metabolizes fetal serotonin from maternal circulating tryptophan until the second trimester of pregnancy. We recently reported that, within the chorionic villi, 3 /4, key modulators of neurogenesis. Importantly, we demonstrated that these molecules are over -expressed in PDMSCs isolated from pregnancies complicated by PE -FGR, severe placenta -related disorders associated with neurological disorders and intellectual di sability for the newborn. PDMSCs contribution to fetal neurodevelopment has never been investigated. Our aim is to characterize the expression of neurogenesis mediators Doublecortin and NCAM, of neurogenesis, in normal and PE -PDMSCs in order to understand their role in physiopathological fetal neurodevelopment. Methods: PDMSCs levels were determined by Real -Time PCR. Western blot was used to evaluate NCAM \"polysialic acid -modified\" (PSA -NCAM) protein levels. PSA -NCAM express ion is inversely correlated to that of NCAM, acting as a negative modulator of neurodevelopment. Spatial expression of IDO, PSA -NCAM and Nestin, a neurofilament typically found in neuroblast, was using immunocytofluorescence (ICF). Results : Doublecortin and mRNA levels were -expressed (p<0.05), mRNA was decreased (p<0.05) in PE -FGR vs normal PDMSCs. In contrast, PSA protein levels were down PE -FGR PDMSCs. PSA-NCAM, IDO and Nestin expression was confirmed by ICF. Conclusions: We characterized, for the first time to our knowledge, the expression of neurogenesis mediators in normal and PE miRNAs down -regulation suggest t hat PE -PDMSCs try to counteract impaired fetal neurodevelopment by promoting the expression of pro -neurogenic molecules and avoiding placental accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites . Further investigations are required.Poster 5 The Role of Neonatal Dexamethasone Exposure on Adult Psychiatric Phenotypes in a Rodent Model 128 Yates, N. J. , Martin -Iverson, M. T. , Robertson, D., and Rodger, J. The University of Western Australia, School of Animal Biology Introduction: The effects of early life stress in utero or as neonates has long -term consequences on hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) stress axis function and neurodevelopment. These effects extend into adulthood and may underpin a variety of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Additionally early life difficulties associated with glucocorticoid treatment in infants are associated with adult mental health issues. Yet no study has comprehensively attempted to mechanistically link early life HPA axis activation with schizophrenia phenotypes. We examined the potential developmental programming effects on adult behaviour and brain function of neonatal glucocor ticoid exposure using the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone in rat pups. Methods: Rat pups were injected with 1.5 mg/kg dexamethasone solution or saline vehicle from postnatal day 5 to 10 inclusive. We utilized a comprehensive battery of assessments for adult behaviour (i.e. startle reactivity, dopamine sensitivity, anxiety), brain function (i.e. EEG, auditory evoked potentials) and gene expression (i.e. dopamine and glucocorticoid genes) to determine if elevated early life HPA activation is associat ed with adult -onset schizophrenia -like traits. Results : Neonatal dexamethasone exposure in rats increased startle reactivity under all conditions tested, yet it decreased sensitivity of sensorimotor gating to dopaminergic disruption - opposite of what is observed in schizophrenia and other psychiatric illness es. There also appeared to be mild long -term reductions in stress and anxiety -related behaviours with neonatal dexamethasone exposure. Electrophysiology revealed that there were no schizophrenia -like abnormalities in auditory processing or resting state br ain function with dexamethasone exposure. However, neonatal dexamethasone Neonatal glucocorticoid exposure in has subtle yet long lasting effects on neurodevelopmental programming. Our results indicate that neonatal HPA axis activation by dexamethasone alters several aspects of adult brain function and behaviour, but is not specifically related to any particular neuropsychiatric disease such as schizophrenia. Changes in dopamine sensitivity and startle reactivity indicate that excessive neonatal glucocorticoids may alter the ability t o filter sensory stimuli as adults, which has broad implications on learning and attention. In addition the phenotype indicates that neonatal dexamethasone exposure may induce long -term changes in emotional stress -reactivity. Poster 6 Creatine protects the fetal brain from the effects of severe In Utero hypoxia 129 Dickinson,H.1.2, Rajakaruna, S.1, Ellery, S. 1, Muccini, A. 1, Hale, N. 1, Snow, R. 3, Walker, D.1,2 1The Ritchie Centre, Hudson Institute of Medical Research,2 Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Monash University; 3Institute for Physical Activity & Nutrition, Deakin University Melbourne, Australia Introduction: Protecting the brain from injury through the perinatal period is imperative to preventing brain injury and neurodevelopmental disabilities acquired in utero or at birth. Supplementation of creatine in late pregnancy has been shown to be an effective neuroprotective agent in the context of birth asphyxia in spiny mice (Ireland et al, 2011). In this study we examined the effect of increasing creatine in fetal s heep on the extent of cell death and brain injury caused by in utero cerebral hypoxia/ischaemia induced by umbilical cord occlusion (UCO). Methods: Singleton fetuses of 11 pregnant ewes were surgically prepared at 118 days gestation with an inflatable cuf f placed around the umbilical cord, and catheters for intravenous infusion of either creatine (6 mg/kg/h, n=6) or the equivalent volume of saline (6 ml/kg/h, n=5) from 122 -135 days gestation. Fetal arterial blood was sampled daily, and frequently before an d after 10 mins UCO at 132 days gestation. The ewe and fetus were killed humanely at 135 days to obtain the fetal brain for analysis of cell death (TUNEL), and extravasation of serum protein into the brain. Results : Quantitative analysis revealed that cre atine treatment reduced the number of TUNEL and sheep serum +ve cells in the subcortical white matter and deep white matter, and in the striatum ( Figure). Conclusions: Increasing the creatine supply to the fetus in late gestation protects the fetal brain from the effects of transient in utero hypoxia, and may therefore be an effective prophylactic treatment for all pregnant women, especially where the level of obstetric surveillance is low or restricted.

Maternal obesity influences offspring behaviour such as anxiety/stress in adult life, potentially via the influenc e of low -grade inflammation on the development of neural pathways such as the hypothalamo -pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis 1. This study used ultrasonic vocalisations to investigate pup anxiety, a marker of HPA function, in the first week of life following exposure to maternal obesity induced by high fat (HF) feeding. Since maternal behavior towards her pups also has long lasting consequences for offspring HPA stress responsiveness 2, we also assessed early markers of maternal care in HF -fed mothers. Methods: Female C57BL/6 mice were fed either a high fat diet (HF; 45% kcal fat) or control diet (C; 7% kcal fat) 6 weeks before mating, throughout pregnancy and lactation. In 7 day -old male and female pups (C, n=20; HF, n=19) anxiety was assessed by measuring ultras onic vocalisations (USVs) using a bat detector (70 KHz) during 4 min isolation from the mother. Maternal behaviour (C, n=5; HF, n=6) was assessed by recording times of first dam -pup interaction and pup retrieval to the nest in the 2 min following pup retur n (averaged across all littermates). Data were analysed by t test. Results: There was a significant reduction ( P<0.05) in pup USVs in female but not male pups from HF mothers. The incidence of mothers failing to return pups to the nest was greater for HF -fed mothers, however there was no significant difference in the times taken to interact with pups or return pups between C and HF mothers. Conclusions: The effect of maternal HF diet on pup anxiety was sex -specific, with pup USVs reduced only in females. Al though mother -to-pup interactions were not different between C and HF mothers at day 7, further studies of behaviour of these offspring at multiple time points in their lifespan will determine whether maternal, as well as postnatal HF feeding, will affect adult offspring behaviour, including anxiety and memory and learning.

Poster 8 Prenatal high fat diet exposure in mice primes offspring for increased neuroinflammation and altered hypothalamic stress markers Rasool,A.1, Green, Teeling, J.L. 2, Cagampang, F.R. 1, Poore, K.R. 1 1 Institute of Developmental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK; 2 Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, UK Introduction: Obesity during pregnancy is a rapidly increasing global issue with 5% of pregnant women classed as obese in the UK 1. Maternal obesity influences offspring behaviour and stress responses, however the mechanisms remain unclear. One possibility is that the hypothalamo -pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, which regulates the stress response, is influenced by an inflammatory response to a high fat (HF) obesogenic diet. This study investigated markers o f HPA function and of neuroinflammation in offspring from HF -fed mothers, subsequent postnatal HF -feeding. Methods: Female C57BL/6 mice were fed either a high fat diet (HF; 45% kcal fat) or control diet (C; 7% kcal fat) 6 weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. From weaning onwards, offspring were fed C or HF diet resulting 15 week -old male offspring brain, gene markers of inflammation (IL -1, TNF-, FCR1) and HPA function (corticotropin releasing hormone receptor [GR]) were measured b y RT -PCR in the hypothalamic TNF - was significantly increased ( P<0.01) and GR was significantly decreased (P<0.05) in HF -fed male offspring PVN, but only when their mothers were HF -fed (HF/HF). Maternal HF diet also increased CRH and offspring PVN, regardless of postnatal diet ( P<0.05). Conclusions: Maternal high fat diet influences markers of both inflammation and stress in the PVN of 15 week -old male mice offspring. The effects on IL -1 and GR specifically in HF/HF offspring suggest that a maternal high fat diet may prime offspring to the adverse effects of subsequent high fat diets in postnatal life. Further studies of offspring from this dietary model later in their lifespan will determine whether these changes persist into old age and have implications for stress responsiveness. Refs: 1.

It has been suggested that early life nutritional adversity is associated with increased oxidative stress (OS). OS is implicated in male infertility and aging. We hypothesized that MPR during pregnancy accelerates the aging process in sperm quality and that OS plays a role. Methods: We studied male rat OFF whose mothers ate either control (C) (20% casein) or a restricted (R) (10% casein) isocaloric diet during pregnancy. After birth all rats were fed C diet. At postnatal day (PND) 110, 450 and 850 male OFF were euthanized and sperm from the epidiymal tail and vas deferens were obtained to measure: 1) reactive oxygen species ROS - by fluorescence), 2) sperm quality (concentration, viability and motility). Data \u00b1 SEM; two -way ANOVA analysis; n=6, p<0.05. Results : At all ages ROS concentrations were higher in the R group vs C. Sperm quality was reduced at all ages in the R group. ROS levels, sperm quality and fertility were analyzed at different ages within groups. In both groups, ROS levels did not change with age and sperm concentration decreased at PND 450 with no further changes. For both groups sperm viability decreased at P ND 450. In the R group sperm viability declined further by PND 850. In both groups, sperm motility decline by PND 850, however in R group the motility was already reduced at PND 450. (Fig. 1). Conclusions: MPR increases sperm ROS which may play an importa nt role in the trajectory of aging in the sperm quality. The increase of ROS in the sperm of young adults may lead to the programming of d iseases in the next generation via the male germ line , currently a little studied area that requires more investigatio n.

Poster 10 Maternal obesity (MO) during pregnancy and lactation increases oxidative stress is SZ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico and 2Wyoming Center for Pregnancy and Life Course Health Research, Animal Science, University Wyoming, Laramie, WY United States Introduction: Growing evidence shows that MO during pregnancy and lactation has long -lasting consequences for offspring health (chronic metabolic, endocrine and reproductive disorders). We have shown that MO during pregnancy and lactation increases testicular and sperm oxidative stress and impacts male fertility in adult life. Nrf2 serves as a master regulator to control the basal and inducible expression of an array of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes. We hypothesized that the alterations observed in adult life such as the increase in testicular reactive oxygen species and the decrease in male offspring reproductive capacity are already programmed since early stages of development. Methods: Control maternal rats (C) ate normal chow (5% -fat) while MO mothers ate a high fat diet (20% animal lard and 5% fat) from weaning through pregnancy and lactation. After weaning all rats ate C diet. We determined Nrf2 (qPCR), malonaldialdehyde (MDA - by spectrophotometry), reactive fluorescence) and sup dismutase (SOD - by spectrophotometry) activity neonatal testis of 36 postnatal days. Results : Nrf2, the master gen of the antioxidant response was increased in the neonatal testis from the MO group. MDA and ROS levels, as well as SOD activity w as also higher in the testes homogenate at postnatal day 36 (Fig.1). Conclusions: MO produces signs of oxidative stress in offspring testes at the time of puberty. Thus oxidative stress may be one mechanism by which MO reduces male offspring reproductive c apacity in adult life (Int J Obes 2016;39(4):549 -56). Figure Testis \u00b1 SEM, n=6,* p<0.05 vs C.

The frontal cortex (FC) of the brain plays an important role in memory, learning, and complex cognition A study of obesity in pregnancy in Japanese macaque mothers showed greater anxiety in offspring ( Sullivan EL et al J Neurosci. 2010; 30:382), Hypothesis: MO affects the fetal F C stress signalling pathways by up -regulating glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and increasing protein expression of the serotonin transporter (5 -HTT). Methods: Animals ate Purina Monkey Diet. Female baboons, similar age and weight were randomly assigned to control (CTR, n = 25) or MO diet (n = 19; 45% energy fat, to high -fructose sodas). CTR diet contained 12% energy fat, 0.29% glucose, 0.32% fructose energy 3.07 kcal/g. Diet s were maintained through pregnancy. Fetal FC was collected at Caesarean section under general anaesthesia at 90% gestation. GR, phosphor -GR (p -GR) and 5 -HTT were measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with Image J quantification of stained fraction. Analy sis was by Student's t -test: P < 0.05. Results : % area stained for GR and 5 -HTT were greater (P < 0.05) in gray and white matter of MO fetal FC, and p-GR protein tended to increase (0.05 < P < 0.1) [Fig. 1]. Conclusions: Increased GR and p -GR will tend to accelerate FC cellular differentiation at the expense of proliferation resulting in postnatal neurological dysfunction of stress signalling pathways. Up -regulation of 5 -HTT would increase serotonin uptake by the presynaptic neuron resulting in local seroto nin deficiency in the synaptic cleft. Conclusions: MO results in changes in fetal FC associated with the stress signalling pathways by late gestation that may explain the programming of offspring of MO mothers to anxiety and depressive mood.

To enable translation to humans, we developed cohorts of baboon offspring of mothers fed ad lib, control or 70% control diet in pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were IUGR at birth. Since we have shown premature brain aging in these IUGR offspring, we hypothesized that IUGR offspring show impaired heart function and accelerated cardiac aging. Methods: We studied IUGR baboons (8 male, 8 female) age 5.7 years and control (CTL) offspring: (8 male, 7 female), age 5.6 years and elderly baboons (OLD), (6 male, 6 female), age 15.9 years Human equivalent 64 years, using cardiac MRI to evaluate left ve ntricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) functional parameters, normalized to body surface area. Analysis two -way ANOVA by group and sex with p < 0.05. Results: Ejection fraction (EF), three -dimensional sphericity diastolic vo lume and normalized LV wall thickness normalized for body surface area differed by group. Group and sex differences were found for normalized LV wall thickening and myocardial mass, without interactions. Decreased LV EF was noted and OLD (Figure). LV filling rate and diastolic 3DSI normalized for body surface area were not correlated in CTL but strongly correlated function, producing myocardial remodelling resulting in emergence of premature cardiac aging. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of the specific characteristics of cardiac programming and functional decline with aging in any species. Further studies across the life span will determine progressi on of cardiac dysfunction. Non -invasive imaging identifies early cardiac biomarkers of IUGR in this susceptible population, improving recognition of clinical presentations and management of treatment strategies. Figure: LV and RV Ejection fractions normalized to body surface area and their correlation in control (CTL) baboon offspring, (8 male, 7 female; age 5.6 years), IUGR baboon offspring (8 male, 8 female; age 5.7 years) and normal elderly baboons (OLD), (6 male, 6 female, age 15.9 years).

Results: The retina before and after receiving VEGF antagonist are shown in Figure 1. After receiving intravitreal VEGF -antagonist, the vessels tortuosity and dilation decreased markedly. Circulating VEGF - antagonist levels have been shown to last 4 to 6 weeks. Repeat imaging at 4 weeks shows re -emergence of vessel tortuosity. Conclusions: We believe the observed changes demonstrate the inherent retinal microvascular plasticity in premature neonates. With improved survival of extremely premature neon ates and the availability of retinal imaging technology, we are now able to monitor this plasticity, allowing closer assessment of both new treatments and the underlying retinal microvascular physiology in the premature neonate and, presumably, the fetus.

Poster 14 Perinatal prognosis using of the 5 -tier system of assessing fetal heart rate tracing 141 Murabayashi , N., Kubo, M., Nii, M., Maeda, Y., Shimura, M., Magawa, S., Kawamura, T., Tanaka, K., Tanaka, H., Osato, K., Umekawa , T., Kamimo to, Y., Parer, J., and Ikeda , T. Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mie University School of Medicine Introduction: To determine whether the 5 -tier system of assessing fetal heart rate tracing can result in reduced metabolic acidemia without increasing obstetrical intervention. Methods: Rates of umbilical artery pH and base excess values, and operative intervention delivery were determined in 14 hospitals in Japan, all of which accept patients in all risk categories. Results were compared for 2 years be fore and 2 years after a 6 -month training period in the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology 5 -tier system of assessing fetal heart rate tracings. All of the perinatologists and nursing staff were educated by lecture or DVD in the 5 -tier system, and had weekly discussions in every hospital. Results : Deliveries were about 10,000 every year, which is equivalent to 1% of all the Japanese deliveries. Although the percentage of low base excess cases were reduced 27% in the post training period, the pre - and post -training rates of umbilical arterial pH<7.10 ( 1.4% -12mEq/L(2.2% vs. 1.6%, p=0.35) did not differ significantly. The rates of unscheduled Cesarean deliveries (6.5% vs. 7.6%, p=0.54) and vacuum deliveries (7.8% v s. 7.4%, p=0.83) did not differ significantly. Conclusions: The 7 -fold reduction in metabolic academia seen in a low risk population (Katsuragi et al, 2015) was not seen in this high risk population, possibly because of the higher intrinsic risk of metabo lic academia, and fore -knowledge by practitioners over the past 5 years of the Japanese 5 -tier system.The 5-tier system may be useful for reduction of newborn metabolic acidemia without increasing operative intervention.

Sakakibra Institute, Japan/ Mie University, Mie, Japan Introduction: Congenital long QT syndrome occur s in one out of 5000 people. In some cases, they may develop ventricular fibrillation , ventricular tachycardia, and Torsa de Pointes. Case: A 30 years old Japanese woman at 33 weeks of gestation was referred to our hospital . Her fetus had a bradycardia (60bpm) . We intravenously administered ritodrine hydrochloride against threatened preterm labor. We found that the fetus had 2:1 AV block, intermittent VT , and TdP. We administered magnesium sulfate instead of ritodrine hydroc hloride , as we considered that the fetus might be long QT syndrome. Fetal heart rate became sinus rhythm in a few days . At 34 weeks and 5 days of gestation , the mother vaginally delivered the baby . We diagnosed the baby as long QT syndrome because the corrected QT time was prolonged ( 600 msec ). The baby developed VT and TdP , and they were treated with magnesium sulfate and beta blockade. She discharged 26 days after birth with the medication of carvedilol and mexiletine Discussion : Ritodrine hydrochloride is recommended as a first choice for treating threatened preterm labors , and magnesium sulfate as a second choice in Japan. In this case, r itodrine hydrochlorid e may have triggered VT/TdP. When we encounter fetal bradycardia, we have to keep in mind the fet us might be long QT syndrome . However, it is difficult to detect long QT syndrome prenatally using ultrasonography. Magnetocardiography is the only available method for detection of long QT syndrome. On the other hand, magnesium sulfate is an antiarrhythmic drug for adults. It is known to reduce the early afterdepolarization and stabilize the membrane of the myocardium. There are a few reports about a transplacental treatment for fetus arrythmia using magnesium sulfate. Lidocaine and beta -block er are also known as transplacental drugs for VT/TdP. However, we are used to administering magnesium sulfate to pregnant women. In addition, it is easy to control its blood concentration. Conclusion: Transplacental magnesium sulfate is one of the options for fetal VT/TdP in case s of congenital long QT syndrome in terms of its effectiveness, saf ety and controllability. Figure 1.

Poster 16 A data -driven system for continuous fetal monitoring in labour: the Oxford prototype 143 Georgieva, A. , Papageorghiou , & Redman, C.W.G. University of Oxford Introduction: Intrapartum cardiotocography (CTG) is widely used. Maternal and fetal risk factors confound the relation of CTG patterns to fetal health; visual interpretation is unscientific, without reliable estimates of the risk for the fetus. Unnecessary operative deliveries are performed whilst some babies at risk are not delivered in a timely fashion. Commercial computerised systems aid visual assessment and standardise expert opinion, but do not quantify the associated fetal risks or incorporate other risk factors. We report the performance of a prototype data -driven system (OxSys) that objectivel y quantifies the intrapartum CTG. It takes into account clinical risk factors and relates to the perinatal outcome in a large cohort. Methods: Considered were all normally formed babies, born Mar'00 -Dec'11 at Oxford, who had intrapartum CTG, paired cord gas analyses, and gestation >35 weeks (23,903 births). We studied four exclusive groups: Compromise: Severe of stillbirth, neonatal death, neonatal encephalopathy, seizures; and resuscitation at birth followed by intensive care for 48hrs); - Moderate (umbilical cord arterial blood pH at birth <7.05); - Mild (7.05pH<7.15); Normal : all rem aining. The OxSys prototype analysed each CTG with a moving 15min window and alerted if the first hour of the trace was nonreactive or, at any time, the Decelerative Capacity (Georgieva et al, BJOG 128;2014) exceeded a threshold, adjusted for preeclampsia or thick meconium. Results : Table 1 shows that, when compared to the rate of emergency deliveries due to 'fetal distress' as recorded in the patients' notes at birth, OxSys had significantly lower alert rates in Normal (i.e. lower false positive rate, 14 .46% vs. 16.40%, p<0.001) and slightly higher alert rates in the compromise groups (i.e. higher sensitivity). We demonstrate that the false positive rate was high and the sensitivity was low for both clinical practice and OxSys. Table 1.

Chi squared test, OxSys 1.5 vs. Clinicians: ** p = 0.21; *** p = 0.11; p = 0.07; p<0.001. Conclusions: The Oxford prototype intrapartum system OxSys compares favourably to assessment in clinical practice. Further work is needed to achieve better performance. Our approach to evaluating diagnostic accuracy allows methods for CTG interpretation to be compared and improved. We can include any new knowledge in the system and test its contribution by measuring changes in sensitivity and/or the fa lse positive rate.Poster 17 The three cases of urinary tract obstruction with bladder rapture 144 Magawa, S, kamimoto, Y., Tanaka, H., Murabayashi , N., and Ikeda , T. Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mie University Faculty Medicine, Saiseikai general hospital, Mie, Japan Introduction: The lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO) are the most common cause of mechanical infravesical obstruction, and causes distention of the bladder, hydronephrosis. In case of severe obstruction, hypoplastic lung due to oligohydramnios and renal failure due to obstruction are often developed. We report the three cases of LUTO to take irregular courses by bladder rupture. Case : Case1: MM -twin. Enlarged bladder was diagnosed by ultrasonography at 11weeks of gestation. We found that the dilated urinary bladder enlarged with \"key -hole sign\", the s ign of bladder outlet obstruction. The enlarged bladder shrunk suddenly at 23 weeks of gestation. At 29 weeks and 2days of gestation, spontaneous labor occurred and she delivered her babies. Infant 1 had cloacal anomaly, vertebral defect (L4-5, S1 -2) and atrial (ASD). Case2: Enlarged bladder was diagnosed by ultrasonography at 27 weeks of gestation. There was no sign of oligohydramnios at diagnosis. At 36 weeks of gestation, the enlarged bladder shrunk and oligohydramnios appeared, we decided her delivery mode Caesarean section. After that, we operated the bladder of the bab y. Case3: Ascites, bladder rupture and oligohydramnios was diagnosed by ultrasonography at 27 weeks of gestation. We injected amniotic fluid and then followed up. Then, the sign of oligohydramnios was disappeared and bladder enlarged gradually again. Oligo hydramnios and hydronephrosis caused at 34 weeks of gestation, so caesarean section was performed. Conclusions: This three cases took irregular courses by bladder rupture. We should be closely monitored by ultrasonography. Poster 18 Fetal behavioural state in late gestation is affected by maternal sleep position 145 Stone, P.R.,1 Thompson, J.M.D.,1,2 Stewart, A.W.,3 McIntyre, J.,1 Lear, C.,4 Bennet, L,.4 Mitchell, EA,.2 1. Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The University of Auckland 2. Department of Paediatrics: Child and Youth Health, The University of Auckland 3. Department of Biostatistics, The University of Auckland 4. Department of Physiology, The University of Auckland Introduction: Maternal sleep positi on has been associated with the risk of late stillbirth. In the developed world a large number of stillbirths are unexplained. In our physiological studies of maternal and fetal responses, we hypothesised that maternal sleep position would affect fetal act ivity states overnight. The aim of this study was to describe the effects of maternal sleep positions on fetal behavioural states (FBS) in healthy fetuses. Methods: Healthy pregnant women (35 -38 weeks gestation, n=30) underwent overnight studies with polysomnography during which continuous transabdominal fetal ECG (Monica AN24 TM) recordings were made. Two independent observers blinded to maternal position assessed FBS by cardiotocography (inter -observer Kappa = 0.8). Repeated measures analyses were under taken to compare 1F and 2F to allow for the differences in proportions of the women in each sleep position and length of sleep. Results : Over 7 hours of fetal data per participant were available for analysis. Fetuses spent most time in state quiet sleep st ate (2F, 83.2%) followed by (active sleep state (1F, 12.5%), very little time being in active awake state (4F, 4.3%). State 4F occurred almost exclusively when the mother was in a left or right lateral position. State 4F was seen mostly in the early part o f the night. In repeated measures analyses comparing state 1F and 2F we found that state 1F was less common in the right position and more common in the supine position compared to the left position. The effect of maternal sleep position on fetal state als o appeared to be restricted to the earlier part of the night when women tended to remain in one position for the longest periods of time. Conclusions: Maternal sleep position affects the behavioural state a fetus is most likely to be in. Maternal supine position is associated with more time in 1F and less time in 4F than other positions. This would be consistent with the fetus taking up a l ower oxygen consuming state as a response to adverse effects of the supine position.Poster 19 Renal function in the first month of life in Australian Indigenous and non -Indigenous preterm neonates 1Dept Anatomy & Developmental Biology, Monash University, Clayton, Australia 2Menzies School of Health Research, Charles Darwin University, Darwin, Australia 3University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia Introduction: Preterm birth (birth < 37 weeks' gestation) occurs in ~10% of births world -wide. In Australia the incidence is very high in the Indigenous population; ~14% in Indigenous Australians compared to ~9% in non -Indigenous Australians. Preterm birth occurs at a time when the kidneys are structurally and functionally immature and nephrogenesis is still ongoing in many preterm infants. Hence, it is likely that renal function in the preterm neonate will be adversely affected by renal immaturity and/or postnatal injury. The aim of this study was to compare renal function in the first month of life in Australian preterm and term Indigenous and non -Indigenous neonates. Methods: Indigenous and non -Indigenous infants recruited at the Royal Darwin Hospital, were grouped by gestational age at birth: < 28, 29 -32, 33 -36 and >36 weeks. Twenty -four hour poo led urine samples were obtained at days 3 -7, 14, 21 and 28; creatinine clearance (CrCl; measure of glomerular filtration rate), fractional excretion of sodium (FENa; measure of tubular function) and urine output (ml/kg/hr) were calculated. Results: During the first week of life, CrCl increased with gestational age at birth and postnatal age, while FENa decreased with increasing gestational age at birth and postnatal age. These trends continued until Day 28 of life. Notably, the FENa during the first month of life was greater in the Indigenous infants born < 28 weeks than age -matched non -Indigenous infants, indicating a significant difference in tubular function. Urine output was markedly lower in term infants of both groups at Day 4, increasing thereafter. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that renal function in preterm neonates is dependent on gestational and postnatal age, with kidneys of extremely preterm Indigenous Australians particularly vulnerable. The low urine output of term babies on Day 4 ref lects low oral intake, compared to all preterm babies, where specified fluid intakes drive urine output. This brings into question the amount of fluid currently used in fluid management of preterm babies. 147 Posters Developmental Cardiovascular Physiology Poster 20 The effect of moderate preterm birth on the structure and growth of cardiomyocytes in the right ventricle of adult sheep 148 Biology, University, Clayton, Australia 2The Ritchie Centre, Clayton, Australia 3Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Australia Introduction: Preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation) affects approximately 10% of births worldwide, with the majority of infants born moderately preterm. Recent studies show that there is remodelling of the myocardium in response to preterm birth and that there is altered growth and f unction of the myocardium in adulthood; these effects are particularly evident in the right ventricle (RV). The aim of this study was to examine the effect of moderate preterm birth on the growth of cardiomyocytes in the RV of the adult heart using a clini cally relevant sheep model. Methods: Singleton male lambs were preterm (132\u00b11days; n=7) at term (147\u00b11days; n=7). Ewes assigned to deliver preterm were administered a clinical dose of betamethasone antenatally (11.4 mg at 48 hours and 24 hours prior to birth). The preterm and term born sheep were grown to adulthood and their hearts examined at 14.5 months of age. Results : Preterm sheep remained smaller in weight and stature throughout life. At 14.5 months of age, there were signific antly fewer cardiomyocytes in the RV of preterm sheep compared to terms, with cardiomyocyte number proportional to both body weight and heart weight. There were no differences in the size of cardiomyocytes or in myocardial interstitial collagen deposition in the RV of the adult preterm and term born sheep. Conc lusions: The reduced number of cardiomyocytes in the RV of the adult heart following preterm birth may be a direct consequence of preterm birth or to the exposure to antenatal corticosteroids; alternatively, it may relate to the attenuated postnatal growt h. A reduced number of cardiomyocytes is likely to impact on the adaptive and functional capabilities of the RV if challenged during adulthood . Cardiomyocyte Number in the RV: Total cardiomyocyte number in the RV of term (n = 7) and preterm (n = 7) 14.5 month old male sheep. There was a significant reduction (P=0.046) in the number of cardiomyocytes in the RV of adult sheep that were born preterm compared to those born at term. Poster 21 miR-133a and miR -15 family target gene expression in the fetus and 6 month old sheep heart in response to myocardial infarction 149 Lock, M.C.1, Soo, , 1Early Origins of Adult Health Research Group and 2Mechanisms in Cell Biology and Disease Research Group, Sansom Institute for Health Research, University of South Australia; 3Centre for Cardiac and Vascular Biology, School of Biomedical Sciences, Universi ty of Queensland;. 4CSIRO Agriculture, Queensland Biosciences Precinct Introduction: The adult mammalian heart has very little capacity to repair after damage because adult cardiomyocytes lack the ability to proliferate. This lack of response to injury is in stark contrast to the adult zebrafish, newborn mouse and fetal sheep whose cardiomyocytes have the capacity to repair through the proliferation of existing cardiomyocytes. The expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) such as miR -133a and the miR -15 family increase at the time that proliferation ceases in rodents and sheep and have been implicated in regulating cell cycle entry and cardiomyocyte proliferation. We therefore aimed to investigate the expression of these miRNAs and their target genes after myocardia l infarction in sheep hearts before (105 d gestation) and after (6 months) birth when the response to injury is different. Methods: We used sheep, which have a similar pattern of cardiomyocyte development relative to birth compared to humans, as a model t o investigate the effect of age on cardiac damage, by ligating the second diagonal of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Surgery was performed on fetuses (MI, n=5; SHAM, n=5; 102 days gestation when all cardiomyocytes are proliferative) an d postnatal sheep (MI, n=4; SHAM, n=4; 6 months of age when all cardiomyocytes contribute to heart growth by hypertrophy). Three days later, size was visualized using 2,3,5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining of heart sections. Total RNA w as extracted and qRT -PCR was used to quantify expression of miRNA and their target genes. Results : Mean normalized expression (MNE) of target genes of miR -133a (e.g. SRF and IGF1R) and the miR -15 family (e.g. CCND2 (Figure 1)) were increased in myocardial tissue from the infarcted area compared with the remote zone in the fetus. In contrast, the opposite expression pattern was observed in the 6 month old sheep. Conclusions: These results indicate that miR -133a and the miR -15 family have significant roles in regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation in sheep. Low expression in the fetus allows cardiac repair after damage with high expression after birth resulting in limited capacity for repair. Figure 1. Normalised miR -15b and CCND2 mRNA expression in the infarct, border zone and remote zone in the fetal (105 d gestation) and adult (6 month old) sheep heart in response to ligation of the LAD. Poster 22 The redistribution of cardiac output by vasopressin infusion in the premature fetal sheep 150 Watanabe, S. , Matsuda, T., Usuda, H., Kitanishi, R., Saito, M., Hanita, T. & *Kobayashi, Y. Center Neonatal Medicine, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Miyagi; *Department of Veterinary Pathology, Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Obihiro, Hokkaido, Japan Introduction: The pioneering works using fetal sheep have clarified their cardiovascular responses to hypoxia. The responses serve to r educe oxygen consumption of the whole body and to redistribute the cardiac output away from the periphery towards hypoxia -sensitive organs, such as adrenal glands, heart and brain. A low dose of vasopressin infusion [ 1.37 \u00b1 0.11 mU/kg/min ( mean \u00b1 SEM )] has been reported to induce the redistribution in late preterm fetus. But, it is unknown whether it can induce the same responses in more premature fetus. Our purpose was to determine whether the low dose infusion of vasopressin could induce the redistributio n of the organ blood flow in premature fetal sheep. Methods: The experiment was performed between October 2012 and March 2014 with the approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee (2013MdA -008/009). Ten sheep fetuses between 99 and 121 days of gestation w ere chronically instrumented and infused vasopressin intravenously ; 0.93 \u00b1 0.10 mU/kg/min . Fetal actual organ blood flows were measured using the colored -microsphere technique and statistically compared between before and after the vasopressin infusion. Results: After the vasopressin infusion, the fetal arterial pressure raised from 40.0 \u00b1 1.6 to 51.3 \u00b1 2.0 mm Hg and the heart rate fell from 192.6 \u00b1 5.9 to 159.3 \u00b1 2.0 beats/min. The fetal blood flows of cerebral cortex and medulla oblongata increased, where as myocardial and adrenal blood flows decreased. Conclusions: The cardiovascular response to the vasopressin infusion in premature fetus might be different from that in late preterm fetus because the vasopressin infusion reduced the blood flows of myocardi um and adrenal glands while it could maintain the cerebral blood flow. Figure. Comparison of organ blood flows before and after the vasopressin infusion. All data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. *, p <0.05, the blood flows of brain cortex and Medulla oblongata significantly increased. **, p <0.05, the myocardial and adrenal blood flows significantly decreased (Wilcoxon signed -rank test, respectively). Poster 23 The effect of cinaciguat (bay -582667) on the cardiopulmonary circulation in hypoxic Chile. 2International Center for Andean Studies (INCAS), Universidad de Chile, del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile. 4Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California Introduction: High altitude hypoxia induces an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which reduces the function of soluble guanilyl cyclase (sGC). In fact, lambs gestated and born at 3600 m, show a reduced sGC. We hypothesised that cinaciguat, a drug that activates oxidized sGC, will enhance vasodilatation in the pulmonary hypertensive neonatal lamb. Methods: Twelve newborn lambs, born and raised at Putre Research Station, INCAS (3,600 m), were catheterized in the pulmonary artery (Swan Ganz) at 3 -4 days of age. Six lambs received a daily infusion of cinaciguat (35 \u00b5g.kg-1.d-1) into the pulmonary circulation and six controls received vehicle. On day 8, lambs were subjected to an acute episode of superimposed hypoxia (30 min of basal, 30 min of hypoxe mia and 30 min of recovery). We determined pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). At 15 days of age, the lambs were euthanized, heart chambers were dissected and weighed, and pulmon ary samples were collected for molecular biology, vascular function (myography) and histology (small pulmonary arteries) studies. All procedures were approved by the Local Bioethical Committee (0643 FMUCH CBA). Results: Cinaciguat changed the PVR and CO i n the last 2 days of treatment, and resulted in a decreased response in mPAP, PVR and CO during the episode of acute hypoxia (p<0.05). Cinaciguat treatment reduced the RV/LV + septum ratio (p<0.05) and decreased the muscle layer in small pulmonary arteries (p<0.05). Further, small pulmonary arteries from cinaciguat group showed a 30% greater vasodilatation when exposed to SNP and when exposed to sildenafil showed more sensitivity than the control group. Additionally, protein expression of cyclase and PD5 (p hosphodiesterase 5) was similar between groups. Conclusion: Cinaciguat decreased pulmonary artery responsiveness in daily treatment and during acute superimposed hypoxia, further improving cardiopulmonary cellular pro -oxidant sources in newborn lambs with pulmonary hypertension 152 for Andean Studies; 3Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Medicine; University of Chile, Chile. Corresponding author's address: eherrera@med.uchile.cl Introduction: Chronic hypobaric hypoxia during gestation cause intrauterine growth restriction and neonatal hypertension (1). One of the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension is oxida tive stress, which implies an increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or a decreased antioxidant capacity (2). Melatonin is a neurohormone with antioxidant properties that improves pulmonary vascular function in the neonatal lamb (3). The refore, we hypothesised that antenatal treatment with melatonin improves the antioxidant/prooxidant ratio and reduces oxidative stress in neonatal lungs. Methods: Twelve singled pregnant ewes were maintained under chronic hypobaric hypoxia (Putre, 3,600 ma sl). Six of them conform a control group (CN, 5ml vehicle) and 6 the melatonin treated group (MM, 10 mg.d-1 melatonin in 5ml ethanol 1.4%). Treatments were given to the pregnant ewes, daily at 18h (oral) in the last third of gestation (100-150 d). All lamb s were born and left with their mothers in a common pen. At 12 d old, lambs were euthanized and lung tissue and plasma were sampled. We performed protein analyses (Western blot) for the antioxidant enzymes: was measured -isoprostanes, 4HNE and nitrotyrosine levels. The pro -oxidant NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase and mitochondrial ROS -generation in lung deter mined the plasmatic antioxidant capacity (FRAP). Results: Antenatal administration of expression of antioxidant SOD, CAT and GPx. In addition, the generation of superoxide anion by the main pro -oxidant sources decreased in the melat onin treated group (Fig. 1), associated with lower oxidative stress markers in lung tissue as: 4HNE, melatonin diminished oxidative stress by programming a decreased ROS generation in the postnatal pulmonary sources.

Poster 25 Can fetal heart rate variability identify the phases of injury after asphyxia in preterm fetal sheep? 153 Yamaguchi, K., Lear, C.A., Gunn, A.J., Ikeda, T.* & Bennet, L. Fetal Physiology and Neuroscience Group. Department of Physiology, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand and *Mie University, Mie, Japan Introduction: Exposure to hypoxia -ischaemia (HI) before birth is a major mediator of brain injury. Neuroprotection treatments including hypothermia are most effective when begu n early (latent phase) after the insult. However, many babies do not benefit from treatment and this may be the injury has already evolved beyond the optimal window for treatment (secondary phase). Currently we lack reliable biomarkers to identify fetuses at risk of brain injury after HI, and phases of injury. The aim of this study was to identify whether fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) could distinguish between injurious and non -injurious HI insults and whether patterns over time predicted phases of in jury. Methods: Singleton fetal sheep at 0.7ga were randomly assigned to one of two groups: 25min of complete umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) (n=29) or 15min (n=18). Fetal heart measures of FHRV (STV, LTV, SDNN, RMSSD) were assessed until 72 h after HI in two phases: latent and secondary phases. Results : During the latent phase (first 6h post UCO) FHRV was biphasic with initial suppression followed by elevation in both groups. The 25min group was tachycardiac, whereas the 15 group were mil dly bradycardic. In the secondary phase (6 -72h) FHRV was suppressed in the 25min group, while FHR was normal or lower. FHRV remained elevated in the 15 min group while FHR normalised. Conclusions: A pattern of increased FHRV may identify the late latent phase of injury after HI, accompanying tachycardia in the early latent phase suggests that the insult was injurious. Suppression of FHRV was observed during the secondary phase only after an injurious duration of asphyxia. These findings suggest that analy sis of FHR and FHRV after HI may be able to help determine the timing and severity of fetal HI and therefore provide information to better direct neonatal care. Figure 1 shows the changes in the latent and secondary phases in fetal heart rate (FHR) and long-term variability (LTV) after 15 or 25 min UCO in preterm fetal sheep. 154 155 Developmental Neuroscience (2) Poster 26 Umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells protect against preterm white matter Monash University Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the Hudson Institute of Medical Research Clayton, Victoria, Australia Introduction: Preterm infants, particularly those born <32 weeks gestational age, are at high risk for cerebral palsy and neurological deficits. We have reported that, following acute hypoxia -ischaemia (HI), the decrease in oligodendrocytes obse rved in the preterm fetal sheep brain is correlated to the number of activated microglia present (Figure) and that early administration of allogeneic umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells reduces white matter brain injury following ischemia and following term neonatal asphyxia. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are receiving strong interest for neural repair, in adolescents and adults, in both preclinical and clinical studies due to their strong anti-inflammatory actions. Although the number of MSCs in human term UCB is very low, preterm UCB contains a relatively higher concentration of MSCs. This study examine d the neuroprotective effects of allogeneic MSCs derived from preterm ovine UCB in a fetal sheep HI model of white matter brain injury induced by acute umbilical cord occlusion. Methods : UCB was collected from a cohort of preterm sheep at ~0.75 -gestation. UCB -MSCs were isolated by plastic adherence and morphology, and expanded until passage 3. Quad -lineage differentiation potential, clonogenicity and self-renewal ability of the cells was confirmed. A different cohort of chronically instrumented fetal sheep (0.7 gestation) received either 25min total umbilical cord occlusion or sham occlusion. Ten million preterm UCB derived MSCs, or saline (control), were administered iv to fetuses at 12h after HI. Fetal brains were collected 10d after occlusion or sham occ lusion for histopathology. Results : HI reduced the density of myelin fiber tracts (CNPase+) in the periventricular white matter (PVWM) and internal capsule (IC; P<0.05) and induced microglial activation in the white matter and systemic inflammation. UCB -MSC administration preserved myelination following HI and significantly promoted cell proliferation (Ki -67+) in all white matter regions examined (subventricular zone, PVWM, and IC) compared to control and HI alone fetuses (P<0.05). UCB -MSC administration re duced plasma inflammatory TNF concentrations at 3d post -HI (P<0.05) and moderately suppressed microglial activation within the brain Conclusions: Administration of UCB -MSC, derived from preterm UCB, preserved white matter structure in preterm fetuses, f ollowing HI, by promoting cell proliferation in the preterm brain and by decreasing systemic inflammation. Figure.

Institute for Women's Health, University College London Introduction: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) defines the failure of a fetus to reach its full intrauterine growth potential. There is currently no treatment available for FGR, which can cause behavioural disorders, impaired motor function, and carries a high mortality -rate. Compared with normally -grown fetuses, those with FGR have reduced brain size, altered brain -to-bodyweight ratio and increased inflammation and cell death in neural tissue . Previously we showed that uterine artery administration of an adenovirus vector containing the VEGF -A165 isoform (Ad.VEGF -A165) to pregnant guinea pigs with FGR mid -gestation increases fetal weight at term. Here we studied the effects of maternal uterine ar tery Ad.VEGF -A165 gene -therapy on neurodevelopment in FGR guinea pig fetuses. Methods: To induce FGR, Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs were either fed normally (control=n=7) or at 70% their usual diet for one month before conception and during pregnancy. FGR da ms received Ad.VEGF vehicle (pluronic gel=n=7, group) externally to their uterine arteries, administered via laparotomy on day ~30 of pregnancy (term=65=days). Control dams underwent sham laparotomy. Fetal body and brain weights were determined on day ~60, at post -mortem. Brain samples were collected, fixed and sectioned (40 m). Analyses of regional brain volumes, microglial ramification and apoptosis were conducted in cresyl violet, IBA-1 and TUNEL stained secti ons, respectively. Groups were compared using one -way ANOVA. Results : Brain weight was reduced in the FGR group fetuses (2.268g 0.064g) but was similar to control values (2.531g0.093g) in the FGR+VEGF group fetuses (2.517g 0.063g,P=0.02). There was no si gnificant difference in fetal weight between the three groups (P>0.05). Consequently, brain:body weight ratio was lower in the FGR group (2.693g0.082g), whereas FGR+VEGF group fetuses (3.040g 0.081g) to controls (2.976g0.120g,P=0.017). was thalamus, and striatum in the FGR group fetuses controls and FGR+VEGF group fetuses [Figure 1a]. TUNEL staining showed no differences apoptosis across the three groups [Figur e 1b]. Conclusions: Administration of maternal uterine artery Ad.VEGF -A165 gene -therapy, mid -gestation to FGR guinea pig pregnancies improves fetal brain growth and normalises microglial activation, and does not adversely affect neurological anatomy or a poptosis in FGR guinea pig fetuses.

A. , Abdulwahid, A. A. & Parkington, H. C. Neuroscience Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Physiology, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria Australia, 3800 Introduction: Obesity is a low -grade inflammatory state, which constitutes an inhospitable intrauterine environment. After birth, children of obese mothers are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental abnormalities, e.g. reduced cognitive capacity (~ 3 IQ points lower at 10 years), developmental delay, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. In adults, high BMI and metabolic syndrome are associated with lower cognitive performance, and poor executive functio n and memory. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are major centres for memory, learning and decision making, and emotional regulation. The aim of our study was to determine the effects of obesity in early life, in utero and lactation, on cognitive funct ion in rats. Methods: Long Evans rat d ams w ere placed on control chow (CC) or a high fat/ cafeteria (HF) diet for 6 weeks and then mated with lean males. Offspring w ere retained on the diet of their dam or, at weaning, were switched to the other diet. At 14 -16 weeks of age, cognitive function was assessed using the 8 -arm radial maze. When 17 -19 weeks old, the brains were studied in vitro using multi -electrode arrays to record electrical activity in hippocampal and cortical brain slices in 0 -Mg2+ artificial aCSF. Results : Cognitive function in HF male and female offspring was impaired in terms of both working memory and reference memory. Switching HF offspring to CC at weaning rescued working memory but reference memory remained impaired. Similarly, pl acing CC offspring onto HF diet at weaning resulted in impaired working, but not reference memory. When brain slice electrical activity was studied, there was a dramatically greater tendency for oscillatory network (epileptiform) activity in the CA3/dentat e gyrus of the hippocampus in offspring from HF dams versus CC counterparts. Similar bursts also occurred in the motor cortex and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Pro -inflammatory markers HF hippocampus. Conclusions: Whereas some cognitive funct ion can be rescued by diet, the offspring of obese mothers may experience some cognitive impairment throughout life. Electrical hyperactivity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex is likely to be an important contributor to this impairment of cognitive function. Poster 29 Maternal protein restriction around conception alters the foetal mouse brain by increasing neuronal differentiation during gestation, and is associated with adult memory deficits 159 Gould J.M1,3, Pearson -Farr 1 Clinical Neurosciences and Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO16 6YD, UK, 2 Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Southampton,3 Centre for Human Development, Stem Cells and Regeneration, University of S outhampton Introduction: Maternal malnutrition during pregnancy is detrimental to foetal development and increases the risk of many chronic diseases in later life i.e. neurological consequences such as increased risk of schizophrenia. Previous studies ha ve shown maternal protein malnutrition during pregnancy and lactation compromises brain development in late gestation and after birth, affecting structural, biochemical and pathway dynamics with lasting consequences for motor and cognitive function. Howeve r, the importance of nutrition during embryogenesis for early brain development is unknown. We have previously shown maternal low protein diet confined to the preimplantation period (Emb -LPD) in mice is sufficient to induce cardiometabolic and behavioural abnormalities in adult offspring. Methods: Using a diet model, female mice were fed different diets from conception to the end of pregnancy: normal protein diet (NPD), low protein diet (LPD) or embryonic LPD (Emb -LPD: LPD for 3.5 days, NPD thereafter). Foe tal brains were analysed at three time points in gestation (E12.5, E14.5 & E17.5), with in vivo analysis using FACS and immunofluorescence for neural stem cell and neuron markers, and in vitro techniques using the neurosphere culture assay. We have also c arried out a number of follow up behavioural tests at multiple time points in the adult offspring, including the short -term memory novel object recognition. Results : We have shown that Emb -LPD and sustained LPD reduce neural stem cell (NSC) and progenitor cell numbers through suppressed proliferation rates in both ganglionic eminences and cortex of the neuronal differentiation rate in compensation beyo nd control levels during gestation independently of sex. In the short -term memory test the Emb-LPD adult offspring show a highly significant deficit in memory Fig 1 (p=0.00001). Conclusions: This data are the first to clearly demonstrate that poor maternal nutrition around conception has adverse effects on early brain development and is associated with adult memory deficits.

HC is common in preterm infants undergoing intensive care, but effects of HC on NVC in the immature brain remains unknown. We examined the impact of HC on NVC in the fetal sheep and neonatal lamb using cerebral oxy - and deoxy -haemoglobin (oxyHb and de oxyHb) measured by near infrared after median nerve stimulation. Methods: Under isoflurane anaesthesia EEG and NIRS electrodes were positioned bilaterally over the somatosensory cortex of fetal sheep (128 -132 days gestation; n=8) and 4-8 day old neonatal lambs (n=7). Median nerve electrical stimuli of 8s duration was used to evoke a somatosensory evoked potential, and oxyHb and deoxyHb were recorded before, during and after HC induced by ventilatory adjustments. Results : PaCO 2 [mean (SD)] before, during and after HC were 48.2(5.6), 69.6(5.5) and 52.7(6.9)mmHg respectively in fetal sheep, and 39.5(3.2), 64.6(6.3) and 4 1.6(4.4)mmHg respectively in newborn lambs. Three patterns of cerebral functional responses were observed after the median nerve stimulation: the positive response denotes an increase in oxyHb in the contralateral cortex, the negative response denotes a reduction in contralateral oxyHb, whereas the biphasic response consists of an initial reduction followed by a l ater rise in contralateral oxyHb. Changes in response patterns before, during and after HC are shown in table 1. During HC, 7 of the 8 fetal sheep showed higher oxyHb in the contralateral cortex after median nerve stimulation compared to before HC [mean (SEM) oxyHb: -1.4 (8.6) vs 14.9 (2.7) \u00b5M.cm before and after HC respectively, n=8, p=0.07]. For newborn lambs, 4 of the 7 animals showed higher oxyHb in contralateral cortex during HC [0.7 (4.9) vs 9.5 and after HC respectively, n=7, p =NS]. Conclusions: The rise in cerebral oxygenation after somatosensory stimulation tends to increase with HC in fetal and newborn lambs, in contrast to findings in adult studies. This may be related to different cerebral vasoreactivity in the developing brain and recruitment of cerebral vessels during HC . Table 1.

Department of Physiology, Development & Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Downing Site, Cambridge, CB2 3EG, U.K Introduction: Mitochondria of immature brains are involved in regulating inflammation, synaptic development and connectivity in addition to ATP generation ( Lancet Neurol 13:217, 2014). Adult brains have a high rate of oxygen consum ption but little is known about mitochondrial function in fetal brains. The aim of this study was to determine the ontogenic changes in mitochondrial respiratory function in the fetal sheep brain, and their dependence on thyroid hormones known to regulate fetal oxygen consumption. Methods: All experiments were carried out under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Twin -bearing ewes (n=6) were anaesthetised at 102 -105 (d; term ~145d) for fetal thyroidectomy (Tx) or sham operation. Ewes and fetuses were euthanised at 140 -145d, together with 4 additional un -operated twin -bearing ewes at 102 -105d. Samples of cortex and cerebellum were placed in biopsy medium before homogenisation in respirometry medium, for assessment of mitochondrial function using Oroboros respirometer and protein c oncentration, measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay. Results : addition; Fig.1A,E ) did not alter significantly with age in either brain region (all p>0.05).

Concl usions: Mitochondrial respiratory function increases up to 2 -fold towards term in both brain regions, with a greater respiratory capacity in cerebellum than cortex.

We used an inte grative and longitudinal approach to determine the role of xanthine oxidase (XO) during hypoxic incubation in the programming of cardiovascular dysfunction in chick embryo and in the adult bird. We combined studies of in vivo physiology with those at the isolated organ and cellular levels. Methods: Fertilized chicken eggs were incubated under normoxia incubation (term 21 days). Allopurinol (5 mg.kg-1), or vehicle (H 2O) was administered dai ly into the air cell for 6 consecutive days. At d19, fetal femoral arteries were isolated for myography and tested with acetylcholine (ACh) and fetal cardiac function was determined under Langendorff. Some animals were allowed to hatch and raised until 6 m onths of adulthood. At adulthood, birds were chronically instrumented under general isofluorane anaesthesia with vascular catheters. Five days later, in vivo echocardiography and basal and stimulated cardiovascular function with and without L -NAME treatme nt was established to determine the contribution of NO bioavailability to any changes. Stereology was carried out on the adult hearts. Results: Chronic in ovo hypoxia resulted in endothelial and cardiac dysfunction in the chick embryo (Fig. 1 A,B). At ad ulthood, offspring of hypoxic incubation had higher basal arterial blood pressure, a significant reduction in NO bioavailability, signs of compensatory cardiac hypertrophy and enhanced cardiac contractility (Fig. 1 C -F). In ovo treatment with allopurinol d uring hypoxic incubation protected against the endothelial and cardiac dysfunction in the chick embryo and normalised in vivo NO bioavailability in the adult bird. However, these effects of allopurinol were insufficient to restore hypertension and the enh anced cardiac contractility in the adult bird. Conclusions: XO-derived oxidative stress has a direct role in programming cardiovascular dysfunction during hypoxic development. .Figure 1.

Poster 33 Intergenerational transmission of protection against heart disease via the maternal mitochondria 165 Niu, 2, Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital; 3,Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, U K Introduction: Many studies have reported the intergenerational transmission of increased risk of disease in humans and animals. Conversely, the transmission of overt protective or advantageous traits between generations has been mostly restricted to reports in plants, s uch as in rice or studies with invertebrate species, such as in C elegans (Agrawal et al. Cell 147(6): 1248 -56, 2011). Here, we show in a mammalian model of intergenerational programming by developmental hypoxia that mothers can transfer onto their offspring cardio -protective traits via mitochondrial mechanisms. Methods: Pregnant hypoxic (H: 14% O2) pregnancy from days 6 -20 of gestation. At 12 weeks, F1 offspring were m ated with partners from outside the colony to produce an F2 generation which did not experience hypoxia from both parental lineages. In F1 and F2 male offspring, cardiac recovery from ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R, Langendorff) at 4 months was assessed. Prot C epsilon (PKC - -protective role against I/R via established mitochondrial mechanisms, such that a fall in its expression increases cardiac susceptibility to I/R damage (Patterson et al.

Results : F1 and F2 paternal lineage offspring of hypoxic pregnancy sho wed impaired cardiac recovery from I/R (Fig. 1a and 1b). In contrast, F2 maternal lineage offspring of hypoxic pregnancy showed normal recovery to I/R (Fig. 1c). Hearts of offspring from hypoxic pregnancy showed a reduced fall in PKC - protein expression f ollowing I/R compared to those of offspring of normoxic pregnancy (Fig. 1d). This cardio -protective trait was present in F2 male offspring via the maternal but not via the paternal line (Fig. 1e and f). Conclusions: We show the heritability of an overt advantageous trait transmitted from mother to offspring via the maternal mitochondria in a major organ system such as the heart and circulation in a mammal for the first time.( Supported by the British Heart Foundation ) Figure 1.

Poster 34 Mitochondrial -derived oxidative stress and the developmental programming of cardiac dysfunction - studies in the chicken 166 Skeffington, K.L.1, Beck, C.1, Neuroscience, 2Mitochondrial Biology Unit; Cambridge University, UK Introduction: Development under chronic hypoxia increases the risk of cardiovascular dysfunction in adult life. It has been demonstrated that this occurs secondary to an increase in oxidative stress as treatment with the antioxidant vitamin C is protective (Giussani et al. PLoS ONE 7(2):e31017, 2012). However, Vitamin C treatment is only effective at high doses which are not clinically viable. Hence, there is a need to find alternative antioxidant strategies. Mitochondria are a major source of cellular oxidative stress, hence we investigated the effects of treatment of hypoxic development with the mitochondrial targeted antioxidant hypoxia (14% oxygen) from day 1 of incubation (term=21 days ). From days 13 -18, embryos were treated with vehicle (water) or MitoQ (0.2 mg.kg-1.day-1). On day 19, all eggs were moved to normoxia, allowed to hatch and chickens raised to adulthood (6 months). At 6 months, chickens were surgically instrumented with femoral vascular catheters allowing measurement of blood pressure and responsiveness to drug infusion. Cardiac function and structure was assessed using echocardiography, the Langendorff preparation and stereological techniques. Results : Adult chickens fro m hypoxic incubations showed hypertension (Fig.1A), low (NO) levels (Fig. 1B), hypertrophic hearts (Fig.1C) which worked hard to overcome the increased afterload (Fig. 1D) and an increase release of lactate dehydrogenase following ischae mia (Fig. 1E). Hypoxic MitoQ treated hearts showed no improvement in blood pressure, NO availability or cardiac hypertrophy (Fig. 1 A -D) but hadve reduced levels of LDH following ischaemia (Fig. 1E). MitoQ in both normoxic animals also reduced infarct size. Conclusions: Developmental hypoxia programmes cardiovascular dysfunction in adult chickens.

Department of Physiology, Development & Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Downing Site, Cambridge, CB2 3EG, U.K Introduction: Late gestation hypoxia -induced intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with left heart dysfunction in young adult rats and ageing -associated pulmonary hypertension (PHT; Rueda Clausen et al. Card Res. 81:713-22, 2009). However, whether chronic prenatal hypoxia programm es PHT in later life in the absence of IUGR is unknown. We hypothesised that chronic prenatal hypoxia would programme PHT in adulthood independent of IUGR and postnatal normoxia. Methods: All experiments were carried out under the Animals (Scientific Proc edures) Act, 1986. Pregnant Wistar dams were exposed (H; 13% O 2) or normoxia (N; 21% O 2) from 6 -21 days gestation (term ~22 days). Offspring were maintained in normoxia to 4 months of age. One male per litter was selected for either echocardiogr aphy, performed under catheters were inserted under isoflurane anaesthesia and cardiovascular function was determined 4 -5 days post -operatively (N: n=10, H: n=8). Results : valve velocity interval (PV VTI) peak pressure (mmHg) and velocity (mms-1) were elevated and tricuspid valve E/A ratio (TV E/A) was greater in H vs. N offspring (Fig. 1A). The ratio of diastolic right ventricle to left ventricle internal diameter (RVIDd/LVIDd) relative to bodyweight was greater in H compared with N offspring (0.42\u00b10.01 vs. 0.36\u00b10.03, p<0.05). M -Mode measurement of ejection fraction and pulse wave Doppler mitral E/A ratios were not different. Simi systolic and diastolic blood pressures and DBP, respectively) were not different (Fig. 1B). Conclusions: These data suggest that chronic prenatal hypoxia programmes PHT independent of IUGR and postnatal normoxia, prior to t he development of significant left heart and systemic dysfunction.

Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mie University School of Medicine Background: For severe preeclampsia (PE) with fetal growth restriction (FGR), the only treatment is early delivery of the placenta. Clinicians are often forced to end the pregnancy for maternal indications. We report the cas e of severe PE with FGR whose PE temporary was improved, and pregnancy was successfully prolonged with Tadalafil as hosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE 5 inhibitor). -year-old primigravid woman presented at 27 3/7 weeks of gestation with severe PE and FGR and started to administer Tadalafil. Biochemical markers temporarily improved after administering Tadalafil, hypertension and proteinuria temporality improved, and importantly a prolongation of the pregnancy by 14 days after initiation of Tadalafil . Conclusion: Tadalafil may be a novel treatment for severe PE with FGR to prolong the period of pregnancy. Figure 1.

Centre for Trophoblast Research, Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, UK Introduction: Insulin -like growth factor (IGF) -2 is a growth regulatory imprinted gene highly expressed in feto-placental tissues. We and others have demonstrated that IGF 2 regulates fetal growth and the morphogenesis and nutrient transport capability of the placenta during physiological and environmentally -manipulated pregnancies. However, less is known about the specific role of IGF2 in placental endocrine function and pu tative adaptation of maternal metabolism to favour fetal nutrient delivery. This is important as failure to adapt maternal physiology can lead to pregnancy complications and abnormal fetal development with long -term consequences for maternal and offspring health. Aim: To investigate the significance of IGF2 in placental endocrine regulation of maternal metabolism and fetal growth during pregnancy. Methods: Transgenic mice were crossed to produce entire litters with a deficiency in Igf2 in the endocrine zone of the placenta (junctional zone, Jz) using the placental endocrine cell specific Cre line, TpbpaCre and Igf2-floxed mice (Figure A -B). On day (D) 16 of pregnancy, dams underwent a glucose tolerance test or were anesthetised, blood collected and maternal organs and fetuses weighed. Data were compared to age -matched non -pregnant (NP) females and pregnant dams on D16 that carried litters with unaltered Igf2. Results : Deletion of Igf2 in the placental Jz impaired the ability of the mother to expand her liver and kidney masses, increase plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and increase glucose availability in the circulation (AUC) in the pregnant state (Figure C -D). Moreover, circulating non -esterified free fatty acids were diminished and fetal growth marginally reduced on D16 of pregnancy in response to Jz -Igf2 deficiency (Figure D -E). Conclusions: Igf2 expression in placental endocrine cells is important for driving maternal metabolic changes that promote fetal nutrient acquisition and growth during pregnancy.

Poster 38 Labour -associated proinflammatory genes in the amnion are marked by bivalent epigenetic histone modifications 172 Zakar, T. Mitchell, C. M. Hirst, J. J. Mitchell, M. M. & Murray, H. Mothers and Babies Research Centre at HMRI, New Lambton Heights, NSW, Australia Obstetrics and Gynaecology, John Hunter Hospital, New Lambton Heights, NSW, Australia UQ Centre for Clinical Research, University of Queensland, Brisbane St Lucia, Queensland, Australia Introduction: The co -occurrence of activating (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone -3 (tri)methylations on nucleosom es near the promoter is a characteristic of developmentally regulated genes poising them for activation at the correct stage of development. Here we have explored whether this \"bivalent\" epigenetic modification pattern is involved in the activation of proi nflammatory genes that may trigger term or preterm labour. Methods: Amnion was collected in early pregnancy (12 -16 wks) and after term elective caesarean section and spontaneous labour. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequential ChIP (ChIP -reChIP ) was used to determine the level and co -occurrence, respectively, of the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications at the promoters of the labour -associated inflammatory genes PTGS2, BMP2 and NAMPT. Histone methyltransferase expression was measur ed by quantitative RT -PCR. Results : Both modifications were present at the proximal promoters of the 3 genes. There was a significant rise in the H3K4me3:H3K27me3 ratio at term prior to labour, compared to early gestation, due to increased H3K4me3 levels. H3K27me3 levels did not change between early pregnancy and term. The H3K4me3:H3K27me3 ratio decreased at the PTGS2 promoter with labour. ChIP -reChIP demonstrated co-occurrence of the H3K4me3 and the H3K27me3 nucleosomes at the PTGS2 -D, -F with KMT2F (SET1A) and KMT2G (SET1B) mRNA levels increasing prior to term labour. Both H3K27me3 demethylases were expressed and KDM6B, but not KDM6A (UTX), mRNA abundance increased during pregnancy and at term labour. KDM6A mRNA level increased at preterm labour, and H3K27 methyltransferase (EZH2) expression decreased sharply after early pregnancy. Conclusions: Our study of prototypical labour -associated genes in the amnion suggests that this group of genes is regulated epigenetically by bivalent histone m odifications at the promoter. Activating H3K4me3 levels increase at term potentially by multiple H3K4 methyltransferase complexes, while suppressive H3K27me3 levels are established in early pregnancy by the EZH2 -containing methyltransferase complex (PRC2) and remain stable until labour. We conjecture that the resulting bivalency controls the extent and the trajectory of labour -promoting gene expression as pregnancy advances ultimately determining the time of labour and providing defence against preterm birt h.Poster 39 Enlarged uterus Ikeda , T3. 1 Ise Red Cross Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology 2Sakakibara Heart Institute, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology 3 Mie University, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Introduction: Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is one of the main causes of maternal death. The reported incidences of amniotic fluid embolism varied prominently from 1.7 to 7.7 per 100,000 deliveries o r pregnancies. And the mortality rate is 20 -60%. Typical symptoms of AFE are acute dyspnea, hypotension, DIC, and atonic bleeding. Case: We experienced two cases of clinical amniotic fluid embolism. In both cases in addition to DIC, severe uterine edema was observed. Although improvement of DIC was admitted by the FFP, severe edema of the uterus persisted. We gave C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH) in both cases and the uterus remarkably contracted in a short time. Discussion: In amniotic fluid embolism, uteru s becomes edematous due to anaphylactoid reaction accompanied by increased level of bradykinin. C1INH improves the edematous change of the uterus by inhibiting the kallikrein -kinin system, which leads to decrease the production of bradykinin which causes a tony of the uterus. In both cases we proved the decreased levels of C1INH before we had given C1INH. C1INH may possibly be used as a therapeutic medication for amniotic fluid embolism in three points: 1) it inhibits the production of bradykinin and contrac ts the uterus, 2) it controls the conhealing fibrinolysis system, 3) it inhibits the activation of the complements. There is no specific medicine for AFE. Tamura et al reported mean C1 esterase inhibitor(C1INH) activity level in clinical AFE cases was 30.1 % , which was significantly lower than those of normal postpartum women 62.0%. C1INH , major inhibitor of complements, Factor a and kallikrein could be the therapeutic medicine in AFE in which anaphylactoid reaction, coagulopathy, and activation of element s are the reported mechanisms. Conculusion: C1INH may help treat AFE with an edematous uterus.Poster 40 Rabbit reproductive toxicology studies of maternal uterine artery Ad.VEGF -DNC gene therapy for placental insufficiency show Evreux, France 2. Magnus Growth Ltd, London, UK 3. Institute for Women's Health, UCL, London, UK Introduction: Placental insufficiency leading to fetal growth restriction (FGR) affects 1:300 pregnancies (according to EMA orphan designation EU/3/14/1415) is untreatable and causes serious neonatal morbidity and death. Reduced uterine blood flow (UBF) is a cause. Tran sduction of uterine arteries in normal and FGR animal models using an adenovirus vector (Ad) encoding VEGF isoforms, increases UBF and improves fetal growth in utero , suggesting this therapy may benefit human FGR. The EVERREST consortium ( www.everrest -fp7.eu) is translating uterine artery injection of an adenovirus vector encoding the pre -processed VEGF -D isoform (Ad.VEGF -DNC) into the clinic to treat severe early onset FGR. Using the pregnant rabbit which has a similar placentation to third trimester human placenta, we studied the effect of high and low dose Ad.VEGF -DNC vector administration to dams and their offspring. Methods: Time -mated female primigravid New Zealand white rabbits (18 -20 weeks old, 3.3 -3.7 k g, n=76) underwent X ray guided serial catheterisation and injection of both uterine arteries under general anaesthesia on day 19 postconception. Dams received a intravascular injection (0.8mL) of either Ad.VEGF -DNC vector (high or low dose n=26 per grou p) or formulation buffer (n=24). Dams and fetuses underwent post -mortem analysis at 3 or 10 days post-op (n=4 per time point, per group) to study fetal survival and biodistribution. The remaining dams were allowed to deliver and at either 28 days post -op (day 16 postnatal) or day 90 post -op (day 79 postnatal) the pups underwent post-mortem analysis for toxicity, pup survival and biodistribution. Results : Dam post -op survival was good; two dams died, one during surgery and one the day after surgery; two dams miscarried post -op and one dam was killed for breathing problems during recovery. The livebirth and weaning indices were similar in the three groups ( Table ). There was no vector detectable by RT -PCR in a broad range of fetal or pup tissues at any time po int. As expected, vector was detected in falling concentrations in the maternal tissues as the post -op days advanced. Histological analysis of tissues and detection of antibodies by ELISA is underway. Conclusions: Uterine artery injection of high or low do se Ad.VEGF -DNC vector using interventional radiology techniques does not appear to adversely affect rabbit dam or pup survival. There is no evidence of vector spread across the placenta to the pups. These results are encouraging for the next step to the clinic, which is to perform a phase 1 clinical trial of Ad.VEGF -DNC for treatment of severe early onset FGR.

Each physiological system may also be influenced by maternal diet. Here, we outline effects of moderate fructose -sweetened beverage intak e on the dam, her placenta and offspring cardiovascular, renal and hepatic function and function. Methods: Pregnant rats were fed water (+/ -10% fructose) before and during gestation and through lactation. Male and female offspring were weaned onto stand ard laboratory chow. From 9 -14 weeks of age, cardiovascular parameters (basal, circadian, stimulated) were assessed continuously by radiotelemetry, renal parameters (Na, K, free water clearance) via metabolic cage and hepatic structure and composition by serum enzymes and lipidomics, respectively. Results : Maternal fructose intake led to significant repartitioning of maternal fat from peripheral to central deposits and significantly reduced placental volume (0.14 vs. 0.40 \u00b1 0.04 cm3). Offspring BP was unaffected by prenatal fructose but sensitive to postnatal dietary intake (i.e. increased ~5 mm Hg within hours), an effect exacerbated in female offspring from fructose -fed dams (i.e. increased ~ 10 mm Hg). Moreover, circadian analyses revealed non -dipping o f nocturnal pressure in fructose -exposed offspring, which also had higher urine flow (34\u00b13 vs. 25\u00b12 ml/day kg BW-1). Despite similar liver mass, triacylglycerol and glycogen content, fructose -exposed offspring had small, but significant shifts in hepatic fatty acid composition, even after no direct exposure to fructose (see Figure). Conclusions: Moderately increased maternal fructose -sweetened beverage intake has myriad direct effects on the dam and her placenta and multiple persistent effects on the offs pring, which would render them more susceptible to metabolic syndrome.

Poster 42 Maternal low protein intake early in gestation specifically impacts hepatic glucose metabolism in adult offspring of sheep 177 and Science, or 2Computer Science , University of Nottingham, UK. 3The James Hutton Institute, Craigiebuckler, Aberdeen, UK Introduction: Differences in maternal diet can account, in part, for variation in metabolic competence of the subsequent individual as an adult. Developmental programming may affect growth of organs to limit functional capacity in adulthood, when environment may assume a greater role e.g. the rate of functional decline being exacerbated by obesity. Here, we have tested an interaction between prenatal nutritional 'thrift' and postnatal nutritional excess on gluco ovine protein; n=20) or a diet low in protein only (9% protein) fed during early gestation (0 -65 days, term ~147 days; A proportion of ewes were culled at 65 days for fe tal sampling. Remaining ewes lambed naturally, were weaned at 10 weeks and offspring handled accordingly to maintain body weight as 'lean' (at 1.5 years of age) or 'obese' (i.e. after 6 months exposed to an 'obesogenic environment'). In lean and obese stat es, body composition was determined by DXA in parallel with GTT and ITTs and organ tissue sampling after euthanasia. Results : Low protein diet had little obvious effect on the dam or fetus, but term weight was reduced by ~500g in LPL. Homeostasis model a ssessment indicated relative insulin resistance in male LPE (Fig, left), an effect observed during adolescence. iAUC confirmed this observation (Fig, centre) and molecular analyses coupled with physiological assessment suggested insulin -signalling pathways in the liver, rather than muscle, as the target organ affected by low protein diet during early gestation (Fig, right). Conclusions: Marked variation in maternal protein intake has 'silent' effects on fetal organ growth that are only revealed later in l ife when environmentally challenged by nutritional excess and physical inactivity. Livers of these offspring appear more susceptible to wider excursions of plasma insulin during gluco -regulatory challenges, an effect that will compound age -related, functio nal metabolic decline.

Mitochondria are the primary source of energy through ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, mitochondria regulate oxidative stress and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Little is known, however, about the perinatal maturation of skeletal muscle mitochondrial density and function in preparation for the changes in energy demand and oxygen availability at birth. Methods: Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, twin -bearing ewes and their fetuses were euthanised (200mg/kg sodium pentobarbitone) at 102 -105 six 1 -2 day old lambs from twin pregnancies were euthanised (one lamb per ewe). Samples of biceps femoris muscle were collected immediately into preservation medium, or frozen in liquid nitrogen. Muscle fibres were dissected and permeabilised to measure fat (palmitoylcarnitine; 40\u00b5M) -, carbohydrate synthase (CS) a marker of mitochondrial density, was measured spectro photometrically. Data were -way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test. Results: Muscle CS increased progressively with offspring age (fig.a; P<0.0001). Similarly, the rate of oxygen consumption with all substrates was higher in the neonates tha n prenatally ( P<0.001 all cases; total fig.b). When normalised to CS activity, pyruvate -supported and total oxygen consumption per muscle mitochondria decreased with increasing offspring age, with the highest values in the 102 -105d fetuses and low est values in the newborns ( P<0.01 for both; total shown in fig.c). Conclusions: Mitochondrial density increases towards term and continues to rise after birth, which would allow the rise in energy production expected for the increased requirement after b irth. However, the functional capacity per mitochondrial unit appears to decrease over this period. This may play a protective role in reducing ROS production during labour and upon exposure to higher postnatal oxygen tension. a. b. c. Figure.

Department of Animal Sciences, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY; 4. Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, University of Texas Health Science Center , San Antonio, Texas Introduction : The liver is a central organ regulating lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis and cholesterol metabolism. It is also considered the main detoxifying organ of the body playing a central role in metabolic homeostasis and is a major site for synthesis, storage and redistribution of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. It is well -established that maternal obesity (MO) increases risk of offspring cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and obesity. Mechanisms by which the MO intrauterine environment predisposes offspring to CVD and metabolic dysregulation are unknown. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of MO on primate fetal liver and identify underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods : Unbiased hepatic gene (arrays) and micr oRNA (small RNA Seq) abundance were quantified in near-term (0.9G) baboon fetal livers (control (CON) = 6, MO = 5) and subjected to network analysis (GeneSifter, Ingenuity Pathways) to determine whether fetal responses to MO represent a coordinated molecul ar response. Lipid content (CON = 16; MO = 16) was quantified by Oil Red O staining and Computer Assisted Stereology Toolbox (CAST). Results : We identified 875 differentially expressed genes between MO and CON, with 350 genes up -regulated and 583 down -regulated. Network analysis revealed Wnt/ catenin signaling central to the MO response suggesting that MO impacts lipid metabolism in fetal liver. In addition, 53 differentially expressed miRNAs that target genes in the Wnt/ catenin signaling pathway are in versely expressed with their target genes. We found hepatic lipid content was 3-fold greater in MO than CON fetal livers (p=0.02). Conclusion : Fetal livers in the MO intrauterine environment display early indications of metabolic dysregulation with marked lipid accumulation. Molecular genetic analyses suggest that this dysregulation is mediated by Wnt/ catenin signaling, a central pathway in fatty acid metabolism and lipid storage. These findings are supported by inverse expression of miRNAs that ta rget Wnt/ catenin signaling genes. The miRNA results also suggest an epigenetic mechanism regulating the Wnt/ catenin pathway with MO. Our findings show that MO has an impact on the fetal liver and predicts the impact on offspring impaired metabolic heal th. Poster 45 Similarities and differences in outcomes in the term fetal baboon pancreas to challenges of maternal under nutrition and obesity 180 Li, J.1,2,3, Tursun, A.2,3, Nathanielsz, P.W. 2,3, and Li, C. 2,3 1Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China , 2Texas Pregnancy & Life Course Health Research Center, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX,US & 3Animal Science, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, US Introduction: Many outcomes in respo nse to developmental challenges have U -shaped programming outcomes. For example the Harvard Nurses Study, one of the very first programming studies, showed that poor adult cardiac outcomes were related to birth weight in a J -or U-shaped fashion. We evalu ated the fetal pancreas for insulin, key growth and differentiation factors as well as indices of oxidative stress and glucocorticoid receptors with immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques at term in pregnancies in which the mother was 1) on a moderate matern al restriction diet or 2) in obese mothers on a high fat high energy diet. Methods: Control baboons ate Purina monkey diet ad libitum (CTR) while mothers experiencing moderate nutrition reduction ate 70% of control throughout pregnancy (IUGR). OB mothers were obese at the time of conception due to eating a high fat, high -energy diet ( 45% energy from fat with 4.62% glucose and 5.64% fructose ) and unlimited access to fructose drinks from at least nine months before and throughout pregnancy. Fetuses were retr ieved at C -section at Term. IHC for area stained with image J quantification was analyzed by Student's T -test. Results : Fig. 1 shows that IUGR fetuses had reduced pancreatic insulin while OB fetuses had increased pancreatic insulin due to presumably to the increase in circulating secretagogues. Similarly IGF1 was down in IUGR and up in OB which could account for differences in pancreatic growth. PDX1, an important molecule in pancreatic differentiation was decreased in both IUGR and OB but proportionat ely more in IUGR. HNF4 was decreased approximately by the same percentage in both IUGR and OB. Reactive oxygen stress (ROS) is considered by many to be a basic mechanism in developmental programming outcomes. It is, thus, of interest that nitrotyrosine w as increased similarly in both IUGR and OB as was NDUFV2 and citrate synthase. Phospho -GR was decreased in both situations. Conclusions: Similarities and differences exist in fetal pancreatic outcomes in response to fetal nutrient deficiency and excess which may reflect the fact similarities and differences in predisposition to diabetes in later life that result from these two challenges.

We and others have shown increased oxidative stress in several tissues of offspring of rodent mothers exposed to either nutrient reduction (MNR) o r maternal nutrition excess (MNE). There is a need to determine if oxidative stress plays a role in responses to maternal dietary challenges in nonhuman primates. Hypothesis: Both MNR and MNE increase oxidative stress in multiple fetal tissues. Methods: Healthy female baboons of similar body weight (10 -15 kg) were fed normal chow (CTR, n=26; 12% energy from fat with 0.29% glucose and 0.32% fructose), or 70% CTR global diet from 0.16 - 0.9 gestation (MNR n = 11) or a high energy diet (MNE, n=19; 45% energ y from fat with 4.62% glucose and 5.64% fructose) plus ad lib fructose sodas prior to pregnancy. Fetuses were removed by C -Section at 0.9G under general anesthesia, frontal cortex (FC), heart left ventricle liver, pancreas, kidney and skeletal muscle vastus lateralis (SM) were fixed and stained for Nitrotyrosine (NT), superoxide dismutase 1 and 2 (SOD1 and SOD2) Cruz, 133254).

FC. However SOD2 increased in both MNR and MNE fetal pancreas. No differences were observed in kidney and muscle (not shown). Conclusions: Altered fetal nutrient supply both an increase and decrease in nutrient availability stimulate oxidative stress. If these changes persist into adult life they may constitute a mechanism whereby poor or excess fetal intrauterine nutrition predisposes to widespread later life organ dysfunction. Figure 1.

We re cently completed an NIH project to establish well -documented cohorts of F1 baboons of both sexes derived from MO mothers eating a high fat, high energy diet (HF -HED) plus unlimited fructose sodas to compare outcomes of F1 of same age, normal weight control mothers eating standard primate center Purina Monkey diet ad libitium . NIH requires that resources developed on R24s be advertised as available for collaborations. Therefore we summarize here their phenotype to describe this cohort for investigators interested in studying F1. F1 fetal and postnatal tissues are available for collaborative studies on challenges, exposures, mechanisms and outcomes responsible for programming due to MO and HF -HED combined in well -characterized nonhuman primate model. It is al so possible to design in vivo studies. Methods: Female baboons housed in group cages were fed ad lib Purina Monkey diet [CTR] or ad lib CTR diet with ad lib HF-HED diet [MO] for at least 9 months prior to breeding and through pregnancy and lactation. MO g roup had continuous access to high fructose beverage (Kool -Aid). Results : MO raised maternal BMI (20%) and increased maternal body fat (12%) above CTR at conception. By 0.9 of gestation, maternal glucose in MO increased above CTR 79%, insulin 181% and triglycerides 31%. Fetal glucose was unchanged but fetal insulin increased 170% and fetal triglycerides 28%. At postnatal age 0.75 - 1.0 years percentage body fat in MO F1 was increased above CTR (6.6% females and 2.5% males). Female F1 of MO mothers were he avier than CTR until 10 months of age, males were of similar weight (Fig 1). Over the first year of life body weight, head, chest and abdominal circumference were all increased at some stages while not in males. Conclusions: Strengths of baboon programmi ng studies are 1) ability to control challenges and remove confounds present in epidemiological studies, 2) genetic similarity to humans, 3) precocial stage at birth. Tissues and F1 are available for study. Figure 1. Morphometry.

NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. Prevalence of NAFLD is higher in males. However, mechanisms underlying NAFLD in F1 of MO mothers are poorly understood. We conducting RNA -seq to evaluat e the transcriptome of F1 male and female from MO and Control (C) mothers to evaluate mechanism involved in development of NAFLD. Methods: F0 female Wistar rats ate control or obesogenic diet from weaning through lactation. After weaning all F1 males and females ate control diet. At PND 110 male and female serum and tissues were collected to analyze biochemical parameters, H&E histology, liver triglycerides (TG), immunohistochemistry (IHC) for nitrotyrosine (NT) and oxidative stress (OS) parameters, as wel l as F1 liver transcriptome with RNA -seq to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) . M \u00b1 SE, analysis one -way ANOVA. Results : Male and female F1 of MO show increased total fat TG, and HOMA without body weight changes vs. C. Liver: weight, fat conten t (Fig 1A), glutathione peroxidase (Fig 1D), increased in males whereas only liver TG and NT increased in females MO vs. C. Expression of 3,054 and 170 genes was changed by MO in males and females, respectively (P < 0.05, Fig 1E). For males 108 genes (3.5%) were up -regulated and 2,946 (96.5%) were down -regulated. From the list of DEG down -regulated, KEGG pathway database identified genes related pathways (314 genes), oxidative phosphorylation (39 genes), insul ing signalling (37 genes), cell cycle (25 genes). In contrast, in female, only 122 genes were differentially expressed up (72%) and 48 genes down (28%) (Fig 1E), with no relevant KEGG pathways enrichment. Conclusions: MO programs metabolic dysfunction and down regulation of key cell cycle genes and oxidative phosphorylation, especially complex 1 the major site of ROS production. Changes are sex -specific and can be associated with liver dysfunction observed in F1. The adult liver of male MO adult F1 shows gl obal down regulation of genes that are required for normal function of the transcription process. Figure 1.

It is recognized that progressive inter-pregnancy weight -gain is a common route to obesity in reproductive age women. However mechanisms influencing post -partum weight loss are not well understood. We investigated whether exposure to a suboptimal early -life environment influenced the metabolic response to pregnancy and subsequent post -partum weight -loss. Methods: Wistar rat dams were fed an 8% protein diet during pregnancy, and offspring suckled by control -fed mothers (recuperated). All first -generation (F1) offspring were weaned onto standard chow. First-generation offspring were bred at 3 months and their weight -gain serially monitored during pregnancy and lactation, alongs ide a non -pregnant paired -sibling control. At the end of lactation, tissues were collected and intra -abdominal fat mass measured. Gene expression was measured via q -rtPCR. Results : There was no difference in pregnancy weight -gain between control and recup erated F1 mothers. By the end of lactation, the weight of the control mothers was not significantly different to their non-pregnant sibling -controls, however recuperated mothers remained significantly heavier than either their control counterparts or their non-pregnant sibling -controls (p<0.01). Ovarian fat pads were heavier in postpartum recuperated mothers than in controls (p<0.05). Gene expression in intra -abdominal adipose tissue showed up -regulation of inflammation and lipoxygenase pathways in recupera ted mothers compared to both impairs recovery from the metabolic challenge of pregnancy and leads to retention of adi pose mass post -partum. This study suggests that the early -life environment may have an important role in influencing inter -gestational weight gain, hence contributing to maternal obesity. Figure 1 .

Department of Medicine, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom Introduction: Vitamin D deficiency affects a substantial proportion of the human population, including during pregnancy. Lower maternal vitamin D status has been associated with altered human fetal bone growth, reduced handgrip strength i n 4 year olds and altered muscle structure in young rodents. The fetus is reliant on maternal vitamin D status, and therefore we looked directly at fetal vitamin D status in relation to bone and skeletal muscle structure during fetal life. Methods: Welsh m ountain ewes were fed 100% nutrient requirements (C, 2000 IU/kg vitamin D 3, n= 9), or a diet lacking the vitamin D 3 supplement (VDD, 0 IU/kg vitamin D, n=10) from 17 days prior to conception until post -mortem at 126 -130 days of gestation. Maternal and feta l serum total 25 -hydroxyvitamin -D concentrations ([25(OH) -D]) were measured by HPLC tandem mass spectroscopy. 3 -dimensional images of fetal femur were captured using microcomputer tomography (SkyScan). Type -I myofibre density ar ea (CSA) were assessed in 10m sections of vastus muscle by immunohistochemistry (MY -32 -fast myosin). Data (age -adjusted) were by Student's t - or Mann -Whitney U -test and linear regression with [25(OH) -D]. Results : Bone length and structure, and vastus type -I and -II myofibre density and type -II CSA were not significantly different between C and VDD groups. In the fetal femur, lower fetal serum [25(OH) -D] was associated with thinner (p<0.01, greater tra becular surface lower mid -shaft -I/II myofibre density or CSA. Longer fet al femur length was associated with lower total (p<0.05, R2=0.30) and type -II myofibre The association of lower fetal [25(OH) -D] with altered bone, but not skeletal muscle, structure shows a tissue -specific hind limb adaptation. Our data highlight an association between longer femur length and reduced vastus myofibre density. Thus the preservation of femur length at the expense of strength with lower fetal [25(OH) -D], may alter skeletal muscle structure and influence hind limb strength in later life.Poster 51 Effect of preterm birth on mRNA expression of drug transporters in guinea pig liver 186 Soo, J.1, Berry, M .2,3*, Dyson, R.2, Gray, C.2 & Morrison, J.L.1* 1Early Origins of Adult Health Research Group, School of Pharmacy & Medical Sciences, Sansom Institute for Health Research, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia 2Centre for Translational Physiology, University of Otago, Wellington, New Zealand. 3Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Otago, Wellington, New Zealand. *denotes equal contribution Introduction: Preterm birth affects approximately 10% of live b irths every year and these babies are likely to be treated with drugs during their lifetime. There is some evidence that preterm birth may alter neonatal drug disposition. Due to advancements in perinatal medicine, more preterm babies are surviving into adulthood; however, little is known regarding the ex -preterm's ability to clear medication from its system in later life. Methods: Guinea pigs were mated and randomised to term and preterm groups. Standard clinical care for women at risk of preterm delivery was replicated by administration of two doses of betamethasone 48 and 24 hours before induction of preterm delivery at day 62 (Term=69d) in the preterm group. Liver tissue was collected at 28d (Term males, n=5; Term females, n=8, Preterm males, n=6, Prete rm females, n=6), representing adolescence, and 9 months (Term males, n=9; Term females, n=8, Preterm males, n=8, Preterm females, n=6), adulthood. qRT -PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression of drug transporters (Breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and P -glycoprotein (P -gp)) as well as factors that can regulate the expression or function of drug transporters (Glucocorticoid pathway (Glucocorticoid receptor (GR), (11HSD2)), Pregn Receptor (PXR) and the most common active dimer complex of NF -B (p50 and p65). Results : We found an increase in BCRP mRNA expression in the liver of preterm males at 28 days and this effect persisted into adulthood. Interestingly, preterm birth had no effect on BCRP mRNA expression in females. There was no effect of preterm birth on P -gp mRNA expression. Although, preterm birth had no effect on GR mRNA expression, males had higher GR mRNA expression compared to females. Interestingly, at both ages p reterm birth resulted in an increase in 11HSD1 mRNA expression in males but a decrease in females. There was no effect of preterm birth on mRNA expression of Pregnane X Receptor, and the most common active dimer complex of NF -B, p50 and p65. Conclusions: This preliminary data shows that preterm birth may affect drug disposition in later life. In addition there appears to be differential effects of sex . Figure 1: Preterm birth resulted in increased mRNA expression of BCRP in male guinea pigs at 28d and 9 months, but not in female guinea pigs. * P<0.05, effect of preterm; white bars, term; black bars, preterm.Poster 52 Earthquake and perinatal medicine in Japan -disaster liaison in paediatrics and perinatal medicine (DLPPM) 187 Tsuda, Nishigaya, Y., Hattori, K., Sugawara, J., Suzuki, M., Nakai, A., Wada, K., Nakamura, T. & Masuzaki, H. Kitasato University Hospital, Japan Society of Perinatal and Neonatal Medicine (JSPNM) and Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology ( JSOG) Introduction: In Japan, 4 7% of all the deliveries are cared in private clinics while 5 2% in private or public hospitals. After the experience of the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, we learned that, during the acute phase of large scale earth quake, m ost private obstetric clinics and small hospitals are unable to continue their practice until recovery of lifelines. D eliveries in the remaining hospitals increase drastically. For these hospitals, immediate support by teams of medical professional s and provision of sterilized medical supplies for delivery and surgery are essential to continue necessary service to the pregnant women and neonates suffered by the earthquake. For this purpose, an efficient communication system between headquarters for disaster contr ol in the local government and delivery units of local hospitals in the affected area must be established . Methods: 1) Following the discussion in disaster control committees of academic societies in paediatric and perinatal field, by the end of 2015, we decided to launch a new training system for obstetricians and paediatricians to become a \"disaster liaison\" who colle cts the support needs for maternal -fetal-neonatal medicine in the affected area, and plays a role in logistic arrangements such as patient transportation to prenatal centres in the unaffected areas. 2) In April 16, 2016, a huge earthquake (Magnitude 7.3) struck Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu district of Japan. Due to serious damage, the largest perinatal centre in Kumamoto with 18 NICU beds, Kumamoto City Hospital lost its function completely, and an immediate evacuation and a transfer of all the patients to other centres in the unaffected areas were conducted. In response to the request of disaster control headquarters in Kumamoto, a team consisted of 3 paediatricians and 3 obstetricians experienced with disaster medicine dashed into Kumamoto to serve as D LPPM. Results : After 10 days ' vigorous activities in the Kumamoto headquarters and evacuation shelter s, the DLPPM team withdrew and took over their mission to local physicians. In Kumamoto area, n o serious damage was observed in pregnant women or in the patients of perinatal centres obliged to be transported after the earthquake. Conclusions: 1) Although not well -prepared, an instant team of DLPPM played a significant role during the acute phase of Kumamoto Earthquake in 2016. 2) T he experience in Kumam oto Earthquake suggests that a training system of DLPPM may enhance our ability of disaster control in the field of paediatrics and perinatal medicine.
