Digestive problems can develop out of different factors so the treatment you choose should be based on your body's specific treatment needs. Read on to learn more about digestive problems and the best approach to take when fixing them. A healthy gut, aka, digestive tract, is a foundation for a healthy body and mind. Our gut is considered our second brain, and Leaky Gut Syndrome is at an all time high. For this reason, when symptoms of digestive problems develop, finding the cause early on can keep a bad situation from getting progressively worse. A healthy diet, exercise, and hydration help keep your digestive tract healthy, but other factors may also contribute to digestive problems. Since your body works together as an integrated system, all aspects of your health should be factored into the treatment you receive. At Cutler Integrative Medicine, we specialize in helping restore balance to the body as a whole. As a licensed naturopathic physician, Dr. Cutler can help you determine the cause of digestive distress and prescribe treatments that restore a natural balance in your digestive system as well as a natural balance in your overall health. Your overall health relies on a balanced gastrointestinal tract or GI tract. When working right, your GI tract breaks down food into a nutrient form that can be absorbed by the body's cells and tissues. Digestive problems develop when your gastrointestinal tract can't do its job properly. Accumulating bacteria, mold, and parasites compromise GI tract health. Bacterial imbalances, in particular, can disrupt your system since the digestive tract relies on a balance of good and bad bacteria to function at its best. For these reasons, Dr. Cutler of Cutler Integrative Medicine relies heavily on your testing results and information obtained during your consultation to create a treatment plan that addresses your specific needs. Since each person's symptoms of digestive distress differ, a treatment approach that addresses the whole person in terms of diet habits, stress levels, and emotional well-being can prove most helpful in identifying the root cause and applying effective treatments. As a naturopathic physician, Dr. Cutler specializes in finding the root of your problem and recommending treatments based on your unique physical makeup. Eating healthy, drinking lots of water, and getting regular exercise can go a long way towards keeping your GI tract healthy. However, other factors, such as genetics, stress, and emotional well-being, also impact digestive health in big ways. A naturopathic physician specializes in considering all aspects of a person's life when putting together a treatment plan. At Cutler Integrative Medicine, we don't treat just the symptoms of a digestive problem but rather the cause of the problem. Once properly treated, a healthy balance is restored in the GI tract.
