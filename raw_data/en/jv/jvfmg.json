We have a growing arts scene and a new state-of-the-art performing arts center. We have professional sports teams with multiple sporting venues. The natural beauty of Florida cannot be compared. We are surrounded by numerous lakes, fresh-water springs, and biking/hiking trails. Orlando is 90 minutes from our closest beach. We recognize the stress of medical training. As part of our efforts to improve resident resiliency, we are dedicated to providing our residents with the support and tools needed to maintain a healthy work-life balance and combat physician burnout. Throughout our educational curriculum we have implemented many activities/programs to ensure resident wellness. "}
