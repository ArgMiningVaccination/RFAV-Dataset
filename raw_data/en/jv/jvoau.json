Introduction The Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) continually strives to improve the health and well -being of the residents of the District of Columbia. This is evident through our vision, mission, values, and strategic priorities. Vision: All residents in th e District of Columbia have the supports and services they need to be actively engaged in their health and to thrive. Mission: The Department of Health Care Finance works to improve health outcomes by providing access to comprehensive, cost -effective and quality health care services for residents of the District of Columbia. Values : 1. Professionalism - Treating all recipients and community partners with respect and dignity 2. Accountability - Ensuring that the efficiencies built into the Medicaid managed care program are effective 3. Compassion - For those who are unable to afford comprehensive health insurance 4. Teamwork - Partnering with the community to address social determinants of health 5. Empathy - For those with chronic conditions and provide s pecial incentives to providers to improve access to, and quality of care Strategic Priorit ies: Building a health system that provides whole person care Ensuring value and accountability Strengthening internal operational infrastructure To help achieve our vision and mission, DHCF plans to move towards a fully managed care Medicaid program over the next five years. This move aims to transform the managed care program into a more organize d, accountable, and person -centered system that best supports the District's Medicaid beneficiaries in managing and improving their health. A. Managed Care Program Goals, Objectives, Overview Effective on March 17, 1993, the Council of the District of Columbia (DC) adopted D.C. L aw 9- 247, the Medicaid Managed Care Amendment Act of 1992 , which require s the establishment of a managed care program for Medicaid beneficiaries . The goal of the DC Medicaid managed care program is to promote healthy outcomes of the enrolled populations in the most cost - effective manner possible. The District's Medicaid population is diverse, including individuals with existing complex medical and social needs and those at high -risk or increasing risk for health care disparities. These beneficiaries may be impacted by a range of social factors, including homelessness that must be recognized within effective plans of care. In alignment with DHCF's strategic priorities, t he Medicaid managed care program shall have 2 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew a clear focus on achieving better health outcomes, health care innovation and cost -effective quality healthcare. Since 1994, the District has enrolled children and families, pregnant women, and children with special needs into managed care, which covers acute, primary, s pecialty, and certain behavioral health services. All beneficiaries, except children with special needs and Medicare and Medicaid dual eligible beneficiaries , are enrolled in a managed care organization (MCO) on a mandatory basis. In 1996, a Medicaid demonstration project was begun for children and youth who have special health care needs and receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits or are SSI -eligible. This program is called the Child and Adolescent Supplemental Security Income Program (CASSIP), and enrollment is voluntary. This program provides acute, primary, specialty, and behavioral health services through a single, prepaid benefit plan. Although the Medicaid managed care program began as a Med icaid waiver, i n 1998 the District was granted state plan authority and subsequently extended coverage to families earning up to 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) through a combined Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) . The managed care program utilizes three risk-based MCOs to provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries in the District's H ealthy Families Program (DCHFP) and a risk -sharing arrangement with a fourth health plan to provide services to Medicaid beneficiarie s eligible for the District's CASSIP program .1 In 2010 DHCF expanded coverage to childless adults with incomes up to 200% of FPL . DHCF's four managed care plans serve over 190,000 DC residents, approximately 75% of the Medicaid population. DHCF does not have an MCO that only serves Medicare and Medicaid dually eligible enrollees. On a voluntary basis, duals may enroll in any of the District's MCOs. In 2017, DHCF issued a request for proposal for procurement of managed care services for the District's Medicaid beneficiaries . As a result, the District implemented new, five-year contracts with three MCOs to provide healthcare services to District Medicaid enrollees : Amerigroup DC, AmeriHealth Caritas DC, and Trusted Health Plan . As a result o f a protest, that contract was cancelled in 2018 and a subsequent procurement resulted in the same health plans receiving the award. The current contract is from May 2019 through September 2023. The District's CASSIP contractor did not change and is curren tly in a five -year contract from 2016 -2021 . Table 1 lists beneficiary enrollment in the Medicaid managed care program and fee-for-service (FFS) program. 1 For purposes of this Quality Strategy, the three MCOs and one CASSIP contractor are referred to collectively as MCOs. 3 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew Table 1: Beneficiary enrollment by program type, May 20192 DC Health y Families Program Type Enrollment Managed Care Program 196,048 Amerigroup DC 42,996 AmeriHealth Caritas DC 116,934 Trusted Health Plan 31,044 Health Services for Children with Special Needs, Inc. (CASSIP) 5,074 Fee-For-Service Program 61,157 Total Number of Beneficiaries 257,205 In September 2019, DHCF announced that nearly 22,000 individuals currently in the FFS program will be transitioned to the Medicaid managed care program, effective October 1, 2020.3 Additionally, between 2020 -2025, DHCF plans to transition more populations and services traditionally covered under the FFS program to the managed care program.4 Health care costs for individuals with FFS coverage can be up to five times greater than persons in managed care as they tend to experience substantially higher rates of emergency room use, hospital admissions, and inpatient stays. Today, these beneficiaries must manage their health care needs without assistance or care coordination. By joining the managed care program, this population will receive access to much needed care coordination, and as a result, improved health outcomes . B. DHCF Quality Management Structure Overview DHCF 's Health Care Delivery Management Administration (HCDMA) is responsible for oversight of the delivery of health care services to managed care enrollee s. Its Division of Quality and Health Outcomes (DQHO) is the lead for implementing the quality strategy. DQHO relies on several partners for successful oversight: External Quality Review Organization (EQRO): Federal regulations mandate states that operate a Medicaid managed care program to contract with an independent EQRO to conduct annual reviews of the quality, accessibility, and timeliness of services provided to MCO enrollee s. MCOs: DHCF also relies on information from the MCO performance metric reporting , grievances and complaints , contract compliance oversight , and Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (QAPI) reports. In addition, the MCOs support the management structure th rough performance improvement projects (PIPs) , quality 2 District of Columbia Department of Health Care Finance. Enrollment Report, September 2019. 3 To effectuate these changes, DHCF will work with the Office of Contracting and Procurement (OCP) to re -bid the contracts for its managed care program. The current contractors in the managed care program - AmeriHealth Caritas of DC (AmeriHealth), Amerigroup, and Trusted Health Plan (Trusted) wil l operate the program as presently organized for Fiscal Year 2020. 4 For more information on the District's Medicaid reform efforts, please refer to Medical Care Advisory Council meeting agenda and materials at https://dhcf.dc.gov/page/dc -medical -care-advisory -committee . 4 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew improvement collaboratives , health and wellness programs , and care coordination activities. Other Partners: DHCF partners with o ther state agencies ( e.g., DC Health, Department of Behavioral Health), provider s and provider organizations (e.g. , DC Primary Care Association), and national organizations (e.g. National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA )). C. Goals and Objectives The District of Columbia's Medicaid Managed Care Quality Strategy utilizes the Institute for Healthcare Improvement fr amework for optimizing health system performance (also referred to the \"Triple Aim\") . The strategic goals and objectives of DHCF programs are organized within the three pillars of the Triple Aim : improving the patient experience of care; improving the health of District residents; and reducing the costs of health care (see table 2 ).5 Table 2: District of Columbia Quality Strategy Triple Aim, Goals , and Objectives The Triple Aim Goals Objectives Better Care Improving the patient experience of care 1. Ensure access to quality, whole - person care 1.1 Promote effective communication between patients and their care providers 1.2 Support appropriate case management and care coordination 1.3 Address physical and behavioral health comorbidities Healthy People, Healthy Community Improving the health of District residents 2. Improve management of chronic conditions 2.1 Improve management of pre -diabetes and diabetes 2.2. Improve comprehensive behavioral health services 3. Improve population health 3.1 Improve maternal and child health 3.2 Reduce health disparities 3.3 Promote preventative care Pay for Value Reducing the costs of health care 4. Ensure high - value, appropriate care 4.1 Incorporate pay for performance programs in all MCO contracts 4.2 Direct MCO payments for primary care enhancement and local hospital services 5 Institute for Healthcare Improvement: IHI Triple Aim Initiative, accessed December 15, 2019. http://www.ihi.org/Engage/Initiatives/TripleAim/Pages/default.aspx . 5 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew The 10 objectives (1.1 -4.2) outlined above are tied to focused interventions ( described in detail in Section I V) used to drive improvements within, and in many cases , across the four Goals set forth in this Quality Strategy. To assess performance on these Goals, these interventions are tied to a set of quality measures by which progress is assessed. The crosswalk of objectives to quality measures is available in Appendix I. DHCF utilizes H EDIS , CMS Core Set , and other rigorously tested and standardized measures . The District has long required its MCOs to be NCQA accredited and thus annually complete and submit all applicable HEDIS measures designated by the NCQA as relevant to Medicaid. The MCOs are required to contract with an NCQA -certified HEDIS auditor to validate the processes of the health plan in accordance with NCQA requirements. In addition, MCOs annually c onduct the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS ) surveys (adult survey, child survey, and children with chronic conditions survey) using an NCQA -certified CAHPS survey vendor. As other populations, services , and programs are inc luded in managed care, D HCF will assess the need to adjust the goals, objectives , and measures required to monitor performance . DHCF will continue reporting a subset of the Adult and Child Core Set measures to CMS, with the goal of increasing the number of Adult and Child Core Set measures it reports over time. DHCF is actively exploring use of electronic clinical quality measures (eCQM) via Health Information Exchange (HIE) , which will support appropriate measure selection for all Medicaid populations. D. Development & Review of Quality Strategy The formal process to develop and review DHCF's Quality Strategy occur s no less than every three years unless there is a significant change. Significant changes include events such as a change to the delivery system model; addition of new populations or services; new managed care procurements; or significant changes to the federal regulations governing quality. The effectiveness of the quality strategy is assessed annually through the recommendations provided by the EQRO in collaboration with DHCF , a review of the MCOs' performance on HEDIS measures and CAHPS surveys and evaluating their quality programs described in their QAPI submissions. Additional information is gleaned from reviews of grievance and complaint logs , performance improvement projects , and through the public comment process for new regulations. In 2019, DHCF solicited input from the public by presenting an executive summary of the key elements of the MCO Quality Strategy to the Medical Care Advisory Council . Feedback from these various stakeholder meetings was incorporated into the final strategy , which was made available for a 30 -day public comment peri od via DHCF's website and submitted to the CMS for approval . The final DHCF Managed Care Quality Strategy is available on the DHCF website. 6 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew II. Assessment A. Quality and Appropriateness of Care i. State Procedures for Assessing Quality and Appropriateness of Care DHCF utilizes several mechanisms in its assessment of the quality and appropriateness of care furnished to all MCO enrollees, including: Contract Management : All MCO contracts include quality reporting requirements and oversight activities that allow DHCF to identify trends and issues in a timely manner . The MCOs are required to report to DHCF on topics includ ing, but not limited to : Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment ( EPSDT ) services , utilization , grievance s and appeal s, progress on performance improvement projects , provider network adequacy , marketing and outreach activities , and care coordination. DHCF convenes regular meetings with the health plans to provide feedback on compliance with contract requirements and on performance relative to benchmarks. The DHCF requires MCOs to take corrective action for occurrences of non -compliance or poor performance under the Medicaid managed care contract, including but not limited to instances where the DHCF determines the MCO's quality improvement efforts are inadequate o r improved performance is necessary due to identified weaknesses within operations of th e MCO . 6 Data Collection and Monitoring : At least annually, DHCF collects HEDIS and other performance measure data from its MCOs and compares their performance to national benchmarks, state program performance, and prior health plan performance. Performance Improvemen t Projects (PIP) : DHCF requires e ach MCO to complete at least two PIPs annually , in accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7 438.330(d) . Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Plan (QAPI) : Each MCO must annually submit a QAPI to DQHO along with an assessment of performance on the previous year's QAPI. Encounter Data Accuracy : DHCF contracts with an external actuary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the encounter data submissions and associated payments. Annual Quality Improvement Activities Cond ucted by the EQRO : Activities include validation of PIPs , assessment of network adequacy , and compliance review. A summary of the activities conducted by DHCF's contracted EQRO is discussed in detail in Section C below (Monitoring and Compliance ). 6 For more information on DHCF's process for addressing MCO -Non-compliance to contract provisions and performance benchmarks, please refer to Appendix II, DHCF Information al Bulletin Compliance Actions in the Managed Care Program . 7 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew ii. Identification of Age, Race, Ethnicity, Sex, Primary Language , and Special Health Care Needs Age, Race, Ethnicity, Sex, and Primary Language At the time of Medicaid enrollment, individuals are asked to voluntarily report their age, race , ethnicity , and primary language. These data are shared with the MCOs in order to ensure the delivery of culturally and linguistically appropriate services to members. Each MCO must have in place written guidelines and procedures to ensure benef iciaries are provided covered services without regard to race, color, gender, creed, religion, age, national origin, ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, political affiliation, personal appearance, or physical or mental disability. The MCOs sha ll provide to beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries , free of charge, competent , professional , oral interpretation services utilizing the District's Language Access Line (or comparable services) or through on -site professional interpretation services, regardless of the language spoken, at all points of contact. In addition, MCOs shall require that all Network Providers follow the requirements of the A mericans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1974, and other District requirements.7 All written materials must be made available in any language that the Medicaid enrollee requests. DHCF also requires all MCOs to submit a demographics report on a monthly basis which contains information on District w ard, race, and sex in conjunction with the required HEDIS measures around race, ethnicity , and language diversity. Enrollees with Special Health Care Needs The MCOs are requi red to have policies and procedures to identify adults and children with special health care needs including utilizing a DHCF approved screening tool. They are also required to ensure that enrollee s with special health care needs receive care coordination and case management services and have access to a specialist appropriate for the enrollee 's condition and identified needs . Adults and children with special health care needs are defined as follows: Adults who have an illness, condition or dis ability that results in limitation of function, activities or social roles in comparison with accepted adult age -related milestones in general areas of physical, cognitive, emotional and/or social growth and/or development, or people who have seen a specia list more than three times in the last year. This definition includes, but is not limited to, individuals who self - identify as having a disability or who meet DHCF's standard of limited English proficiency. 7 The DC Language Access Act at 2 -1933 states that a covered entity shall provide translations of vital documents into any non-English language spoken by a limited or no -English proficient popula tion that constitutes 3% or 500 individuals , whichever is less, of the population served or encountered, or likely to be served or encountered, by the covered entity in t he District of Columbia. 8 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew A child with special health care needs is defin ed as a person under 21 years of age with a chronic, physical, developmental or behavioral condition that requires health and related services of a type or amount beyond that which is required by children generally . This may include a child who receives SS I, a child whose disabilities meets the SSI definition, a child in foster care , and a child with developmental delays or disabilities who needs special education and related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) . CASSIP is a voluntary managed care program for children and adolescents with special health care needs . This program provides all the benefits of the risk -based MCO , with the added requirement to provide respite services for families and the option of choosing as the enrollee 's primary care provider (PCP ), a specialist who has the experience and expertise in the treatment of the enrollee 's special health care needs . iii. Efforts and Initiatives to Reduce Disparities in Health Care DHCF is committed to addressing health equity in its managed care program . All new initiatives are developed with the knowledge that the District's Medicaid population is diverse, including individuals with complex medical and social needs and those at high -risk or increasing risk for health care disparities. MCOs are required t o develop a Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) Program , which describes the MCO's systematic approach for assessing and improving the quality of car e utilizing the co ntin uous quality improvement framework. The QAPI program must include a mechanism for r educing racial, socioeconomic and ethnic disparities in health care utilization and in health outcomes. Analysis of interventions must c ompar e health care utilization da ta for enrollee s by subgroups, such as, race/ethnicity, language , and DC ward , prior year performance and , where possible, against regi onal and national benchmarks. Annually, the MCOs are required to submit an evaluation report highlighting QAPI program successes and lessons learned . 8 B. National Performance Measures i. Required National Performance Measures Identified Because all risk-based MCOs are required to have NCQA Health Plan Accreditation as a condition of contracting in the District , MCOs collect and report the full roster of HEDIS /CAHPS measures to DHCF. The CASSIP plan is required to report all measures that have a denominator greater than 30, in alignment with NCQA Health Plan Accreditation Standards and Guidelines. DHCF review s performance on an annual basis and sets benchmarks based either on the national average or prior performance. 8 For more information on MCO QAPI requirements, please refer to Appendix III, Requirements for the Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (QAPI) Program . 9 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew ii. CMS Core Set Measures for Children and Adults in Medicaid/CHIP DHCF voluntarily reports on a subset of the CMS' Child and Adult Core Set measures that align with HEDIS . DHCF also reports to CMS a subset of Core Set measures for both the managed care and FFS populations . Additionally, DHCF submits to CMS the annual EPSDT Report, Form CMS -416. C. Monitoring and Compliance DHCF has detailed procedures for the regular oversight, monitoring , and evaluation of its MCOs . DHCF conducts ongoing c ompliance reviews and data analyses to monitor the MCOs' compliance with contract requirements and to proactively identify issues that could put enrollee s at risk. Activities include: Defining data quality and network access standards Holding bi -monthly operational meetings with each MCO Contracting with an EQRO to perform an independent annual review Monitoring encounter data to assess trends in service utilization Reviewing logs of complaints, grievances, and appeals Analyzing effectiveness of annual PIPs Monitoring MCOs ' NCQA accreditation status DHCF requires MCOs to submit a comprehensive series of reports, which are used for oversight and monitoring. These reports are submitted monthly, quarterly , or annually on a variety of topics such as: case management and care coordination; PIPs; financial repo rts; quality strategic outcome plan; and provider network geo-access reports. T he findings from the MC O reports are analyzed by DHCF and discussed on an ongoing basis and with the MCOs at the bi -monthly operational meetings. When compliance and/or perfo rmance is deemed to be below the established benchmark or contractual requirement, DHCF may provide technical assistance , impose a corrective action , and/or impose financial penalties as necessary. In addition to the oversight and monitoring mechanisms det ailed above, DHCF may make modifications or additions to performance metrics and incentives ; and data and reporting requirements as necessary . These modifications/additions will either be part of a contract amendment or as an implementation of new initiatives. Intermediate Sanctions As specified in 42 CFR \u00a7438.702 , DHCF has establish ed and may impose intermediate sanctions, including: 1. Civil money penalties; 2. Appointment of temporary management for an MCO; 3. Granting enrollee s the right to terminate enrollment without cause; 10 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew 4. Suspension of all new enrollment; and 5. Suspension of payment for beneficiaries enrolled after the effective date of the sanction and until CMS or the State is satisfied that the reason for imposition of th e sanction no longer exists and is not likely to recur. DHCF may use these intermediate sanctions to address any MCO non -compliance with the contract and poor performance . Determinations will be based on findings from MCO reporting, onsite surveys, enroll ee or other grievance s, financial status, or any other source. D. External Quality Review and Non -Duplication of EQR Activities To ensure the District's MCOs provide care and services that meet acceptable standards for quality, timeliness and access ibility of services , DHCF contracts with an EQRO to conduct an annual, external, independent review. DHCF 's contract ed EQRO is Qlarant Quality Solutions, Inc. In accordance with Federal regulations, Qlarant conducts the following mandatory activities to assess MCO performance in the District : 1. Conduct a n operational systems review (OSR) , of MCOs' operations to assess compliance with State and Federal standards for quality program operations; 2. Perform performance measure validation on required performance measures , including source code validation and medical record overreads ; 3. Validat ion of required PIPs , including proper identification of MCO, provider , and beneficiary barriers and interventions ; 4. Network Adequacy Validation (NAV) , including: a. Geo-access reporting to determine if the network is compliant with the District's time and distance standards; b. A secret shopper survey to evaluate compliance with access and availability of services; and c. A review of the accuracy and completeness of each MCO 's provider directory. 5. Development and Implementation of the Quality Rating System (Q RS) and accompanying Consumer Report Card ; and 6. Completion of a comprehensive Annual Technical Report (ATR) to evaluate DHCF's compliance with overall quality, access and timeliness standards . Information and recommendations from the EQRO reports assist DHCF in determining compliance with the contractual requirements and evidence for technical assistance , enhanced monitoring, corrective action plans , or monetary penalties . EQR Standards Using Medicare or Private Accreditation Reviews The risk -based MCOs are required to obtain and maintain full NCQA Health Plan Accreditation. The CASSIP plan is required to complete only the HEDIS component of the accreditation. All MCOs are required to obtain NCQA Case Management Accreditation. The 11 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew EQRO may use i nformation about the MCOs obtained from NCQA accreditation findings to complete required EQR activities . The EQRO also includes the results and findings from the OSR in the ATR. III. State Standards A. Access Standards DHCF requires the MCOs to meet five access standards : availability of services, network capacity, appointment availability , and coordination and continuity of care . Meeting these standards further support the District's overall goals and objectives for improving the patient experience of care ; improving the health of District residents; and reducing the costs of health care of the Managed care quality strategy . i. Availability of Services Maintain and Monitor a Network of Appropriate Providers DHCF's MCO contracts require the M COs provide , or arrange for , the delivery of all medically necessary covered health services enrollees . This includes assuring that they follow provider panel access standards by considering the following: Anticipated Medicaid enrollment ; Expected service usage based on a consideration of member health care needs; The number and types (specialization) of providers required to deliver contract ed Medicaid services; The number of providers accepting new Medicaid patients; The geographic location and distance, as well as travel time required between providers and enrollee s; Appointment availability; and Appropriate provider locations for enrol lees with physical disabilities. MCOs are required to submit their panel of network providers to DHCF in order to demonstrate that the range of preventative, primary care and specialty services offered is adequate in number, mix , and geographical distrib ution to meet the needs of the anticipated number of enrollee s in the service area. If the MC O's provider panel is unable to provide medically necessary covered services, the MC O is required to contract with an out -of-network provider. For e nrollee s with special health care needs or who are determined to need a course of treatment or regular care monitoring, DHCF requires MC Os to have mechanisms in place in order to allow direct access to specialists appropriate for the member's condition and identif ied needs. 12 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew DHCF monitors the adequacy of provider networks throug h monthly reports, secret shopper surveys , utilization, and complaints, grievance /appeal logs . Corrective action s are taken when necessary . Access to a Women's Health Specialist MCOs are required to allow female enrollee s to have a women's health specialist in addition to a PCP (or, at the enrollee 's option, in lieu of a PCP). MCOs must also provide female enrollee s with direct access (without referral) to a women's health special ist within the network for covered women's routine and preventive health care services. This is in addition to the enrollee 's designated source of primary care if that source is not a women's health specialist. Female enrollee s are entitled to timely access to family planning (Title X) services, in or out of network. Provide for a Second Opinion from a Qualified Health Professional The MCO contract requires that enrollee s must be afforded the opportunity to a second opinion. I f an appropriately qualif ied network provider is not available, the MCO must arrange for a second opinion outside the network at no charge to the enrollee . Adequate and Timely Coverage of Services Not Available in Network and payment for those services In the event the MCO's network is insufficient to furnish a specialty service, the MCO shall pay for the cost of out-of-network services, for as long as the MCO is unable to provide the serv ices through a network provider . Additionally, if an enrollee with special health care needs is unable to secure a new network provider within three business days, the MCO shall arrange for covered services from an out-of-network provider at a level of service comparable to that received from a network provider until the MCO is able to arrange for such service from a network provider . The MCO shall pay for such services at a rate negotiated by the MCO and the out-of-network provider. The MCO shall cover and pay for emergency services regardless of whether the provider furnishing the services is a network provider . The MCO is required to coordinate with out-of-network providers with respect to authorization and payment in these instances and ensure that cost of the services and transportation to the Enrollee is no greater than it would be if the services were furnished within the MCOs provider network. Assure Provi ders Meet State Standards for Timely Access to Care and Services MCOs must maintain a provider network that is sufficient to provide timely access to the full range of covered services, considering the urgency of the need for services , including after -hour s coverage . In addition, the MCOs' network providers must offer hours of operation that are no less than the hours of operation offered to commercial enrollee s or comparable to the Medicaid FFS program , if the provider serves only Medicaid enrollee s. 13 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew Services included in the MCO contract must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, when medically necessary . The District has set timely access standards for non -urgent appointments ( see Table 3 ). In addition, the wait time for a primary care appointment should not be greater than 45 minutes if the enrollee arrived early. MCOs must have written policies and procedures for monitoring and sanctioning providers who are either out of compliance with state standard s for timely access to care and services, or have been excluded, suspended or debarred from participating in any District, State, or Federal health care benefit program, in accordance with \u00a7438.606. The MCO must provide these policies and procedures to the ir network providers.

Assurances of Adequate Capacity and Services Assurance of Capacity to Serve Expected Enrollment In order to assess the adequacy of the provider network, MCOs are required to submit a list of all network providers , provide summary reports by specialization, and submit all provider contracts to DHCF . On a weekly basis, the MC Os are sent an electronic file that contains the District's provider panel allow ing for a reconciliation of any discrepancies between the MCO panel and what is contained within DHCF's Medicaid Management Information System ( MMIS ). Another component of DHCF's monitoring and oversight is the network adequacy validation performed by the EQRO to determine the MCOs compliance with the District's network adequacy and access requirements. Mechanisms/Monitoring to Ensure Provider Compliance The District has developed time, distance , and timely access standards. MCOs provide geo-access reports to demonstrate compliance. MCOs must ensure that, at a minimum, they can meet the time and distance standards for the fol lowing provider types: Primary Care, Obstetric -Gynecological , Specialty Care, Mental Health , Hospital , and Laboratory - 5 miles or 30 minutes from the beneficiary's residence Pharmacy - 2 miles from the beneficiary's residence Culturally Competent Services to All Participants MCOs are required to respond with sensitivity to the needs and preferences of culturally and linguistically diverse enrollees. To ensure that all enrollees are treated in an appropriate manner, MCOs must ensure provi der compliance with policies and procedures that promote cultural competency in accordance with the DC Language Access Act of 2004 . This includes free translations of marketing and member materials into non -English languages. MCOs are responsible for promo ting the delivery of services in a culturally competent manner, to all members, including those with limited English proficiency and diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds. MC Os must inform providers of their obligation to provide oral translation, oral i nterpretation, and sign -language services to the ir enrollees . Additionally, MC Os must conduct staff training sessions on subjects including disability competency, access, cultural sensitivity, and person -centered care delivery approache s. iii. Coordination and Continuity of Care MCOs must ensure that each enrollee has an ongoing source of care appropriate to his or her needs, especially during transitions between health plans or health systems. This is of paramount importance for enrollees with special health care needs. In accordance with the MCO contract, MCOs shall be required to provide or arrange for all 15 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew medically necessary services, authorization, referrals, case management, and/or assistance in accessing services. MCOs may subcontract or enter into a sin gle-case agreement in order to meet the health care and support needs of their enrollees. Medicaid enrollees are permitted to retain their current provider(s) for up to 60 calendar days from the effective date of enrollment in the receiving MCO, unless the enrollee has been identified as an individual with special health care needs. Enrollees identified as having special health care needs shall receive continuation/coordination of services for up to 90 calendar days or until the enrollee may be reasonably transferred without disruption. MCOs shall also allow enrollees to maintain their previously authorized Medicaid services, including frequency and payment rate, for the duration of the prior authorization or for 60 days from enrollment (90 days for indivi duals with special health care needs), whichever is less. The MCO may prior authorize or assist the enrollee to access services through an in - network provider when any of the following occur: The enrollee's condition stabilizes and the MCO can ensure no interruption to services; The enrollee chooses to change to a network provider; A change in medical status occurs that warrants a change in service; or Quality of care concerns with the provider are identified. MCOs must reimburse out -of-network providers for beneficiaries who are transitioning to a di fferent MCO or FFS program . MCOs must request approval from DHCF prior to transferring an enrollee with a special health care need within the ninety 90-day transition period. Whether the beneficiary is transferring from FFS program or another MCO: The ent ity that previously served the beneficiary must provide historical utilization data. Utilization data consists of claims, medical records, case management notes, data collected from social determinants surveys , and any other data that is relevant to the he alth of the enrollee. If the enrollee is assigned to a new provider, the new provider(s) must be able obtain copies of the enrollee's medical records from the newly assigned MCO or DHCF, as appropriate. iv. Coverage and Authorization of Services Amount, Dura tion, and Scope of Each Service MCO s are required to cover and pay for diagnostic, screening, and preventive clinical services that are assigned a grade of A or B (strongly recommended or recommended, respectively) by the United States Preventive Services Task Force; approved vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; preventive care and screening of infants, children and adults recommend by the Health Resources and 16 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew Services Administration's Bright Futures program; and additio nal preventive services for women recommended by the Institute of Medicine. Preventive services shall be recommended by a physician or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts acting within the authorized scope of practice under the Health Occupatio ns Revision Act of 1985, effective March 25, 1986 (D.C. Law 6 -99; D.C. Official Code \u00a7 3 -1201.01 et seq.), or comparable law in the state where the provider is licensed. The MCO contract further requires that MCO s furnish services in an amount, duration , and scope that is : No less than the amount, duration , and scope for the same services furnished to beneficiaries through an FFS arrangement ; and Are sufficient in amount, duration, or scope to reasonably achieve th e purpose for which the service is furnished . MCO s shall not arbitrarily deny or reduce the amount, du ration, or scope of a Medicaid service solely because of a diagnosis, type of illness, or condition of the enrollee . Medical Necessity MCOs are responsible for determining medical necessity for services and supplies for enrollee s. Medical necessity is met if the service: Meets generally accepted standards of medical practice; Is clinically appropriate in its type, frequency, extent, duration, and delivery setting; Is appropriate to the adverse health condition for which it is provided and is expected to produce the desired outco me; Is the lowest cost alternative that effectively addresses and treats the medical problem; Provides unique, essential, and appropriate information if it is used for diagnostic purposes; and Is not provided primarily for the economic benefit or convenien ce of anyone other than the recipient. MCO s are allowed to place appropriate limits on services for the purpose of utilization control, provided that the services furnished can reasonably achieve their purpose; the services supporting individuals with ongo ing or chronic conditions , or who require long -term services and supports are authorized in a manner that reflects the enrollee 's ongoing need for such services and supports; and for family planning services that are provided in a manner that protects and enables the enrollee 's freedom to choose the method of family planning to be used. Authorization of Services The MCO 's written U tilization Management (UM) policies and procedures defines its prior authorization process . This process must include the use of review criteria and a 17 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew utilization review decision algorithm that conforms to managed care industry standards. Specifically, th e policies and procedures must: Have the flexibility to efficiently authoriz e medically necessary services ; Ensure that the review criteria for authorization determinations are applied consistently ; Require that the reviewer consult with the reques ting provider when appropriate ; Identify services available upo n an enrollee 's direct request ; Identify services that re quire pr e-service authorization ; Identify services that require concurrent review ; Indicate circumstances th at warrant post -service review ; Include MCO 's special procedures for management of high -cost and high -risk cases ; and Include a clear statement that MCO is legally prohibited from denying services based upon cost. In order to ensure consistency in the review process and to provide effective guidance , MCO utilization reviewers must make authorization determinations consistent with the medical necessity criteria and at no time shall any covered services be denied based upon cost. At least annually , MCO s must evaluate the consistency with which utilization reviewers apply standardized criteria in decision making and complete inter -rater reliability testing with all reviewers. MCOs shall ensure that compensation to individuals or entities that conduct UM activities is not structured with the provision of incentives for the individual or entity to deny, limit or discontinue medically necessary services to any enrollee . MCOs are to maintain a record of all authorization requests, including standard and expedited requests. This information must be provided to DHCF upon request. As a furthe r check on the authorization process, t he MCO's Chief Medical Officer must be responsible for overseeing the authorization decisions of the UM program to ensure that decisions are based on all relevant medical information available about the enrollee and i n accordance with evidence -based clinical practice standards. Any decision to deny a service authorization request or to authorize a service in an amount, duration, or scope that is less than requested, must be made by a health care professional who has ap propriate clinical experience in treating the enrollee 's condition or disease. Prior authorization decisions shall be communicated within prescribed timelines and on a template provided by DHCF . The MCO shall give the enrollee and requesting provider written and /or oral notice of any adverse benefit determination at least 10 days before the date of the action . Notices of adverse determinations are sent to the requesting provider as well as the enrollee. The MCO's Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination shall meet all Federal and District requirements that includes, at a minimum, the following information: The reason(s) for the adverse benefit determination; 18 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew The enrollee's right to file an Appeal with the MCO; The enrollee's right to directly request a District Fair Hearing only after receiving notice that the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP is upholding the adverse benefit determination ; The procedures for exercising the enrollee's Appeal and Fair Hearing rights; The circumstances under which an expedited resolution of the adverse benefit determination is permitted and how to request it; The enrollee's right to have his or her benefits continued pending resolution of the Appeal or Fair Hearing if the conditions specified in the contract are met; The enrollee's right to receive assistance from the Medicaid Ombudsman and how to contact the Ombudsman; and The enrollee's right to obtain free copies of certain documents, including the Enrollee's medical records used to make the decision and the medical necessity criteria, referenced in the adverse benefit determination. B. Structure and Operation Standards i. Credentialing and Re -Credentialing All MCOs must develop and maintain written policies and procedures for the credentialing and re -credentialing of all network providers to ensure the covered services are provided by appropriately licensed and accredited providers. These policies and procedures shall, at a minimum, comply with federal, state and NCQA standards. DHCF has also mandated that all MCO contracted providers have credentialing information on file or accessible by the District. DHCF requires that MCOs use the NCQA Health Plan Standard s and Guidelines credentialing and re -credentialing requirements as the District's standard and requirement for all MCOs when initiall y credentialing and when re -credentialing providers in connection with policies, contracts, and agreements providing basic health care services. MCOs may not discriminate against providers that serve high -risk populations or specialize in conditions t hat r equire costly treatment. MCOs must ensure that the provider has met all applicable credentialing criteria before the provider can be listed as an in -network provider . If any MC O delegates the credentialing or re -credentialing process to another entity, the MC O must retain the authority to approve, suspend, or terminate any subcontractors. Upon DHCF 's request, the MC O must be able to demonstrate the record keeping associated with maintaining this documentation and/or submit documentation verifying that all necessary contract documents have been appropriately completed. DHCF prohibit s the employment or contracting of providers excluded from participation in federal health care progr ams under either Section 1128 or Section 1128A of the Social Security Act. MC Os must notify DHCF when credentialing is denied for program integrity reasons. 19 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew ii. Enrollee Information To assist potential enrollee s, DHCF maintains current information about the Managed Care Program on its website ( https://dhcf.dc.gov/ ). This includes information about Medicaid Managed Care Benefit Package, links to each of the MC O websites, and , in 2019 , a comparison of the District's MCOs on key performance indicators. The District's enrollment broker maintains a phone line and is responsible for providing unbiased education and selection services for the MCOs . All informational materials develo ped by DHCF , the enrollment broker , and the MCOs will be made available in formats and languages that ensure their accessibility, including that materials are provided at an appropriate reading level. Each MCO is required to produce an enrollee handbook wh ich include s the following information: Benefits provided, including the amount, duration and scope of those benefits, and guidance on how and where to access benefits, including transportation, family planning services and supplies from out-of-network providers; Procedures for obtaining benefits, including any requirements for service authorizations and/or referrals for specialty care and for other benefits not furnished by the enrollee 's PCP ; The extent to which, and how, after -hours and emergency coverage are provided; Beneficiary rights and responsibilities; The process of selecting and changing the enrollee 's PCP ; Grievance, appeal, and State fair hearing procedures and timeframes; The toll -free telephone number for member services, me dical management, and any other unit providing services directly to beneficiaries and how to access auxiliary aids and services, including additional information in in alternative formats or languages; and Information on how to report suspected fraud or ab use. MCOs are permitted to provide this information by mail or email (only if beneficiary has expressed consent for email) in addition to posting online. MCO s must compile a directory of its network providers in a format specified by D HCF . The directory mu st be made available to enrollee s and potential enrollee s and include the following information : Provider names (first, middle, last) Group affiliation(s) (i.e., organization or facility name(s), if applicable) Street address(es) of service location(s) Telephone number(s) at each location Website URL(s) Provider specialty Whether provider is accepting new beneficiaries Provider's linguistic capabilities, (i.e., languages (including American Sign Language) offered by provider or a skilled medical interpreter at provider's office ) 20 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew Whether provider has completed cultural competency training Office accessibility (i.e., whether location has accommodations for people with physical disabilities, including in offices, exam room(s) and equi pment) Telephone number that beneficiaries can call to confirm the information in the directory This information must be made available in electronic form, and upon request, in paper form. Per 42 CFR \u00a7 438.10, information included in a paper provider direc tory must be updated at least monthly and electronic provider directories must be updated no later than 30 calendar days after the MCO receives updated provider information. Provider directories must be posted on the MCO 's website . iii. Confidentiality MCO s mu st have a management information system capable of documenting administrative and clinical procedures while maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of protected health information in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act , the District's Mental Health Informatio n Act, and 42 C.F.R. Part 2, including special privacy and confidentiality provisions related to people with HIV/AIDS, mental illness, and alcohol and drug abuse disorders. All MCO contracted providers must complete training and education on privacy and confidentiality of protected health information. The MCO provider manual must also address privacy and security procedures and additional protections for maintaining enrollee privacy and confidentiality. All reporting must comply with privacy and confidenti ality standards in accordance 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E . iv. Enrollment and Disenrollment Newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries shall be initially enrolled in FFS Medicaid and shall have 30 days from the date of notice sent by the enrollment broker to select an MCO. If a newly eligible beneficiary fails to select a n MCO within 30 days of enrollment, DHCF, through its enrollment broker, shall auto -assign such individuals and families on approximately an equal and random basis among MCOs. Newly e ligible beneficiaries that are auto -assigned or voluntarily select a n MCO shall have 90 days from the date of managed care enrollment to transfer to another MCO. Within 10 business days of the birth of an infant to a woman enrolled in the plan , the MCO shall notify DHCF by completing all fields in the Deemed Newborn forms and log and submit to designated staff at the Department of Human Services' Economic Security Agency , which is responsible for Medicaid eligibility determinations , within 10 business days to ensure newborns are enrolled timely. From the time of birth, the newborn must remain an enrollee of the MCO to which he/she was assigned until a separate Medicaid number is assigned . Upon assignment, the parent can choose to enroll the newborn in a different MCO. MCOs may only request disenroll ment of enrollee s when the MCO is notified that the enrollee is ineligible for services or upon suspicions of fraud or deceptive use of MCO 21 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew services by the enrollee . Consistent with the ADA , DHCF determines if the ind ividual is a qualified person with a disabili ty and, if so, shall spe cify the reasona ble accommodations that MCO shall make to continue provision of services . Risk -based MCOs may request that DHCF disenroll a Medicaid enrollee who has been admitted to a Medicaid approved Residential Treatment Center, Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilit y, Nursing Home, Nursing Facility, Skilled Nursing Facility, or other long -term care facility or is incarcerated and who is expected to remain in the facility for 30 consecutive days. v. Grievance and Appeals System DHCF has implemented a grievance and appeals system that meets the standards in the federal regulations ( 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 438.228, 4 38.400, 438.402) . Enrollees or authorized representatives may file a grievance , orally or in writing, to express dissatisfaction with any issue that does not relate to an adverse benefit determination (e.g., quality of care concerns or behavior of a provi der) with the MCOs at any time. In the event of an adverse benefit determination, in which the M COs must give enrollee s timely and adequate notice in writing consistent with 42 CFR \u00a7438.10 , the enrollee may file an appeal with the MCO. Should the MCO not resolve the appeal to the enrollee's satisfaction, they have access to a state fair hearing. A provider or an authorized representative may request an appeal or file a grievance, or request a State fair hearing, on behalf of an enrollee . The MCO shall issue a written acknowledgement of the receipt of an appeal or a grievance within two business days of receipt. The MCO shall dispose of the grievance and notify the enrollee or the enrollee 's de signee in writing of the decision no later than sixty calendar days from the date the MCO receives the grievance or as expeditiously as the enrollee 's health condition requires . In handling grievances and appeals, each MCO must give enrollee s any reasonabl e assistance in completing forms and taking other procedural steps related to a grievance or appeal. This includes, but is not limited to, auxiliary aids and services upon request, such as providing interpreter services and toll -free numbers for use by per sons with hearing or speech difficulties . DHCF require MCOs to report monthly on their grievance and appeal processes and outcomes. vi. Sub-contractual Relationships and Delegation MCO s shall evaluate a prospective subcontractor's ability to perform the activities to be delegated before a written agreement is executed. When an MCO enters into a sub - contractual arrangement all contracts or written arrangements/agreements between the MCO and any subcontractor must specify that the de legated activities or obligations are : 1) in compliance with the MCO's contract obligations; and 2) either provide for the revocation of the delegation or specify remedies in instances where the subcontractor has not performed satisfactorily. Additionally, MCO s shall monitor the independent contractor's performance on an ongoing basis and subject it to formal review according to a periodic schedule 22 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew established by the District, consistent with industry standards, or District MCO laws and regulations. I f the MCO identifies deficiencies or areas for improvement, the MCO shall take corrective actions. C. Measurement and Improvement Standards i. Practice Guidelines The MCO s shall adopt and disseminate clinical practice guidelines relevant to its enrollee s for the provision of preventive, acute , and chronic medical and behavioral healthcare services. All practice guidelines shall be based on valid and reliable scientific clinical evidence or drawn from expert and professional provider consensus which includes the results of peer -reviewed studies. The MCO s shall adopt practice guide lines in consultation with network practitioners located in the District. These practice guidelines shall be reviewed, updated , and approved periodically, as appropriate, at least every two years by the MCO's Quality Improvement Committee or a designated c linical committee. The practice guid elines shall be disseminated to all network providers, and shall be readily available through mail, fax, e -mail , or through the MCO 's website. Practice guidelines shall be made available upon request to enrollee s and po tential enrollee s. The MCO shall utilize the application of practice guidelines to assist practitioners and enrollee s in decision making as it pertains to appropriate health care utilization management for specific clinical circumstances and behavioral health care services. ii. Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Program MCO s are required to develop, maintain and operate a Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) program , which shall be reviewed and/or revised annually and submitted to DHCF for approval. The MCO must maintain a well -defined QAPI structure that includes a planned, systematic approach to improving clinical and non-clinical processes and enrollee health outcomes (See Appendix III). The MCO is also required to use performance measures including, but n ot limited to , HEDIS, CAHPS, provider surveys, and enrollee satisfac tion surveys to assess the effectiveness of its QAPI program . The QAPI program shall include iterative processes for assessing and monitoring quality performance, including but not limited to: barrier analysis , identifying opportunities for improvement , implementing targeted and system interventions , and continuous monitoring for effectiveness through the utilization of quality improvement principles . Conduct Performance Improvement Projects MCOs conduct at least two DHCF chosen PIPs annually using a report template provided by the EQRO. The EQRO develo ps the study methodolog ies and validates the data reported. Results are presented in final reports due 18 months after each study begins. 23 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew DHCF required the MCOs to conduct two PIPs on Pediatric Asthma and Perinatal Health and Birth Outcomes from FY 2015 through FY 2018 . In FY 201 8, DHCF added PIPs on Comprehensive Diabetes Care and Behavioral Health. PIPs on Pediatric Asthma; Perinatal Health and Birth Outcomes; and Behavioral Healt h were retired in FY 2019 . A PIP on Maternal Health, which includes timeliness of prenatal care and access to contraceptive care , was added , and the PIP on Comprehensive Diabetes Care was maintained . Utilization of Services The MCO contract requires that the QAPI include m echanisms to detect both underutilization and overutilization of services. The MCO must u se required performance measures to analyze the delivery of services and quality of care, over and underutilization of services, disease management strategies, and outcomes of care. Mechanisms to Assess the Quality and Appropriateness of Care The MCO contract requires that the QAPI include m echanisms to assess the quality and appropriateness of care furnished to enrolle es with special healt h care needs. Requirements includ e, but are not limited to: 1. Ensuring that each enrollee is assigned a PCP , which may be any of the following: family practice physician, general practice physician, internal medicine physician, OB/GYN, pediatric physician (when appropriate for the enrollee ), osteopath, clinic or Federally Qualified Health Center ( FQHC ), nurse practitio ner, or a subspecialty physician when appropriate to an enrollee 's special health care needs ; 2. Providing care coordination and case management services ; 3. Direct access to a specialist as appropriate for the enrollee 's condition and identified needs ; and 4. The availability of appropriate accommodations . Comply with the District's Annual QAPI Review The MCO 's QAPI is reviewed annually as part of the external quality review process. The District's MCO contract requires that the MCO mus t fully cooperate and collaborate with all EQRO activities, personnel, and any requests for data/documentation/reports . In addition, MCO s are required to conduct an annual evaluation of its QAPI program , which at a minimum must include: Analysis of improve ments in the access and quality of health care and services for enrollee s, due to quality assessment and improvement activities , and targeted interventions carried out by the MCO ; Consideration of trends in service delivery and health outcomes over time , including monitoring of progress on performance goals and objectives; and 24 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew Annual s ubmission of information on the effectiveness of the MCO 's QAPI program to network providers , upon request to enrollee s, and to DHCF through the annual compliance review or upon request. iii. Health Information Systems MCO s must maintain a health information system that collects, analyzes, integrates and reports data as specified by DHCF. The system must provide information on the areas including, but not limited to, ut ilization, claims, grievance and appeals, as well as enrollment and disenrollment for reasons other than loss of Medicaid eligibility. Collect Data on Participant and Provider Characteristics and on Services MCO s must provide for: Collection and mainten ance of sufficient enrollee encounter data to identify the provider who delivers any item(s) or service(s) to enrollee s; Submission of enrollee encounter data to the District at a frequency and level of detail to be specified by the State, based on program administration, oversight and program integrity needs; Submission of all enrollee encounter data that the District is required to report to CMS; Specifications for submitting encounter data to the District in the required format; State review and v alidation of encounter data ; Validat ion of the completeness and accuracy of reported encounter data and that it precisely reflects the services provided to the enrollee s; Timely submission of data; and Policies and procedures to monitor data completeness, consistency and validity including an attestation process. The MCO s are required to have internal procedures to ensure that data reported to DHCF are test ed for validity, accuracy, and consistency on a regular basis. At a minimum, the MCO s mus t verify the accuracy and timeliness of reported data , screen the data for completeness, logic, and consistency . They must also collect service information in standardized formats to the extent feasible and appropr iate. The MCO must ensure that reportable data, when allowed to be reported based on a sample, reflects a sufficient sample size to accurately reflect the enrollee population. The MCO s must also agree to cooperate in data validation activities that may be conducted by DHCF, by making available to DHCF's specifications, medical records, claims records, and a sample of any other data. 25 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew IV.

Performance Improvement Projects Each MCO is required to annually conduct performance improvement projects (PIPs ) that are designed to achieve, through ongoing measurements and interventions, significant improvement in clinical or non -clinical care areas that are expected to have a 26 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew favorable effect on health outcomes. The MCOs' PIPs must include measurements of perfo rmance using objective quality indicators, implementation and reporting of interventions to achieve improvement in quality, evaluation of the effectiveness of the interventions, and planning and initiation of activities for increasing or sustaining improve ment. As of FY 201 9, DHCF requires the MCO s to conduct two PIPs, one on Comprehensive Diabetes Care and one on M aternal Health. Comprehensive Diabetes Care - According to the CDC's Surveillance System in 2016, 9.3% of adults within the District of Columb ia had a diabetes diagnosis. Overall, the measurement year (MY) 2016 District of Columbia MCO averages did not compare favorably to the national averages for the HEDIS\u00ae Comprehensive Diabetes Care performance measures. On f ive of seven measures, the MCOs performed below the national average benchmarks. Diabetes is a chronic condition, and eliminating risk factors such as smoking, overweight/obesity, physical inactivity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood glucose is critical in managing t he condition. In 2018, DHCF initiated the Comprehensive Diabetes Care PIP with the Medicaid managed care population and used MY 2017 results as the baseline assessment. Maternal Health - The District of Columbia Department of Health Perinatal Health and Infant Mortality Report (April 5, 2018) published several relevant statistics based on 2015 -2016 DC birth data:9 Fifty -two percent (52%) of non -Hispanic black mothers entered prenatal care in the 1st trimester compared to 86% of non -Hispanic white mothers and 64% of Hispanic mothers. One (1) in 20 non -Hispanic black mothers did not initiate prenatal care , which was significantly higher than the percentage of non -Hispanic white and Hispanic mothers. Some of these women may have high -risk pregnancies and conditions that can potentially be managed. DC Health has identified multiple core priorities to drive programmatic efforts. In addition to the potential positive effects on the mother's and newborn's heath, prenatal care can also positively impact child health. Overall, the MY 2017 District of Columbia MCO averages did not compare favorably to the national averages f or the HEDIS \u00ae Prenatal and Postpartum Care performance measures. Both measures performed below the national average benchmarks. To further drive improve ment on the MCO PIPs , DHCF and the MCOs participate in multi - stakeholder QI collaboratives which typic ally includes representation from provider groups and with other governmental and community stakeholders . For 2020, DHCF is proposing a QI improvement collaborative for the Maternal Health PIP that will bring 9 These statistics represent all DC residents who gave birth, not only those covered by DC Medicaid.

Incentivizing MCO DHCF has implemented an MCO pay-for-performance ( P4P ) program, which includes capitation payment withhold tied to MCO performance on select quality improvement performance measures . DHCF selected three outcomes -based measures that aim to reduce the following : 1) Plan All -Cause Readmissions, 2) Potentially Preventable Hospitalizations, and 3) Low Acuit y Non -Emergent (LANE) ED Visits. DHCF chose three performance measures to incentivize the risk-based MCOs to maximize provision of ca se management and primary and preventive care in the least acute setting. The DQHO works closely with the MCOs to address b arriers and implement effective interventions to improve the P4P measures . The res ults of the MCO P4P program are published biannually on DHCF's website. Value Based Purchasing - DHCF is requiring MCOs to engage in v alue -based purchasing (VBP) arrangement s or other alternative payment methodologies (APM) that link specific financial incentives to demonstrable improv ement in health outcomes . MCOs must utilize payment arrangements with their network p rovider s to reward performance excellence and performance improvement in targeted priority areas conducive to improved health outcomes and /or cost saving s to the health system . VBP arrangements with providers include both FFS -based bonus arrangements and shared savings, shared risk, or capitated Alternative Payment Methods arrangements . As of February 2018, all risk-based MCOs are operating V BP programs. DHCF aims to further align these programs across MCOs to achieve increased efficiencies for providers and maxim ize positive health outcomes for enrollee s. DHCF is working closely with community partners to identify and prioritize social determinants of heath that challenge the District's Medicaid population and how the agency can most effectively leverage this data to build person -centered VBP programs. iii. Mayor's Commission on Healthcare Systems Transformation The work of the District of Columbia Mayor's Commission on Healthcare Systems Transformation (the C ommission ) focus ed on alleviating systemic health care challenges in the District by developing recommendations that address the current stresses in the District's health care system . The Commission specifically target ed the following issues: improving access to primary, acute, and specialty care s ervices, including behavioral health care; addressing health system capacity issues for inpatient, outpatient, pre - hospital and emergency room services; and promoting an equitable geographic distribution of acute care and specialty services in disproportio nately -underserved communities east of the Anacostia river. The Report and Recommendations of the Mayor's 28 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew Commission on Healthcare systems Transformation can be found here: https://dmhhs.dc.gov/node/1409786 . iv. Health Homes DHCF launched its first Health H omes program, called My DC Health Home (MDCHH), in January 2016. To be eligible for MDCHH, beneficiaries must have a serious mental illness (SMI ). In July 2017, DHCF launched its second Health Homes program, called My Health GPS (MHGPS), targeting benefic iaries with three or more chronic conditions. These programs provide critical case management and care coordination services to enrollee s in the primary care setting. Health Home providers coordinate very closely with community partners to address unmet ne eds of enrollee s. DHCF conducted an observational analysis on a cohort of participants pre - and post -enrollment in the MHGPS Program . The analysis illustrated promising results on preventable utilization , including: reduction in LANE ED visits as well as total ED cost , reduction in preventable inpatient admissions, and no growth in readmissions. Starting in 201 7, DHCF began reporting on the CMS Health Home Core Set of performance measures for MDCHH enrollee s and will continue to track their p rogress on key quality metrics to improve their health outcomes.10 DHCF began reporting on the CMS Health Home Core Set for MHGPS enrollee s in 201 8.11 B. Health Information Technology (HIT) i. DC's Information Systems and Medicaid Data Warehouse DHCF has created a unique , single source Medicaid D ata Warehouse (MDW) that ensures timely access to claims and encounter data. DHCF migrated ten years of claims history from its MMIS into an enterprise data warehouse and is now able to create all CMS required reports and ad -hoc reports. The modernized data infrastructure and analytical tools allow for evaluat ion of MCO performance across financial and utilization metrics . In conjunction with the ad option of the MDW, DHCF has incorporated numer ous analytics tools to augment the agency's reporting and analytics capabilities , to better serve the District Medicaid population. ii. Health Information Technology Initiatives DHCF's Health Care Reform and Innovation Administration (HCRIA) is charged with implementing the necessary Health Information Technology ( HIT) to support the 10 Measurement year 2016 and 2017 data on the CMS Health Home Core Set of performance for MDCHH have been reported to CMS. 11 Measurement year 2017 data on the CMS Healt h Home Core Set of performance for MHGPS was reported in 2018. 29 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew agency's quality improvement efforts across service delivery areas and programs. HCRIA is spearheading initiatives currently to develop multiple , sophisticated HIT tools, includi ng a n HIE platform through CRISP (the Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients ); eCQM aligned population health reporting tool ; a performance measurement tool that will be used by providers across programs, such as Health Homes, Nursing Facility Quality Improvement, and DHCF's FQHC P4P program . All these initiatives can help the MCOs enhance their quality improvement initiatives. For example, t he electronic clinical quality measures (eCQM ) tool creates the opportunity for MCOs to monitor performance measures using clinical data , thus creating a comprehensive picture of performance and holding providers accountable. In addition, the Community Resource Information Exchange Technical Solution (Co RIE) Development Grant will fund District partners (e.g., DC PACT (public/private community partnership) , DC P rimary Care Association ) to creat e a community resource inventory and referral system for capturing, reporting, measuring and sharing data on Soci al Determinants of Health. Finally, the SUD Demonstration Project Planning Grant will fund the District to design and build an infrastructure that enable s structured data collection and communication with District behavioral health providers, as well as the development and implementation of consent management tools to facilitate appropriate exchange of 42 CFR Part 2 data.12 V. Delivery System Reforms Behavioral Health S ystem Redesign The District of Columbia offers a broad array of behavioral health services, ranging from diagnosis and counseling to more intensive interventions for individuals with SMI , serious emotional disturbance (SED) or substance use disorder ( SUD ). However, key gaps in the Medicaid service array and complex and overlapping oversight have made it harder for the District to manage behavioral health services in a holistic way that is integrated with other medical treatment. Providers and services are overseen by DHCF, Medicaid MCOs, and the District's Department of Behavioral Health, with some overlap in authority. In addition, other District agencies provide ancillary behavioral health services and touchpoints including through the school system, fos ter care and child protective services, and justice system, among others. This division of responsibility has sometimes resulted in service gaps, confusion about points of entry, and a disconnect between beneficiaries' physical and behavioral health care. In addition, the disparate Medicaid coverage of institutions for mental disease ( IMD ) services between the managed care and FFS programs unfairly disadvantage FFS beneficiaries. 12 For more information on the Demonstration Project to Increase Substance Use Provider Capacity, please visit: https://dhcf.dc.gov/page/demonstration -project -increase -substance -use-provider -capacity 30 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew In 2019, DHCF expanded the behavioral health network to include FQHC s, free-standing mental health clinics, physician group s, and clinical group practices to treat substance abuse and mental health disorders under the direction of a physician. The qualified practitioners were expanded to nurse practitioners, physician assistan ts, and other allied health professionals under the direction of a physician. The dramatic increase in opioid -related fatalities in recent years has exacerbated and deepened these challenges and catalyzed the District's interest in seeking new authorities to ensure Medicaid can more effectively support residents' needs. DHCF received CMS approv al in November 2019 for a Section 1115 Medicaid Behavioral Health Transformation demonstration that seeks to strengthen the District's Medicaid behavioral health system through the addition of a broader array of services and providers designed to improve access to and transitions of care, including , coverage for short -term residential and inpatient services provided by IMDs for individuals with SMI and SUD , and complementary community -based services.13 To compliment the Behavioral Health Transformation Demonstration and the District of Columbia Opioid Response program activities , DHCF was awarded a $ 4.6 million CMS planning grant to assess the growth in Distri ct Medicaid provider capacity to diagnose SUD and provide treatment and recovery services.14 Medicaid Program Reform DHCF plans to move towards a fully managed Medicaid program by 2025 . This move aims to transform the managed care program into a more organized, accountable, and person -centered system that best supports the District's Medicaid beneficiaries in managing and improving their health. Initially, DHCF will transition nearly 22,000 individuals currently in the Medicaid FFS program to the Medi caid managed care program, effective October 1, 2020. Health care costs for individuals with FFS coverage are typically four -to-five times greater than persons in managed care as they tend to experience substantially higher rates of emergency room use, hospital admissions, and inpatient stays. Today, these beneficiaries must manage their health care needs without assistance or care coordination. By joining the managed care program, this population will receive access to much needed care coordination, and as a result, improved health outcomes. VI. Conclusion and Opportunities Managed Care Performance 13 For more information on the 1115 Waiver Initiative, please visit https://dhcf.dc.gov/1115 -waiver -initiative . 14 For more information on the Demonstration Project to Increase Substance Use Provider Capacity, please visit: https://dhcf.dc.gov/page/demonstration -project -increase -substance -use-provider -capacity 31 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew The care coordination challenges that plagued the District's three full -risk MCOs from 2014 through 2016 have been well documented - members' use of the emergency room for routine care, potentially avoidable hospital admissions and readmissions - and remain s tubborn challenges . However , DHCF is seeing some improvement. With CMS approval, DHCF implemented the MCO P4P program in 2017 , which is funded through a two -percent withhold of each MCO's actuarially sound capitation payments . DHCF used data from the per iod April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2016 to set the initial baseline . MCOs must meet minimum thresholds for improvement ( i.e., reduction in rates of avoidable emergency and inpatient utilization ) for all three performance measures in order to earn any port ion of the with hold. For the most recent annual data period for 2018, the MCOs have spent approximately $47 million on patient care that may have been avoided using more aggressive care coordination strategies. This is a notable reduction from the over $53 million spent in year one of the program , which equates to roughly $6 million in savings (this does not account for increases to outpatient costs with reductions i n emergency and inpatient utilization) . Most MCOs have exceeded the established targets for performance in quality initiatives, except for DHCF's newest MCO entering the District in late 2017 (see Figure 1 and 2 below ). Figure 1: MCO Performance on P4P Measures FY2017 (Year 1 of P4P Program) Figure 2: MCO Performance on P4P Measures FY201 8 (Year 2 of P4P Program) 32 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew Future Medicaid quality improvement activities will consider the behavioral health and physical health needs of the FFS populations as they begin to transition into the manage d care program over the next five years . These proposed changes, with the recent expansion of the District's HIE capabilities , should positiv ely impact health outcomes for all beneficiaries as their care will be less fragmented. Over the next few years, DHCF will work more closely with the MCOs to incorporate APMs into all provider contracts. Through the leadership of DQHO , DHCF will move towa rd achieving the triple aim in its managed care program by identif ying additional areas for improvement and promot ing best practices. The Medicaid system transformation will further augment t he goals outlined in this quality strategy as the District strive s to improve outcomes for all beneficiaries. 33 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew Appendix I: Selected Performance Measures This Appendix highlights the MCO -reported quality measures that are tied to the DHCF's 10 quality strategy objectives.

NCQA 36 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew Appendix II: Department of Health Care Finance Informational Bulletin Concerning Compliance Actions in the Managed Care Program. GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Department of Health Care Finance 441 4th Street Northwest, Suite 900 South Washington, DC 20001 ______________________________________________________________________________ Department of Health Care Finance Informational Bulletin DATE: November 13, 2019 FROM: Lisa Truitt Director, Healt h Care Delivery Management Administration SUBJECT: Compliance Actions in the Managed Care Program The purpose of this Informational Bulletin is to outline the hierarchy of actions the Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) may implement for non-compliance with and poor performance of contract requirements by a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO). This Informational Bulletin applies to all DHCF contracted Medicaid MCOs and the Child and Adolescent Supplemental Security Income Program (CAS SIP) Contractor, hereinafter referred to as MCO. The DHCF requires MCOs to take corrective action for occurrences of non -compliance or poor performance under the Medicaid managed care contract (Contract), including but not limited to instances where the DHCF determines the MCO's quality improvement efforts are inadequate or improved performance is necessary due to identified weaknesses within operations of the program. A variety of means will be utilized to assure compliance with the Contract, includi ng issuance of compliance actions to achieve resolution of all outstanding requirements. Any MCO found non -compliant of its Contract may be eligible for a range of compliance and/or enforcement actions, in accordance with the following procedures. Compli ance Continuum The DHCF may issue a compliance/enforcement action to an eligible MCO according to the following Compliance Continuum, in chronological order, as well as in order of increasing severity. Depending on the number of, severity of, or potentia l for harm to an enrollee and the MCO's instance(s) of non -compliance, DHCF may take initial action at any point on the following continuum: Compliance Actions 1. Notice of Non -Compliance (NONC) - Issued by the DHCF, a NONC represents a formal acknowledgement of the instance of non -compliance. NONCs are used to document small or isolated problems. 2. Warning Letter - Issued by the DHCF, a Warning Letter is issued either when an organization has already received a NONC, yet the problem persists, or as a first offense for larger or more concerning problems. Unlike NONCs, these letters contain warning language 37 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew about the potential consequences to the MCO, should the non -compliant performance continue. 3. Level 1 Corrective Action Plan (CAP) - The DHCF may request the MCO to submit a Level 1 CAP outlining how the MCO will resolve each identified occurrence of non - compliance with specific deadlines. When a Level 1 CAP is requested, the DHCF shall initiate Enhanced Monitoring of the MCO until the CAP is resolved to the satisfaction of the DHCF. 4. Level 2 CAP - Issued by the Office of Contracting and Procurement (OCP), a Level 2 CAP is reserved for persistent problems or very serious concerns that require in -depth and continued monitoring by the DHCF. A Level 2 CAP requires the MCO to submit a step -by- step plan of action to achieve targeted outcomes for resolution of identified occurrences of non-compliance. For all Level 2 CAPs, the DHCF shall initiate Enhanced Monitoring of the MCO until the CAP is reso lved to the satisfaction of the DHCF. MCOs are required to self - report all ongoing and closed Level 2 CAPs when applying to any new District procurement. Enforcement Actions 5. Intermediate Sanctions - MCOs are required to report all Intermediate Sanctions when applying for a new District procurement and may prohibit the ability of an MCO to participate in District procurements. Issued by the OCP, Intermediate Sanctions may include the following, as outlined in the MCO contracts: a. Civil money penalties; b. Appointment of temporary management for Contractor; c. Granting enrollees the right to terminate enrollment without cause and notifying the affected enrollees of their right to disenroll; d. Suspension of all new enrollment; e. Suspension o f payment for beneficiaries enrolled after the effective date of the sanction; and f. Additional sanctions under District law that address areas of noncompliance. Contract Actions 6. Termination - The DHCF, through the OCP, may ultimately terminate its contract with an MCO due to non -compliance and/or poor performance. Other Considerations The DHCF may choose to issue an action for each occurrence of non -compliance or include several occurrences of an MCO's non -compliance in a single action. A specific action will endure until: The MCO has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the DHCF, resolution of the occurrence(s) of non -compliance and implemented adequate measures to reasonably prevent future occurrences; OR The occurrence(s) of non -complia nce is (are) not resolved to the satisfaction of the DHCF, and DHCF escalates the issue to a higher step on the Compliance Continuum. 38 | P a g e Revised January 30, 2020 Submitted for CMS Revi ew The DHCF shall conduct a review of all compliance/enforcement actions issued to the MCO during the previous or current Contract period. At any time, DHCF may choose to publicly publish a compliance report of past performance by each contracted MCO.
