Challenges in evaluating post -licensure vaccine safety: observations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Expert Rev Vaccines . 2019 Oct;18(10):1091 -1101. -Summary -We discuss selected challenges for conducting pharmacovigilance and epidemiologic studies of AEs after vaccination in the United States using the post -licensure safety surveillance infrastructure of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The availability of specific post -licensure surveillance systems to monitor and study AEs after vaccination, such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the Vaccine Safety Datalink, and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project, each with its unique set of strengths and limitations, provide a harmonized and supportive approach to meet several of these barriers. -Available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580725 22Recent Publication McNeil MM, Paradowska -Stankiewicz I, Miller ER, Marquez PL, Seshadri S, Collins Jr LC, Cano MV. Adverse events following adenovirus type 4 and type 7 vaccine, live, oral in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), United States, October 2011July 2018 . Vaccine 2019 Sep 20. -Summary -In March 2011, FDA licensed adenovirus type 4 and type 7 vaccine, live, oral (Barr Labs, Inc.) for use in military personnel 17 through 50 years of age. We investigated reports in VAERS October 2011 through July 2018. During the analytic period, VAERS received 100 reports following adenovirus vaccination; 39 (39%) were classified as serious and one death was reported. The most frequently reported serious AEs were Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) (n = 12) and anaphylaxis (n = 8). Reports documented concurrent receipt of multiple other vaccines (95%) and penicillin G (IM Pen G) or other antibiotics. Conclusions: The reporting rate for serious AEs was higher than with other vaccines administered in the comparison military recruit population (39% vs 18%); however, we identified no unexpected or concerning pattern of adenovirus vaccine AEs. Co -administration of vaccines and IM Pen G may have contributed to the GBS and anaphylaxis outcomes. -Available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548014 Primary ovarian insufficiency and human papilloma virus vaccines: A review of the current evidence . Am J Obstet Gynecol . 2019 Aug 31. -Summary: Human papilloma virus is the primary causative agent for cervical cancer, and vaccination is the primary means of preventing anogenital cancers caused by human papilloma virus infection. Despite the availability for over a decade, coverage rates lag behind the other vaccines. Public concerns regarding safety of the vaccines have been identified as an important barrier to vaccination, including that the vaccine causes primary ovarian insufficiency. Health care providers should address concerns by acknowledging the case reports but noting the lack of association found in a recently published epidemiologic study of approximately 60,000 females. Current evidence is insufficient to suggest or support a causal relationship between human papilloma virus vaccination and primary ovarian insufficiency. -Available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31479634 Publication Grohskopf Walter EB, Fry AM, Jernigan DB. Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014United States, 2019 -20 Influenza Season. Recommendations and Reports. MMWR . August 23, 2019 / 68(3);1 -21. ( Influenza MMWR ) -Summary This report updates the 2018 -19 recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States (MMWR Recomm Rep 2018;67[No. RR -3]). Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months who do not have contraindications. A licensed, recommended, and age -appropriate vaccine should be used. Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) are expected to be available for the 2019 -20 season. Standard -dose, unadjuvanted, inactivated influenza vaccines will be available in High -dose (HD -IIV3) and adjuvanted (aIIV3) inactivated influenza vaccines will be available in trivalent formulations. Recombinant (RIV4) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) will be available in quadrivalent formulations. Recombinant (RIV4) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) will be available in quadrivalent formulations. - Available at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/rr/rr6803a1.htm 25Recent Publication Donahue JG, Kieke BA, King JP , Mascola MA, Shimabukuro TT, O, Glanz JM, RC, AL, Weintraub ES, Belongia EA.

Uptake and safety of hepatitis A vaccination during pregnancy: A Vaccine Safety Datalink study. Vaccine Volume 37, Issue 44, 16 October 2019, Pages 6648 -6655. -Conclusions: The rate of maternal HepA vaccination was low and rarely due to documented risk factors for vaccination. HepA vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk for a range of adverse events examined among pregnancies resulting in live births, but an identified association between maternal HepA and SGA infant outcomes, while likely due to unmeasured confounding, warrants further exploration. -Available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19312526 27For CDC 1-800-CDC-INFO (232 -4636) TTY: 1 -888-232-6348 www.cdc.gov The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Thank you 28Extra SlidesUpdates in ACIP Recommendations: 2020 Adult Immunization Schedule Hepatitis A vaccination -Living with HIV as an indication HPV vaccination -2 or 3 doses for men through age 26 depending on age at initial vaccination -Shared clinical decision -making for persons aged 27 -45 years MMR vaccination in HCW Pneumococcal vaccination -Shared clinical decision -making for immunocompetent persons aged 65 years Meningococcal B vaccination -Shared clinical decision -making for persons aged 19 -23 years Tdap vaccination -Tdap may be used any time Td is indicated Varicella vaccination -Indications for adults with HIV infection 30ACIP Update -Influenza Vaccines Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine -High Dose (QIV -HD) Phase 3 Safety and Immunogenicity Study* -Evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of QIV -HD compared to TIV -HD -The safety component to 893 TIV -HD recipients -Results While higher percentages for some solicited reactions were observed for QIV -HD, the overall reactogenicity profile was comparable to TIV -HD with similar rates of unsolicited events, AEs leading to study discontinuation, SAEs, fatal SAEs, and AEs of special interest.
