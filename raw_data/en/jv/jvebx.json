Select: Blueberries are susceptible to pesticide contamination that can be harmful to your baby's health. So, purchase the fruit from a trustworthy source, preferably the one that stocks organic produce. Choose the berries that have a deeper blue color and are firm but not hard to touch. Do not buy the fruits that are dull and watery. Also, they should be able to roll freely; if they do not, then they are not fresh. Store: Store the fruits in a freezer after sealing them in an airtight container. That way you will be able to store them for over two weeks without losing the freshness or flavor of the fruit. If you plan to consume them within a few days, then you can simply put the berries in a bowl, and cover it with cling film. The indigo-coloured pigment in the fruit's skin acts as a natural preservative. Wash the berries thoroughly before processing them.
