My primary focus for our work is with my emotional and mental energy. So, I took time with my SRI practices that Dr. Rose teaches & WOW. I went from feeling hopeless to powerful in just a few minutes. The SRI has been one of the greatest additions I've gained in my tool belt...\" ~Taraney V.

I feel parts of myself open up and integrate in a way I never thought possible. It's fueled a record year for me at my corporate job in enterprise software sales, my energy healing practice, and joy in everything I do. Love and gratitude for all of it. ~Rob A. "}
