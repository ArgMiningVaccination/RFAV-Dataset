Slowly and steadily, the nation is making every effort to win the war against Covid-19. Currently, statistics say that about 9 percent of India's population has received two doses and are fully vaccinated. The country has administered a total of 55.7 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses midway through August 2021. However, multiple data show that compared to men, fewer women have received their vaccine. Figures imply that vaccine hesitancy in women is higher than in men. This can become detrimental in our battle against Covid-19. Approximately 65% of India's inhabitants live in rural areas where myths around the vaccines' efficacy are widely prevalent. There is plenty of misinformation floating around about the side effects of vaccination in women. At present, our only weapon to fight Covid-19 is immunisation, and therefore, every individual must prioritise their vaccine shots. Healthcare practitioners and epidemiologists have already warned against the perils of an the non-vaccinated population. Post the brutal and crippling second wave, we must ensure that this episode doesn't repeat. Hence, increasing awareness and debunking myths about vaccination among women is a must. 1. A common misconception is that the vaccine makes a woman infertile. This false. There is evidence that shows women have become pregnant post- vaccination. 2. Some say women should avoid getting jabbed while menstruating as it will disrupt the cycle. Many also fear that the vaccine will cause death or that Covid-19 won't harm them. People in urban areas have also let such myths influence their minds, but it is more widespread in villages. It is crucial to understand that there is absolutely no basis for such information. People must not get influenced by rumours, as vaccines are pivotal to save lives. A vaccine is a critical biological preparation to battle against a particular infectious disease that encompasses an immune system improvement. Moreover, it is essential to note that pregnant women with underlying health conditions such as high blood pressure and obesity, are more likely to contract Covid-19. Hence, they must get vaccinated to stay protected. There are no known hazards for vaccines in breastfeeding women either. In the case of a vaccinated lactating woman, the mother's antibodies may go through the breast milk to the baby and only serve as protection. Thus, not getting immunised against Covid-19 increases health risks and is not the other way around. Select Topics of your interest and let us customize your feed. The side effects of getting vaccinated are minor and can be felt by any individual. One may experience fever, fatigue, headache, dehydration, muscle pain at the injection site, etc. These side effects are common in all. When we are looking at India, we cannot wholly ignore societal conditioning. Women here in conservative households are taught from a young age to care for their families first. Often, they are not in charge of making their own decisions. If the man of the family advises against vaccination, thinking it may affect their fertility; the woman will follow what he decides. This is not the case for every woman, but a percentage of women in India deal with such scenarios. Access to vaccination is another problem. For underprivileged women, accessing the portal also becomes a task. Despite free vaccines available at government health centres, slots aren't always available. With all these challenges in the backdrop, the only way to spread awareness and reduce vaccine hesitancy is a behavioural and mindset change.
