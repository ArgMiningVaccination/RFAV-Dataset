The Office of Faith-based Outreach at the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) works to inform, educate, and empower communities of faith to take an active role in their health. Through places of worship, Strike Teams ensure that hard-toreach populations, such as racial/ethnic minorities, people living with disabilities, marginalized rural communities, and elderly populations among others are included in COVID-19 outreach. Strike Teams target areas that have low vaccination rates and work alongside pastors and faith leaders to build and foster faith community relationships, address vaccine hesitancy, promote education, and encourage vaccination participation. To ensure statewide support, Strike Teams are assigned to a geographical area and are comprised of individuals with complementary skill sets that are highlighted below. If your place of worship is interested in hosting a vaccination clinic, please contact the Office of Faith-based Outreach at 501-280-4545.
