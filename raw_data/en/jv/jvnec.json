This review book is designed to help you study effectively and efficiently for the adult-gerontology nurse practitioner certification exams of both the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) and the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners Certification Board (AANPCB). The contents and procedures in this book are designed for review purposes only. They are not intended for use in clinical practice. The goal for this nurse practitioner (NP) certification review book is to provide you, the student and/or NP test-taker, with a tool to effectively and rapidly review for both the ANCC and the AANPCB certification exams. This book is also a good resource for current adult-gerontology NP students. Many students credit this book with helping them pass not only their certification exam, but also quizzes and tests when they were students. Students report that the review book has helped them successfully pass their school's dreaded \"exit\" exam. In this edition, new disease topics, tables, and updated clinical content relate to the latest exam questions. There are new photographs of dermatological diseases and other conditions. The text now includes three new chapters: (a) Gerontology and Long-Term Care, (b) Culture and Spiritually Related Health Beliefs, and (c) Evidence-Based Medicine and Epidemiology. These new chapters will help those who are taking the ANCC and the AANPCB exam. In addition, there is an increase in the total number of practice questions and answers, which include rationales. New-format questions are included, and the question dissection section has been expanded. The book's format remains the same as in the popular and best-selling first two editions, which were also published by Springer Publishing Company. The book is styled as a \"mega-review\" study guide because it combines six different resources in one: (a) certification exam information that is highly specific for both the ANCC and AANPCB exams, (b) test-taking techniques, (c) a question dissection and analysis section that breaks down questions for further study, (d) a review of primary care diseases and conditions, (e) a review of pertinent normal physical exam findings, and finally (f) questions with rationales to practice your new skills. This book and my Family Nurse Practitioner Certification Intensive Review have become the most successful and sought-after review books to use in studying for both the ANCC and the AANPCB certification exams. If you have any comments or suggestions for this book or want me to teach a review course at your school, please contact me at npreviews@gmail.com . If you want to attend one of my webinars or live-review courses, please visit my website at www.npreview.com . I will post updates and new treatment guidelines on my website at www.npreview.com . Maria T. Codina Leik 12xiv xv Acknowledgments The role of the nurse practitioner can be difficult, but it is also a rewarding one. As NPs, we can touch so many lives. When we care for our patients, we are combining nursing with medicine. I think as NPs, we have the best of both worlds. But before we can practice, we must first pass the NP certification exam. So, as usual, this book is dedicated to all my review course students, past and present, who worked so hard to pass the certification exam. To my editor, Margaret Zuccarini, thank you for your infinite patience. I want to extend my gratitude to Springer Publishing Company, New York, and their staff who helped make this book a reality. Extra kudos to Donna Frassetto, Martha Cushman, and Lindsay Claire. Thank you, Angelica Rundell, for your support of our review course students. Last, but not least, I want to extend my deep gratitude to my dear parents, Ricardo G. Codina and Thelma Y. Codina. 13Share Adult-Gerontology Nurse Practitioner Certification Intensive Review: Fast Facts and Practice Questions, Third Edition 1497 2 1 Exam and Health Screening Overview I 153 1 Certification Exam Information AMERICAN NURSES CREDENTIALING CENTER aprnvalidation@ana.org American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) is the independent credentialing body of the American Nurses Association (ANA). It is the largest nurse credentialing organization in the United States. The current edition of the ANCC Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) exam was released on February 9, 2016, and the Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner (AGPCNP) exam was released on December 23, 2015. The ANCC currently offers certification exams for the following nurse practitioner (NP) specialties: family NP (FNP-BC), adult-gerontology primary care NP (AGPCNP- BC), adult-gerontology acute care NP (AGACNP-BC), pediatric primary care NP (PPCNP-BC), and psychiatric-mental health NP (PMHNP-BC). It retired the adult NP and gerontologic NP exams in 2015. You must first establish an online account at the ANCC website before you can apply for the any of the exams. You can use the mobile app \"MYANCC\" to apply or renew your certification and keep track of your continuing- education (CE) hours in the mobile app. Prometric Computer Testing Centers ANCC Exams Prometric Test Centers www.prometric.com/ANCC Toll-Free Phone: (800) 350-7076 Conditions (Special Accommodations): (800) 967-1139 164 The ANCC uses Prometric Testing Centers to administer its exams. Before you can schedule an appointment, you must have your candidate eligibility number; this is provided in the Authorization to Test Notice letter sent to qualified candidates who meet eligibility requirements and have completed their application documentation. You can schedule, reschedule, cancel, and/or confirm an appointment at the website portal or by telephone. Prometric has 8,000 test centers in 160 countries, including the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, Venezuela, and the United Kingdom. There are also test centers in Africa, Asia, and Europe. International Testing for Military Personnel Military nurses who want to take the exam outside of the United States are allowed to take their exams at one of Prometric's \"global\" testing centers. Qualifications One must be a graduate of an approved master's, postgraduate, or doctoral degree program with a specialization in family NP (plus the required minimum of 500 faculty-supervised clinical practice hours) from an institution of higher learning. The program must be accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) or the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (formerly known as the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission). In addition, the candidate must possess an active RN license in any state or territory of the United States. The ANCC will, on an individual basis, accept the professional legally recognized equivalent (of NP status) from another country if the applicant meets its certification criteria. If he or she is educated and/or licensed outside the United States, there are additional requirements. AMERICAN ACADEMY OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS CERTIFICATION BOARD www.aanpcert.org transcripts@aanpcert.org (via secure electronic transmission from registrar's office) The American Academy of Nurse Practitioners Certification Board (AANPCB) is an independent organization that is affiliated with the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) and the American Academy of Emergency Nurse Practitioners (AAENP). The AANPCB is currently offering three specialty exams: Family NP (FNP-C), Adult- Gerontology Primary Care NP (AGNP-C), and the Emergency NP (ENP-C) specialty exam. The current FNP and AGNP exams were both released in October 2016. Their Adult NP exam was retired in December 2015 and the Gerontologic NP exam was retired 175 in December 2012. You must first establish an online account at their website before you can apply for the exam. Applicants enrolled in an MSN or post-master's certificate program may begin the application process 6 months before completion of the program. If you are enrolled in a DNP program, you can begin the application process as early as 1 year prior to completion of the program. But you must complete all the NP program didactic courses and supervised clinical practice hour requirements before you can sit for the exam. In addition, an official transcript showing the DNP degree awarded and conferral date is required to release your exam score. The certification start date will be the date the score is released (not the date the examination was taken). PSI Computer Testing Centers AANPCB Exams PSI Services LLC (PSI) Fax: (702) 932-2666 The AANPCB's exams are administered by PSI Services LLC, which has more than 300 locations across the United States and Canada. Locations are listed on the PSI scheduling portal. Approved qualified candidates who have completed their applications (final transcripts included) are sent an authorization to test by email from the AANPCB. About 1 day after you receive the AANPCB email, PSI Services will send you your PSI Eligibility ID number from support@psionline.com providing a link to their online scheduling system (to schedule/reschedule/cancel/confirm). You can also register by phone (800-733-9276). Important information about applying for the AANC and AANPCB exams is given in Table 1.1 . Table 1.1 Application Timeline for Certification Exams Timeline Recommended Activities Before Graduation About 3 to 4 months before graduation Open an account on the ANCC and/or the AANPCB website and start the application process. Find out about the certification requirements. Download and read the General Testing Booklet, Test Content Outline, and the Reference List. Visit your SBON website and read the licensure requirements for NPs in your state. Download the licensure application. About 4 to 6 weeks before graduation Order three to four copies of your official final transcript. About 2 to 3 weeks before graduation The NP director of your program needs to sign the ANCC Education Validation Form.

The AANPCB is now releasing a new edition of their exam annually. There is more than one version of each exam\u2014each ANCC exam edition has several versions, but the AANPCB exam only has two. If you have failed the exam and retake it, you will get a different version of the exam. The version of the exam that you are taking is assigned by the testing center computer system. What this means is that you may be taking a different version of the exam than your classmate even though both of you are taking the same edition of the exam on the same date and time at the same testing center. Exam Format New question formats for the ANCC and AANPCB exams were introduced beginning with the 2016 exams. There are more new-format questions on the ANCC exam than on the AANPCB exam. The new formats on the ANCC exam include \"drag and drop,\" multiple-choice question with five or six answer options (you are asked to pick two or three correct answers), \"hot spot\" (a picture is presented that is divided into four quadrants and you click on the correct quadrant as the answer), colored photographs of skin and eye conditions, EKG strips, and chest x-ray films. These new formats are discussed in Chapter 2 . Most questions on the ANCC exam are still multiple choice with four answer options. Similarly, most AANPCB exam questions are the classic multiple-choice format with four answer options. There may be one EKG strip, a chest x-ray film, as well as some multiple-choice questions with five to six answer options (you are asked to pick two to three answers). The exams are computer-based tests (CBTs) unlike the NCLEX-RN \u00ae exam, which is a computer-adaptive test. The NP exams do not shut down automatically after you have earned enough points, as occurs with the NCLEX-RN exam. Test Content Outline and Reference List Both the ANCC and the AANPCB provide Test Content Outlines (TCOs) and a Reference List on their website. It is important that you read these documents. Read each carefully and concentrate your studies on the designated topic areas. Total Number of Questions and Time ANCC: FNP Exam (released February 2016) ANCC: AGPCNP Exam (released December 2015) There are 200 total questions (only 175 questions are graded). There are 25 questions that are not graded (for statistical data). Total Time: Total counted testing time is 4 hours. AANPCB : FNP Exam (released February 2018) AANPCB: AGNP Exam (released February 2018) There are 150 total questions (only 135 questions are graded). There are 15 questions 197 that are not graded. Total Time: Total counted testing time is 3 hours. Computer Tutorial For both exams, each testing session starts with a computer tutorial session of 10 to 15 minutes. This time is not counted as part of the testing time (it is \"free\" time). When the tutorial time expires, the computer will automatically start the exam and the first question will appear on the screen. The countdown clock (upper corner of the screen) will start counting down the time. The countdown clock will not stop for \"breaks,\" but if you need a break, inform a testing center staff member who is monitoring the testing area. Watch the time clock closely because when the allotted testing time expires, the computer will automatically shut down the exam. Time Allotted per Question For both the ANCC and AANPCB certification exams, each question is allotted about 60 seconds. If you find yourself spending too much time on one question, pick an answer (best guess), then \"mark\" it so that you can return to it later. Never leave any question unanswered. If you guess correctly, it will get counted; if you leave it blank, it is marked as an error (0 points). Sample Exam Questions I highly recommend that you try the free sample exams at the ANCC's website even if you are planning to only take the AANPCB exam. The ANCC's sample exam is web-based and contains 25 questions. It can be taken as many times as desired at no charge (and it is scored every time). The AANPCB also has free questions, which are listed on the last two pages of their candidate handbook (no answer key is provided). If you want to familiarize yourself with the format of the AANPCB exam, you can purchase their 75-item Practice Examination (timed 90 minutes), which is taken online and graded. It can only be taken once. The ANCC also sells sample exam questions, but their free web-based sample exams provide a good opportunity to practice using their exam formats. If you are an FNP, you can take the free sample exams for the FNP, AGPCNP, and PNP. You will have a total of 75 questions from these three exams. COMPARING THE ANCC VERSUS THE AANPCB EXAM 1. What are the passing rates for the two exams? For the exams released in 2016, the passing rates for the ANCC and AANPCB exams are as follows: FNP exam : 82% for the ANCC versus 80% for the AANPCB, or a difference of just 2%. 208 AGPCNP/AGNP exam : 82% for the ANCC versus 76% for the AANPCB\u2014a 6% difference, which is significant. 2. What is the major difference between the two exams? There are two major differences between the two exams. First, the ANCC exam contains more nonclinical questions than the AANPCB exam. Second, new question formats, such as drag and drop, photographs, EKG strip, chest x-ray film, and multiple-choice questions with five to six answer options, were added beginning with the 2016 ANCC exams. The vast majority of questions on the AANPCB exam are on clinical topics. Most of the questions are the classic multiple-choice format with four answer options, but there may be some multiple-choice questions that have five to six answer options (you are asked to pick two or three answers), an EKG strip, and a chest x-ray film. 3. Are there apps from the Apple Store and the Google Play Store? AANC : The ANCC has an app that can be used to apply for the exam. AANPCB : The AANPCB does not have an app currently, but it may have one in the near future. 4. What are the new commands in the ANCC Prometric exams? You can now \"highlight\" words (keywords) to help you concentrate on the best clues (that you picked). You can also use the \"strikeout\" command, which allows you to cross out (eliminate) the answer option(s) that you think is(are) wrong (distractors). These two new commands are not yet available for the PSI AANPCB exam. 5. If I join their respective membership organizations, will I receive a discount on my fees? ANCC : To be eligible, you need to be a member of the ANA. If you belong to a state nursing association, you may already be a member of the ANA. Check with your state's nursing association. To apply for membership, apply online at the ANA's website ( www.nursingworld.org ). A word of warning: If you are not a member, you only have 5 business days after you apply for the exam to claim the membership discount. Exam discount claims received after this time are not allowed, and \"refunds will not be issued.\" AANPCB : To be eligible for the exam discount, you must be a member of the AANP ( www.aanp.org ). If you already applied for the exam as a nonmember, you have up to 30 days to apply for membership. To receive the membership discount (as a refund), you need to send an email to inform them that you are a member ( certification@aanpcert.org ). 6. How do I apply for the ANCC or the AANPCB certification exam? For both agencies, you must initially open an online account at their website. To avoid loss of information, it is best to complete your online application within 30 days once it is started. The application forms are in typeable PDF so you can fill them in directly on your computer and then print a hardcopy for your records. ANCC : The ANCC accepts applications online, by mail, expedited method (fax/email), and by their new mobile app \"MYANCC\" (Apple Store/Google Play). AANPCB : The AANPCB accepts applications online and by mail. Applying online does not expedite processing. The organization automatically charges a nonrefundable paper application processing fee for all paper applications (email, mail, and fax). There is no charge for processing of supporting documents for certification 21and recertification (e.g., unofficial transcripts, RN license). If you apply by mail, do not forget to photocopy the entire contents of your application package. If you plan on using the U.S. Postal Service to mail your package, I would recommend that you pay the extra fee for registered mail. 7. How early can I apply for the certification exam? Both the ANCC and AANPCB allow students to apply as early as 6 months before graduation. ANCC : The ANCC will not process an application until payment has cleared. A completed application must contain copy of your RN license, an official copy of your final transcripts, and the original copy of the Validation of Education form, signed by your NP program director. AANPCB : The AANPCB allows DNP students to apply up to 12 months before graduation, but it will not release the exam scores until the MSN or DNP degrees are issued. If you apply before you graduate, you are required to submit an official copy of your current transcript (the interim transcript). The interim transcript is your most recent transcript, which contains all the course work that you have completed up to that date. When the official final transcript is released, either you or the registrar's office of your school can mail or email it directly to the AANPCB. In addition, the AANPCB requires a hard copy of your RN license. Do not forget to download the State Board of Nursing Notification Form from the board's website so that it can release your exam scores to your state board of nursing (SBON). 8. How long does it take to process a completed application? ANCC: It takes about 4 to 6 weeks to process an application. Be warned that the ANCC will not process an application until it is complete and all required documents have been received (copy of RN license, original of the signed education validation form, final transcript). If there are problems with your application, an email will be sent to you. Answer all the questions on the forms, and do not leave any blanks. AANPCB: It generally takes between 4 to 6 weeks after you have paid the fees and submitted all the required documentation to process an application. Fill out all the questions, and do not leave any blanks or forget signatures. An error can delay your application significantly. 9. What is the ANCC's \"expedited application\" process? This option shortens the processing time to 5 business days ($200 nonrefundable fee). Download and print the Certification Expedite Review Request Form from the ANCC website and fax it to (301) 628-5233. If your school has not released your final transcript, it will delay the expedited application. The Validation of Advanced Practice Nursing Education form can be signed by electronic signature (give your NP director's email address) and an electronic copy of your final transcript can be emailed directly by secure transmission from your school's registrar ( aprnvalidation@ana.org ). Follow up by calling to verify that the ANCC has received your faxed application. Note : Mailing the ANCC \"expedite\" form will delay processing; it should be faxed. If you both fax and mail it, you will be charged the processing fee twice. The AANPCB does not expedite applications. 10. What are the final transcript and the \"official\" transcript? The final transcript is the one that is issued after you graduate from your NP program. It should indicate the type of degree you earned along with the NP specialty you 229 graduated with (e.g., family or adult-gerontology NP). A transcript is considered \"official\" only if it remains inside the sealed envelope in which it was mailed from your college registrar's office or if it is mailed directly from their office to the certifying agency. An electronic copy of your transcript can be transmitted directly by secure transmission from the registrars' office ( aprnvalidation@ana.org ). Order at least three to four copies of your final transcripts and keep the extras unopened to keep them official. Open one copy (yours) and check it for accuracy. 11. What is the ANCC Validation of Education form? This one-page form is a requirement for ANCC applicants only. Most NP programs have this document signed in bulk by the current director of the NP program. Ideally, it should be distributed to the students before the final day of school. You must send the original signed form (not a copy) to the ANCC with your application. Note: It is probably a good idea for all NP students to get this document signed, even if they plan to take only the AANPCB exam. Because the ANCC requires this form, it will save you precious time in the future if you decide to apply for their exam. You always have the option of applying quickly for the \"other\" certification exam if you fail the first. Do not forget that you will need another official final transcript (another good reason why you should have at least four copies of your transcript). 12. Is it possible to take the exam at any time of the year? You can take both certification exams at any time of the year, whenever the Prometric and the PSI testing centers are open. 13. When should I schedule my exam? Do not wait until the last minute to schedule your exam because the testing centers in your area may no longer have the date (or the time) that you desire. Morning time slots tend to get filled very quickly. Both Prometric and PSI testing centers allow test- takers to schedule, reschedule, or cancel an appointment on their website or by phone, but you should give them notice. Prometric (ANCC) : Processing fee is charged if less than 30-day notice is given and up to noon on the fifth business day of the appointment (Eastern Standard Time). PSI (AANPCB) : Requires a minimum of at least 2 days in advance to reschedule or cancel an exam (before 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time). Note : Avoid scheduling yourself at the time of the day when you tend to get tired or sleepy. For most, this is usually after lunchtime. Simply picking the wrong time of day can cause you to fail the exam, sometimes by as little as 2 points. 14. What should I do if the time slot or date that I want is no longer available? Look for another testing center as soon as possible. For some, it may mean a long drive to another city, but it may well be worth the extra time and effort if your authorization-to-test letter is about to expire. 15. What happens if I am late or miss my scheduled appointment? Table 1.2 presents important information about the AANPCB exams. If you are late or miss your appointment, you are considered a \"no show\" by the testing center staff. Your testing time period or \"window\" will automatically expire on that same day. Call the certifying agency as soon as possible for further instructions. Both the ANCC and the AANPCB will allow you to reschedule your exam (one time only), and you will be charged a rescheduling fee. 2310 16. If I have a disability, how can I obtain special testing accommodations? You can download the Special Accommodations Form from each organization's website (ANCC and AANPCB). It requires a description of the disability and limitations related to testing. It should be dated and signed by the provider. For example, if a student has severe test-taking anxiety, a special accommodation (if approved) is an extension of the testing time. Check the agency's website for further instructions.

COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NURSE PRACTITIONER CERTIFICATION EXAMS 1. What are the passing scores? ANCC : The passing score is 350 points or higher. ANCC scores range from 100 to 500 points. AANPCB : The passing score is 500 points or higher. AANPCB scores range from 200 to 800 points. 2. Will I find out immediately if I pass (or fail) the exam? Yes, you will. After you exit the testing area, ask the proctor to print a copy of your results (pass or fail format). This is the \"unofficial\" score. If you pass the exam, you will not get a number score. According to the AANPCB, a preliminary \"pass\" score at the testing center is not considered official notification. It does not indicate active certification status, and it may not be used for employment or licensure as an NP. A letter with your official score will be mailed to you at a later date, indicating the type of certification and the starting date. If you fail the exam, you will receive a scaled number score with diagnostic feedback information for each domain such as: Low : Your score from this content area is below the acceptable level. Medium : Your score from this content area is marginally acceptable. High : Your score from this content area is above average. Concentrate your studies on the domain/category(s) in which you score \"low\" or \"medium.\" 3. How many times a year can I retake the FNP and AGNP certification exam? ANCC : You can take this exam up to three times in a 12-month calendar period. You must wait at least 60 days between each exam. If you fail, you can reapply online 2411 (retest application), but wait about 5 days (after taking your exam) before you reapply online. AANPCB : You can take the exam up to two times per calendar year. Although there is no wait-time requirement prior to retesting, the AANPCB requires test-takers to take 15 contact hours in their area(s) with the weakest score (your \"areas of weakness\"). Reapply for the exam online by using the Retake Application form. Note : The continuing-education hours that you took before sitting for the certification exam are not eligible. The contact hours must be taken after you failed the exam. If you took a review course, it can be retaken again with the new dates. When you have completed the required 15 contact hours, email or fax the certificate of completion as proof. Call the AANPCB certification office first before faxing any documents. 4. What happens if I fail the ANCC or AANPCB exam the second time? You must resubmit a full application along with all the required documentation (like the first time) and pay the full test fee. 5. What happens if my Authorization-to-Test letter expires and I have not taken the exam? Call the certifying agency for further instructions immediately. Both the ANCC and the AANPCB will allow you to reschedule your exam (one time only). You must pay a rescheduling fee. If you fail to test on your extended testing window, you must reapply like a new applicant and pay the full registration fee again. 6. Is it possible to extend the testing window? ANCC : You can request (one time only) a new 90-day testing window. It must occur less than 6 months from the last day of the initial testing window. Your request for extension to the ANCC should be received before the initial 90-day testing period expires. AANPCB : You can request an extension (one time only) by sending an email to certification@aanpcert.org . If an extension is granted, it will be for 60 days only. If you do not retake the exam during that time, you must reapply to take the examination (like the first time) and pay the full fee. 7. Is there a penalty for guessing on the exam? No, there is no penalty for guessing. Therefore, if you are running out of time, answer the remaining questions at random. Do not leave any questions \"blank\" or without an answer, because this will be marked as an error (0 points). You may earn a few extra points if you guess correctly, which can make the difference between passing and failing the exam. 8. Is it possible to return to a question later and change its answer? Yes, it is, but only if you \"mark\" the question. You will learn about this simple command during the computer tutorial time at the beginning of the exam. \"Marking\" a question allows the test-taker to return to the question at a later time (if you want to change or review your answer). On the other hand, if you indicate to the computer that your answer is \"final,\" then you will not be allowed to change the answer. Do not worry about forgetting to \"unmark\" the questions if you run out of time. As long as a question has an answer, it will be graded by the computer. 9. Does the certifying agency inform the SBON of my certification status? The AANPCB and the ANCC will not automatically send your scores to your SBON. 2512 For both certifying agencies, you must sign their Release of Scores consent form, which is one of the documents required when you apply for the exam. 10. How can I obtain an \"official\" verification of my national certification for my employer? Both agencies have verification request forms on their websites. If you just took the exam, the AANPCB recommends you wait at least 10 days after your testing date. A nominal fee is charged. 11. I am getting married (or divorced). Is there a problem with changing my legal name after I applied for the exams using my maiden or married name? Yes, there may be a problem. The name that you use in your application must be the same name as the one listed on your primary identification such as your unexpired driver's license, passport, or military ID. Check the agency's website or call for more details. If you get married after you applied for the exam, it is better to wait before changing the name on your driver's license until you have taken and passed the exam. CERTIFICATION RENEWAL 1. How long is my certification valid? Certification from the ANCC as well as the AANPCB is valid for 5 years. A few months before your certification expires, both the ANCC and the AANPCB will send you a reminder letter. \"Failure of the certificant to receive (his or her) renewal notice does not relieve the certificant of his or her professional responsibility for renewing their certification.\" 2. Can I still use my professional designations after my certification expires because I forgot to renew it? No, the ANCC states that credentials cannot be used, once they have expired. 3. What should I do if I change my legal name, have a new email address, new telephone contact number, or move to a new address? You need to update your online account at the ANCC or at the AANPCB website within 30 days if there are any changes in your contact information, such as your legal name, residence address, email, or phone number. 4. Is there a time period that must be followed to renew certification? Yes, there is. All of the contact hours and practice hours must be completed within the current 5-year certification period. 5. When should I submit my renewal application? The process can be started as early as 12 months before your certification expires. It is best to start early because if you do not have enough continuing- education/clinical/pharmacology contact hours, you still have enough time to obtain them. Recertification applications should be submitted no later than 12 weeks prior to the expiration date of the current certification to allow time for reviewing, processing, and issuing the new certificate before the expiration of the current certification. Note : Save a digital or hard copy (or other proof) of all your continuing-education hours and clinical practice hours. If you are audited, you will be asked to submit proof of your continuing-education hours (e.g., certificates) and clinical practice hours. 6. How many clinical hours of practice are required to renew my certification every 5 2613 years? The ANCC no longer requires clinical practice hours for recertification, although the AANPCB does require 1,000 hours of clinical practice in your area of specialty (completed in the previous 5 years before recertification), plus 100 hours CE, of which 25 hours must be pharmacology CE. If you plan to use your clinical volunteer hours as an NP, keep a notebook to record each clinical site's address, the number of hours that you practiced, and the name/signature of the supervising NP/physician. If you do not have enough clinical hours, another method you can use to recertify is to retake the examination combined with the required continuing-education hours. For ANPs and GNPs, you do not have the option to recertify by retaking the examination because the exams for your specialty have been retired. 7. How many continuing-education contact hours are required for recertification? ANCC : 75 contact hours of continuing education are required. You also need one or more of the eight ANCC renewal categories (e.g., academic credits, presentations, preceptor hours, quality improvement project, professional service, practice hours, retake exam, publication or research). AANPCB : 100 contact hours of continuing education are required. 8. How many pharmacotherapeutic contact hours are required per renewal cycle? ANCC : Of the 75 contact hours, 25 of those hours must be in pharmacotherapeutics. If you double the 75 (150 contact hours), only 25 contact hours are required. AANPCB : Of 100 contact hours, 25 contact hours of advanced pharmacology are required. 9. What happens if my certification lapsed (I forgot to renew it)? There is no \"grace period\" or backdating. On the day when your certification expires, you are prohibited from using your designation after your name. In addition, you will have a gap in your certification dates. The ANCC recommends that you check with your state licensing board to determine whether you can continue to practice as an NP. They also recommend that you check with your employer and with the agencies that are reimbursing your services. 10. If my specialty certification exam was retired (ANP, GNP), can I continue with my specialty designation? Yes, you may. You can renew your certification through continuing education and clinical hours. If you let your certification lapse, you no longer have the examination option. Unless there are other options in the future (check the websites for updates), only students who have graduated from an AGNP program are permitted to take that exam. ANPs and GNPs are not allowed to take the AGNP exam. 11. Is there any reciprocity between the ANCC and the AANPCB? No, there is not. Both the ANCC and the AANPCB discontinued their reciprocity program many years ago. EXAM QUESTION CLASSIFICATION American Nurses Credentialing Center AGPCNP and FNP Certification Exams 2714 Both the FNP and the AGPCNP exams have a total of 200 questions, but only 175 of the questions will be graded. The AGPCNP exam contains more nonclinical topics than the FNP exam. On the AGPCNP exam, the Professional Roles domain comprises 29% of questions, but on the FNP exam, the same domain comprises only 17% (see Table 1.3 ). For both exams, the true percentage of clinical questions is actually higher because many nonclinical topics are mixed into the two clinical domains (Foundations of Advanced Practice Nursing and Independent Practice. The nonclinical topics inserted under these two predominantly clinical domains include advocacy, theory, community needs assessment, research methodology, critiquing research findings, and ethical issues, among others. On the FNP exam, approximately 33% of the questions are likely to cover nonclinical topics (about 58 questions; see Table 1.4 for more information.) On the AGPCNP exam, about 20% of the questions (about 35 questions) are likely to cover nonclinical topics. The ANCC, unlike the AANPCB, does not release age-group statistics. Table 1.3 ANCC AGPCNP Exam Domains AGPCNP Exam (released December 2015) % Number of Questions Foundations of Advanced Practice Nursing 29 51 Professional Roles 29 51 Independent Practice 42 73 TOTAL 100 175 graded questions AGPCNP, Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner; ANCC, American Nurses Credentialing Center. Adapted from the ANCC Adult-Gerontology Primary Care NP Certification Exam Test Content Outline (2016).

Summary 1. There are only three domains in the ANCC FNP and AGPCNP certification exams. 2. Almost all the questions on the AANPCB exam have to do with clinical topics. 3. For the FNP exam, about one out of four questions cover nonclinical topics 4. For the AGPCNP exam, about one out of three questions cover nonclinical topics. 5. Test-takers who score low in two of the three domains will fail the exam. American Academy of Nurse Practitioners Certification Board AGNP and FNP Certification Exams The AANPCB FNP and AGNP exams were both released in October 2016. The exams 28have a total of 150 questions, but only 135 of these are graded. The AANPCB releases the domain as well as the age breakdown of their exams. There are four domains in the AANPCB exams. The largest domain is Assessment (36%), followed by Diagnosis (24%), Plan (23%), and Evaluation (17%). Percentage breakdown by age group of the AANPCB's FNP exam questions is detailed in Table 1.5 . The percentage for the AGNP exam is detailed in Table 1.6 . There is a big difference between the FNP and AGNP exams regarding the percentage of questions on adolescents: On the FNP exam, 18% (24 questions) focus on adolescents, but in the AGNP exam, it is only 7% (nine questions). Table 1.5 Age Groups by Percentage (FNP Exam) Age Group % Number of Questions Adults (21-64 years) 37 50 Geriatrics 21 29 Frail Elderly 7 9 Early/Late Adolescence (12-20 years) 18 24 Pediatrics (birth-11 years) 14 19 Prenatal (pregnancy) 3 4 TOTAL 100 135 graded questions FNP, family nurse practitioner. Source: AANPCB Family Nurse Practitioner and Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Candidate Handbook (2017). Table 1.6 Age Groups by Percentage (AGNP Exam) Age Group % Number of Questions Adults (21-64 years) 43 58 Geriatrics 38 51 Frail Elderly 17 23 Early/Late Adolescence (12-20 years) 2 3 TOTAL 100 135 graded questions AGNP, adult-gerontology nurse practitioner. Summary 1. On the AANPCB FNP exam, the age group with the largest number of questions is adults (50 questions). The next largest group is geriatrics (29 questions). 2. When these two age groups are combined (age 21 years and older), they make up about 66% of questions (88 questions) in the FNP exam. Therefore, at least one out of two questions will relate to a patient who is 21 years of age or older. 3. There will be very few questions on the prenatal period and obstetrics (four questions). Keep this in mind when you are reviewing, and do not spend too much time on this content. 4. On the AANPCB AGNP exam, the age group with the least number of questions is adolescents (nine questions). 5. On the AANPCB AGNP exam, the questions are centered mostly on adult and 2915 geriatric age groups (126 questions). 6. As is usual for the AANPCB exams, almost all the questions are clinically based. FAST FACTS: ANCC AND AABPCB EXAMS 1. The current ANCC AGPCNP exam (2016) probably has about 33% nonclinical questions\u2014about one out of three questions. 2. The ANCC FNP exam probably has about 20% nonclinical questions or about one out of four questions. 3. The current AANPCB FNP and AGNP exams contain very few nonclinical questions. 4. The ANCC and AANPCB NP certification tests are designed for entry-level (not expert-level) practice. Most test-takers who sit for the NP certification exams are new graduates. 5. There are 25 pilot-test questions on the ANCC exam and 15 pilot-test questions on the AANPCB exam. These questions are not graded. There is no way to identify the pilot test questions from the graded questions. 6. New clinical information (treatment guidelines or new drugs) released within the previous 10 months prior to the current exam will most likely not be included. 7. Keep in mind that the questions will be on primary care disorders (e.g., primary care clinics, public health clinics). If you are guessing, avoid picking an exotic diagnosis as an answer. 8. The AANPCB exams will list the normal lab results when they are pertinent to a question, but they will be listed only once. Write them down on some scratch paper (or a whiteboard). When a related question comes up later, these pertinent lab values will not be listed again. 9. Follow the norms given by the AANPCB. For example, they may list their mean corpuscular volume (MCV) normal value between 82 and 102 fL (femtoliters). The usual norm taught in NP schools is an MCV between 80 and 100 fL (use this norm for the ANCC exam). 10. Unlike the AANPCB, the ANCC does not list the normal lab results. If you are taking the ANCC exam, it is important to memorize some normal lab results and to write them down on scratch paper during the computer tutorial time period. 11. Learn the significance of abnormal lab results and the type of follow-up needed to further evaluate the patient. Example : An elderly male patient complains of a new-onset, left-sided temporal headache accompanied by scalp tenderness and indurated temporal artery. The NP suspects temporal arteritis. The screening test is the sedimentation rate, which is expected to be much higher than normal (elevated value). Example : A patient with an elevated white blood cell (WBC >11,000/mm 3 ) count accompanied by neutrophilia (>70%) and the presence of bands (\"shift to the left\") most likely has a serious bacterial infection. 12. Expect to find many culture-related questions on the ANCC exam. Example : If a traditional Muslim woman refuses to undress and use a hospital gown, an alternative is to examine her with her clothes on (modified physical exam). 13. The other cultures that may be addressed on the ANCC exam are Mexicans, Cubans, 3016 Chinese, Cambodians/Filipinos, and Native Americans (e.g., Navajo). Cultural topics are covered in this book in the nonclinical chapters. Example : A Navajo woman has an appointment for a follow-up visit, but she does not show up for the appointment. The most common cause for Navajo patients to skip health visits and follow-up visits is the lack of transportation. 14. Sometimes there will be one unexpected question relating to a dental injury. Example : A completely avulsed permanent tooth should be reimplanted as soon as possible. It can be transported to the dentist in cold milk (not frozen milk). 15. There may be a question on epidemiologic terms. Example : Sensitivity is defined as the ability of a test to detect a person who has the disease. Specificity is defined as the ability of a test to detect a person who is healthy (or to detect the person without the disease). 16. Learn the definition of some of the research study designs. Example : A cohort study follows a group of people who share some common characteristics to observe the development of disease over time (e.g., the Framingham Nurses' Health Study). 17. Several emergent conditions that may present in the primary care area will be on the exam. Example : Navicular fracture, acute myocardial infarction (MI), cauda equina syndrome, anaphylaxis, angioedema, meningococcal meningitis, etc. 18. Become familiar with the names of some anatomic areas. Example : Trauma to Kiesselbach's plexus will result in an anterior nosebleed. 19. Some questions may ask about the \"gold-standard test\" or the diagnostic test for a condition. Example : The diagnostic or gold-standard test for sickle cell anemia, glucose- 6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) anemia, and alpha or beta thalassemia is the hemoglobin electrophoresis. 20. Distinguish between first-line and second-line antibiotics. (For adult-gerontology NPs, the age in the example that follows can be changed to an adolescent or an adult.) Example : A 7-year-old child with acute otitis media (AOM) who is treated with amoxicillin returns in 48 hours without improvement (complains of ear pain, bulging tympanic membrane). The next step is to discontinue the amoxicillin and start the child on a second-line antibiotic such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) BID (twice a day) \u00d7 10 days. 21. Become knowledgeable about alternative antibiotics for penicillin-allergic patients. If the patient has a gram-positive infection, the possible alternatives are macrolides, clindamycin, or quinolones with gram-positive activity such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin. 22. If a patient has an infection that responds well to macrolides, but she thinks she is \"allergic\" to erythromycin (symptoms of nausea or gastrointestinal [GI] upset), inform her that she had an adverse reaction, not a true allergic reaction (hives, angioedema). Example : Switch the patient from erythromycin to azithromycin (usually a Z-Pack). 23. If a patient fails to respond to the initial medication, add another medication (follow the steps of the treatment guideline). Example : A patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is 3117 prescribed ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) for dyspnea. On follow-up, the patient complains that his symptoms are not relieved. The next step would be to prescribe an albuterol inhaler (Ventolin) or to prescribe a combination inhaler. 24. Disease states are usually presented in their full-blown \"classic\" textbook presentations. Example : In a case of acute mononucleosis, the patient will most likely be a teen presenting with the classic triad of sore throat, prolonged fatigue, and enlarged cervical nodes. If the patient is older, but has the same signs and symptoms, it is still mononucleosis (reactivated type). 25. Ethnic background may give a clue for some diseases. Example : Alpha thalassemia is more common among Southeast Asians (such as Filipinos). Beta thalassemia is more common in Mediterranean people. 26. No asymptomatic or \"borderline\" cases of disease states are presented in the test. Example : In real life, most patients with iron-deficiency anemia are asymptomatic and do not have either pica or spoon-shaped nails. In the exam, they will probably have these clinical findings plus the other findings of anemia. 27. Become familiar with lupus or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Example : A malar rash (butterfly rash) is present in most patients with lupus. These patients should be advised to avoid or to minimize sunlight exposure (photosensitivity). 28. Become familiar with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Example : First-line treatment for PMR includes long-term steroids. Long-term, low-dosed steroids are commonly used to control symptoms (pain, severe stiffness in shoulders and hip girdle). PMR patients are also at higher risk for temporal arteritis. 29. The gold-standard exam for temporal arteritis is a biopsy of the temporal artery. Refer the patient to an ophthalmologist for management. 30. Learn the disorders for which maneuvers are used and what a positive report signifies. Example : Finkelstein's test\u2014positive in De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Anterior drawer maneuver and Lachman maneuver\u2014positive if anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee is damaged. The knee may also be unstable. McMurray's sign\u2014 positive in meniscus injuries of the knee. 31. Some conditions need to be evaluated with a radiologic test. Example : Damaged joints: Order an x-ray first (but MRI is the gold standard). 32. The abnormal eye findings in diabetes (diabetic retinopathy) and hypertension (hypertensive retinopathy) should be memorized. Learn to distinguish each one. Example : Diabetic retinopathy (neovascularization, cotton wool spots, and microaneurysms). nicking, silver and/or copper wire 33. Become knowledgeable about physical exam \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" findings. Example : When checking deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) in a patient with severe sciatica or diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the ankle jerk reflex (Achilles reflex) may be absent or hypoactive. Scoring: absent (0), hypoactive (1), normal (2), hyperactive (3), and clonus (4). 34. There are only a few questions on benign or physiologic variants. Example : A benign S4 heart sound may be auscultated in some elderly patients. Torus palatinus and fishtail uvula may be seen during the oral exam in a few 3218 patients. 35. Some commonly used drugs have rare (but potentially life-threatening) adverse effects. Example : A rare but serious adverse effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is angioedema. A common side effect of ACEIs is a dry cough (up to 10%). 36. Learn about the preferred and/or first-line drug used to treat some diseases. Example : ACEI or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the preferred drugs to treat hypertension in diabetics and patients with mild to moderate renal disease because of their renal-protective properties. 37. When medications are used in the answer options, they will be listed either by name (generic and brand name) or by drug class alone. Example : Instead of using the generic/brand name of ipratropium (Atrovent), it may be listed as a drug class (an anticholinergic). 38. Most of the drugs mentioned in the exam are the well-recognized drugs. Example : listed in both Chapters 2 and 3 . 39. Category B drugs are allowed for pregnant or lactating women. Example : For pain relief, pick acetaminophen (Tylenol) instead of NSAIDs Anaprox). Avoid nitrofurantoin and sulfa drugs during the third trimester (these increase risk of hyperbilirubinemia). 40. The preferred treatment for cutaneous anthrax is ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally BID for 60 days or for 8 weeks. If the patient is allergic to ciprofloxacin, use doxycycline 100 mg BID. Cutaneous anthrax is not contagious; it comes from touching fur or animal skins that are contaminated with anthrax spores. 41. There are some questions on theories and conceptual models. Example : Stages of change or \"decision\" theory (Prochaska) includes concepts such as precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance (see Chapter 26 ). 42. Other health theorists who have been included on the exams in the past are (not inclusive): Alfred Bandura (self-efficacy), Erik Erikson, Sigmund Freud, Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross (grieving), and others. Example : If a small child expresses a desire to marry a parent of the opposite sex, the 3319 child is in the oedipal stage (Freud). Child's age is about 5 to 6 years (preschool to kindergarten). 43. Starting at the age of about 11 years, most children can understand abstract concepts (early abstract thinking) and are better at logical thinking. Example : When performing the Mini-Mental State Exam, when the NP is asking about \"proverbs,\" the nurse is assessing the patient's ability to understand abstract concepts. 44. Keep these good communication rules in mind: Ask open-ended questions, do not reassure patients, avoid angering the patient, and respect the patient's culture. There may be two to three questions relating to \"abuse\" (child abuse, domestic abuse, elderly abuse). 45. Follow national treatment guidelines for certain disorders.

The ANCC exam has several questions about evidence-based medicine that are designed in the drag-and-drop format. For important facts, review Chapter 2 to become familiar with this format, as well as the new chapter in this book on Evidence- Based Medicine and Epidemiology for important facts. 47. If the question is asking for the initial or screening lab test, it will probably be a \"cheap\" and readily available test such as the CBC (complete blood count (CBC) to screen for anemia. MAXIMIZING YOUR SCORE 1. The first answer that \"pops\" in your head is usually the correct answer. 2. If you are guessing, pick an answer at random. Try not to change it unless you are sure. 3. Use the \"mark\" command so that you can return to the question later when you complete the exam. 4. Avoid changing too many answers. If you are not sure, then leave the answer alone. I advise my students not to change more than three answers. 5. Avoid choosing exotic diseases as answers if you are guessing. Remember, these are tests for primary care conditions. 6. One method of guessing is to look for a pattern. Pick the answer that does not fit the pattern. Another is to pick the answer that you are most \"attracted\" to. Go with your gut feeling, and do not change the answer unless you are very sure. 7. Remind yourself to read slowly and carefully throughout the test. Avoid reading questions too rapidly. Make sure that you understand the stem of the question (usually the last sentence of a question). 8. If you are having problems choosing or understanding the answer options, try to read them from the bottom up (from option D to A, or from 4 to 1). 9. Eliminate the wrong answers after you read all the answer options. If an answer option contains all-inclusive words (\"all,\" \"none,\" \"every,\" \"never,\" \"none\"), then it is probably wrong. 10. Be careful with certain words such as \"always,\" \"exactly,\" \"often,\" \"sometimes,\" and \"mostly.\" 11. Assume that each question has enough information to answer it correctly. Questions and answers are carefully designed. Take the facts at face value. 12. The first few questions are usually harder to solve. This is a common test design. Do not let it shake your confidence. (Guess the answer and \"mark\" it so that you can return to it later.) 13. Save yourself time (and mental strain) by reading the last sentence (or stem) of long questions and case scenarios first . Then read the question again from the beginning. The advantage of this \"backward reading\" technique is that you know ahead of time what the question is asking for. When you read it again \"normally,\" it becomes easier to recognize important clues that will help you answer the question. 14. Just because a statement or an answer is true does not mean that it is the correct answer. If it does not answer the stem of the question, then it is the wrong answer. 3521 15. Design and memorize your \"scratch paper\" a few weeks before you take the exam. Choose what you want on it wisely. Remember to keep it brief. 16. Use the time left from the \"free\" computer tutorial time to write down the facts that you memorized for your scratch paper. If you run out of time, skip this step. 17. Some suggestions of facts to write down on the scratch paper are lab results (hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, platelets, WBC count, neutrophil percentage, potassium, urinalysis, etc.). Other popular choices are the murmurs, mnemonics, and cranial nerves. 18. Do not leave any of the questions unanswered because there is no penalty for guessing. Questions that are left blank are marked as errors (0 points). If you have only 30 minutes left and you are not done, quickly answer the remaining questions at random. 19. If you spend more than 60 seconds on a question, you are wasting time. Answer it at random and then \"mark\" it so that you can return to it later (after you finish the entire test). 20. Consider a quick break (if you have enough time) if you get too mentally fatigued. Solving 200 questions is pretty intense. If you feel \"fuzzy\" or tired, go to the bathroom and get a drink of water, and splash cold water on your face. This can take less than 5 minutes. You can bring bottled water, but you have to leave it outside the testing area. 21. The countdown clock in the computer does not stop for breaks. Do not use more than 5 minutes for your quick bathroom break. 22. If you have failed the test before, try not to memorize what you did on the previous exam you took. The answers you remember may be wrong. Pretend that you have never seen the test before so that you can start out fresh mentally. 23. Do not panic or let your anxiety take over. Learn to use a calming technique, such as deep breathing, to calm yourself quickly before you take the exam. 24. Consider using a test-anxiety hypnosis CD and use it every night for at least 2 to 3 weeks for maximum effect. 25. One of the most important advice that I can give you is to make sure that you get enough sleep the night before the exam. Aim for at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep. Better yet, make sure that you get enough sleep a few nights before, not just the night before. 26. Before the test, practice answering questions and check the rationales afterward. The ANCC has free questions per specialty that you can take online and score. Buy practice questions from the ANCC or the AANPCB (depends on which test you are taking). 27. Check out the website allnurses.com and search for examination tips from other who have taken/failed the FNP certification exam. You can also do this directly by using a Google, Bing, or other search engine. PREPARING FOR THE EXAM Review Timeline 1. Start seriously reviewing for the exam at least 3 months in advance. Study time can range from 2 to 3 hours per session or you can break it up into 1-hour segments. Be consistent. The best time to study is the time of day you are most alert. 2. Prepare a study schedule by organ system. Photocopy the table of contents of your primary care textbook. Place check marks next to the diseases that you want to 36concentrate on and then schedule the date and time period for each organ system. 3. Concentrate your studies on your weaker areas. For example, if orthopedics is one of your weak areas, devote more time to it. Spend 3 days on orthopedics versus 1 day for the \"easy\" organ systems (easy since you understand them better). 4. I highly recommend that you attend at least one quality review course and buy CDs of another review course. I teach review courses live and by webinar. You can view my class schedule at my website at www.npreview.com . 5. Buy a new notebook. If you find that you are having a problem understanding a concept, write it down in your notebook, then research it and find the answer to your question. 6. Meet with someone in your local area or by phone who is also taking the exam. Practice quizzing each other. 7. Note the disease and topics that I have highlighted in this review book. Some organ systems have more \"weight\" on the exam than others. Become more familiar with these areas. 8. If you are taking the ANCC exam, I highly recommend that you devote at least 30% of your study time learning about the nonclinical topics. 9. If you learn better in a group, organize one. Decide ahead of time what organ systems or diseases to cover together so that you do not waste time. Testing Center Details 1. Call the testing center or confirm your appointment online 4 weeks before to verify your appointment date and time. 2. Locate and drive to the testing center 1 to 2 weeks before taking the exam. Save the address of the testing center on your GPS or map app. 3. Arrive at least 45 to 60 minutes before your scheduled time so that you have enough time to park your car, locate the testing center, and check in for your appointment. 4. Acceptable forms of primary identification (photo with signature). If you do not have the proper forms of identification, you will not be allowed to take the exam. Driver's license issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) State ID card issued by the DMV Passport U.S. military ID Your secondary ID (nonphoto): Card with your name and signature (e.g., credit card, ATM card, Social Security card, Voter Registration card, employee ID) Expired IDs are not acceptable The name that is printed on your primary ID must match the name that you used when you applied for the exam Check that both your primary and secondary IDs and the letter with your Prometric identification number match; make sure that all your IDs are inside your wallet/handbag 5. Biometrics are used for enhanced security. Your fingerprint is scanned before testing and every time you reenter the test area (it is erased in 24 hours to ensure privacy). The test-taking room is also monitored closely by videotape and microphones. 3722 6. A whiteboard (8.5 \u00d7 11 inches) with the pen, or scratch paper and pencil, is given to you by the testing center staff (and collected after you are done). If you are given paper and tend to write a lot, ask for extra paper. 7. You can request noise-reducing headsets or ear plugs; consider this option if you are sensitive to noise. 8. Cell phones, watches, cameras, pagers, jewelry (except for engagement and/or wedding ring) and food or drink are not allowed inside the testing area. 9. Testing computers are predetermined. Each test-taker is assigned one small cubicle with one computer. If you are having problems seeing the computer screen, bring it to the proctor's attention as soon as possible. 10. Verify that you are given the correct examination as soon as you sit down. Check that the title and the examination code on the screen match the information sent by the testing agency for your NP specialty. 11. No food or drink is allowed inside the testing room. But you can bring in a drink and food (e.g., snack bar) and place it outside the locker (top of the locker) so that you do not have to open your locker. You are not permitted to unlock your locker during the testing period. 12. If you need to go to the restroom, you must first sign out with the proctor/testing staff. Remember, the time clock will continue to count down the time. It does not stop for breaks. 13. Do not forget your glasses if you need them to read text on the computer. The Night Before the Exam 1. Avoid eating a heavy meal or consuming alcoholic drinks the night before the exam. Avoid eating 3 to 4 hours before bedtime (prevents heartburn). 2. Get enough sleep. Aim for at least 7 to 8 hours. Getting adequate sleep is probably one of the most important things you can do to help you pass the exam. 3. If you are scheduled to take your exam in the morning, set two alarms to wake you up on time. Give yourself extra time if it is a weekday (traffic congestion). The Day of the Exam 1. Avoid eating a heavy breakfast or eating only simple carbs. The best meals are a combination of a protein with a complex carbohydrate (eggs, whole-wheat bread, nuts, cheese, etc.). If you eat only simple carbs, you can become hypoglycemic within 1 hour. 2. If you get drowsy and \"fuzzy\" during the exam, there are several ways to \"wake up\" rapidly. Excuse yourself and go the bathroom to drink cold water and to splash cold water on your face. You can perform 10 to 20 \"jumping jacks.\" Drinking a caffeinated beverage or coffee can be very helpful. (However, don't drink too much.) 3. Avoid drinking too much fluid and do not forget to empty your bladder before the exam. 4. Wear comfortable clothing and dress in layers in case of temperature changes. 5. Jewelry is not allowed inside the testing area except for wedding and/or engagement rings. 3823 24 OTHER TEST-TAKING ISSUES Test Anxiety It is normal to feel anxious before taking an exam. A little anxiety helps us to become alert and vigilant, but too much anxiety can wear you down both emotionally and physically. Your internal perception about how well you will do on the exam is very important. If you tend to become very anxious (or you are now more anxious because you previously failed the exam), there are calming methods that may prove helpful in controlling your anxiety. Following are some suggestions to help reduce test-taking anxiety a few weeks before the exam. 1. Make sure that you have devoted enough time for your review studies. If you feel in your gut that you have not studied \"enough\" or that you are not ready, it will worsen anxiety. 2. Consider signing up for both the ANCC and AANPCB exams. It can help to reduce your anxiety level because you feel like you have a \"backup\" exam. 3. If you have a firm job offer, I also recommend that you sign up for both exams to decrease test-taking anxiety. 4. Consider taking one to two review courses. My review courses and webinars are listed at my website www.npreview.com . 5. Avoid negative \"self-talk.\" When you catch yourself doing it, silently tell yourself to \"Stop it! Right now!\" 6. Improve the nutritional content of your diet, especially about 2 weeks before the exam. Vitamins and supplements that may be helpful to the brain are omega-3 capsules (fish oil); B-complex vitamins; vitamins C, D, and E; choline; and others. 7. Hypnotherapy audio files are sold online for use in portable-player devices. For maximum effectiveness, it is best to listen to them daily for 2 to 4 weeks. 8. \"Tapping\" is another method used to counteract test anxiety (or increase self- confidence). The technique is demonstrated in videos posted to YouTube. Your Panic Button If you find yourself feeling panicky during the exam, try the following calming technique. Practice this exercise at home until you feel comfortable doing it. Breathing Exercise 1. Close your eyes. During inhalation, tell yourself gently, \"I am breathing in calmness.\" Then hold your breath and count from 1 to 3. 2. During exhalation, tell yourself gently \"I am breathing out fear\" while counting from 1 to 5. 3. Inhale deeply through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth. 4. Complete one cycle of three inhalations and three exhalations. Repeat as needed. __________ * Not an all-inclusive list. 3925 2 Question Dissection and Analysis * EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE (EBM) I. Discussion Questions about EBM are typically designed in \"drag-and-drop\" format on the American Nurses Credentialing Center exam. They are presented as two boxes with three sections each. The example that follows illustrates this format. On the left side, three types of article summaries (or research studies) are marked A, B, or C (in the exam, they will appear as yellow boxes). On the right side, you will see the rankings from 1 to 3 (in the exam, they will be blue boxes). You \"drag\" one of the articles from the left-hand box into the correct ranking or hierarchy in the right-hand box. Your job is to rank the three research article summaries as 1, 2, or 3 (best evidence, moderate evidence, weakest evidence). II. Example Article Summaries Strength of Evidence (strongest to weakest) A) A meta-analysis on Medline and Cochrane databases that found 53 RCTs about gingko biloba use in patients with early dementia 1. B) A specialty society opinion paper regarding the effectiveness of gingko biloba supplementation in dementia 2. C) An experimental study on 500 patients with early dementia who were given gingko biloba daily for 6 months versus the control group, which given placebo pills 3. RCTs, randomized controlled trials. III. Correct Answer: 4026 Article A is ranked 1, Article C is ranked 2, and Article B is ranked 3. IV. Question Dissection Best Clues I teach a three-step system to students in my review courses. First, identify the research study that has the highest/best level of evidence (#1 ranking). An easy way to do this is by searching for keywords in the question such as \"meta-analysis,\" \"systematic review\" \"Medline database,\" and/or Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (\"CINAHL\"). Next, look for the research study that has the weakest evidence (#3 ranking). It usually contains keywords such as \"expert opinion\" or \"specialty society.\" Therefore, view the study that is leftover as having the middle ranking (#2 ranking). In addition, keep in mind that if the choices do not include a meta-analysis or systemic review, then the study with the highest ranking would be an RCT or an experimental study. The ANCC exams usually have several of this type of question. Further discussion about EBM appears in the chapter on Evidence-Based Medicine and Epidemiology later in this book. The levels of evidence rankings are: Meta-analysis and/or systematic reviews (Cochrane/Medline/CINAHL/PubMed) RCTs (used for testing medical treatment effectiveness, subjects assigned at random to either a control or treatment group) Experimental studies (control group, intervention group, randomization) Cohort/case control studies Retrospective chart reviews Expert/specialty society opinions PHOTOGRAPHS I. Discussion On the ANCC exam, expect to see several colored photographs of skin conditions and a few on the eye/fundi. In the future, there may be pictures from other organ systems. The stem of the question usually will ask for the possible diagnosis, differential diagnosis, or type of treatment. If you plan to take the ANCC exam, you need to memorize how a skin condition or eye finding appears in colored photos/pictures. It is a good idea to use a search engine (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo) to look for the images. For example, you want to become familiar with skin cancers, such as basal cell and melanoma, and with funduscopic findings in diabetes and hypertension. II. Example The nurse practitioner (NP) is performing a routine physical exam on a 54-year-old White male farmer who is an immigrant from Australia. The NP notices a shiny round, ulcerated 4127 skin lesion on the patient's head. It has a firm texture with indurated edges and telangiectasia. See Figure 2.1 . The patient reports that the lesion does not itch, but it has slowly enlarged over the past few years. Which of the following conditions is most likely in this patient? A) Nodular melanoma B) Squamous cell carcinoma C) Basal cell carcinoma D) Actinic keratosis Figure 2.1 Sample exam photograph. This image can be found in color in the app. Source: Courtesy of National Cancer Institute. III. Correct Answer: Option C C) Basal cell carcinoma IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Notice that the skin lesion has a pearly or wax-like (shiny) appearance with telangiectasia, which is \"classic\" for basal cell carcinoma; some lesions may show central ulceration Patient has risk factors for skin cancer, such as light-colored skin, and he is from Australia, which has high rates of skin cancer The skin lesion is located on a sun-exposed area It is probably not nodular melanoma, which usually has pigment such as brown or black color with irregular borders Actinic keratosis is a precancer of squamous cell carcinoma and is usually located on the scalp (males), face, and the back of the hands (dorsum); they appear as a crusty/scaly growth that slowly enlarges over time The gold-standard test for skin cancer is the skin biopsy MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS WITH MORE 4228 THAN ONE CORRECT RESPONSE I. Discussion Expect to see some multiple-choice questions with five to six answer options in both the ANCC and American Academy of Nurse Practitioners Certification Board (AANPCB) exams. The question will ask for two to three correct answers. For example, you may be asked to pick two or three differential diagnoses for a case of skin rash. The clues are given in the presentation of the signs and symptoms. II. Example A 75-year-old woman with mild dementia, hyperlipidemia, and emphysema is brought in by her middle-aged daughter as a walk-in patient in a community clinic with a complaint of the sudden onset of red rashes on her left lower arm and hand. During the skin exam, the NP notes that there are a few blisters. When the NP touches one of the blisters, it ruptures and drains clear serous fluid. Which of the following three conditions should the NP consider in the differential diagnosis? A) Contact dermatitis B) Erysipelas C) Psoriasis D) Impetigo E) Thermal burn III. Correct Answer: Options A, D, and E A) Contact dermatitis D) Impetigo E) Thermal burn IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Easily ruptured blisters (fragile) is a classic finding for bullous impetigo, an acute bacterial skin infection caused by Staphylococcus or Streptococcus . Contact dermatitis can present with just red skin or red skin with blisters. The rash can be located anywhere on the body and it may have a pattern (like a belt) or no pattern. The timing of the rash is very important. Is it acute or chronic? Rule out option C (psoriasis), which is a chronic skin disease. Erysipelas is a type of cellulitis caused by strep. It resembles a bright-red, warm, raised rash (plaque-like) with discrete borders usually located on the face or the shins. Blistering is not present. A thermal burn is a burn caused by heat (fire, heat). Consider a second-degree burn in the differential diagnosis because of its acute onset. Also, the patient has mild dementia, which puts her at a higher risk for accidents. 4329 DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING I. Discussion Questions about diagnostic imaging tests may appear on the exam. You may get a multiple- choice question alone or a question that is accompanied by a chest x-ray film. I recommend that you use a search engine (Google, Bing, Yahoo) to search for images of chest films with lobar consolidation due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), right middle lobe pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) infection, and emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). II. Example A 34-year-old male smoker presents in an urgent care clinic complaining of a productive cough, chest congestion, fever, chills, and poor appetite for 1 week. Cough is productive of greenish sputum, which is sometimes tinged with a small amount of blood. Vital signs are temperature of 101.2\u00b0F, pulse of 100 beats/min, respirations of 24 breaths/min, and BP 122/88 mmHg. A radiograph of the chest is obtained (see Figure 2.2 ). What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? Figure 2.2 Sample exam photo. A) Acute bronchitis B) Right middle lobe pneumonia C) Right lower lobe pneumonia D) Legionella pneumonia III. Correct Answer: Option B B) Right middle lobe pneumonia IV. Question Dissection Best Clues 44Presence of signs and symptoms of CAP such as fever, cough productive of green sputum with small amount of blood (or rust-colored sputum). Rust-colored sputum is associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Most of the middle lobe of the right lung is in the anterior chest by the right nipple area. Notice that lobar consolidation is located in the same area. Patients with acute bronchitis may have chest congestion but not fever, chills, or productive cough with purulent sputum. Legionella pneumonia (Legionnaire's disease) is uncommon in primary care. Look for a history of exposure to \"nebulized\" water sources such as air conditioners, fountains, etc. Presents with pneumonia signs/symptoms that are accompanied by GI symptoms (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting). CULTURE I. Discussion There will be several questions on the ANCC exam that address culture. The questions will address knowledge of cultural practices that influence health-seeking behavior. Some of the cultures that may be included in the ANCC exam are Hispanic/Latino, Muslim, Chinese, Native American (Navajo), and Southeast Asian (Vietnamese, Hmong, Filipinos, and others). II. Example An elderly woman immigrant from Vietnam who recently has been diagnosed with hypertension is returning for a 4-week follow-up visit. The patient is on a prescription of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. Her blood pressure during the visit is 150/94 mmHg. The NP queries the patient whether she is taking her medication. The patient looks down at the floor and does not directly answer the question. Which of the following statements regarding the health behaviors of Southeast Asians is incorrect? A) The patient may have difficulty verbalizing questions about his or her treatment B) The patient may ask to consult with an older family member about major health decisions C) If the patient is not compliant with taking medications, he or she will not directly communicate it with the health provider D) The patient will directly verbalize his or her disagreement in a loud voice III. Correct Answer: Option D D) The patient will directly verbalize his or her disagreement in a loud voice. IV. Question Dissection Best Clues The patient's behavior (aggressive, loud) is considered rude in most Asian cultures 4530 Notes 1. The Hmong ethnic group that immigrated to the United States came from several countries (e.g., Laos, Vietnam, Thailand). A traditional household has a male (i.e., father) who is the head of the household. The family identifies with a clan group, which is headed by an older male. 2. For major health decisions, the head of the family is always involved in the health decision. If the father is dead, then another older male relative (e.g., uncle) may be consulted. 3. Most Asians have high regard for physicians (and college education). Because of this cultural value, they may not directly disagree or question the health care provider. 4. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are eight to 13 times more likely to develop liver cancer than other groups due to higher rates of chronic hepatitis B infection. LAB RESULTS AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS I. Discussion Laboratory tests, such as hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), total white blood cell (WBC) count, percentage of neutrophils in the WBC differential, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and urinalysis (UA), are commonly encountered in the exams. Learn the significance of the abnormal results and the follow-up tests that are needed to evaluate them further. The AANPCB exam does list the norms for some of the common laboratory tests. They will appear only when needed to answer a question (such as an anemia question). It is important that you copy the lab norm that is given (on your scratch paper) because it will be listed only once. In contrast, the ANCC does not list any of the normal results in its certification exams. Therefore, if you plan to take the ANCC exam, it is important that you memorize the normal results of these laboratory tests. Be warned that lab results are also used as distractors; the labs listed may not be necessary to solve the exam question correctly. The normal results for these labs are also included in the pertinent review chapters of this book (e.g., TSH will be found in Chapter 9 . II. Example An elderly man of Mediterranean descent has a routine CBC done for an annual physical. The following are his lab test results: hemoglobin is 12.0 g/dL, hematocrit is 39%, and MCV is 72 fL. His PSA result is 3.2 ng/mL. UA shows no leukocytes and few epithelial cells. Which of the following laboratory tests are indicated for this patient? A) Serum iron, serum ferritin, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and the red cell distribution width (RDW) B) Serum vitamin B 12 and folate level with a peripheral smear 4631 C) CBC with white cell differential and UA D) Urine culture and sensitivity with microscopic exam of the urine ( Tables 2.1 and 2.2 ) III. Correct Answer: Option A A) Serum iron, serum ferritin, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and the red cell distribution width (RDW) Table 2.1 List of Laboratory Norms CBC Reference Ranges Hemoglobin Males 13.0-17.5 g/dL intravascular coagulation) Reticulocytes 0.5%-1.5% of red cells ( acute bleeding, starting treatment for vitamin deficiencies (iron, B 12 , folate), acute hemolytic episodes Total WBC infections) Neutrophils (or infections) Band forms (immature WBCs) >6% ( severe bacterial infections) Also Eosinophils >3% ( allergies, corpuscular volume; RDW, red cell distribution width; WBC, white blood cell. Table 2.2 List of Blood Chemistries Laboratory Test Reference Ranges [RA], lupus, inflammation) CRP Elevated (inflammation, autoimmune diseases, a risk factor for heart disease) cTnT Elevated in myocardial infarction, heart damage, heart failure 4732 Sensitive test for myocardial cell damage B-type natriuretic peptide Elevated (elevated in heart Question Dissection Best Clues Low hemoglobin and hematocrit for gender (male) and age (abnormal CBC result) An MCV of 72 fL, which is indicative of microcytic anemia (assessment) The ethnic background of the patient (demographics) Ignore the UA and PSA tests because they are not necessary to solve the problem Notes 1. You must go through three steps to answer this question correctly: First step: A hemoglobin of less than 13.5 g/dL in males (but not in females) is indicative of anemia. An MCV of 72 fL is indicative of microcytic anemia (norm 80-100 fL). Second step: The MCV will direct you in the differential diagnosis (microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic). Third step: The differential diagnosis for microcytic anemia is iron deficiency and alpha/beta thalassemia trait or minor for the exams. 2. In iron-deficiency anemia, the following results are found: Decreased (serum ferritin and serum iron levels) Elevated (TIBC and RDW) 3. In alpha or beta thalassemia trait or minor, the following results are found: Normal to high (serum ferritin and serum iron levels) Normal (TIBC) 4. The gold-standard test to diagnose any anemia involving abnormal hemoglobin (thalassemia, sickle cell, etc.) is the hemoglobin electrophoresis. 5. The RDW is a measure of the variability in size of RBCs (or anisocytosis). An elevated RDW is one of the earliest indicators of iron-deficiency anemia. 6. In clinical practice, rule out iron-deficiency anemia first (most common anemia in the world for all ages/races/gender) before ordering a hemoglobin electrophoresis. HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA) I. Discussion One common topic that is frequently included in the certification exam is the HIPAA of 1996. The questions are designed to determine whether you know how to apply HIPAA 4833 regulations in primary care practice. Your job is to determine whether the activity is compliant (or not) with HIPAA regulations. II. Example According to the HIPAA of 1996, which of the following examples demonstrates noncompliance? A) The sign-in sheet on the front desk is covered so that other patients' names are not visible to new patients B) The medical assistant calls the patient who is in the waiting room using his or her first name C) A patient's chart that is hanging on the door of the exam room is turned backward D) The NP calls the daughter of an elderly diabetic patient and leaves a detailed message on the answering machine regarding her mother's lab results III. Correct Answer: Option D D) The NP calls the daughter of an elderly diabetic patient and leaves a detailed message on the answering machine regarding her mother's lab results IV. Question Dissection Best Clues In option D, the phrase \"detailed message on the answering machine\" is a good clue of HIPAA noncompliance The question does not specify whether the patient authorized that her information could be released to her daughter. Therefore, assume that no authorization was given by the patient Option B shows HIPAA compliance because only the patient's first name is used Notes 1. Option D demonstrates two examples of HIPAA noncompliance. First, there is no mention that the patient gave consent for her daughter to have access to her medical information. Second, the NP did not follow the \"minimum necessary requirement\" rule when leaving a detailed message on the daughter's answering machine. 2. The best action in this case is for the NP to call the elderly patient's home and to leave only his or her name, the name of the clinic, and a phone number that the patient can call. 3. When speaking to a patient in the waiting room area (or any public area), use only the patient's first name. If both the patient's first and last names are used, then option C would be an example of HIPAA noncompliance. 4934 WOMEN'S HEALTH I. Discussion Expect to see several questions addressing gynecological conditions. The topics that are covered include recognizing and treating sexually transmitted infections or diseases (STIs or STDs), oral contraceptive issues, abnormal Pap smears, menopausal conditions, threatened abortion or early pregnancy, and many more. For example, there will be questions about vaginal disorders such as bacterial vaginosis (BV), candida vaginitis, trichomoniasis, and atrophic vaginitis, and when a pregnancy would have to be established to make a choice of medications. Be aware that a clinical finding can be described in detail instead of using its common name. For example, the term clue cell is not used in the question that follows. Instead, it is described in detail (\"mature squamous epithelial cells with numerous bacteria noted on the cell surface and borders\"). II. Example An 18-year-old female student presents in the college health clinic complaining of a strong odor in her vagina. She reports that she had an abortion about 3 weeks ago and recently completed her prescription of antibiotics. The NP performs a vaginal speculum exam and notes a large amount of gray to off-white discharge coating the patient's vaginal walls. It has a milk-like consistency. During microscopy, the slide reveals mature squamous epithelial cells with numerous bacteria on the cell borders. The vaginal pH is 6.0. Which of the following conditions is most likely? A) Trichomoniasis B) Bacterial vaginosis C) Candida vulvovaginitis D) Hormonal changes III. Correct Answer: Option B B) Bacterial vaginosis IV. Question Dissection Best Clues The vaginal pH is alkaline (pH of 6.0). Rule out Candida because it is classified as a yeast organism (not a bacteria). Rule out Trichomonas because it is a protozoan or unicellular flagellated organism. The odor and discharge are not due to hormonal changes in an 18-year-old. Notes 1. BV has an alkaline pH (vagina normally has acidic pH of 3.5-4.5). BV is the only vaginal condition with an alkaline pH for the exam. 5035 2. BV is not considered an STD (it is caused by an imbalance of vaginal bacteria). The sex partner does not need to be treated. It is a vaginosis (not a vaginitis). 3. BV does not cause inflammation (the vulvovagina will not be red or irritated). The microscopy slide will have very few WBCs and a large number of clue cells. 4. The vaginal discharge in Candida infection is a white color with a thick and curdlike consistency. It frequently causes redness and itching in the vulvovagina due to inflammation. 5. The microscopy in candidiasis will show a large number of WBCs, pseudohyphae, and spores (\"spaghetti and meatballs\"). 6. Candida yeast is normal flora of the GI tract and in some women's vaginas. 7. Trichomonas infection (or trichomoniasis) vaginal discharge is copious, bubbly, and green in color. It causes a lot of inflammation, resulting in itching and redness of the vulvovagina. It is considered to be an STI. The sex partner also needs treatment. 8. Microscopy (wet smear) is the gold standard of diagnosis for BV, candida vaginitis, and trichomoniasis for the exam. MEDICATIONS I. Discussion When studying pharmacology for the exam, it is generally not important to memorize the specific drug doses. What is more important is to study a drug's \"safety\" issues such as contraindications, major drug/food interactions, and the well-known side effects. You will need to be familiar with the drug's indications and the duration of treatment. Become familiar with a \"first-line drug\" and the alternative drug (if applicable). For example, the first-line (or preferred) drug for treating \"strep\" throat is still penicillin VK (V potassium) PO for 10 days. If the patient has a penicillin allergy, macrolides can be used instead. The majority of the medicines seen on the exam are the well-known drugs that have been in use for a few years to many decades (i.e., doxycycline, penicillin, amoxicillin). Memorize the drug class and some representative drugs from that class. For example, in the quinolone drug class are the drugs such as ofloxacin (Floxin), moxifloxacin (Avelox), and levofloxacin (Levaquin). You can memorize a drug either by its generic name or by both its generic and brand name. In addition, you need to become familiar with some of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) category X drugs (listed in Chapter 3 ). II. Examples Example A Using the drug class as the answer option: A previously healthy 30-year-old complains of an acute onset of fever and chills accompanied by a productive cough with purulent sputum and a loss of appetite. The patient denies receiving an antibiotic in the previous 3 months. The NP diagnoses community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The Infectious Diseases Society of America 51(IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) treatment guidelines recommend which of the following as the preferred first-line treatment for this patient? A) Macrolides B) Antitussives C) Cephalosporins D) Fluoroquinolones with gram-positive bacteria activity Example B Which of the following antibiotics is preferred treatment for healthy adults diagnosed with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)? A) Azithromycin (Zithromax Z-Pak 250 mg) 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily for 4 days B) Dextromethorphan with guaifenesin (Robitussin DM) 1 to 2 teaspoons PO QID as needed C) Cephalexin (Keflex) 500 mg PO QID \u00d7 10 days D) Levofloxacin (Levaquin) 500 mg PO daily \u00d7 7 days Example C The following is an example of a question about a common side effect: Possible side effects that may be seen in a patient who is being treated with hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension are: A) Dry cough and angioedema B) Swollen ankles and headache C) Hyperuricemia and hyperglycemia D) Fatigue and depression III. Correct Answers Example A: Option A A) Macrolides Example B: Option A A) Azithromycin (Zithromax Z-Pak 250 mg) 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily for 4 days Example C: Option C C) Hyperuricemia and hyperglycemia IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Lack of comorbidity (\"healthy adults\") is an important clue in Examples A and B Your knowledge of the latest IDSA and the ATS treatment guidelines helps to correctly answer Examples A and B (covered in Chapter 8 ) For Example C, you must memorize the adverse side effects of the thiazide diuretics 5236 Notes 1. According to the IDSA and the ATS treatment guidelines, outpatient treatment of CAP in healthy patients (no comorbidities) involves the macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin). 2. Example A is caused by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Look for a sudden or new onset of a dry cough in a patient with hypertension (without signs of the common cold). Angioedema is a rare adverse effect and can be life- threatening. 3. Example B is caused by calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Look for a hypertensive patient with swollen ankles (not associated with heart failure) and headache. 4. Example C is caused by the thiazide diuretics (hyperuricemia and hyperglycemia). 5. Example D is caused by beta-blockers. Look for a patient with history of myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure and/or hypertension who complains of increased fatigue and depression (avoid if possible in depressed patients, pulse <50 beats/min, second- or third-degree heart block). U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION STATISTICS I. Discussion It is important that you memorize these U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statistics. The questions will be short and to the point. Determine whether a question is asking about the most common cause of death (mortality) or whether it is asking about the most common cause of a certain disease in a population (prevalence). For example, the most common cause of cancer death overall is lung cancer (mortality), but the most common cancer overall (prevalence) is skin cancer. The most common type of skin cancer is basal cell skin cancer. Sometimes, a question will ask about a gender-specific cause. For example, the most common cancer in females is breast cancer and the most common cancer in males is prostate cancer (prevalence). But the cancer causing the most deaths overall for both males and females is still lung cancer (mortality). Mortality Statistics Disease causing the most deaths overall: heart disease Cancer with the highest mortality: Lung cancer Cancer with the highest mortality in males (lung cancer) and in females (lung cancer) Most common cause of death in adolescents: Motor vehicle crashes Prevalence Most common cancer in females: Breast cancer Most common cancer in males: Prostate cancer Most common type of cancer overall (males/females): Skin cancer Most common type of skin cancer (males/females): Basal cell cancer 5337 Skin cancer with the Gynecological cancer vagina, cervix, uterus, ovary) Uterine/endometrial cancer (most common gynecological cancer) Ovarian cancer (second most common gynecological cancer) II. Example What is the most common type of gynecological cancer? A) Uterine cancer B) Cervical cancer C) Breast cancer D) Ovarian cancer III. Correct Answer: Option A A) Uterine cancer IV. Question Dissection Best Clues This question is based on your recall of facts that you memorized (rote memory) Rule out breast cancer because it is not considered a gynecological cancer Notes 1. There may be a question about the gynecological cancers (see example). These types of cancers are located in the pelvis (labia, vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries). 2. Breast cancer is not classified as a gynecological cancer. BENIGN PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIANTS I. Discussion A benign variant is a physiological abnormality that does not interfere with bodily process or function. There are very few questions on benign variants. Some examples of the benign variants that have been seen on the exams include the geographic tongue, torus palatinus, and a split or fishtail uvula (listed in Chapter 5 ). Benign variants are listed under the appropriate organ system. II. Example A 45-year-old female patient complains of a sore throat. Upon examination, the NP notices a bony growth midline at the hard palate of the mouth. The patient denies any changes or 5438 pain. It is not red, tender, or swollen. She reports a history of the same growth for many years without any change. Which of the following conditions is most likely? A) Torus palatinus B) Geographic tongue C) Acute glossitis D) Leukoplakia III. Correct Answer: Option A A) Torus palatinus IV. Question Dissection Best Clues The description of a chronic bony growth located midline in the hard palate Rule out glossitis, geographic tongue, and hairy leukoplakia because they are all located on the tongue and not on the hard palate (roof of the mouth) Notes 1. A torus palatinus is a benign growth of bone (an exostosis) located midline on the hard palate and covered with normal oral skin. It is painless and does not interfere with function. 2. A \"geographic tongue\" has multiple fissures and irregular smoother areas on its surface that makes it look like a topographic map. The patient may complain of soreness on the tongue after eating or drinking acidic or hot foods. 3. Leukoplakia is not a benign variant. It appears as a slow-growing white plaque that has a firm to hard surface that is slightly raised on the tongue or inside the mouth. It is considered a precancerous lesion. It is due to chronic irritation of the skin or to precancerous changes on the tongue and inside the cheeks. Its causes include poorly fitting dentures, chewing tobacco (snuff), and using other types of tobacco. Refer the patient for a biopsy because it can sometimes become malignant. 4. Oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) of the tongue is a painless white patch (or patches) that appears corrugated. It is usually located on the lateral aspects of the tongue (or other areas inside the mouth) and is associated with HIV and AIDS infection. It is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of the tongue. It is not considered a premalignant lesion. U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE SCREENING GUIDELINES I. Discussion USPSTF screening guidelines are graded as A, B, C, D, or I (insufficient evidence or 5539 evidence is lacking or of poor quality). The highest rating is a Grade A (routine screening is advised\u2014high certainty that the net benefit is substantial). A rating of Grade D means that the harm outweighs the benefits (or there is no benefit) to the service and the use of the service is discouraged. Both the ANCC and the AANPCB exams use the USPSTF screening recommendations. Regarding breast cancer screening, the USPSTF (2016) currently recommends that a screening baseline mammogram (with or without clinical breast exam) start at age 50 years, then every 2 years until the age of 74 years. For women aged 40 to 49 years, mammograms should be based on individual factors (such as risk factors, preferences, risk vs. benefits of mammograms). II. Example What is the USPSTF screening recommendation for ovarian cancer? A) Annual bimanual pelvic exam with pelvic ultrasound B) Pelvic and intravaginal ultrasound C) Intravaginal ultrasound with CA-125 tumor marker D) The USPSTF does not recommend routine screening of women for ovarian cancer III. Correct Answer: Option D D) The USPSTF does not recommend routine screening of women for ovarian cancer IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Do not \"overread\" the question. Assume that the question is asking about routine screening of the general population. Transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 are not used for routine screening. Although the bimanual pelvic exam is \"low tech,\" it is being used as a distractor. Notes 1. The USPSTF (2018) is against routine screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women who are not known to have a high risk of hereditary cancer syndrome. 2. If there is a case scenario of an older woman who complains of vague abdominal/pelvic symptoms (stomach bloating, low-back ache, constipation) and is found to have a palpable ovary during the bimanual exam, rule out ovarian cancer. 3. Always rule out ovarian cancer in a postmenopausal woman who has a palpable ovary. 4. The next step is to order a pelvic and intravaginal ultrasound with CA-125. Refer to oncologist. 5. The strongest risk factor for ovarian cancer (or breast cancer) is genetic 5640 predisposition, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and positive family history ( Table 2.3 ). Absolute risk of developing ovarian cancer is 35% to 45% in women with BRCA1 mutation. Other risk factors are age, obesity, clomiphene (Clomid) use, or endometriosis. Table 2.3 USPSTF Screening Guidelines Disease Screening Test Breast cancer (2016) Baseline mammogram at age 50 years Screen every 2 years until age 74 years (biennial) After age 75 years (insufficient evidence) Cervical cancer (2012) Baseline Pap smear/cytology at age 21 years Screen every 3 years until age 65 years Do not screen women younger than 21 years even if sexually active Lung cancer (2013) Aged 55-80 years with 30 pack-year history of smoking or quit smoking up to 15 years previously Annual screening with LDCT Hysterectomy (no cervix) Do not screen (if no history of precancer or cervical cancer) Prostate cancer (2012) Routine screening is not recommended Testicular cancer (2011) Routine screening is not recommended Colon cancer (2016) Baseline screening at age 50 years Use high-sensitivity fecal occult blood test (yearly) or sigmoidoscopy (every 5 years) or colonoscopy (every 10 years) from age 50-75 years Skin cancer (2012) Aged 10-24 years Educate fair-skinned persons to avoid sunlight (10 a.m.-3 p.m.) and use sunblock SPF 15 Tobacco smoking (2015) Ask all adolescents and adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop smoking, and provide behavioral interventions/smoking cessation Fall prevention in community- dwelling older adults (2012) Aged 65 years or older: Exercise and vitamin D dose is from 600 to 800 IU Ask about falls, balance or gait problems Ovarian cancer (2016) Routine screening is not recommended High-risk ( BRCA mutation, family history breast/ovarian cancer) are screened by specialist; refer for genetic counseling Abdominal aortic aneurysm (2014) One-time screening (men aged 65-75 years) for cigarette smokers or those who have quit but smoked previously Screening test is ultrasound of abdomen LDCT, low-dose, computed tomography; SPF, sun protection factor; USPSTF, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. FOLLOWING UP ON A PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE I. Discussion In these cases, a patient who is taking prescription medicine is running out of his or her supply or does not have refills left. The test-taker must decide what type of initial follow-up is needed. Depending on the case scenario, for a patient who is fully symptomatic due to the abrupt cessation of medicine (either due to running out of refills or discontinuation of 57health insurance), a reasonable initial action is to continue the prescription medicine. II. Example A 65-year-old female smoker presents with a history of Barrett's esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient reports that her gastroenterologist's prescription for esomeprazole (Nexium) 40 mg daily ran out a few days ago. She is complaining of severe heartburn and a sore throat. During the physical exam, the NP notes an erythematous posterior pharynx without tonsillar discharge and mild dental enamel loss on the rear molars. What is the best initial action for the NP to follow? A) Refer the patient to an oncologist for a biopsy to rule out esophageal cancer B) Give the patient a refill of her proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) prescription and advise her to schedule an appointment with her gastroenterologist C) Recommend that the patient take over-the-counter (OTC) ranitidine (Zantac) twice a day until she can be seen by her gastroenterologist D) Switch the patient's prescription to another brand of PPI because her symptoms are not improving III. Correct Answer: Option B B) Give the patient a refill of her proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) prescription and advise her to schedule an appointment with her gastroenterologist IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Rule out option A because the patient is already under the care of a gastroenterologist. OTC ranitidine (Zantac) is not potent enough to control the symptoms of erosive esophagitis. A PPI is the preferred treatment for erosive esophagitis. Do not switch the patient to another brand of PPI. Her worsening symptoms are caused by rebound caused by abrupt cessation of PPI. The best initial action in this case is to refill the PPI prescription because the patient is fully symptomatic (erosive esophagitis) until she can see her gastroenterologist. Notes 1. The patient's severe symptoms are caused by the sudden discontinuation of the high-dose PPI (rebound-type of reaction). 2. Barrett's esophagus is the \"precancerous\" lesion of esophageal cancer. It is best managed by a gastroenterologist (not an oncologist). 3. Patients diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus typically have endoscopic examinations with biopsy by a gastroenterologist annually (or every 6 months for high-grade lesions). 4. Patients with Barrett's esophagus are treated with high-dose PPIs for a \"lifetime.\" 5. The first-line treatment of mild, uncomplicated GERD is lifestyle changes (avoid 5841 eating 3 to 4 hours before bedtime, dietary changes, weight loss if overweight, etc.). 6. If a patient is at high risk for esophageal cancer (aged 50 years or older, smoker, chronic GERD for decades), consider referral to a gastroenterologist for an upper endoscopy. TANNER STAGES I. Discussion Expect to see at least one to two questions regarding Tanner stages in girls and boys. Because Tanner stage I is prepuberty and Tanner stage V is the adult pattern for both boys and girls, the only stages to memorize for the exams are Tanner stage II to Tanner stage IV. For girls, memorize the pattern of breast development and for boys, the genital development (testes and penis). It is not as important to memorize pubic hair development for both. Tanner Stages Girls: Stage I: Prepubertal pattern Stage II: Breast bud and areola starts to develop Stage III: Breast continues to grow with nipples/areola (one mound/no separation) Stage IV: Nipples and areola become elevated from the breast (a secondary mound) Stage V: Adult pattern Boys: Stage I: Prepubertal pattern Stage II: Testes and scrotum to (scrotal skin starts to get darker/more rugae) Stage III: Penis grows longer (length) and testes/scrotum continues to become larger Stage IV: Penis become wider and continues growing in length (testes are larger with darker scrotal skin and more rugae) Stage V: Adult pattern II. Example A 14-year-old boy is brought in by his mother for a physical exam. Both are concerned about his breast enlargement. The teen denies breast tenderness. On physical exam, the NP palpates soft breast tissue that is not tender. No dominant mass is noted. The skin is smooth and there is no nipple discharge with massage. The teen has a body mass index (BMI) of 29. Which of the following statements is correct? A) Advise the mother that the patient has physiological gynecomastia and should return for a follow-up exam B) Order an ultrasound of both breasts to further assess the patient's breast tissue 5942 development C) Reassure the mother that the patient's breast development is within normal limits D) Educate the mother that her son has pseudogynecomastia III. Correct Answer: Option D D) Educate the mother that her son has pseudogynecomastia IV. Question Dissection Best Clues The boy is very overweight (BMI 29) and is almost obese. The clinical breast exam does not show palpable breast tissue. Instead, the breast palpation reveals soft fatty tissue. It is wrong to \"reassure\" a patient or a family member in the exam (poor therapeutic communication technique). Notes 1. Physiological gynecomastia physical exam findings will show disk-like breast tissue that is mobile under each nipple/areola, the breast may be tender, and the breast can be asymmetrical (one breast larger than the other). 2. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. Obesity is a BMI of 30 or higher. 3. Overweight to obese males are at highest risk for pseudogynecomastia. QUESTIONS ABOUT FOOD I. Discussion There are basically three kinds of food-related questions on the exam. You may be asked to pick the foods that have high levels of certain minerals, such as potassium, calcium, or magnesium. Other questions will address food interactions (tetracycline and dairy), drug interactions (monoamine oxidase inhibitor [MAOI] and high tyramine-containing foods such as fermented foods), or foods that should be avoided for a particular disease (e.g., wheat products in the case of celiac disease). Certain foods are recommended for certain diseases (e.g., salmon/omega-3 for heart disease) because of their favorable effect. In contrast, certain foods are contraindicated for some conditions because of adverse or dangerous effects. II. Example Which of the following foods are known to have high potassium content? A) Low-fat yogurt, soft cheeses, and collard greens B) Aged cheese, red wine, and chocolate 6043 C) Potatoes, apricots, and brussels sprouts D) Black beans, red meat, and citrus juice III. Correct Answer: Option C C) Potatoes, apricots, and brussels sprouts IV. Question Dissection Best Clues First, look at the answer option pairs for inconsistencies in the list of foods. Rule out option A because it is inconsistent and these foods do not contain high levels of potassium: low-fat yogurt and soft cheeses (calcium) with collard greens (vitamin K). Rule out option B because these foods have high a tyramine, not potassium, content. Rule out option D because it is inconsistent. Although citrus juices are high in potassium, both black beans and red meat are not (iron). If options A, B, and D are incorrect, then the only one left is option C (potatoes, apricots, and brussels sprouts. A large number of fruits and vegetables are rich in potassium and vitamins. Notes 1. Foods with high tyramine content can cause dangerous food-drug interactions with isocarboxide [Marplan], phenelzine tranylcypromine [Parnate]). 2. Foods and supplements containing stimulants, such as caffeine and ephedra, are best avoided by patients with hypertension, arrhythmias, high risk for MI, hyperthyroid disease, albuterol use, amphetamine use, etc. 3. If one of the food choices in an answer option is incorrect, rule out this option because all of the foods on the list have to be correlated. Examples of Food Groups 1. Gluten (avoid with celiac disease/celiac sprue): Wheat (including spelt and kamut), rye, barley (breads, cereals, pasta, cookies, cakes) Gluten-free (safe carbohydrates): Corn, rice, potatoes, quinoa, tapioca, soybeans 2. Plant sterols and stanols (reduce cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides): sterol-fortified spreads (Benecol spread), sterol-fortified foods, wheat germ, sesame oil 3. Monounsaturated fats/fatty acids (decrease risk of heart disease): Olive oil, canola oil, some nuts (almonds, walnuts), sunflower oil/seeds Mediterranean diet, which is high in monounsaturated fats 4. Saturated fats or trans fats (increase risk of heart disease): Lard, beef fat (fatty steak), deep-fried fast foods 5. Omega-3 or fish oils (decrease risk of heart disease): Fatty cold-water marine fish 6144 (salmon), fish oils, flaxseed oil, and krill oil 6. Magnesium (decreases BP, dilates blood vessels): Some nuts (almonds, peanuts, cashews), some beans, whole wheat; also found in laxatives, antacids, milk of magnesia 7. Potassium (helps decrease BP): Most fruits (especially apricot, banana, orange, prune juice), some vegetables 8. Folate (decreases homocysteine levels and fetal neural tube defects): Breakfast cereals fortified with folate, green leafy vegetables (i.e., spinach), liver 9. Iron (treats iron-deficiency anemia): Beef, liver, black beans, black-eyed peas 10. Vitamin K (should control intake if on anticoagulants): Green leafy vegetables (kale, collard greens, spinach), broccoli, cabbage 11. High sodium content (increases water retention, can increase BP): Cold cuts, pickles, preserved foods, canned foods, hot dogs, chips 12. Calcium (helps with osteopenia and osteoporosis, helps decrease BP): Low-fat dairy, low-fat milk, low-fat yogurt, cheeses Common Disorders Associated With Certain Foods 1. Celiac disease Lifetime avoidance of gluten-containing cereals such as wheat, rye, and barley Gluten-free: Rice, corn, potatoes, peanuts, soy, beans, meat, dairy, all fruits/vegetables; most people with celiac disease can eat oats 2. Hypertension Maintain an adequate intake of calcium, magnesium, and potassium Calcium: Low-fat dairy, low-fat yogurt, cheeses Magnesium: Wheat bread, nuts (almonds, peanuts, cashews), some beans Potassium: Most fruits (apricot, banana, oranges, cantaloupes, raisins), green vegetables Avoid high-sodium foods: Cold cuts, pickles, preserved foods, canned foods, preservatives headaches draft beer, fermented foods 4. Anticoagulation therapy (i.e., warfarin sodium or Coumadin) Keep daily intake of vitamin K-containing foods such as green leafy vegetables (kale/collard greens, spinach, cabbage), broccoli stable; vitamin K decreases the effectiveness of warfarin sodium; avoid excessive intake of vitamin K-rich foods CASE MANAGEMENT I. Discussion Only Medical case managers are experienced RNs who work for hospitals, health care plans, and health insurance companies. Their job is essentially to coordinate the outpatient health care of patients with high-cost chronic conditions. The goal of case management is to decrease disease exacerbations and decrease the risk of hospitalization. 6245 Asthma A good outcome for children with asthma is their ability to attend school full time and to play normally every day. A poor case management outcome is if the child misses school and/or is unable to play due to poor control of asthma symptoms. Notes 1. With asthma, a good case outcome is for the child (or adult) to return to normal function. For children, it means the child is attending school and can play daily. If the child is not able to attend school full time (frequent absences), this is a poor case management outcome. 2. The risk factors for asthma fatality include a history of ED visits, frequent use of short-acting beta-agonist use (i.e., albuterol), nocturnal awakenings, increased dyspnea and wheezing, respiratory viral infection, etc. 3. Diseases that are selected for case management are usually chronic conditions such as asthma, congestive heart failure (CHF), HIV infection, chronic psychiatric conditions, and so on. A good outcome will show good symptom control, no exacerbations or hospitalizations. ALL QUESTIONS HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION I. Discussion Only Assume that all the questions on the exams contain enough information to answer them correctly. Do not read too much into a question or assume that it is missing some vital information. As far as the ANCC and AANPCB exams are concerned, all questions contain enough information to allow you to solve them correctly. Unless indicated otherwise, consider a patient is in good health unless a disease or other health condition is mentioned in the test question. EMERGENT CASES I. Discussion The ability to recognize and initially manage emergent conditions that may present in the primary care arena is a skill that is expected of all NPs. It is important to memorize not only the presenting signs and symptoms of a given condition, but also its initial management in primary care. Learn how these conditions present so that you can recognize them in the exam. The following is a list of emergent conditions that will be on the exam. (They are discussed in detail in the \"Danger Signals\" sections of Chapters 5 through 17 .) Danger Signals Cardiovascular System 63Acute myocardial infarction (MI) Congestive heart failure (CHF) Bacterial (AAA) Skin and Integumentary Angioedema/anaphylaxis Stevens-Johnson syndrome zoster opthalmicus Melanoma Basal cell carcinoma System appendicitis Acute pancreatitis Acute diverticulitis Acute torsion Priapism Prostate cancer Psychosocial Mental Health Depression with suicidal plan Acute serotonin syndrome Malignant neuroleptic syndrome Nervous System Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) Temporal arteritis headache Subarachnoid bleeding Acute bacterial meningitis Subdural hematoma Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Throat Retinal detachment Orbital cellulitis Optic neuritis 6446 Pulmonary System asthmatic exacerbation (impending respiratory failure) Pulmonary emboli Community-acquired pneumonia Lung cancer Renal System Acute pyelonephritis Acute renal failure Bladder cancer Women's Health Dominant breast mass attached to surrounding tissue Ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy Paget's disease of the breast Ovarian cancer II. Example An asthmatic male patient complains of a sudden onset of itching and coughing after taking two aspirin tablets for a headache in the waiting room. The patient's lips and eyelids are becoming swollen. The patient complains of feeling hot. Bright-red wheals are noted on his chest and arms and legs. Which of the following is the best initial intervention to follow? A) Call 911 B) Check the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and temperature C) Give an injection of aqueous epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) 0.5 mg IM into the vastus lateralis muscle immediately D) Initiate a prescription of a potent topical steroid and a Medrol Dose Pack III. Correct Answer: Option C C) Give an injection of aqueous epinephrine 1:1000 dilution (1 mg/mL) 0.5 mg IM into the vastus lateralis muscle immediately. IV. Question Dissection Best Clues 6547 The quick onset of symptoms, such as angioedema, after taking aspirin The classic signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis described in this case Severe anaphylactic episodes occur almost immediately or within 1 hour after exposure Notes 1. Treatment of anaphylaxis (in primary care): If only one clinician is present: Give an injection of epinephrine 1:1000 dilution 0.3 to 0.5 mg IM stat , and then call 911. May repeat dose within 5 minutes in case of poor response. 2. ED treatment medications: Administer epinephrine IM, 100% oxygen by face mask, an antihistamine (H1 blocker) such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), an H2 agonist), and glucocorticosteroids such as prednisone. Patients with an atopic history (asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis) with nasal polyps are at higher risk for aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) allergies. 4. Anaphylaxis is classified as a type I IgE-dependent reaction. 5. Biphasic anaphylaxis occurs in up to 23% of cases (symptoms recur within 8-10 hours after initial episode). This is the reason why these patients are prescribed a Medrol Dose Pack and a long-acting antihistamine after being discharged from the ED. 6. The most common triggers for anaphylaxis in children are foods. Medications and insect stings are the most common triggers in adults. PRIORITIZING OTHER EMERGENT CASES I. Discussion During life-threatening situations, managing the airway, breathing, and circulation (the ABCs) is always the top priority. If the question does not describe conditions requiring the ABCs, then the next level of priority is the acute or sudden change in the mental status and the level of consciousness (LOC). One of the most important clues in such problems is the acute timing of onset of symptoms or the sudden change of the LOC from the patient's \"baseline.\" II. Example A 16-year-old boy presents to a community clinic accompanied by his grandmother, who reports that he fell off his bike this morning. The patient now complains of a headache with mild nausea. The patient's grandmother reports that he was not wearing a helmet. The health history is uneventful. Which of the following statements is indicative of an emergent condition? A) The patient complains of multiple painful abrasions that are bleeding on his arms and legs 6648 B) The patient complains of a headache that is relieved by acetaminophen (Tylenol) C) The patient makes eye contact occasionally and answers with brief statements D) The patient is having difficulty with following normal conversation and answering questions III. Correct Answer: Option D D) The patient is having difficulty with following normal conversation and answering questions IV. Question Dissection Best Clues History of recent trauma that is followed by a headache with nausea. The patient did not wear a bicycle helmet. Notes 1. Any recent changes in LOC, even one as subtle as difficulty with normal conversation, should ring a bell in your head. 2. Notice the words \"normal conversation.\" Do not overread the question and ask yourself what they mean by \"normal conversation.\" Take it at face value. 3. Changes in LOC on the test are usually subtle changes. Signs to watch for include difficulty answering questions, slurred speech, apparent confusion, inability to understand instructions/conversation, being sleepy/lethargic, and so forth. 4. Even though the patient is bleeding, note that he has \"abrasions,\" which are superficial. 5. The behavior described in option C is considered \"normal\" for an adolescent male (or female). GERIATRICS I. Discussion The ANCC does not give any information about the number of questions by age group, but the AANPCB does. Elderly patients are divided into two age categories on the AANPCB exam. Those between the ages of 65 and 84 years are the \"young gerontologicals.\" Those from the age of 85 years and older are the \"frail elderly.\" The AANPCB's FNP exam has a total of 38 questions (29%) on gerontological topics. The AANPCB Adult-Gerontology NP exam has a total of 67 questions (50%) on gerontological topics. II. Example 6749 Which of the following drug classes is considered as first-line treatment for unipolar depression in the elderly? A) Selective reuptake Option A A) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) IV. Question Dissection Best Clues There are no obvious clues in this question. Answering it correctly is based on your recognizing that unipolar depression is the same disease entity as major/minor depression. Depression in bipolar patients is called bipolar depression . SSRIs are the first-line treatment for unipolar/major depression. They carry an FDA warning that they increase suicidality in children and young adults up to age 23 years. TCAs have many anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, sedation, arrhythmias, confusion, urinary retention, etc.). MAOIs have major food and drug interactions and are not first-line drugs. CHOOSING THE BEST INITIAL INTERVENTION I. Discussion Numerous questions on the exam will ask test-takers about the best initial intervention to perform in a given case scenario. The question may ask you to pick out the best initial evaluation, treatment, or statement to say to a patient. One reason why some test takers answer these questions incorrectly is because they skip a step in the \"SOAPE\" process (subjective, objective, assessment, planning, and evaluation). The first step of the patient evaluation is to find \"subjective\" information such as asking about the patient's symptoms and other historical/demographic information. The next step is to find \"objective\" information. This means performing a physical examination or other tests. It is best to start out \"low tech,\" such as performing a neurological exam for PVD or another low-tech maneuver. For example, in a case of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), it makes sense to check the pulse and BP first on the lower and upper extremities before ordering an expensive test such as an ultrasound Doppler flow study. The following are examples of actions that can be done using the \"SOAPE\" mnemonic as a guide. S: Look for Subjective Evidence 1. Interview the patient and/or family member about the history of the present illness. 2. Ask about the presentation of the illness (timing, signs and symptoms, etc.). 6850 3. Ask whether the patient is on any medication, inquire about the past medical history, diet, etc. 4. Be alert for the historical findings because they provide important clues that help point to the correct diagnosis (or differential diagnosis). O: Look for Objective Evidence 1. Perform a physical exam (general or targeted to the present complaints; examine associated systems in the differential, e.g., diabetic foot exams). 2. If applicable, perform a physical maneuver (Tinel's, Kernig's, drawer, etc.). 3. Order laboratory/other tests to \"rule in\" (or \"rule out\") the differential diagnosis. 4. If the laboratory test result is abnormal, you may be asked about the next step (such as a follow-up lab test that is more sensitive or specific). A: Diagnosis or Assessment 1. What is the most likely diagnosis based on the history, disease presentation, and physical exam findings? 2. If applicable, figure out whether the lab or other testing results point to a more specific diagnosis (or rule out a diagnosis). 3. Decide whether the condition is emergent or not (if applicable). P: Treatment Plan 1. Initiate or prescribe medications and symptomatic treatment (if applicable). 2. Educate the patient. 3. Recommend a follow-up visit to assess response to treatment, etc. E: Evaluate Response to the Treatment/Intervention or Evaluate the Situation 1. Decide where there is poor or no response to treatment (or worsens). 2. Decide whether a situation is emergent. II. Example A 13-year-old girl with a history of mild persistent asthma and allergic rhinitis complains of a cough that has been waking her up very early in the morning. She reports that she is wheezing more than usual. She is accompanied by her mother. Her last office visit was 8 months ago. Which of the following is the best initial course of action? A) Initiate a prescription of a short-acting beta-2 agonist QID PRN B) Refer the patient to an allergist for a scratch test C) Discuss her symptoms and other factors associated with the asthmatic exacerbation D) Perform a thorough physical exam and obtain blood work III. Correct Answer: Option C C) Discuss her symptoms and other factors associated with the asthmatic exacerbation IV. Question Dissection 69Best Clues The patient's asthma appears to be getting worse (wheezing more than usual, early- morning cough). There is a need to find out about precipitating factors, medication compliance, comorbid conditions, what is precipitating the asthma, and so on. Always obtain a history (subjective) before performing a physical exam and labs. The adolescent age group starts at age 13 years (ANCC). Notes The correct order of actions to follow in this case scenario is the following: 1. Interview the patient/parent to find out more about the symptoms, etc. (subjective). 2. Perform a thorough physical exam (objective). 3. Administer a nebulizer treatment. Check peak expiratory flow (PEF) before and after treatment to assess for effectiveness. 4. Initiate a prescription of a short-acting beta-2 agonist QID PRN and a low-dosed steroid inhaler BID. 5. Refer the patient to an allergist for a scratch test if you suspect the patient has allergic asthma (evaluation). 6. Patients with asthmatic exacerbations whose PEF is less than 50% of predicted value after being given nebulized albuterol/saline treatments should not be discharged. Consider calling 911. 7. The differential diagnosis for an early-morning cough includes postnasal drip, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, GERD, and so forth. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS I. Discussion Only It is very common for a question to ask for the sign(s) and/or symptom(s) of a disease process. After a description of a disease's signs and symptoms, you may be asked about the diagnosis or about the laboratory or follow-up tests for the disease. PICK OUT THE MOST SPECIFIC SIGN/SYMPTOM I. Discussion Always pick out the most specific answer to a question when it is asking about the signs and/or symptoms of a disease. Learn the unique or the most specific signs/symptoms associated with the disease. The following question is a good example of this concept. II. Example 7051 Which of the following is most likely to be found in patients with a long-standing case of iron-deficiency anemia? A) Pica B) Fatigue C) Pallor D) Irritability III. Correct Answer: Option A A) Pica IV. Question Dissection Best Clues The diagnosis (iron-deficiency anemia) Knowledge that pica is also associated with iron-deficiency anemia Notes 1. If you are guessing, use common sense. Fatigue and irritability are found in many conditions. 2. Pallor is also seen in many disorders such as shock, illness, and anemia. 3. By the process of elimination, you are left with option A, the correct choice. 4. Another specific clinical finding in iron-deficiency anemia is spoon- shaped nails (or koilonychia). Do not confuse this finding with pitted nails (psoriasis). DERMATOLOGY QUESTIONS I. Discussion Many of the questions from this area are also accompanied by a colored photograph (ANCC). The AANPCB does not use photographs yet but may do so in the future. One of the problems that students have with these questions is their unfamiliarity with the dermatologic terms used to describe the skin condition. A list and description of the primary and secondary skin lesions are available in Chapter 6 . Maculopapular: A skin rash that has both color (macular) and texture (small papules or raised skin lesions\u2014the color ranges from red [erythematous] to bright pink) Maculopapular rash in a lace-like pattern rosea) Vesicular rashes on herpes) II. Example 7152 A male nursing assistant who works in a nursing home is complaining of multiple pruritic rashes that have been disturbing his sleep at night for the past few weeks. He reports that several of the residents are starting to complain of pruritic rashes. On physical exam, the NP notices multiple small papules, some vesicles, and maculopapular excoriated rashes on the sides and the webs of the fingers, on the waist, and on the penis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Scarlatina B) Impetigo C) Erythema migrans D) Scabies III. Correct Answer: Option D D) Scabies IV. Question Dissection Best Clues History (pruritic rashes disturb sleep at night, and individual works in a higher risk area [nursing home]) Classic location of the rashes (finger webs, waist, penis) Notes 1. Assume that a patient has scabies if excoriated pruritic rashes are located in the finger webs and the penis until proven otherwise. Higher risk groups are health care providers or people who work with large populations such as those in schools, nursing homes, group homes, or prisons. 2. The usual recommendation is that all family members and close contacts be treated at the same time as the patient (spread by skin-to-skin contact). Used clothes/sheets should be washed in hot water and then dried or ironed with high heat. 3. The rash of scarlatina has a sandpaper-like texture and is accompanied by a sore throat, strawberry tongue, and skin desquamation (peeling) of the palms and soles. It is not pruritic. 4. The rash of impetigo initially appears as papules that develop into bullae. These rupture easily, becoming superficial, bright-red \"weeping\" rashes with honey- colored exudate that becomes crusted as it dries. The rashes are very pruritic and are located on areas that are easily traumatized, such as the face, arms, or legs. Insect bites, acne lesions, and varicella lesions can also become secondarily infected, resulting in impetigo. 5. Cutaneous larva migrans (creeping eruption) rashes are shaped like red raised wavy lines (serpiginous or snake-like) that are alone or a few may be grouped. They are red and very pruritic, and they become excoriated from scratching (appears maculopapular). 7253 6. The areas of the body that are commonly exposed directly to contaminated soil and sand, such as the soles of the feet, extremities, or the buttocks, are the most common locations for larva migrans. 7. Systemic treatment with either ivermectin once a day (for 1-2 days) or albendazole (for 3 days) is the preferred therapy for larva migrans. CHOOSING THE CORRECT DRUG I. Discussion Test-takers are expected to know not only a drug's generic and/or brand name, but also its drug class. If you are familiar only with the drug's brand name or generic form, you will still be able to recognize the drug on the test because both names will be listed. In addition, the drug's action, indication(s), common side effects, drug interactions, and contraindications are important to learn. Drugs may only be listed as a drug class. II. Example A 10-year-old female student complains of pain and decreased hearing in her left ear that is getting steadily worse. She has a history of allergic rhinitis and is allergic to dust mites. On physical exam, the left tympanic membrane is bulging and red with displaced landmarks. The tympanogram exam reveals a flat line. The student denies frequent ear infections, and the last antibiotic she took was 8 months ago for a urinary tract infection. She is allergic to sulfa and tells the NP that she will not take any erythromycin because it makes her very nauseated. Which of the following is the best choice of treatment for this patient? A) Amoxicillin 500 mg PO three times a day for 7 days B) Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) 20 mg PO as needed every 4 to 6 hours C) Fluticasone (Flonase) nasal inhaler 1 to 2 sprays each nostril every 12 hours D) Clarithromycin (Biaxin) 500 mg PO two times a day for 10 days III. Correct Answer: Option A A) Amoxicillin 500 mg PO three times a day for 7 days IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Red bulging tympanic membrane with cloudy fluid inside and displaced landmarks Last antibiotic taken was 8 months ago and ear infections were infrequent (lack of risk factors for beta-lactamase-resistant bacteria) Notes 1. This question is more complicated compared with the first example. Although the 7354 question is asking about the correct drug treatment, it also lists the signs/symptoms of the disease. In order to answer this question correctly, you must first arrive at the correct diagnosis, which is acute otitis media (AOM). 2. Amoxicillin is the preferred first-line antibiotic for both AOM and acute sinusitis in children (for patients with no risk factors for resistant organisms). 3. The ideal patient is someone who has not been on any antibiotics in the past 3 months and/or does not live in an area with high rates of beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. 4. If the patient is a treatment failure, or was on an antibiotic in the previous 3 months, then a second-line antibiotic, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) BID or cefdinir (Omnicef) BID, should be given. 5. If penicillin-allergic, an alternative is azithromycin (Z-Pack) and clarithromycin (Biaxin) BID. 6. Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) is for symptoms only. Do not use for infants, young children, or patients with hypertension. 7. A nasal steroid spray BID is a good adjunct treatment for this patient because of allergic rhinitis, which causes the eustachian tube to swell and get blocked. DIAGRAMS I. Discussion The only diagram seen on the test at the moment is one of a chest with the four cardiac ausculatory areas (aortic, pulmonic, tricuspid, and mitral) marked. The diagram is used for questions on either cardiac murmurs or the heart sounds. II. Example Which of the following is the best location to auscultate for the S3 heart sound? A) Aortic area B) Pulmonic area C) Tricuspid area D) Mitral area III. Correct Answer: Option B D) Mitral area IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Memorization of the S3 heart sound facts Notes 741. The mitral area, sometimes called the cardiac apex, is the optimal location to hear the S3. 2. This area is located at the left fifth intervertebral space, along the mid-clavicular line. 3. The left lateral recumbent position brings the apex closer to the chest wall and improves the practitioner's ability to hear the left ventricular S3. \"GOLD STANDARD\" TESTS I. Discussion Learn to distinguish between a screening test and a diagnostic test (the \"gold standard\"). Depending on the disease process, the preferred diagnostic test might be a biopsy (e.g., melanoma), blood culture (e.g., septicemia), or an MRI scan (e.g., meniscus cartilage damage). In contrast, screening tests are generally more available and cost-effective. Some examples of screening tests are the CBC (anemia), BP (hypertension), Mantoux test (TB), or a UA (UTI). The ideal screening test is one that can detect a disease at an early-enough stage so that it can help to decrease the morbidity and mortality. A good example of a disease with no approved screening test is ovarian cancer. The CA-125 is not sensitive enough to detect ovarian cancer during the early stages of the disease when it is potentially curable. II. Example A middle-aged male nurse is having his Mantoux test result checked. A reddened area of 10.5 mm is present. It is smooth and soft and does not appear to be indurated. During the interview, the patient denies fever, cough, and weight loss. Which of the following is a true statement? A) The Mantoux test result is negative B) The Mantoux test result is borderline C) The Mantoux test should be repeated in 2 weeks D) A chest x-ray and sputum culture are indicated III. Correct Answer: Option A A) The Mantoux test result is negative IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Knowledge that skin induration, not the red color, is the best indicator of a positive reaction Lack of signs or symptoms of TB 7555 Notes 1. When some test-takers see the 10.5-mm size and the red color, they assume automatically that it is a positive result. 2. The Mantoux test (TB skin test) result is negative because of the description of the soft and smooth skin (it is not indurated). Erythema alone is not an important criterion. The area must be indurated (firm texture) and of the correct size to be positive for TB. 3. For pulmonary TB, a sputum culture is the gold standard. Treatment is started with at least three antitubercular drugs because of high rates of resistance. When the sputum culture and sensitivity result are available, the antitubercular antibiotic treatment can be narrowed down or changed. Another drug can be added. 4. TB is a reportable disease. Noncompliant patients who refuse treatment can be quarantined to protect the public. 5. A baseline LFT level and follow-up testing are recommended for patients on isoniazid (INH). ARE TWO NAMES BETTER THAN ONE? I. Discussion Some diseases and conditions are known by two different names that are used interchangeably in both the clinical area and the literature. Sometimes the alternate name is the one being used in the exam questions. This can fool the test-taker who is familiar with the disease but only recognizes it under its other name. II. Examples 1. Degenerative joint disease (DJD), or osteoarthritis 2. Atopic dermatitis, or eczema 3. lupus erythematosus (SLE) 5. Otitis media with effusion (OME), or middle ear effusion (MEE) 6. Group A beta Streptococcus , Vitamin B 12 , or cobalamin, or cyanocobalamin 10. Vitamin B 1 , or thiamine 11. Scarlet fever, or scarlatina 12. Otitis externa, or swimmer's ear 13. Condyloma Tic douloureux, or trigeminal neuralgia 15. Tinea cruris, or jock itch 16. Thalassemia minor, or thalassemia trait (either alpha or beta) 17. Giant cell arteritis, or temporal arteritis 7656 18. Psoas sign, or iliopsoas sign 19. Tinea capitis, or ringworm of the scalp 20. Light reflex, or the Hirschberg (corneal reflex) test 21. Sentinel nodes, or Virchow's nodes 22. Mantoux test or TB skin test (TST) 23. Erythema migrans, or early Lyme disease 24. Sinusitis, or rhinosinusitis 25. Major depression, or unipolar depression SUICIDE RISK AND DEPRESSION I. Discussion All depressed patients should be screened for suicidal and/or homicidal ideation. This is true in the clinical arena as well as on the exam. Avoid picking statements that do not directly address the patient's suicidal and homicidal plans. Risk factors for suicide and depression are discussed in Chapter 15 . Incorrect answers are statements that are judgmental, reassuring to the patient, vague, disrespectful, or do not address the issue of suicide (or homicide) in a direct manner. II. Example An NP working in a school health clinic is evaluating a new student who has been referred by a teacher. The student is a 16-year-old boy with a history of attention deficit disorder (ADD). He complains that his parents are always fighting and he thinks that they are getting divorced. He reports that he is failing two classes. During the interview, he stares at the floor and avoids eye contact. He reports that he is having problems falling asleep at night and has stopped seeing friends, including his girlfriend. Which of the following statements is the best choice to ask this teen? A) \"Do you want me to call your parents after we talk?\" B) \"Do you have any plans for killing or hurting yourself or other people?\" C) \"Do you have any close male or female friends?\" D) \"Do you want to wait to tell me about your plans until you feel better?\" III. Correct Answer: Option B B) \"Do you have any plans for killing or hurting yourself or other people?\" IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Classic behavioral cues (avoidance of eye contact, insomnia, social isolation) Parents fighting and getting divorced 7757 Notes 1. Option B is the most specific approach in the evaluation for suicide in this case. 2. Although option C (\"Do you have any close male or female friends?\") is a common question asked of depressed patients, it is incorrect because it does not give specific information about specific plans of suicide or of homicide. 3. Always avoid picking answer choices in which an intervention is delayed. The statement \"Do you want to wait to tell me about your plans until you feel better?\" is a good example. This advice is applicable to all areas of the test. 4. Teenagers are separating from their parents emotionally and value their privacy highly. When interviewing a teen, do it privately (without parents) and also with the parent(s) present. OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS I. Discussion Other psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, minor depression, anxiety, panic disorder, alcohol addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), ADD, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be included in the exams. Not all of these disorders are usually seen together in one exam. The most common psychiatric conditions on the exam are major depression, alcohol abuse, and suicide risk. The question may be as straightforward as querying about the correct drug treatment for the condition, as illustrated in this example. II. Example Which of the following drug classes is indicated as first-line treatment of both major depression and OCD? A) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) B) Tricyclic C) Mood stabilizers D) Benzodiazepines III. Correct Answer: Option A A) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Rule out benzodiazepines, which are used to treat anxiety or insomnia (process of elimination) Mood stabilizers, such as lithium salts, are used to treat bipolar disorder (process of elimination) 7858 The stem is asking for the \"first-line treatment\" for depression, which is the SSRIs Notes 1. TCAs are not first-line treatment for depression (SSRIs are first-line treatment). 2. TCAs are also used as prophylactic treatment for migraine headaches, chronic pain, and neuropathic pain (i.e., tingling, burning) such as postherpetic neuralgia. Examples of TCAs are amitriptyline (Elavil) and nortriptyline (Pamelor). 3. Do not give suicidal patients a prescription for TCAs because of the high risk of hoarding the drug and overdosing. Overdose of TCAs can be fatal (cardiac and CNS toxicity). 4. SSRIs are also first-line treatment for OCD, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder (extreme shyness), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, and premenstrual mood disorder are also used for chronic pain and trigeminal neuralgia. ABUSIVE SITUATIONS I. Discussion Health care workers are required by law to report suspected and actual child abuse to the proper authorities. Abuse-related topics may include domestic violence, physical abuse, child abuse, child neglect, elderly abuse, elderly neglect, and sexual abuse. II. Example A 16-year-old teenager with a history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is brought in to the ED by his mother. She does not want her son to be alone in the room. The NP doing the intake notes several burns on the teen's trunk. Some of the burns appear infected. The NP documents the burns as mostly round in shape and about 0.5 cm (centimeter) in size. Which of the following questions is most appropriate to ask the child's mother? A) \"Your son's back looks terrible. What happened to him?\" B) \"Does your son have more friends outside of school?\" C) \"Did you burn his back with a cigarette?\" D) \"Can you please tell me what happened to your son?\" III. Correct Answer: Option D D) \"Can you please tell me what happened to your son?\" 7959 IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Option D is the only open-ended question in the group In addition, it is not a judgmental statement Notes 1. In general, open-ended questions are usually the correct answer in cases in which an NP is trying to elicit the history in an interview. 2. \"Your son's back looks terrible. What happened to him?\" and \"Did you burn his back with a cigarette?\" Both are considered judgmental questions and are always the wrong choice. 3. These types of questions are more likely to make people defensive and/or hostile and cause them to end the conversation. 4. \"Does your son have more friends outside of school?\" This question does not address the immediate issue of the burn marks on the boy's back. 5. Communication tips: Questions on Abuse: If a history is being taken, pick the open-ended question first. Interview both the patient and possible \"abuser\" together, and then interview the patient separately. Questions on Depression: Pick the statement that is the most specific to find out whether the patient is suicidal or homicidal. Any answer considered judgmental or confrontational is wrong. Do not pick answers that \"reassure\" patients about their issues, because this discourages them from verbalizing more about it. In addition, do not ignore cultural beliefs. Integrate them into the treatment plan if they are not harmful to the health of the patient. THE \"CAGE\" MNEMONIC I. Discussion The CAGE is a screening tool used to screen patients for possible alcohol abuse. A positive response to two out of four questions is highly suggestive of alcohol abuse. In the exam, you are expected to use higher level cognitive skills and apply the concepts of CAGE. Examples of this concept are the questions that ask you to pick the patient who is most likely (or least likely) to abuse alcohol. CAGE Screening Tool (Two or More Positive Answers Is Suggestive of Alcoholism) C: Do you feel the need to cut down? 8060 A: Are you a nnoyed when your friends/spouse comment about your drinking? G: Do you feel g uilty about your drinking? E: Do you need to drink e arly in the morning? (eye-opener) II. Example Which of the following individuals is least likely to have an alcohol abuse problem? A) A woman who gets annoyed if her best friend talks to her about her drinking habit B) A carpenter who drinks two cans of beer when playing cards with friends C) A nurse who feels shaky when she wakes up and drinks one glass of wine to feel better. D) A college student who tells his friend that he drinks only on weekends but feels that he should be drinking less III. Correct Answer: Option B B) A carpenter who drinks two cans of beer nightly when playing cards with friends IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Lack of risk factor (two cans of beer at night is considered normal consumption for males); for females, the limit is one drink per day (one 12 oz. beer, 5 oz. wine) There is no description of any negative effects on the carpenter's daily functioning, social environment, or mental state Notes Any person who feels compelled to drink (or use drugs) no matter what the consequences are to his or her health, finances, career, friends, and family is addicted to the substance. 1. \"A woman who gets annoyed if her best friend talks to her about her drinking habit.\" This is the \"A\" in CAGE (\"annoyed\"), a good example of an alcohol abuser getting annoyed when someone close remarks about her drinking problem. 2. \"A nurse who feels shaky when she wakes up and drinks one glass of wine to feel better.\" This is the \"E\" in CAGE (\"eye-opener\"). The patient is having withdrawal symptoms and must drink in order to feel better. 3. \"A college student who tells his friend that he drinks only on weekends but feels that he should be drinking less.\" This fits the \"C\" in CAGE (\"cut down\"). This student is aware that he is drinking too much. PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT FINDINGS I. Discussion 8161 Questions about physical exam findings are plentiful. Learn the classic presentation of disease and emergent conditions. The knowledge of normal findings, as well as some variants, is important for the exam. In addition, if the question style used is negatively worded, careful reading is essential. II. Example An older woman complains of a new onset of severe pain in her right ear after taking swimming classes for 2 weeks. On physical exam, the right ear canal is red and swollen. Purulent green exudate is seen inside. Which of the following is an incorrect statement? A) Pulling on the tragus is painful B) The tympanic membrane is translucent with intact landmarks C) The external ear canal is swollen and painful D) Tenderness of the mastoid area during palpation III. Correct Answer: Option D D) The tympanic membrane is translucent with intact landmarks IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Positive risk factor (history of swimming) Classic signs (reddened and swollen ear canal with green exudate) Notes 1. Acute otitis externa is a superficial infection of the skin in the ear canal. It is more common during warm and humid conditions such as swimming and summertime. 2. The most common bacterial pathogen is Pseudomonas (bright-green pus). 3. Otitis externa does not involve the middle ear or the tympanic membrane (translucent tympanic membrane with intact landmarks, no redness, no bulging). 4. Acute mastoiditis is a possible complication of AOM. TWO-PART QUESTIONS I. Discussion There may be case scenarios that are followed by two questions. These questions are problematic because the two questions are dependent on each other. To solve both correctly, the test-taker must answer the first portion by figuring out the diagnosis in order to solve the second question correctly. II. Example 82Part One An adolescent male reports the new onset of symptoms 2 weeks after returning from a hiking trip in North Carolina. He presents with complaints of high fever, severe headache, muscle aches, lack of appetite and nausea. The symptoms are accompanied by a generalized red rash that is not pruritic. The rash initially appeared on both ankles and wrists and then spread toward the patient's trunk. The rash involves both the palms and the soles. Which of the following conditions is most likely? A) Meningococcemia B) Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) C) Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) D) Lyme disease Part Two Which of the following is the best treatment plan to follow? A) Refer the patient to the hospital ED B) Refer the patient to an infectious disease specialist C) Initiate a prescription of oral glucocorticoids D) Collect a blood specimen for culture and sensitivity III. Correct Answers Part One: Option B B) Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) Part Two: Option A A) Refer the patient to the hospital ED IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Part One Location and activity (south-central United States, outdoor activity) Classic rash (red rash on both wrists and ankles that spreads centrally with involvement of the palms and the soles) Systemic symptoms (high fever, headache, myalgia, nausea) Part Two Knowledge of the emergent nature of RMSF (can cause death if not treated within the first 8 days of symptoms) Notes 1. Early treatment is important, and empiric treatment should be started early if 8362 RMSF is suspected. Refer the patient to the closest ED as soon as possible. 2. It may be difficult to distinguish RMSF from meningococcemia before the blood culture results and the CSF culture results are available. 3. Doxycycline is the preferred agent for both children and adults. 4. RMSF: Dog/wood tick bite; spirochete called Rickettsia rickettsii Treat with doxycycline 100 mg PO/IV for a minimum of 7 days or longer 5. Early Lyme disease (erythema migrans rash stage): Ixodes Treat with doxycycline \u00d7 21 days Majority of the cases are in the mid-Atlantic and New England states (i.e., CT, MA, NY, NJ, PA). 6. ITP severity ranges from mild to severe (platelet count <30,000/ L). Platelets are broken down by the spleen, causing thrombocytopenia. Look for easy bruising, petechiae, purpura, epistaxis, and gingival bleeding (combined with low platelet count). 7. Initial treatment for ITP is glucocorticoids (i.e., prednisone) based on platelet response. NORMAL PHYSICAL EXAM FINDINGS I. Discussion A good review of normal physical exam findings and some benign variants is necessary. Pertinent physical exam findings are discussed at the beginning of each organ system review. A good resource to use in your review is the advanced physical assessment textbook that was used in your program. Keep in mind that sometimes questions about normal physical findings are written as if they were a pathological process. This is important to remember when you encounter these types of questions. II. Example A 13-year-old girl complains of an irregular menstrual cycle. She started menarche 6 months ago. Her last menstrual period was 2 months ago. She denies being sexually active. Her urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following would you tell the child's mother? A) Consult with a pediatric endocrinologist to rule out problems with the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis B) Advise the mother that irregular menstrual cycles are common during the first year after menarche C) Advise the mother that her child is starting menarche early and has precocious puberty D) Ask the medical assistant to get labs drawn for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol levels 8463 III. Correct Answer: Option B B) Advise the mother that irregular menstrual cycles are common during the first year after menarche IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Patient recently started menarche 6 months ago (knowledge of pubertal changes); the ovaries may not ovulate monthly (resulting in irregular periods) when starting menarche The teen is not sexually active (rule out pertinent negative, such as the negative pregnancy test) Notes 1. This question describes normal growth and development in adolescents. 2. When girls start menarche, their periods may be very irregular for several months up to 2 years. ADOLESCENCE I. Discussion During this period of life, numerous changes are occurring, both physically and emotionally. Adolescents are thinking in more abstract ways and are psychologically separating from their parents. The opinions of peers are more important than those of the parents. Privacy is a big issue in this age group and should be respected. II. Example Which of the following is the second highest cause of mortality among adolescents and young adults in this country? A) Suicide B) Smoking C) Homicide D) Illicit drug use III. Correct Answer: Option A A) Suicide IV. Question Dissection Best Clues 8564 Rote memory (suicide is the second highest cause of mortality among adolescents) Notes 1. According to the CDC, the number one cause of mortality in this age group is motor vehicle crashes. 2. The second most common cause of mortality in adolescents in the United States is suicide and the third is homicide. 3. Screening for depression in all adolescents is recommended. Signs of a depressed teen include falling grades, acting out, avoiding socializing, moodiness, and so forth. 4. Smoking is ruled out because its health effects take decades (i.e., COPD). 5. Mortality from illicit drug use is more common among adults. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS I. Discussion Differential diagnoses are the conditions whose presentations share many similarities. For example, the differential diagnoses to consider for chronic cough (a cough lasting more than 8 weeks) are asthma, GERD, ACE inhibitors, chronic bronchitis, lung cancer, and lung infections such as TB (and many more). As a clinician, your ability to apply differential diagnosis is important for patient safety. In this type of question, the differential diagnoses are the distractors. II. Example A 67-year-old man walks into an urgent care center. The patient complains of episodes of chest pain in his upper sternum when he is climbing up stairs in his apartment building. When he stops the activity, the pain goes away. He reports that once when he was eating a steak dinner, he also experienced the chest pain. A fasting total lipid profile is ordered. The result reveals total cholesterol of 250 mg/dL, LDL of 180 mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) of 25 mg/dL. Which of the following is most likely? A) Acute esophagitis B) Myocardial infarction (MI) C) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) D) Angina III. Correct Answer: Option D D) Angina IV. Question Dissection Best Clues 8665 Classic presentation (chest pain that is precipitated by exertion and is relieved by rest) History (several episodes of the same chest pain) Positive risk factors (low HDL, elevated lipid levels, age, and gender) Notes All four answer options are some common conditions that can mimic angina (differential diagnoses). Rule out the pertinent negatives. Pain is relieved by rest (angina). If pain not relieved by rest, then rule out angina. Risk factors for heart disease and chest pain (angina, MI) are present. Physical activity aggravates the condition (angina, MI). There is a lack of history of aggravating factors such as intake of certain meds such as NSAIDs, aspirin, bisphosphonates, or alcohol (rule out esophagitis). Chest pain is not related to meals (rule out GERD). CLASSIC PRESENTATION I. Discussion Because certification exams are administered all over the country, the questions are written to conform to the classic \"textbook presentation.\" This allows the test to be valid and statistically sound. All of the questions on the exam are referenced by at least two to three reliable sources. For both exams, a large number of clinical questions are referenced by popular medical and nursing textbooks. The disease process is described at its height, although in real-life practice, the signs and/or symptoms are dependent upon the stage of the illness. For example, for the majority of disease processes, usually the prodromal period, or the early phase, is asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, while during the height of the illness, the full signs and symptoms are usually present. II. Example While performing a routine physical exam on an older White male patient with a history of cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, the NP palpates a pulsatile mass in the patient's midabdominal area. A bruit is auscultated over the soft mass. Which of the following is the recommended imaging method? A) CT scan B) Abdominal ultrasound C) Radiography of the chest D) Plain film of the abdomen III. Correct Answer: Option B B) Abdominal ultrasound 87IV. Question Dissection Best Clues Pulsatile mass located in the middle of the abdomen that is associated with a bruit Patient demographics Notes 1. This question describes the classic case of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). 2. Some of the risk factors for AAA are male gender (age older than 60 years), smoker, uncontrolled hypertension, White race, genetic diseases such as Marfan syndrome, and family history. 3. Signs and symptoms of AAA rupture are abrupt onset of severe abdominal pain with low-back pain and abdominal distension with signs and symptoms of shock. 4. The initial imaging diagnostic test to order is the abdominal ultrasound. ETHNIC BACKGROUND I. Discussion Ethnic background is an important clue for certain genetic disorders. For example, Tay- Sachs, a rare and fatal genetic disorder, is most common among Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jews. A warning about ethnic background: It can also be used as a distractor. In most medical conditions, the patient's ethnic background does not affect the treatment plan or the patient's response to treatment. The next question is an example of this concept. II. Example Which of the following laboratory tests is a sensitive indicator of renal function in people of African descent? A) Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) B) Serum creatinine concentration C) Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) D) Serum BUN-to-creatinine ratio The question in this example can also be phrased as: Which of the following laboratory tests is a sensitive indicator of renal function in people of Hispanic descent? Or Asian descent? III. Correct Answer: Option C C) Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) IV. Question Dissection 8866 Best Clues Knowledge that the eGFR is a better test of renal function compared with the serum creatinine concentration Notes 1. A GFR value of 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or less is a sign of kidney damage (refer to a nephrologist). 2. The eGFR is an \"estimated\" value (it is not measured directly) and is computed by using specific formulas (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] study equation, Cockcroft-Gault, others). 3. The serum creatinine is affected by age (less sensitive in elderly), gender (higher in males), ethnicity (higher with African background), and other factors. 4. The BUN is a waste product of the protein from foods that you have eaten. If you eat more protein before the test, it will increase (or decrease with low protein intake). 5. Dehydration will elevate the BUN value. SENTINEL EVENTS I. Discussion The Joint Commission adopted a Sentinel Event Policy in 1996 to assist ambulatory care centers and hospitals improve patient safety. A sentinel event is defined as \"a patient safety event (not primarily related to the natural course of patient's illness or underlying condition) that reaches a patient and results in any of the following: death, permanent harm, or severe temporary harm\" (The Joint Commission, 2016). Sentinel events require immediate investigation. II. Example All of the following are considered sentinel events except: A) Unanticipated death of a full-term infant B) Abduction of any patient who is receiving treatment or services C) Suicide of a patient who is receiving around-the-clock care D) Nausea and vomiting caused by a prescription of oral erythromycin III. Correct Answer: Option D D) Nausea and vomiting caused by a prescription of oral erythromycin IV. Question Dissection Best Clues 89If you are not sure of the answer, one way to guess is to look for a pattern or for contextual clues Notice that options A, B, and C all have something in common; they are all serious patient safety events Option D is not considered a serious patient event. GI side effects, such as nausea/vomiting, anorexia, and abdominal pain, are not life-threatening An example of a sentinel event involving medications is when a patient who is allergic to a drug (e.g., macrolides) is prescribed erythromycin, resulting in death of the patient due to anaphylaxis __________ * For additional information, see http://ancc.nursecredentialing.org/certification/ExamResources/SampleQuestions/FamilyNP/demo/item3.htm 9067 3 Pharmacology Review During your review, memorize both the drug class and the representative drug(s) for that particular class. The reason is that sometimes drugs are listed by class only. Memorizing drug doses is generally not emphasized to the same extent as on the NCLEX-RN \u00ae examination. Higher level thinking skills, such as knowledge of drug indications and drug safety issues, are considered more important in the nurse practitioner (NP) examinations. Learn about clinically important drug \"safety\" issues, such as drug-drug interactions, disease-drug interactions, and the adverse reactions that are seen in the primary care area. For example, one of the most common drug interactions in the primary care area is between warfarin sodium (Coumadin) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim). Sulfa drugs will interact with warfarin (increases the blood level), which results in an elevation of the INR and the risk of bleeding. The most common question about drugs (prescription and over-the-counter [OTC]) is related to disease management. These questions involve the correct drug(s) used to treat a condition. The drugs that are included in the examinations are usually the \"older\" drugs that have been in use for several years to several decades (e.g., doxycycline, amoxicillin). Drugs that have been recently released (past 6 months or less) will not be included on the examinations. Lately, there have been a few questions about pharmacokinetics (e.g., first- pass metabolism, excretion). This section is not meant to be a comprehensive review of pharmacology. The goal is to help you understand pharmacologic concepts, drug names, drug class, drug interactions, disease-drug interactions, types of laboratory tests needed for certain medications in order to help you pass your American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) or American Academy of Nurse Practitioners Certification Board (AANPCB) certification exam. Do not use the contents of this review book for clinical practice. ORAL DRUGS: FIRST-PASS HEPATIC METABOLISM 9168 (OR FIRST-PASS EFFECT) All oral drugs must go through \"first-pass metabolism\" before they can be used by the body. When a drug is swallowed, it is absorbed through the small intestine where it enters the portal circulation. Inside the liver, the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system is responsible for the biotransformation of not only many drugs, but other substances such as alcohol, herbs, and some foods and toxins. Drugs that have extensive first-pass metabolism cannot be given by the oral route simply because there is not enough of the active drug left. A good example is insulin, which, if given by the oral route, is completely broken down in the GI tract (by enzymes). To bypass first-pass metabolism, insulin must be given by injection. DRUG METABOLISM (BIOTRANSFORMATION) The most active organ is the liver (CYPP450 enzyme system). The CYP450 system can either be induced (increase drug metabolism) or it can be inhibited (slow down drug metabolism). Genetic variants of the CYP450 system and receptors determine how an individual's body breaks down and reacts to a drug. The other organ systems that are involved in biotransformation of drugs are the kidneys, the GI tract (breakdown by gut bacteria), and the lungs (CO 2 ). DRUG EXCRETION Almost all drugs/chemicals are broken down by the liver and excreted from the body in the bile, urine, feces, respiratory gas (CO 2 ), and as sweat (sweat glands). It is unusual to have a drug that is totally (100%) broken down by only one organ (e.g., kidneys only). Most drugs are excreted by both the hepatobiliary system and the kidneys. PHARMACOLOGY TERMS Half-life (t\u00bd): The amount of time in which drug concentration decreases by 50% Area under the curve (AUC): The average amount of a drug in the blood after a dose is given it is a measure of the availability (bioavailability) of a drug after it is administered Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): The lowest concentration of an antibiotic that will inhibit the growth of organisms (after overnight incubation) Maximum concentration : The highest concentration of a drug after a dose Trough (minimum concentration) : The lowest concentration of a drug after a dose POTENT INHIBITORS: CYP450 SYSTEM The following are some \"problematic\" drugs. These drugs are responsible for a large number of drug-drug interactions. Drugs that act as inhibitors slow down drug clearance 9269 (increase drug concentration). When this happens, the patient is at high risk for a drug overdose and adverse effects. When a test question is asking about a drug interaction, think of these drugs and drug drug, grapefruit juice affects the CYP450 system. Drugs that are adversely affected by grapefruit juice include statins, Warfarin sodium Monitor levels Levothyroxine: Lithium: Monitor blood levels, TSH (risk of hypothyroidism) Table 3.1 Safety Issues With Some Prescription Drugs * Drug Class and Generic and Trade Names Safety Issues Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) Increased risk of fractures (postmenopausal women), pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, hypomagnesemia, B 12 gingko, and ginseng; other herbs/supplements: Feverfew, green tea, and fish oil; numerous drug interactions Discontinue 7 days before surgery TZDs Black Box Warning : Cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients; do not use if New York Health Association Class III or IV heart failure Pioglitazone (Actos) Stop if causes dyspnea, weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes; monitor weight every 3 months Black Box Warning : Higher mortality in elderly patients Monitor TSH, lipids, weight/body mass index Bisphosphonates Erosive esophagitis, abdominal pain, stop immediately if symptoms of esophagitis (chest pain, difficulty swallowing, burning midback) 9370 or jaw pain (osteonecrosis); take alone upon awakening with 8-oz glass water ( not juice) before breakfast; do not lie down for 30 minutes afterward; do not mix with other drugs; take first thing in the morning before breakfast Alendronate (Fosamax) Risedronate (Actonel) rhabdomyolysis higher if mixed with azole antifungals High-dose Zocor (80 mg) has highest risk of (muscle pain/tenderness) Chinese descent: Higher risk myopathy or rhabdomyolysis 40 mg/d (or kinase up Lincosamides Clindamycin (Cleocin) Higher risk of CDAD * List is not all inclusive. BID, twice a CDAD, hormone TZDs, thiazolidinediones. DRUGS USED TO TREAT DISEASE Cardiac Glycosides: Digoxin (Lanoxin) Treats certain supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and heart due to left ventricular [LV] systolic dysfunction Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic range (0.5-2.0 ng/mL). Not a first-line drug for heart rate control in most patients with atrial fibrillation Signs and symptoms of digoxin overdose: Initial symptoms are gastrointestinal (anorexia, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain). Others are arrhythmias, confusion, and visual changes (yellowish green tinged-color vision, scotomas) What laboratory tests should be ordered if digoxin toxicity is suspected? Order a digoxin level, G bind free digoxin in blood (Digibind, DigiFab). Potassium values (adult to elderly): Critical: Values that are less than 2.5 or greater than 6.5 mEq/L Normal: Values that are 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L Anticoagulants: Warfarin Sodium (Coumadin) FDA Pregnancy Category X K antagonist (VKA) Indications: Prophylaxis and treatment thromboembolic events associated with atrial fibrillation or heart valve replacement (pulmonary embolism [PE], deep venous thrombosis [DVT], stroke, thromboemboli) Duration of action: 2 to 5 days (single dose) For atrial fibrillation, target INR is 2.0 to 3.0 (ideal INR 2.5) Initial dose (outpatients): Starting dose 2 to 5 mg orally once a day (maintenance dose 2 to 10 mg per day based on INR value); may start lower doses if elderly patient, liver disease, etc; do not forget to check baseline PT, APTT, creatinine, LFTS, and INR On day 3 (outpatient): Periodically check INR (dose changes are based on INR value); consult with clinic's or hospital's warfarin-dosing protocols. Contraindications: See Table 3.3 .

ACEI, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin Stable INR Check every 2 to 4 weeks up to every 12 weeks per the ACCP Single Out-of-Range INR If patient has stable INR and has a single out-of-range INR equal to or less than 0.5 below or above therapeutic INR (2 to 3), experts suggest continuing current warfarin dose; retest INR within 1 to 2 weeks INR of Less Than 5 With No Significant Bleeding Risk Omit one dose and/or reduce maintenance dose slightly; recheck INR Signs and Symptoms: Elevated INR Educate patient to call if prolonged bleeding from cuts, frequent nosebleeds, bloody/tarry stool, hematuria, petechiae, excessive bruising, excessive menstrual bleeding, persistent oozing/bleeding gums after brushing, sudden decrease in hemoglobin, new onset of severe headache especially after a fall (CNS bleed). One Missed Dose Take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. Do not double dose the next day 96Vitamin K The ACCP advises against routine vitamin K1 (phytonadione) supplementation Dietary issues: Do not forget to review patient's daily dietary intake of vitamin K foods (kale, spinach, collards/mustard/beet greens, broccoli raab); high intake of vitamin K will reduce anticoagulant effect of warfarin (will decrease INR) Contraindications: See Table 3.3 Alcohol Avoid drinking or limit to no more than one to two servings occasionally; increases risk of bleeding even if INR is in target range Adverse Reaction \"Purple toes syndrome\" (rare); skin necrosis located in subcutaneous fat, breasts, extremities, trunk (within first few days of receiving large doses of warfarin) CLINICAL PEARLS After warfarin is discontinued, anticoagulant effects persist for 2 to 5 days. Be aware of increased bleeding risk with certain drugs ( Table 3.2 ) . Asian patients may require lower starting and maintenance doses of warfarin . Some genotypes require lower doses of warfarin . Persons older than 60 years are more likely to have larger increases in INR (after dose is increased) compared with younger patients . INR values lower than 2.0 increase stroke risk sixfold . Mayonnaise, canola oil, and soybean oil also have high levels of vitamin K . Warfarin algorithms and dosing (HCTZ) Chlorthalidone Indapamide (Lozol) Do not combine with lithium (increased risk of lithium toxicity) Contraindication : Sulfa allergy Adverse Effects Elevates plasma glucose/hyperglycemia (careful with diabetics) Elevates cholesterol and LDL (careful if preexisting hyperlipidemia) Elevates uric acid (can precipitate a gout (severe muscle weakness, arrhythmias) 9773 Pharma Notes Chlorthalidone is longer acting and more \"effective\" than HCTZ. Preferred by Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8). Patients with both hypertension and osteoporosis have an extra benefit from thiazides. Thiazide diuretics reduce calcium excretion by the kidneys and stimulate the osteoblasts. This helps build bone. Patients with serious sulfa allergies should avoid thiazide and loop diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics, such as triamterene and amiloride (Midamor), are the alternative options for these patients. Potassium-Sparing Diuretics Hypertension, alternative diuretic for Warning : Hyperkalemia, which can be fatal; higher risk with renal impairment, diabetes, elderly, severely ill Monitor serum potassium (baseline, during, dose changes, illness) Contraindications: See Table 3.3 . Mineralcorticoid Receptor Antagonists Spironolactone Eplerenone (Inspra) Pharma Notes Do not give potassium supplement. Avoid using salt substitutes that contain potassium. Be careful with combinations of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) or NSAIDs; increases risk of hyperkalemia. Avoid with severe renal disease (increases risk of hyperkalemia). Spironolactone adverse effects: Gynecomastia (13%) and hyperkalemia. Black Box Warning : There is increased risk of both benign and malignant tumors. Loop Diuretics 9874 Edema from heart failure, cirrhosis, renal disease, and hypertension Loop diuretics are excreted via the loop of Henle of the kidneys and are more potent than HCTZ Furosemide (Lasix) Bumetanide (Bumex) More potent than thiazides but with shorter duration of action Black Box Warning : Excessive amounts of furosemide may lead to profound diuresis; medical supervision required, individualized dose schedule Contraindication : Sulfa allergy Adverse Effects Electrolytes (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, aminoglycoside USED and MI (unless contraindicated such as shock, hypotension, severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first-degree block, chronic pulmonary disease) Adjunctive treatment: Hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis (decreases heart rate, and anxiety) noncardioselective or extended release (Inderal LA) Cardioselective beta-blockers are more potent because they block beta-1 receptors, which are found mainly in the heart Atenolol (Tenormin) daily Metoprolol immediate release (Lopressor) ophthalmic drops : See also Table 3.3 Asthma (causes bronchoconstriction) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; causes bronchoconstriction) third-degree block) Adverse Effects Bronchospasm (blocks beta-2 receptors in the lungs) 9975 Bradycardia (blocks beta-1 receptors in the heart) Depression, fatigue (careful with elderly) Erectile dysfunction Blunts hypoglycemic response (warn diabetic patients) HF ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (Colucci, 2018) Hypertension, diabetes (renal), chronic kidney disease (CKD), post-MI, heart failure Improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and survival post-MI Preferred agents for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are the ACEIs or ARBs, and mineral corticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone, eplerone) Category C (first trimester) and category D (second to third trimesters) ACE inhibition blocks conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (potent vasoconstrictor); ACEI suffix of \"pril\" ARBs block angiotensin II (less aldosterone); ARB suffix of \"sartan\" Black Box Warning : ACEIs can cause death/injury to the developing fetus during the second and third trimesters; discontinue ACEIs and ARBs immediately if pregnant Contraindications : of renin, JNC 8 does not recommend aliskiren as initial treatment for hypertension. Contraindications : Concomitant use of ACEI or ARBs, angioedema, pregnancy/breastfeeding, age younger than 2 years Pharma Notes ACEI cough occurs within the first few months of treatment. It is a dry and hacking cough (without other symptoms of upper respiratory infection). Stop ACEI and switch to an ARB. ACEIs and ARBs are preferred drugs for hypertension in diabetics (diabetic nephropathy), and for patients with CKD. Avoid using salt substitutes that contain potassium. Captopril is associated with agranulocytosis, neutropenia, leukopenia (rare). Monitor CBC. ACEIs and ARBs are excreted in breast milk (breastfeeding mothers should avoid them). CLINICAL PEARLS JNC 8 encourages use of chlorthalidone (longer acting, more effective). If your patient is already on HCTZ and doing well, do not change. But if you have a new hypertensive patient or one with a BP that is hard to control, consider chlorthalidone 12.5 to 25 mg alone or combined with ACEI or ARBs (or another antihypertensive drug class). Baseline electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and calcium, are needed. Be careful prescribing ACEIs/ARBs to sexually active, reproductive-aged females who are not consistently using birth control (categories C and D during the second and third trimester). Warn patients taking salt substitutes that some contain potassium. Calcium Channel Blockers (Calcium Antagonists) Hypertension, angina, Contraindications AV block (second- Bradycardia failure Notes use of short-acting acting calcium blockers such as nifedipine (increases mortality). Long-acting CCBs show no increased risk. Up to 25% patients on verapamil develop constipation. Adverse Effects Headache (vasodilation) Peripheral edema (not due to fluid overload) Bradycardia HF and heart block Hypotension, QT prolongation Constipation is the most commonly reported side effect Alpha-Blockers Hypertension with coexisting benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); initial therapy (Hytrin) 1 PO not give during cataract/glaucoma surgery (floppy iris syndrome) Pharma Notes This is not a first-line choice except for males with both hypertension and BPH. Potent vasodilator. Common side effects are dizziness and hypotension. Give at bedtime at very low dose and slowly titrate up. Careful with frail elderly (risk of syncope and falls). Some experts recommend taking some antihypertensive medications (except diuretics) in the evening. The physiologic increase in BP occurs in early morning (3 to 5 a.m.) and peaks in early afternoon. CLINICAL PEARLS 10278 In the United States, most heart attacks occur during the morning hours (6 a.m. to 12 p.m.). The day of the week when most MIs occur is Monday, and the season when most MIs occur is in winter. ANTIBIOTICS Antibiotics are either bacteriostatic or bactericidal. Bactericidal antibiotics kill bacteria. Bacteriostatic antibiotics limit bacterial growth and replication. The result is a lower bacterial count, which helps the immune system clear the infection. Tetracyclines (Category D) Tetracyclines are bacteriostatic. They may cause permanent discoloration of teeth (brown to yellow) and skeletal defects if taken during the last half of pregnancy, in infancy, or by children younger than 9 years of age. Generally, tetracyclines are not used in children who are younger than 9 years of age. Treat acne starting at age 13 to 14 years. By this age, all permanent teeth have erupted (except wisdom teeth). Doxycycline Minocycline Tetracycline Adverse Reactions Photosensitivity reaction (severe sunburns) occurs with minimal sunlight exposure; avoid or minimize sunlight exposure; use sunblock, wide-brim hats, and sunglasses Esophageal ulcerations are rare; swallow tablet completely using a full glass of water Contraindications : Avoid in pregnancy, infancy, and in children aged 8 years or younger Pharma Notes Do not use oral tetracycline for mild acne (comedones). Start with OTC topicals such as salicylic acid (Noxzema, Stridex) and benzoyl peroxide. For mild acne not responding to OTC drugs, try prescription topicals (benzoyl peroxide and erythromycin/Benzamycin), tretinoin (Retin-A), azelaic acid cream. Consider adding tetracycline if a patient with moderate inflammatory acne is not responding to topical prescriptions (Benzamycin, Retin-A, azelaic acid) after 2 to 3 months. Another option to tetracycline is minocycline (Minocin). Tetracycline binds to some minerals (calcium, dairy products, iron, magnesium, zinc). It is best to take it on an empty stomach. Take 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Tetracyclines may decrease effectiveness of oral contraceptive pills. 10379 Minocycline (Minocin) can cause vertigo (more common in females) that is dose related. It usually resolves in 1 to 2 days after discontinuation of the drug. Advise patients to throw away expired tetracycline pills (they degenerate and may cause nephropathy or Fanconi syndrome; Table 3.4 ). Table 3.4 Macrolides and Tetracyclines Generic Name (Trade Name) Interactions Macrolides Erythromycin BID to QID Azithromycin (Z-Pack) Clarithromycin BID Many Myasthenia gravis (respiratory failure) Anticoagulants: Warfarin Black Box Warning: Myasthenia gravis patients\u2014do not use Do not use in children; causes liver failure; avoid if history of jaundice/hepatitis from Same (use hat, sunblock) If taken without water and pill gets stuck in the esophagus, it can cause esophagitis/esophageal ulceration Binds with iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc Antacids, sucralfate, and bile acid sequestrants markedly decrease oral contraceptives (may decrease effectiveness); can cause pseudotumor cerebri BID, twice a day; QID, four times a day. Macrolides (Category B) Macrolides are bacteriostatic. They bacteria mycoplasma, with other antibiotic drug classes, macrolides (and quinolones) are associated with more drug interactions. Both erythromycin and clarithromycin (Biaxin) are potent CYP 34A inhibitors, but not azithromycin (which has fewer drug interactions). All macrolides are category B except clarithromycin and telithromycin (both are category C; avoid using nausea, vomiting) Ototoxicity, cholestatic jaundice QT with prolongation (risk of torsades de pointes) Pharma Notes Erythromycin's GI side effects are common (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea). If a condition must be treated with a macrolide (i.e., atypical bacteria) and the patient cannot tolerate erythromycin, switch the patient to azithromycin (Z-Pack) or triazolam, terfenadine). CLINICAL PEARLS Advise patients to use only one pharmacy so that all the drugs they take are on one database. This makes it easier for the pharmacy to check for drug interactions . May prolong INR and increase risk of bleeding if warfarin is mixed with erythromycin or clarithromycin . Cephalosporins (Category B) Cephalosporins and penicillins to the beta-lactam family of antibiotics. Beta-lactams are bactericidal and work by interfering with the cell wall synthesis of actively growing bacteria. There are five generations of cephalosporins. However, as the NP certification exams are about primary care conditions, only the first to the third generations are covered. First-Generation Cephalosporins Activity against gram-positive cocci bacteria (group A streptococcus, S. aureu s) Not effective against beta-lactamase producing strains and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Poor anaerobic coverage; increased risk of cross-reactivity if allergic to penicillin Second-Generation Cephalosporins Considered to be \"broad-spectrum\" antibiotics; used to against gram-positive infections compared to the first-generation cephalosporins 10581 Better protection against enterobacteria influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus ) generation cephalosporins Pharma Notes Rocephin (ceftriaxone) 250 mg IM is first-line treatment for gonorrheal infections. MRSA skin infections (boils, abscesses)\u2014do not use cephalosporins. therapy either trimethoprim-sulfa (Bactrim DS), doxycycline or minocycline, and clindamycin. Treat for at least 5 to 10 days. Patients who have a true allergy to penicillin (history of anaphylaxis, angioedema) are more likely to have an allergic reaction to cephalosporins (especially first generation). Anaphylaxis and angioedema are type 1 IgE-mediated reactions ( Table 3.5 ). Table 3.5 Cephalosporins and Penicillins * Generic Name (Trade Name) Indications Cephalosporins First generation Cephalexin (Keflex) PO QID Pregnancy: Urinary tract by MRSA), chronic bronchitis Avoid using cefaclor because it does not cover common pathogens Third generation Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) IM Cefixime (Suprax) Cefdinir (Omnicef) infections, pelvic inflammatory disease Renal: pyelonephritis ENT: Amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (Augmentin PO BID) Benzathine penicillin G IM Dicloxacillin PO QID Strep throat (first line) Otitis media (first line), rhinosinusitis (first line) Otitis media/rhinosinusitis (first second line) Cystitis cellulitis (not caused by MRSA), impetigo, erysipelas * List is not all inclusive. BID, twice a day; CAP, community-acquired pneumonia; ENT, VK, V potassium. Penicillins (Category B) 106Penicillins are bactericidal and directly kill bacteria. Amoxicillin and ampicillin are broad- spectrum penicillins. They are effective against gram-positive bacteria as well some gram- negative bacteria ( H. influenzae, E. coli, P. mirabilis ). Penicillin VK PO TID to QID Amoxicillin PO BID to TID Amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (Augmentin) PO BID Benzathine penicillin G IM Dicloxacillin PO QID Adverse Reactions candida) Stevens-Johnson Notes Avoid using amoxicillin for patients with mononucleosis (causes a generalized rash not related to allergy). Use penicillin VK instead (if not allergic). If penicillin allergy, use a macrolide antibiotic. Dicloxacillin is for penicillinase-producing staph skin infections (mastitis and impetigo). Patients who have a true allergy to penicillin (history of anaphylaxis, angioedema) are more likely to have an allergic reaction to cephalosporins (especially, first generation). Anaphylaxis and angioedema are type 1 IgE-mediated reactions. Some women will complain of candida vaginitis with amoxicillin. Recommend probiotic capsules or eating Fluoroquinolones (Quinolones; Table 3.6 ) Quinolones are bactericidal. also active against gram-positive bacteria activity against streptococcal PO daily Gemifloxacin (Factive) PO daily Black Box Warnings Increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture. Avoid strenuous activity while on the drug. 10782 Stop drug if tendon pain/swelling develops. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states \"serious side effects associated with fluoroquinolones generally outweigh the benefits for patients with sinusitis, bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections who have other treatment options ... for patients with these conditions, fluoroquinolones should be reserved for those who do not have alternative treatment options\" (FDA, 2016). Contraindications : Children (younger than 18 years of age) Myasthenia gravis Pregnancy, breastfeeding Table 3.6 Quinolones * Generic Name (Trade Name) Indications Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) BID infection prostatitis externa Bacterial conjunctivitis * List is not all inclusive. BID, twice a day. Drug Interactions Avoid concomitant use of quinolones with other QT-prolonging drugs (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia) because these will elevate the risk of sudden death from arrhythmias (torsades de pointes). Coadministration of minerals and antacids (aluminum/magnesium/calcium) or sucralfate drastically reduces effectiveness of quinolones due to binding (inactivation). Adverse Effects Hypoglycemia (monitor blood glucose in diabetics) CNS effects (confusion, dizziness, headache, insomnia, seizures) QT prolongation, torsades de pointes Peripheral neuropathy Phototoxicity (advise patients to avoid excessive sunlight or UV light) Double vision Tendon rupture, tendinitis 10883 Pharma Notes Achilles tendon rupture is a serious complication of quinolone therapy and patients who are on steroids or older than 60 years are at higher risk. Do not use quinolones in children (younger than 18 years) or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding due to adverse effects on growing cartilage. If a patient on quinolone reports a new onset of difficulty in walking, order an ultrasound to rule out Achilles tendon rupture or peripheral neuropathy and discontinue the medicine. Bioterrorism-related inhalation of anthrax spores (postexposure prophylaxis) is treated with ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours \u00d7 60 days (treat within 48 hours.). In addition, a three-dose series of anthrax vaccine is recommended. Cutaneous anthrax is treated with ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID \u00d7 7-10 days. Traveler's diarrhea is treated with Cipro 500 mg BID \u00d7 3 days. Ciprofloxacin has the best activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram negative) and is the first-line drug for treating pseudomonal pneumonia for patients with cystic fibrosis. CLINICAL PEARL Moxifloxacin (Avelox) is more likely to cause a hypersensitivity reaction compared with levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin (Prescriber's Letter, 2013) Sulfonamides (a genetic hemolytic anemia) causes hemolysis Newborns and infants younger than 2 months of age Pregnancy in late third trimester (increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia/kernicterus) Hypersensitivity to sulfa drugs 10984 Drug Interactions Warfarin Adverse Effects Fever and nonblistering morbilliform rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and others Pharma Notes Patients with a UTI who are on warfarin (Coumadin) should not be given TMP- SMX (increased risk of bleeding). Monitor INR closely. Pregnant women (or suspected pregnancy) with a UTI can be treated with amoxicillin or cephalosporins (FDA category B). CLINICAL PEARLS HIV patients are at high risk (25%-50%) for sulfa-related Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In the United States, the typical G6PD deficiency anemia patient is a person of African American (10%) descent. Usually asymptomatic, but may present with hemolysis/jaundice secondary to being treated with a sulfa drug or after eating fava beans. Look for a low hemoglobin and hematocrit (H&H) and jaundice. G6PD anemia is also seen with Mediterranean ancestry. Sulfonamide antibiotics are the second most frequent cause of allergic drug reactions (penicillins and cephalosporins are the first; Table 3.7 ). Table 3.7 Sulfonamides Generic Name Indications Bactrim a day; DS, CASE SCENARIOS 11085 Penicillin-Allergic Patient With Strep Throat An 18-year-old female patient has a positive throat C&S for Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta streptococci). The patient reports a history of an allergic reaction to penicillin with \"swollen lips\" accompanied by itchy hives. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment? A) Clarithromycin (Biaxin) 250 mg PO BID \u00d7 10 days B) Gargle with salt water three times a day C) Cephalexin (Keflex) 250 mg PO QID \u00d7 10 days D) Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID \u00d7 10 days Question Dissection Correct answer is option A: A) Clarithromycin (Biaxin) 250 mg PO BID \u00d7 10 days Best Clues Positive C&S for strep Report of a penicillin allergy Rule out the following options because: Option B (gargling with salt water is for symptoms and will not eradicate strep) Option C (penicillin-allergic patients may also be allergic to cephalosporins) Option D (doxycycline not effective for gram-positive infections) Pharma Notes Become familiar with alternative antibiotics for penicillin-allergic patients. A good alternative antibiotic for these patients with gram-positive bacterial infections are macrolides such as azithromycin \u00d7 (Z-Pack) or clarithromycin (Biaxin) PO BID. Clindamycin (Cleocin) is also an alternative, but it is associated with slightly higher risk of Clostridium difficile colitis. If age 18 years or older, quinolones with gram-positive activity (levofloxacin, gatifloxacin) are an option for some infections. Case 2 Patient With Both Mononucleosis and Strep Throat Infection A 16-year-old high school athlete is returning for follow-up for a severe sore throat. During the physical exam, purulent exudate is noted on both tonsils. Tender lymph nodes that are 1 cm in diameter are palpable on the posterior cervical chains. The lungs are clear. The rapid strep antigen test is positive for group A beta hemolytic Streptococcus . The Monospot test (heterophile antibody test) is positive. What is the best initial clinical management of this patient? A) Initiate a prescription of amoxicillin 500 mg PO BID \u00d7 10 days B) Initiate a prescription of penicillin V 250 mg PO TID \u00d7 10 days C) Order an Epstein-Barr virus titer to determine whether the patient has an acute or a 11186 reactivated mononucleosis infection D) Write a prescription for an abdominal ultrasound to determine the size of the patient's liver and spleen Question Dissection Correct answer is option B: B) Initiate a prescription of penicillin V 250 mg PO TID \u00d7 10 days Best Clues Positive test results (Monospot and strep) Rule out: Option A (avoid using amoxicillin if a patient has mononucleosis because of the risk of an amoxicillin \"drug rash\" that is not due to an allergy) Option C (not for initial management of uncomplicated mononucleosis) Option D (not for initial management; only for cases in which the physical exam reveals an enlarged liver and/or spleen) Pharma Notes In the case of rash in mononucleosis patients who are treated with amoxicillin, it is very hard to determine whether the rash is due to a true allergy or whether the patient has a benign nonallergic drug rash. About 70% to 90% of patients with mono taking amoxicillin may break out with a \"nonallergic\" generalized maculopapular rash (mechanism is not well understood). If a patient has both mono and strep throat, avoid using amoxicillin or ampicillin. Instead, use penicillin (if not allergic) or a macrolide to treat the patient. CLINICAL PEARL Of patients with true penicillin allergy, a small percentage (0.17%-8.4%) will also react to a cephalosporin . Case 3 Young Adult With History of GI Symptoms After Taking Erythromycin A 25-year-old healthy male who is a nonsmoker is diagnosed with atypical pneumonia. The patient reports a history of nausea, upset stomach, and vomiting with erythromycin. The vital signs are temperature of 99.8\u00b0F, pulse of 80/min, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min. What is the most appropriate treatment plan for this patient? A) Initiate a prescription of azithromycin (Z-Pack) PO \u00d7 5 days B) Initiate a prescription of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) 1 tablet PO BID \u00d7 10 days 11287 C) Order a CBC with differential D) Order a sputum for culture and sensitivity Question Dissection Correct answer is option A: A) Initiate a prescription of azithromycin (Z-Pack) PO \u00d7 5 days Best Clues The patient has atypical pneumonia but is a healthy young adult and a nonsmoker. He is not febrile or toxic (fever is temperature of 100.4\u00b0F). Rule out: Option B (Bactrim is not effective against Mycoplasma or Chlamydia bacterial infections, but it is an excellent drug for some gram-negative infections such as urinary tract infections [UTIS]) Option C (ordering a CBC with differential is not necessary in this case) Option D (for community-acquired pneumonia [CAP], ordering a sputum for C&S is not recommended by the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America [ATS/IDSA] treatment guidelines for CAP) Pharma Notes GI upset (nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain) is a common side effect of erythromycin\u2014it is not an allergic reaction (such as angioedema, hives, anaphylaxis). If a patient who needs a macrolide is not allergic, azithromycin (Z- Pack) is a good choice. It usually does not cause GI side effects, has fewer drug interactions, and a broader spectrum of activity. If the patient is allergic to macrolides, an alternative is doxycycline PO BID or the new-generation quinolones (Levaquin, Avelox) if age 18 years or older. CLINICAL PEARL Consider macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae if the patient was on a macrolide in the previous 3 months . Case 4 Answer Options Listed by Drug Class A 65-year-old male presents with a history of a chronic cough that is productive of large amounts of off-white-colored sputum. The patient reports a 30-pack-year history of cigarette smoking. The chest x-ray reveals hyperinflation with flattened diaphragms and two small bullae on the left lobe. Which of the following drug classes is the initial treatment of choice for this condition? 113A) Oxygen by nasal cannula Question Dissection The correct answer is option A: A) Short-acting beta-2 agonists Best Clues Arriving at the correct answer is based on your knowledge of the current COPD treatment guidelines (Global Initiative for COPD/GOLD, 2015). Notice that the stem of the question is asking for the \"initial treatment\" (rule out options B, C, and D). Pharma Notes For COPD patients with mild dyspnea, the initial treatment choice is a short- acting (albuterol, levalbuterol) or a short-acting anticholinergic (ipratropium bromide), or both. If not effective, the next step is either a long- acting beta-2 agonist (salmeterol) or a long-acting anticholinergic (tiotropium), or both. If the question is asking you for the next step (if symptoms are not better with short-acting bronchodilators), then start on a long-acting beta-2 agonist alone or combined with a long-acting anticholinergic. Smoking cessation is important. The flu vaccine and Pneumovax is recommended for all with COPD\u2014it is considered a primary prevention measure. \"Pack year\" is calculated by multiplying the number of packs smoked per day by the number of years a person has smoked. One pack contains 20 cigarettes. OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) DRUGS AND HERBS Topical decongestants (BID PRN \u00d7 3 days) is considered safe treatment for nasal congestion (common cold, allergic rhinitis) Rhinitis medicamentosa is due diphenhydramine (Benadryl) in the elderly, if possible For elderly patients, use loratadine (Claritin) because it has a lower incidence of sedation Zyrtec is more potent and long acting. It is very effective for acute and chronic urticaria 11488 Topical and/or Decongestants Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) and phenylephrine The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 restricts the amount of pseudoephedrine you can buy; you must log in and present your ID to the pharmacy Antitussives Dextromethorphan (Robitussin, Delsym) and benzonatate (Tessalon) Dextromethorphan with hypertension, CAD (angina, MI) . Advise decongestants with stimulants (caffeine, Ritalin, albuterol inhaler) will cataract surgery ketorolac ophthalmic (Acular) NSAID Warnings NSAIDs should be avoided in HF, severe heart disease, GI bleeding, severe renal disease and during the last 3 months of pregnancy Patients with nasal polyps and asthma can be sensitive to aspirin/NSAIDs Ketorolac (Toradol) IM, IV, or tablets are for short-term use only (up to 5 days) Contraindications : Ketorolac should not be used before surgery, with concurrent acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), pediatric patients, active or recent GI bleed, stroke, labor/delivery, and others. For long-term use, document informed consent such as the higher risk of serious MI, stroke, emboli, GI bleeds, acute renal failure. COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib) have lower risk of GI bleeding compared with the other NSAIDs. They are not a first-line NSAID except for patients at high risk for GI bleeding. Increased risk of bleeding if NSAIDs are combined with warfarin, dabigatran (Pradaxa), steroids, aspirin, alcohol. For long-term use, consider prescribing concurrent proton- pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2-receptor antagonists, or misoprostol (Cytotec). Cytotec is a synthetic prostaglandin. Avoid long-term use of NSAIDs if patient is on aspirin prophylaxis (interferes with aspirin's cardioprotective effect). NSAIDs may worsen hypertension in patients who were previously well controlled. Salicylates Aspirin (Bayer) 325 mg to 650 mg every 4 to 6 hours PRN Aspirin controlled/extended/delayed release (enteric-coated): 650 to 1,300 mg every 8 hours (do not exceed 3.9 g/d) Acute coronary syndrome: 160 to 325 mg PO; chew nonenteric-coated tablet as soon as possible (within minutes of symptoms) Secondary prevention (MI, stroke): 75 to 81 mg PO daily (up to 325 mg/d) Aspirin 845 mg with caffeine (BC Powder): One powder sublingually every 6 hours PRN; drink or mix powder with full glass of water Topical: Methyl the age of 12 years (Reye's syndrome) Capsaicin Capsaicin topical cream (Zostrix HP), capsaicin patch For temporary relief of muscle and joint pain (arthritis, sprains/ strains, bruises) For neuropathic pain (postherpetic neuralgia [PHN], trigeminal 11690 May take up to 4 weeks to work; may cause temporary burning sensation; do not use on broken skin; advise patient to wash hands with soap and water immediately after using capsaicin cream and to avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth Acetaminophen (Tylenol) Adults and children 12 years of age or older; maximum dose ranges from 3,000 mg (3 g) to 3,250 mg/d or 3,900/day (almost 4 g/d) Considered pain from osteoarthritis/DJD Regular-strength Tylenol (325 mg): Take two tablets every 4 to 6 hours PRN; do not take more than ten tablets in 24 hours (maximum dose is 3,250 mg in 24 hr) Extra-strength Tylenol (500 mg each): Take two caplets every 6 hours PRN; do not take more than six caplets in 24 hours (maximum dose 3,000 mg [3 g] in 24 hr) Extended-release Tylenol (8 hr; 650 mg each): Take two caplets every 8 hr PRN; do not take more than six caplets in 24 hours (maximum dose is 3,900 mg [3.9 g] in 24 hr) Duration: Do not use for more than 10 days unless directed by health provider Avoid if: chronic hepatitis B/C/D, dehydration, liver disease, cirrhosis, heavy drinker Risk of severe liver damage if intake of three or more alcoholic drinks/day while using medication Antidote for overdose: Acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) EXAM TIPS Capsaicin cream can be used to treat pain in trigeminal neuralgia and PHN . Maximum number of days that ketorolac (Toradol) can be used is 5 days . The maximum dose for acetaminophen (Tylenol) ranges from 3 to 4 g/d . Aspirin irreversibly suppresses platelet function for up to 7 days (due to irreversible acetylation). Life span of platelets is about 7 to 10 days . Discontinue ASA if patient complains of tinnitus (possible aspirin toxicity) . IMMUNE SYSTEM DRUGS Glucocorticoids (Steroids) Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other autoimmune disorders Polymyalgia rheumatica (dramatic relief of symptoms) Asthma or acute asthmatic exacerbations Temporal arteritis/giant cell arteritis (high doses \u00d7 several weeks to months) Uveitis (complication of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, rheumatica) Skin (eczema, to 60 mg/day (high-dosed) for 3 to 4 days; can be used for short-term 11791 treatment (i.e., asthma exacerbation); there is no need to taper if patient is not on chronic steroids (oral or inhalation) Methylprednisolone (Medrol Dose Pack) \u00d7 7 days; does not need to be weaned Topical Steroids Classification: (Class 1 (superpotent) to Class 7 (least 1) Notes: Topical Steroids Be careful with using topical steroids on children and limit duration. Use low-potency steroid for the eyelids, face, intertriginous areas, and the genitals. Example : Use hydrocortisone cream/ointment/lotions 0.5% to 1% prescription strength such 2.5% (Hytone Rx). May need to use ophthalmic-grade rashes around the eyes/eyelids. Use moderate to high-potency steroids for thicker skin (scalp, soles of feet, palms of the hands) or for plaques (psoriasis). Taper potent-strength topical steroids (or will rebound). What is \"occlusion\"? Thick resistant psoriatic plaques are sometimes treated by using occlusion (increases absorption). The topical steroid is applied to the plaque and is covered with plastic wrap. Ultrapotent steroids (Temovate, etc.) should not be occluded for more than 2 weeks (risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-axis [HPA] suppression). Acutely inflamed joints (knees/hips/shoulders/elbows) can be treated with intraarticular triamcinolone (Kenalog) injections up to three times per year. Do not inject septic joint with steroids. Side Effects of Glucocorticoids/Steroids (Chronic Use) HPA suppression Cushing's disease (dorsal hump, rounded face, etc.) Osteoporosis (advise weight-bearing exercises, vitamin D, calcium 1,200 mg/d, bisphosphonates) Immunosuppression (increased risk of infection) Skin changes from long-term topical therapy (skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, acne, pigmentation changes) CLINICAL PEARLS 11892 A severe case of poison ivy or poison oak rash may require 14 to 21 days of an oral steroid to clear . The most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States is acetaminophen overdose (Poison Control Center: (800) 222-1222) OTHER DRUGS AND SAFETY ISSUES Drugs That Require Eye Examination The following drugs require careful monitoring of vision due to adverse effects. Check that the patient has baseline examination with regular eye exams done by an ophthalmologist. Digoxin (yellow to green vision, blurred vision, halos if blood level too high) Ethambutol and linezolid (optic neuropathy) Corticosteroids (cataracts, blurred vision, ischemic optic neuropathy, others) Accutane (cataracts, decreased night vision, glaucoma, increased intracranial pressure, of vision) Cisapride (Propulsid) Available only by limited-access protocol in the United States Block box warning : Serious cardiac arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia, Drug Interactions Theophylline 15 mcg/mL Drug interactions (cimetidine, caffeine, Ritalin) Disorders worsened by stimulants: Hypertension, arrhythmias, stroke, seizures BPH: Causes urinary retention, worsening of symptoms Suspect toxicity if persistent vomiting Tapering (Weaning) Drugs Certain drugs that are used long term need to be tapered; abrupt discontinuation will cause the treated condition to flare up (exacerbation), rebound, and/or have adverse effects: Beta-blockers (rebound hypertension or hypertensive crisis) Benzodiazepines (severe anxiety, insomnia, seizures, tremors) 11993 Oral steroids Anticonvulsants (seizures) Paroxetine or Paxil Antiarrhythmics (refer DRUGS Cannabis (Marijuana, Hash, Hashish, Marinol) Euphoria (\"high\"), sociable, increased appetite, and slurred speech Ataxia, nystagmus, conjunctival injection (red eyes), and dilated pupils (mydriasis) Lowers sperm count; increases heart rate and blood pressure Psychomotor effects lasts 12 to 24 hours Prescription Opiods (Fentanyl, (miosis) Overdose or combining with alcohol may cause respiratory depression, coma, death Naltrexone can reverse effects Dextromethorphan (Robo, Robo-Trip, Triple C) Obtained from OTC cough and cold medications Euphoria, speech slurred, tachycardia, possibly elevated BP and temperature, seizures, paranoia, confusion Cocaine (Coke, Crack, Rock) Happy, mental alertness, paranoia, decreased appetite, insomnia, nosebleeds Pupil dilations (mydriasis), tachycardia, hypertension, angina/MI, Crystal Meth, Ice, Methylphenidate) Chronic use results in severe dental carries with loss of front teeth on the upper jaw Anorexia results in drastic weight loss; pupils appear constricted U.S. FDA DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY (DEA) 120Controlled Substances Act Schedule I drugs (heroin, Ecstasy/MDMA, PCP, etc.) Illegal to prescribe; no currently accepted medical use; high abuse potential Schedule II drugs (Demerol, Dilaudid, OxyContin, cocaine, amphetamines, fentanyl, etc.) Only the original prescription with the prescriber's signature (not stamped) is acceptable The total number of pills must be indicated; no refills are allowed Schedule III drugs (Tylenol with codeine, Vicodin, anabolic (benzodiazepines, Ambien, Lunesta, Soma, etc.) Schedule V drugs (cough medicines with less than 200 mg of codeine, Lomotil, Lyrica) Schedule IV, V : Can be mailed to the patient; some states allow NPs to prescribe lower- level controlled substances For all controlled substances: Must have the prescriber's and the supervising prescriber's name/DEA number with the clinic address on the pad; cannot be predated or postdated; some states do not require a supervising prescriber's signature. Caution: Rules vary by state and the prescriber should keep abreast of the rules in the state where he or she practices. List of FDA Category X Drugs Finasteride (Proscar, Propecia): Reproductive-aged or pregnant diethylstilbestrol (DES), methimazole, and so on FDA Category Classifications The new FDA Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR) went into effect on June 30, 2015. It replaces the pregnancy letter categories A, B, C, D, and X. The new labeling categories are: Pregnancy, Lactation, and Females and Males of Reproductive Potential. Prescription drugs and biologics approved after June 30, 2015 will use the new format immediately. Drugs/biologics approved on or after June 30, 2001 will be phased in gradually. Drugs approved prior to June 29, 2001 are not subject to the PLLR rule; but the pregnancy letter category must be removed by June 29, 2018. Over-the-counter drugs are not subject to this rule. Pregnancy: Includes labor and delivery; it will include information about the potential risks to the developing fetus. Lactation: Includes nursing mothers and drugs that should not be used during breastfeeding, as well and the clinical effects on the infant. It may have information 12194 about the timing of breastfeeding to minimize infant exposure. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Includes information on the drug's effect on fertility, pregnancy testing/loss (if available), and birth control. Pharma Notes Almost all the drugs on the 2016 edition of the exams were released before the PLLR became effective. Therefore, FDA category X may still be in use in these exams. In general, FDA category X drugs are those that interfere with or block hormones (finasteride, misoprostol, Lupron), contain estrogen (birth control pills, HRT), are live virus vaccines, interfere with cell growth (methotrexate, chemotherapy, radiation), or are derivatives of vitamin A (e.g., Accutane, high-dosed vitamin A supplements). PRESCRIPTION PADS Tamper-resistant prescription pads/paper are required. If a prescription goes directly to the pharmacy (electronically, by fax, or by telephone), it does not have to be to tamper-resistant paper. It should contain the following information: Practitioner's name/designation/license number/NPI (National Practitioner Identification) number Supervising physician's name/designation (some states do not require a supervising physician) Clinic address (if multiple sites, the sites where the NP works should be listed on the pad) and phone number(s) Writing a Prescription Date, name, and address of the patient Drug name, dosage strength, dosage form, frequency, and duration Directions for use: Quantity and number of refills (indicate how many times or none) For controlled drugs, a DEA number must be on the script if the prescription is for a controlled drug For FDA Schedule II drugs, the script must be handwritten or typed on a tamper- resistant prescription pad and manually signed Schedule II drug prescriptions cannot be called in to the pharmacy Avoid using initials or shortcuts (e.g., use daily instead of QD). Write the quantity of the drug in both number and written word form. Examples: Lunesta tablets 3 mg by mouth at bedtime as needed - Dispense: #20 (twenty) - Refills: 1 (one) Bactrim DS 1 (one) tablet by mouth twice a day for 10 (ten) days - Dispense: #20 (twenty) 12295 - Refills: 0 (none) The \"Five Rights\" There are \"five rights\" that help to prevent or decrease the chances of a medical error: 1. Right patient 2. Right drug 3. Right dose 4. Right time 5. Right route What is \"e-prescribing\"? The process of sending and receiving prescriptions by electronic means. Preferred method for drug prescriptions for Medicare and Medicaid. Clinicians write the prescription in their offices on a computer or tablet using e- prescribing software. COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Conventional medicine (or allopathic medicine) is also known as modern medicine or Western medicine . Alternative medicine is the treatments and substances that are not part of standard medicine. Examples: Herbal supplements, probiotics, chiropractic, homeopathy, meditation, yoga, massage therapy Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is the term used when Western medicine is combined with alternative medicine or \"medical products and practices that are not part of standard care\" (National Institutes of Health, 2010). CAM is using both Western medicine with alternative medicines (herbs) or with another healing system such as homeopathy, ayurveda (from India), or traditional Chinese medicine (or TCM). Herbal Supplements Feverfew: Migraine headache Cinnamon: Improves blood sugar (diabetes) and cholesterol Glucosamine (with/without chondroitin): Osteoarthritis Natural progesterone cream (from wild yam root extract): Premenstrual symptoms (hot flashes) Isoflavones (from St. disease, arthritis, cancer Homeopathy 12396 The founder is the physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843). This healing system is based on the \"Law of Similars\" or \"Let likes be cured by likes.\" What is the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States? The HPUS is a list of approved homeopathic substances used in this country. How are homeopathic substances made? Extremely small amounts of a substance are diluted (ultradilution). For example, the herb Arnica montana , which is used to prevent or treat bruises, can be diluted 30 times (e.g., Arnica montana 30\u00d7 dilution). Ayurveda An ancient healing system from India. Food, spices, herbs, yoga, and lifestyle are believed to prevent and treat disease. 12497 98 Systems Review II 12599 4 Health Screening and Health Promotion Review U.S. HEALTH STATISTICS Mortality Statistics * Leading cause of death (all ages/genders): 1.

Cervical Cancer ( Table 4.1 ) Table 4.1 Cervical Cancer Screening Age Group Recommendations for Pap/Liquid Cytology 129Age 20 years or younger Do not screen (even if sexually active with multiple partners). Cervical cancer is rare before age 21 years. Age 21 to 65 years Baseline at age 21 years. Screen every 3 years. Age 30 to 65 years Another option starting at age 30 years is to screen with combination of cytology plus human papillomavirus (HPV) testing every 5 years. Had hysterectomy with removal of cervix If hysterectomy with cervical removal was not due to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN grade 2) or cervical cancer, then can stop screening. Women older than 65 years who had adequate prior screening Do not screen if history of adequate prior screening and is otherwise not at high risk for cervical cancer. Source: USPSTF (2012). Notes * These recommendations do not apply to women who are immunocompromised (i.e., HIV infection), had in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), or have a diagnosis of high-grade precancerous cervical lesion or cervical cancer. __________ * USPSTF Screening Recommendations for Cervical Cancer (July 2015). Colorectal Cancer (June 2016) Baseline: Starting at age 50 years until the age of 75 (older age is the most common risk factor) Age 76 to 85 years: Against routine screening but \"there may be considerations\"; individualize screening as needed Older than age 85 years: Screening for colorectal cancer bot recommended Notes These three methods are all acceptable for colorectal cancer. The screening intervals of each method differ: High-sensitivity fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) for three consecutive stool samples annually (high-sensitivity version such as Hemoccult SENSA superior to older Hemoccult II test) Flexible sigmoidoscopy or CT colonography every 5 years Colonoscopy every 10 years Lipid Disorders Total lipid profile after a 9-hour (minimum) fast 130103 The USPSTF recommends the use of low- to moderate-dose statin when all of the following criteria area met: Aged 40 to 74 years The patient has one or more CVD risk factors (i.e., dyslipidemia, DM, hypertension, smoking) The patient has a calculated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater Age 76 years and older without history of heart attack or stroke (insufficient evidence) Lung Cancer (June 2013) Screening for persons who smoke (30 pack-years) or have quit in the past 15 years Age 55 to 80 years: Annual screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) Discontinue screening once person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery Prostate Cancer (May 2012) This topic is being updated in 2016. The USPSTF recommends against prostate- specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer. The recommendation \"applies to men in the general U.S. population, regardless of age.\" Grade D: The benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer do not outweigh the disadvantages. Ovarian Cancer (September 2012) Grade D: Routine screening is not recommended. Very high-risk women with BRCA1 / BRCA2 mutations: Refer to specialists. If ovarian cancer screening is done, transvaginal ultrasound with serum cancer antigen (CA-125) is ordered. The screening starts at age 30 years (or 5-10 years before earliest age of first diagnosis of ovarian cancer in family). Some experts recommend bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) between age 35 to 40 years (after childbearing is complete). BSO has a significant effect in reducing ovarian cancer risk in at-risk women. High-risk women: Refer for genetic counseling. Look for family history of having two or more first- to second-degree relatives with a history of ovarian cancer or a combination of ovarian cancer; women of Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity with first-degree relative (or second-degree relatives on the same side of the family) with breast or ovarian cancer. Skin Cancer Counseling Recommended for children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 10-24 years) with fair skin Education includes avoidance of sunlight from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., use of SPF 15 or 131104 higher sunblock, protective clothing, wide-brim hats Other Routine screening is not recommended by the USPSTF for the following conditions: Ovarian cancer Oral cancer Prostate cancer Testicular cancer (adolescents or adult males; Table 4.2 ) Table 4.2 USPSTF Health Screening Recommendations Baseline Notes Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA; June 2014) Men at age 65 to 75 years who have smoked One-time screening with ultrasonography in men ages 65 to 75 years who have smoked; individualize for men who never smoked Breast cancer (January 2016) Start at age 50 years Mammogram every 2 years (biennial) until age 74 years Age 75 years or older * Stop routine screening. Individualize * Breast self-exam (BSE) Against teaching BSE (Grade D recommendation) Blood pressure in adults (hypertension; October 2015) Start at age 18 years or older Recommends obtaining measurements outside of clinical setting for diagnostic confirmation before starting treatment Colon/colorectal cancer (June 2016) Start at age 50 years continue until age 75 years High-sensitivity fetal occult blood test (FOBT; every year), or sigmoidoscopy (every 5 years), or colonoscopy (every 10 years) Age 76 to 85 years Individualize * Age older than 85 years Stop routine screening Depression Adolescents (12-18 years) Start screening for major depressive disorder starting at age 12 to 18 years Depression (adults; January 2016) General adult population Include pregnant and postpartum women; use Beck Depression Inventory Diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 (October 2015) Age 40 to 70 years if overweight or obese Applies to adults in primary care settings who are not \"high risk\"; DM patients with risk factors (certain ethnicities, PCOS, GDM, etc.) can undergo screening at younger age 132105 Latent tuberculosis (September 2016) Asymptomatic adults Screen asymptomatic adults who are at increased risk for infection Lung cancer (December 2013) Aged 55 to 80 years with history of smoking Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) if currently smokes with 30-pack-year history or quit in the previous 15 years Obesity Start at age 6 to 18 years Offer or refer for intensive behavioral interventions Sexually transmitted infections (STIs; September 2014) Start at the onset of sexual activity High-intensity behavioral counseling for sexually active adolescents and adults who are at high risk for STIs Skin cancer(July 2016) Insufficient evidence Routine screening is not recommended; individualize recommendation Osteoporosis (being updated) Start at age 65 years or older May start earlier if a younger woman has a fracture risk equal or greater than that of a 65-year-old White woman (i.e., chronic steroids) Ovarian cancer (September 2012) Against routine screening Do not screen for ovarian cancer except high risk (as of September 2016) Pancreatic cancer (February 2014) Against routine screening * Decision to screen is based on risk factors, life expectancy (>10 years), risk versus benefits. FOBT, fecal gestational diabetes mellitus; ovary syndrome. RISK FACTORS Breast Cancer Older age: Age 50 years or older (most common risk factor) Previous history of breast cancer Two or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer Early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity (longer exposure to estrogen) Obesity (adipose tissue can synthesize small amounts of estrogen) Cervical Cancer Multiple sex partners (defined as greater than four lifetime partners) Younger age onset of sex (immature cervix easier to infect) Immunosuppression and smoking Colorectal Cancer History of familial polyposis (multiple polyps on colon) 133First-degree relative with colon cancer Crohn's disease (ulcerative colitis) Prostate Cancer Age 50 years or older African ancestry First-degree relative with prostate cancer Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) or Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) Multiple sexual partners Earlier age onset of sex New partners (defined as <3 months) History of STD Homelessness VACCINES AND IMMUNIZATIONS ( TABLE 4.3 ) Hepatitis B Vaccine Total of three doses (0, 1, 6 months). First vaccine given at birth (monovalent hepatitis B vaccine). Need a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses one and two. If series is not completed, catch up until three-dose series is completed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend a restart of the hepatitis B series. Vaccine Facts 1. If a patient had only one dose of hepatitis B vaccine, what is recommended? Do not restart the hepatitis B series again. If only one dose, give the second dose. Catch up until the three-dose series is completed. Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Start giving the influenza injection at the end of October of each year (fall to winter season). It takes 2 weeks after the shot for a person to develop antibodies. As long as influenza viruses circulate, vaccination should continue to be offered, even into January or later. Most seasons, influenza activity peaks in January or later (CDC, 2017). Health care personnel who work with patients older than 50 years should be vaccinated. If a person with an egg allergy only experiences hives, an influenza vaccine can be 134106 administered. Pregnant women may receive any licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate flu vaccine. Formulations Inactivated and Recombinant Influenza Vaccines (Injectable) Trivalent influenza vaccine or quadrivalent vaccines given by intramuscular (IM) injection in the arm preferred. There are intradermal and nasal forms of these vaccines. High-dose trivalent influenza vaccine for people age 65 years or older (Fluzone High- Dose) Recombinant trivalent influenza vaccine that is egg-free approved for persons age 18 years and older (Flublok) Quadrivalent influenza vaccine: protects against four types flu virus (broader protection). Age 4 years or older. Live Attenuated Inactivated Virus (LAIV) For the 2017 to 2018 influenza season, there is a CDC and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation against use of LAIV vaccine for all age groups. Only for healthy persons aged 2 to 49 years Some antivirals (amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, or oseltamivir) should be avoided 48 hours before and 14 days after vaccination because they interfere with antibody production. Do not give aspirin to children within the 4 weeks following vaccination. LAIV Contraindications Pregnancy, chronic disease (i.e., asthma, COPD, renal failure, diabetes, immunosuppression) Contraindicated in children on aspirin therapy (ages 2-17 years) Contraindications (all types of influenza vaccine) Infants age 6 months or younger People with severe, life-threatening allergies to components of the influenza vaccine (gelatin, gentamicin, preservative), which is not related to an egg allergy, should not be given influenza vaccine (egg-allergy-related reactions are discussed in the text that follows). Safety Issues If severe reaction (hypotension, wheezing, nausea/vomiting, reaction requiring epinephrine or emergency medical attention) occurs after eating eggs or food containing eggs, vaccine should be administered in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting (clinics, hospitals, health departments, physician offices) under the supervision of a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions. If patient experienced only hives previously, he or she can receive the influenza vaccine. People with egg allergies no longer need to be observed for an allergic reaction for 30 minutes after receiving the flu vaccine (CDC, 2016; Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2017). 135107 Age-appropriate recombinant (RIV) or cell cultured flu vaccines are an option for patients who refuse egg-based influenza vaccine. Use caution or avoid influenza vaccine if history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome within 6 weeks of previous vaccination. Vaccine Facts 1. What is the youngest age at which influenza vaccine (injection) can be given? At the age of 6 months 2. Most flu vaccines (including nasal spray) are manufactured using egg-based technology. What are the implications for patients? Egg allergy affects 1.3% of children but only 0.2% of adults Tetanus Vaccines (Tdap and Td) Give every 10 years for lifetime Boosters: For \"dirty\"/contaminated wounds, give a booster if the last dose was more than 5 years prior Infancy and children younger than age 7 years: Use DTaP form Age 7 years and older: Use only tetanus and diphtheria (Td); and tetanus, diphtheria; or the tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) forms of the vaccine; give one Tdap dose (lifetime) to replace one Td dose DTaP: Give by IM route to infants and children younger than age 7 years Td: Give by IM route. Start using this form at the age of 7 years Tdap: Give by IM route Safety Issue History of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome within 6 weeks of previous dose. Be careful with pertussis component if progressive or unstable neurological disorder, uncontrolled seizures. Vaccine Facts 1. When can the Tdap be used as a booster in adolescents and adults? The Tdap can be substituted for a single dose of Td (once in a lifetime) starting at age 11 to 12 years 2. What is done if a patient has a tetanus-prone wound and vaccination status is unknown? Administer immediate dose of Td/Tdap vaccine and the tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) injection as soon as possible 3. Which wounds are considered at highest risk for tetanus infection? Puncture wounds, wounds with devitalized tissue, soil-contaminated wounds, crush injuries, and others are at high risk for tetanus infection 136108 Pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23 or Pneumovax): All adults age 65 years or older or if high risk for pneumococcal disease (ages 2-64 years) PPSV23: 50% to 85% effective Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 or Prevnar): All children younger than 5 years of age or at high risk for pneumococcal disease; PCV13 is also recommended for all adults age 65 years or older Age 65 years or older: CDC recommends giving PCV13 first (if never had PPSV23); then 12 months after PCV13, administer PPSV23 (better immunogenic response) Highest risk (of fatal pneumococcal infection): Chronic diseases (alcoholism, diabetes, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] leaks, asthma, chronic hepatitis) Anatomical or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease) If immunocompromised or on medications causing immunocompromised state Generalized malignancy or cancers of the blood (leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma) Renal diseases (e.g., chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome) History of organ or bone marrow transplant Vaccine Facts 1. What vaccine is recommended for persons who are 65 years of age? Adults 65 years or older (who never received Pneumovax): Give Prevnar (PCV13) initially, followed at 12 months with Pneumovax (PPSV23); if person has already had PPSV23 previously, wait 12 months to give PCV13 2. If a person is vaccinated before the age of 65 with Pneumovax, what is recommended? Give a booster dose of Pneumovax 5 years after the initial dose Shingles Vaccine Zoster vaccine (Zostavax) is a live attenuated virus vaccine. Age 60 years: Give one-time dose by subcutaneous (SC) route. A past history of shingles is not a contraindication for receiving the shingles vaccine. The shingles vaccine can be administered to persons even if they never had a chickenpox infection. However, even if a person has had shingles before, the CDC still recommends the vaccine. Certain antivirals (acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir) can decrease immunological response if taken 24 hours before or 14 days after vaccination. May cause exacerbation of asthma and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Risk factors (shingles): Older age (60 years or older), immunocompromised (HIV, steroids, chemotherapy) Leukemia, lymphoma Contraindications: 137109 Pregnancy and breastfeeding Leukemia, bone/bone marrow Immunocompromise (high-dose steroids >2 weeks, antitumor necrosis factor medications such as etanercept) Vaccine Facts 1. What age group should receive the shingles vaccine? Give a one-time dose at the age of 60 years or older (even if patient has already had shingles). A person with a history of shingles can be vaccinated with shingles vaccine (unless there is a contraindication). The youngest age that Zostavax can be given is 50 years of age. 2. Can any person who has never had chickenpox develop shingles? No, they cannot. 3. How long are persons with shingles contagious? Shingles is infectious until all the skin lesions are dry and crusted. Follow contact precautions. About half of cases of shingles occur in persons aged 60 years or older. 4. Which vaccine, the shingles vaccine or the varicella vaccine, contains more varicella zoster virus (VZV)? The shingles vaccine (Zostavax) contains about 14 times more VZV compared with the varicella vaccine (Varivax). Varicella Vaccine Varicella live attenuated virus (Varivax): Given by SC route. Need two doses. First dose given in infancy: 12 to 15 months (do not give to infants younger than 12 months). Advise women not to get pregnant for 1 month after getting vaccine. A new combination vaccine called the MMRV (ProQuad) contains both chickenpox and the MMR vaccines (only for ages 12 years or younger). Postexposure prophylaxis: Ideally, vaccine should be given within 72 hours postexposure but may be given up to 5 days (120 hours) after incident (healthy, previously unvaccinated). Reactions: Mild rash or several small chickenpox rashes can occur after vaccination (contagious, avoid immunocompromised people). Acceptable proof of varicella immunity: Documentation of two doses of varicella vaccine Written diagnosis of chickenpox or shingles based on health care provider diagnosis Positive laboratory varicella titer (IgG ELISA) Do not administer the varicella vaccine to a person born in the United States before 1980. Safety Issues Avoid giving to pregnant patients, patients with immunosuppression or on drugs that affect 138110 the immune system (steroids, biologics such as Humira, Enbrel), patients having radiation treatment or with any type of cancer. Health Care Personnel Vaccination Recommendations These recommendations also apply to students who are in training to become health care providers. Td or Tdap Give one-time dose of Tdap for all health care personnel who have not received the Tdap when due for a tetanus booster. Continue giving Td boosters every 10 years for a lifetime. MMR Proof of immunity is necessary (born before 1957, laboratory confirmation such as positive titers). If not vaccinated for MMR, two doses are needed (at least 28 days apart). Varicella Proof of immunity is necessary (positive varicella titer, documentation of two doses of varicella vaccine or diagnosis of varicella by physician/health care provider). Hepatitis B If incomplete hepatitis B series (fewer than three doses), complete the series (do not restart). If job involves blood or body fluids, obtain anti-HBs serological testing 1 to 2 months after dose 3. If anti-HBs is less than 10 mIU/mL, three additional doses should be administered on the regular hepatitis B schedule followed by anti-HBs testing in 1 to 2 months. Influenza All health care personnel should have an annual influenza shot during the fall/winter. Table 4.3 CDC Immunization Recommendations for Adults and Teens (2016) * Vaccine Schedule Notes Hepatitis B Total of three doses If incomplete series, do not restart; if had one dose, give the second dose during the visit; if had two doses, give the third dose Tetanus/diphtheria (Td) Every 10 years for lifetime Substitute one-time dose of Tdap for Td booster (once in a lifetime) Tetanus/diphtheria/acellular pertussis (Tdap) Dirty wounds, give tetanus booster if last dose more than 5 years Flu (influenza) Give once a year in the fall or winter Give in fall/winter season Trivalent flu vaccine Give flu to everyone 6 months or older Quadrivalent flu vaccine Age 4 years or older Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) intranasal ** Do not use the LAIV flu vaccine during 2017-2018 season Instead, use trivalent or quadrivalent flu vaccine Do not give FluMist to pregnant For healthy persons (not pregnant) from 139111 women; use injection form age 2 years to 49 years Varicella ** Give two doses at least 4 weeks apart Age 12 months or older; need two doses Shingles/zoster Single dose at age 60 years Give single dose at age 60 years or older (regardless if reports history of shingles) Meningococcal conjugate vaccine quadrivalent (MCV4) Preteens, teens, and young adults: start at age 11 to 12 years First-year college students who will be living in residence halls are at higher risk Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) One dose lifetime for adults Give at age 65 years, followed in 12 months by the PPSV23 Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) One dose at age 65 years If vaccinated before age 65 years, give a booster in 5 years * List is not all inclusive. ** Live virus vaccines contraindications apply. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2017). Other Types of Vaccines Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is a vaccine against tuberculosis (TB) infection. BCG is made from live attenuated (or weakened) Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Vaccination with BCG can produce a false positive with the TB skin test (Mantoux). Vaccine Facts 1. What is the follow-up if a person with a history of BCG immunization has a positive purified protein derivative (PPD)? TB blood testing (QuantiFERON, T-SPOT) is preferred. Most people with a positive TB blood test have latent TB infection. TB blood tests (interferon-gamma release assays [IGRAs]), unlike the TB skin test, are not affected by prior BCG vaccination. 2. What is the follow-up if a person has a positive TB skin test or TB blood test? Evaluate the person for signs and symptoms of TB. Rule out latent or active TB infection. Order a chest x-ray and check for signs and symptoms of TB such as a \"chronic\" cough, weight loss, and night sweats. Preferred treatment for latent TB infection is isoniazid daily orally for 9 months. According to the CDC, there are four treatment regimens for latent TB infection (April 2016). Consult or refer to TB specialist if the source has drug-resistant TB. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) The VICP is a federal program created to compensate people who have been injured by certain vaccines. Call 1-800-338-2382 or visit the VICP website at 140112 www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation . CLINICAL PEARLS TB blood tests (IGRA) are preferred method of TB testing for people who have received the BCG vaccine. During recent influenza seasons, between 80% and 90% of influenza-related deaths occurred in people aged 65 years or older. Remind older patients to get the influenza vaccine starting in the fall season. __________ * National Vital Statistics Reports. Volume 25, Number 2, February 16, 2016. 141113 5 Head, Ear, Eyes, Nose, and Throat Review DANGER SIGNALS EYES Herpes Keratitis Acute onset of severe eye pain, photophobia, tearing, and blurred vision in one eye. Diagnosed by using fluorescein dye. A black lamp in a darkened room is used to search for fern-like lines in the corneal surface. In contrast, corneal abrasions appear round or irregularly shaped. Infection permanently damages corneal epithelium, which may result in corneal blindness. There are two types of herpesvirus that can infect the eyes (herpes simplex and herpes varicella zoster or shingles). If infection virus (due to If infection is due to shingles of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve [CN] V) Herpes zoster ophthalmicus has eye findings accompanied by the acute eruption of crusty rashes that follow the ophthalmic branch (CN V 1 ) of the trigeminal nerve (one side of forehead, eyelids, and tip of nose). Refer to ED. Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma Elderly patient with acute onset of severe eye pain accompanied by headache, nausea/vomiting, halos around lights, and decreased vision. Examination reveals a mid- dilated pupil(s) that is oval shaped. The cornea appears cloudy. Funduscopic examination reveals cupping of the optic nerve. This is an ophthalmological emergency. If the rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) is slower, patient may be asymptomatic. Refer to ED. 142114 Multiple Sclerosis (Optic Neuritis) Young adult with new or intermittent loss of vision of one eye (optic neuritis) alone or accompanied by nystagmus or other abnormal eye movements. May be accompanied by other neurological symptoms (aphasia, paresthesia, abnormal gait, spasticity, etc.). Complains of daily fatigue on awakening that worsens as day goes on. Heat exacerbates and worsens symptoms (heat sensitivity). Has recurrent episodes. Refer to neurologist. Orbital Cellulitis Acute onset of erythematous swollen eyelid with proptosis (bulging of the eyeball) and eye pain on affected eye. Unable to perform full range of motion (ROM) of the eyes (abnormal extraocular movement [EOM] exam) with pain on eye movement. Look for history of recent rhinosinusitis or upper respiratory infection (URI). Caused by acute bacterial infection of the orbital contents (fat and ocular muscles). More common in young children than adults. Serious complication. Refer to ED. Retinal Detachment Sudden onset of a shower of floaters associated with \"looking through a curtain\" sensation with sudden flashes of light (photopsia). Refer to ED. EARS, NOSE, AND SINUSES Cholesteatoma \"Cauliflower-like\" growth accompanied by foul-smelling ear discharge. Hearing loss on affected ear. On examination, no tympanic membrane or ossicles are visible because of destruction by the tumor. History of chronic otitis media infection. The mass is not cancerous, but it can erode into the bones of the face and damage the facial nerve (CN VII). Treated with antibiotics and surgical debridement. Refer to otolaryngologist. Battle Sign \"Raccoon eyes\" (periorbital ecchymosis) and bruising behind the ear (mastoid area) that appears about 2 to 3 days after trauma. Physical exam (after trauma) does not show these two clinical signs immediately. Search for a clear golden serous discharge from the ear or nose (described next). Rule out basilar and/or temporal bone skull fracture. Basilar skull fractures can cause intracranial hemorrhage. Refer to ED. Clear Golden Fluid Discharge From the Nose/Ear Indicative of a basilar skull fracture. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) slowly leaks through the fracture. Testing the fluid with a urine dipstick will show that it is positive for glucose, whereas plain mucus or mucopurulent drainage will be negative. Refer to ED. 143115 PHARYNX Peritonsillar Abscess Severe sore throat and difficulty swallowing, odynophagia (pain on swallowing), trismus (jaw muscle spasm making it difficult to open mouth), and a \"hot potato\" voice. Unilateral swelling of the peritonsillar area and soft palate. Affected area is markedly swollen and appears as a bulging red mass with the uvula displaced away from the mass. Accompanied by malaise, fever, and chills. Refer to ED. Diphtheria Sore throat, fever, and markedly swollen neck (\"bull neck\"). are coated with a gray- to yellow-colored pseudomembrane that is hard to displace. Very contagious. Contact prophylaxis required. Refer to ED. NORMAL FINDINGS EYES Fundi: The veins are larger than arteries; veins are darker (in color) than arteries Cones: For color perception, 20/20 vision, sharp vision Rods: For detecting light and shadow, night vision Macula (and fovea): The macula is the area responsible for central vision; the fovea (which contains large numbers of cones) is set in the middle, the area of the eye that determines 20/20 vision (sharpest vision) Presbyopia: Age-related visual change due to a decreased ability of the eye to accommodate stiffening of the lenses; usually starts at the age of 40 years; near vision is affected with decreased ability to read small print at close range EARS Bones (ossicles) of the ear: Malleus, incus, and stapes. The stapes is the smallest bone in the body. Tympanic membrane (TM): Appears as translucent off-white to gray color with the \"cone of light\" intact. Tympanogram: This is the most objective measure to test for presence of fluid inside middle ear (results in a straight line vs. a peaked shape). Acute otitis media and serious otitis media will show a straight line on testing. Pinna: Has a large amount of cartilage. Refer injuries to plastic surgeon. Tragus: A small cartilage flap of tissue that is on front of the ear. Cartilage: Is found on the nose and the ears. Does not regenerate. Refer injuries to 144116 plastic surgeon. Cerumen: Ear wax; the color can range from yellow to dark brown. NOSE Only the inferior nasal turbinates are usually visible. The medial and superior turbinates are not visible without special instruments. Bluish, pale, and/or boggy nasal turbinates are seen in allergic rhinitis. Lower third of the nose is cartilage. Cartilage tissue does not regenerate; if damaged, refer to plastic surgeon. SINUSES Sinuses are air-filled cavities in the skull. There are four: ethmoid and maxillary sinuses (both present at birth), frontal (age 5 years), and sphenoid (age 12 years). By age 12 years, a child's sinuses are nearly at adult proportions. MOUTH Mucous membranes are pink to dark pink and moist. Look for ulcers, fissures, leukoplakia, and inflammation. If the gums are red and swollen, the patient may have gingivitis (gums may bleed when brushing teeth) or be taking phenytoin (Dilantin) for seizures (gingival hyperplasia). The tongue should not be red or swollen (glossitis). A normal adult has 32 teeth (except wisdom teeth). Leukoplakia: White to light-gray patch that appears on tongue, floor of mouth, or inside cheek. Rule out oral cancer. Chewing or smoking tobacco and alcohol abuse are risk factors for oral cancer. Aphthous stomatitis (canker sores): Painful shallow ulcers on soft tissue of the mouth that usually heal within 7 to 10 days. Cause is unknown. Treat symptoms with \"Magic mouthwash\" (combination of liquid diphenhydramine, viscous lidocaine, and glucocorticosteroid). Swish, hold, and spit every 4 hours as needed. See Figure 5.1 . Avulsed tooth: Store in cool milk (no ice) and see dentist as soon as possible for reimplantation. Vermillion border: Vermillion border is the edges of the lips. The corners of the lips are called the oral commissure (cheilosis, perleche). 145Figure 5.1 Aphthous stomatitis (canker sore). This image can be found in color in the app. Source: Courtesy of Pfiffner Pascal. SALIVARY GLANDS There are three salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual). The glands may become infected (sialadenitis, sialadenosis, mumps) or can become blocked with calculi TONSILS Also known as the palatine ; tonsils are made up of lymphoid tissue. Butterfly-shaped glands with small pore-like openings that may secrete thick white exudate (mononucleosis) or purulent exudate that is a yellow to green color (strep throat). POSTERIOR PHARYNX Look for postnasal drip (acute sinusitis, allergic rhinitis). Laying down supine worsens a postnasal drip cough. Sometimes, chronic sinusitis causes a chronic cough. Posterior pharyngeal lymph nodes that are mildly enlarged and distributed evenly on the back of the throat (allergies, allergic rhinitis). Hard palate: Look for any openings (cleft palate), ulcers, redness. Uvula: Should be in midline position; is displaced if infected and abscessed. BENIGN VARIANTS 146117 Geographic Tongue Tongue surface has a map-like appearance; patches may move from day to day Patient may complain of soreness with acidic foods, spicy foods Torus Palatinus Painless bony protuberance midline on the hard palate (roof of the mouth); may be asymmetrical; skin should be normal Does not interfere with normal function Fishtail or Split Uvula Uvula is split into two sections and resembles a fish tail May be a sign of an occult cleft palate (rare) Physiological Gaze-Evoked Nystagmus On prolonged extreme lateral gaze, a few beats of nystagmus that resolve when the eye moves back toward midline in healthy patients, is normal Can also be caused by brain lesions ABNORMAL FINDINGS Papilledema Optic disc swollen with blurred edges due to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to bleeding, brain Hypertensive ( Figure 5.2 (caused by arteriosclerosis) Arteriovenous nicking (when arteriosclerotic arteriole crosses retinal vein, it vein) Retinal hemorrhages 147118 Figure 5.2 Hypertensive retinopathy.

Diabetic Retinopathy Microaneurysms (small bulges in retinal blood vessels that often leak fluid) caused by neovascularization (new fragile arteries in the retina that rupture and bleed) Cotton wool spots (fluffy yellow-white patches on the retina) Cataracts Opacity of the lens of the eye, which can be central (nuclear cataract) or on the sides (cortical cataract) Up to 20% of older adults (aged 65-74 years) are affected; however, cataracts can appear at any age from birth (congenital cataracts) through adulthood to the elderly Symptoms include difficulty with glare (with headlights when driving at night or sunlight), halos around lights, and blurred vision Allergic Rhinitis Blue-tinged or pale and swollen (boggy) nasal turbinates associated with increased in clear nasal discharge May be accompanied by itchy nose and nasal congestion Koplik's Spots ( Figure 5.3 ) Clusters of small-sized red papules with white centers inside the cheeks (buccal mucosa) 148by the lower molars Pathognomonic for measles Figure 5.3 Koplik's spots. This image can be found in color in the app. Source: Heinz F. Eichenwald, MD/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Retrieved from https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=3187 . Nasal Polyps Painless and soft round growths inside the nose. Look for fleshy mass inside nasal cavity. May have blockage on one side of the nose. There is increased risk of aspirin sensitivity or allergy. Hairy Leukoplakia ( Figure 5.4 ) Elongated papilla on the lateral aspects of the tongue that is pathognomonic for HIV infection Caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of tongue Leukoplakia of the Oral Mucosa/Tongue Bright-white plaque caused by chronic irritation, such as from chewing tobacco or snuff (rule out oral cancer) or on the inner cheeks (buccal mucosa) 149119 Figure 5.4 Oral hairy leukoplakia. This image can be found in color in the app. Source: National Cancer Institute. Cheilosis (Angular Cheilitis, Perleche) Painful skin fissures and maceration at the corners of the mouth due to excessive moisture. More common in elderly with dentures. Can be acute or chronic. Secondary infection with Candida albicans (yeast) or bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus ). Multiple etiologies such as oversalivation, poorly dentures, nutritional deficiencies, lupus, autoimmune disease, irritant dermatitis, squamous cell carcinoma, and pacifier use in children. Treatment Plan Check B12 level to rule out pernicious anemia with cheliosis Remove underlying cause. Check if dentures fit correctly; if loose, refer to dentist. If yeast infection is suspected, microscopy with KOH. If positive (pseudohyphae and spores), treat with topical azole ointment (e.g., clotrimazole, miconazole) BID. If suspect staphylococcal infection, C&S. If positive, treat with topical mupirocin ointment BID. When infection has cleared, use barrier cream with zinc or petroleum jelly applied at night. High rate of recurrence. EENT TERMINOLOGY Palpebral conjunctiva: Mucosal lining inside the eyes Buccal mucosa: Mucosal lining inside the mouth Soft palate: Refers to the area where uvula, tonsils, anterior of throat are located Hard palate: \"Roof\" of the mouth Hyperopia: \"Farsightedness\"; distance vision is intact, but near vision is blurry 150120 Myopia: \"Nearsightedness\"; near vision intact, but distance vision is blurry Cobblestoning: Hyperplastic lymphoid tissue on the posterior pharynx EVALUATION AND TESTING VISION TESTING Distance Vision The Snellen chart measures central distance vision. If the person is illiterate, use the Tumbling E chart. Patient must stand 20 feet away from the chart. If the patient wears glasses, test the vision with the glasses with both eyes (OU), the right eye (OD), and the left eye (OS). Abnormal: Two-line difference between each eye; less than four letters out of six correct. Near Vision Ask patient to read small print. Peripheral Vision Use the \"visual fields of confrontation\" exam. Look for blind spots (scotoma) and peripheral visual field defects. Color Blindness Use the Ishihara chart. Visual Test Results Definition of a Snellen test result 20/60: Top number (or numerator): The distance in feet at which the patient stands from the Snellen or picture eye chart (always 20 feet and never changes). Bottom number (or denominator): The number of feet that the patient can see compared to a person with normal vision (20/20 or less). Number changes, dependent on patient's vision. In this example, the patient can see at 20 feet what a person with normal vision can see at 60 feet. Legal blindness: Defined as a best corrected vision of 20/200 or less or a visual field less than 20 degrees (tunnel vision). Children By the age of 6 years, visual acuity (retina or CN II) is 20/20 in both eyes. Use the Snellen chart with the child standing 20 feet away from the chart. If the child's vision is not at least 151121 20/30 in either eye by age 6 years, refer to ophthalmologist. HEARING TESTS ( Table 5.1 ) Table 5.1 Types of Hearing Loss: Results of Weber and Rinne Tests Results Weber Test Rinne Test Normal No lateralization (hears sound equally in both ears) AC > BC Sensorineural loss Presbycusis M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease Lateralization to \"good\" ear (sound is heard louder in the ear that is normal) AC > BC Conductive loss Otitis media Serous membrane Lateralization to \"bad\" ear (sound is heard louder in the \"bad\" or affected ear) BC > AC AC, air conduction; BC, bone conduction. Weber Test ( Figure 5.5 ) Place the tuning fork midline on the forehead. Normal finding: No lateralization. If lateralization (hears the sound in only one ear), abnormal finding. Figure 5.5 Weber test. Rinne Test Place tuning fork first on mastoid process, then at front of the ear. Time each area. 152122 Normal finding: Air conduction (AC) lasts longer than bone conduction (BC; i.e., can hear longer in front of ear than on mastoid bone). Types of Hearing Loss Conductive Hearing Loss (Outer Ear and Middle Ear) Any type of obstruction (or conduction) of the sound waves will cause conductive hearing loss. Other causes include blockage of the outer ear (ceruminosis, otitis externa) or fluid inside the middle ear (otitis media, serous otitis media). Sensorineural Hearing Loss (Inner Ear) Damage (or aging) of the cochlea/vestibule (presbycusis, M\u00e9n\u00e8re's disease) and/or to the nerve pathways (CN VIII or acoustic nerve) causes sensorineural hearing loss. causes are ototoxic drugs (oral aminoglycosides, erythromycin, tetracyclines, high-dose aspirin, sildenafil, etc.) and stroke. Usually results in permanent hearing loss. EXAM TIPS The Weber and Rinne test results are complete opposites of each other. For example, in sensorineural hearing loss, Rinne is AC greater than BC. In conductive hearing loss, it is Rinne BC greater than AC. During the exam, you could write this on your scratch paper (discussed in Chapter 1 ). DISEASE REVIEW EYES Corneal Abrasion Complains of acute onset of severe eye pain with tearing. Reports feeling of a foreign body sensation on the surface of the eye. Always ask any patient with eye complaints whether he or she wears contact lenses. Herpes Keratitis Complains of acute onset of severe eye pain, photophobia, and blurred vision in affected eye. Diagnosed by using fluorescein dye. A black lamp in a darkened room is used to search for fern-like lines in the corneal surface. (Corneal abrasions appear more linear or round.) Infection permanently damages corneal epithelium, which may result in corneal blindness. Contact Lens-Related Keratitis 153123 Complains of acute onset of red eye, blurred vision, watery eyes, photophobia, and sometimes a foreign-body sensation in affected eye. History of using contacts past prescribed time schedule, sleeping with contact lens, bathes/showers or swims with contacts, extended lens use, and use of tap/well water or poor disinfection practices. Objective Findings Use fluorescein dye strips with Wood's lamp (black lamp) in darkened room. Contact lens- associated abrasions are usually in the center and are round. Herpes keratitis appears as fernlike or branching curved lines (in contrast, corneal abrasions usually appear round or linear). Treatment Plan Always check visual acuity and check pupils with penlight. Rule out penetrating trauma, retained foreign body, and contact lens-associated eye infections. If suspect bacterial infection, obtain C&S of eye discharge. Flush eye with sterile normal saline to remove foreign body. Evert eyelid to look for foreign body. If unable to remove, refer. Use topical ophthalmic antibiotic with pseudomonal coverage (especially if contact lens user) such as ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan), ofloxacin (Ocuflox), trimethoprim-polymyxin B (Polytrim) applied to affected eye \u00d7 3 to 5 days. Do not patch eye. Follow up in 24 hours. If not improved, refer to ED or ophthalmologist stat (Zovirax or Valtrex BID). Avoid steroid ophthalmic drops for herpes keratitis. Consider eye pain prescription (hydrocodone with acetaminophen; prescribe enough for 48 hours of use). Topical pain medication Acular 1 gtts of a hair follicle and sebaceous gland in the upper or lower eyelid. An internal hordeolum involves inflammation of the meibomian gland. May have history of blepharitis. Classic Case Complains of acute onset of a swollen, red, and warm abscess on the upper or lower eyelid involving one hair follicle that gradually enlarges. May spontaneously rupture and drain purulent exudate. Infection may spread to adjoining tissue (preseptal cellulitis). Treatment Plan Hot compresses \u00d7 5 to 10 minutes BID to TID until it drains If infection spreads (preseptal cellulitis), systemic antibiotics such as dicloxacillin or erythromycin PO QID. Refer to ophthalmologist for incision and drainage (I&D). Chalazion 154A chronic inflammation of the meibomian gland (specialized sweat gland) of the eyelids. It may resolve spontaneously in 2 to 8 weeks. Classic Case Complains of a gradual onset of a small superficial nodule on the upper eyelid that feels like a bead and is discrete and movable. Painless. Can slowly enlarge over time. If chalazion is large, it can press on the cornea and cause blurred vision. Treatment Plan Treatment is I&D, surgical removal, or intrachalazion corticosteroid injections by ophthalmologist. Pinguecula A raised yellow to white small round growth in the bulbar conjunctiva (skin covering eyeball) next to the cornea. Located on the nasal and temporal side of the eye. Caused by chronic sun exposure. Pterygium ( Figure 5.6 ) A yellow triangular (wedge-shaped) thickening of the conjunctiva that extends across the cornea on the nasal side. Results from chronic sun exposure. Sometimes called surfer's eye . Can be red or inflamed at times. May complain of foreign body sensation on the eye. Figure 5.6 Severe pterygium. This image can be found in color in the app. Source: Courtesy of Sciencia58. Treatment Plan (Both Pinguecula and Pterygium) If inflamed, refer to ophthalmologist for prescription of weak steroid eye drops only during exacerbations. Use artificial tears PRN for irritation. Recommend use of good-quality sunglasses (100% against UVA and UVB). Remove surgically if encroaches on cornea and affects vision. 155124 Subconjunctival Hemorrhage Blood that is trapped underneath the conjunctiva and sclera secondary to broken arterioles. Can be caused by coughing, sneezing, heavy lifting, vomiting, local trauma, or can occur spontaneously. Resolves within 1 to 3 weeks (blood reabsorbed) like a bruise, with color changes from red, to green, to yellow. Increased risk if on aspirin, anticoagulants, and patient has hypertension. Classic Case Complains of sudden onset of bright-red blood in one eye after an incident of severe coughing, sneezing, or straining. May also be due to trauma such as a fall. Denies visual loss and pain. Treatment Plan Watchful waiting and reassurance of patient. Follow up until resolution. Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Gradual onset of increased IOP greater than 22 mmHg due to blockage of the drainage of aqueous humor inside the eye. The retina (CN 2) undergoes ischemic changes and, if untreated, becomes permanently damaged. Most common type of glaucoma (60%-70%). Classic Case Most commonly seen in elderly patients, especially those of African or Caucasian ancestry or diabetics. Usually asymptomatic during early stages. Gradual changes in peripheral vision (lost first) and then central vision. May complain of missing portions of words when reading. If funduscopic exam shows cupping, IOP is too high. Refer to ophthalmologist. Treatment Plan Check IOP (use tonometer). Normal range: 8 to 21 mmHg. IOP of 30 mmHg or more is considered very high. Urgent referral within 24 hours or less to ophthalmologist or refer to ED. Medications Betimol 0.5 % ( timolol): (increase aqueous outflow) Side effects and contraindications: Same as oral form; include bronchospasm, fatigue, depression, heart failure, bradycardia Contraindicated: Asthma, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), second- to third-degree heart block, heart failure Complication Blindness due to ischemic damage to retina (CN II) Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma 156125 Sudden blockage of aqueous humor causes marked increase of the IOP, resulting in ischemia and permanent damage to the optic nerve (CN II). Classic Case Older patient complains of acute onset of decreased/blurred vision with severe eye pain and frontal headache that is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Objective Findings Eyes: Fixed and mid-dilated cloudy pupil (4-6 mm) that looks more oval than round. Pupil reacts slowly to light. Conjunctival injection with increased lacrimation. Treatment Plan Refer to ED. Anterior Uveitis (Iritis) Insidious onset of eye pain with conjunctival injection (redness; note that injection of the eye means the superficial blood vessels of the conjunctiva are prominent [red eyes]) located mainly on the limbus (junction between cornea and sclera) that is a complication of autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid lupus, ankylosing spondylitis), discharge (as in bacterial conjunctivitis). Refer to ophthalmologist for management as soon as possible within 24 hours. Anterior uveitis can result in blindness. Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Usually asymptomatic during the early stages. Caused by gradual damage to the pigment of the macula (area of central vision) that results in severe visual loss to blindness. Leading cause of blindness in the elderly. More common in smokers. AMD can either be atrophic (dry form) or exudative (wet form). The dry form of AMD is more common (85%-90%) and is \"less severe\" compared to the wet form. The wet form of AMD is responsible for 80% of vision loss (choroidal neovascularization). Classic Case Elderly smoker complains of gradual or sudden and painless loss of central vision in one or both eyes. Reports that straight lines (doors, windows) appear distorted or curved. Peripheral vision is usually preserved. Treatment Plan Refer to ophthalmologist. Patient is given a copy of the Amsler grid (focus eye on center dot and view grid 12 inches from eyes). Patient checks visual field loss daily to weekly (center of grid is distorted, blind spot or scotoma, or wavy lines). \"Ocular\" vitamins are lutein and zeaxanthin with zinc. Patients should consult their ophthalmologist before taking ocular vitamins. 157126 Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome Chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by decreased function of the lacrimal and salivary glands. It can occur alone or with another autoimmune disorder (i.e., with rheumatoid arthritis). Classic Case The classic symptoms are persistent daily symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth (xerostomia) for longer than 3 months. Complains of chronic \"dry eyes\" and that both eyes have sandy or gritty sensation (keratoconjunctivitis sicca). Has used over-the-counter (OTC) artificial tears more than three times per day. Marked increase in dental caries; oral examination shows swollen and inflamed salivary glands. Treatment Plan Use OTC tear-substitute eye drops three times/day. Refer to ophthalmologist (keratoconjunctivitis sicca). Refer to dentist (dental caries). Refer to rheumatologist for management. Blepharitis Chronic condition caused by inflammation of the eyelids (hair follicles, meibomian glands). Associated with seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea. Lid may be colonized by staphylococcal bacteria. Intermittent exacerbations. Complains of itching or irritation in the eyelids (upper/lower or both), gritty sensation, eye redness, and crusting. Treatment Plan Johnson's Baby Shampoo with warm water: Gently scrub eyelid margins until resolves. Consider topical antibiotic solution (erythromycin eye drops) to eyelids two to three times/day (lid hygiene). Commercial eye lid scrub products are available. Warm compress to eyelids two to four times/day during exacerbations to soften debris and relieve itching. NOSE Allergic Rhinitis Inflammatory changes of the nasal mucosa due to allergy. Increases risk of sinusitis. May have intermittent, seasonal, or daily symptoms. Atopic family history (asthma, eczema). May be allergic to dust mites (daily symptoms), mold and grasses (summer), ragweed pollen (fall), cockroach dander (older buildings in urban areas), others. May affect sleep and quality of life. Affects 10% to 30% of adults and children in the United States. Classic Case Complains of chronic or seasonal nasal congestion with clear mucus rhinorrhea or postnasal drip. Coughing due to postnasal drip worsens when supine. Accompanied by nasal itch 158127 and, at times, frequent sneezing. Some people produce a clicking sound to clear mucus inside their throat (palatal click). Objective Findings Nose has or pale turbinates. Mucus clear. Posterior pharynx reveals thick mucus, with colors ranging from clear, white, yellow, or green (rule out sinusitis). Undereye \"circles\" (venodilation). Children may have salute). Posterior (hyperplastic lymphoid (Flonase) BID, triamcinolone (Nasacort Allergy 24HR), one to two sprays once a day. If only partial relief, another option is topical antihistamine nasal spray azelastine (Astelin) daily or BID. If no relief, consider combination product (azelastine and fluticasone nasal spray). Use cromolyn sodium nasal spray TID (less effective than steroids). Use decongestants (i.e., pseudoephedrine, or Sudafed) PRN. Do not children. daily careful with diphenhydramine (Benadryl); it causes sedation. Ideally, eliminate environmental allergens. Dust mite allergies: Avoid using ceiling fans, no stuffed animals or pets in bed, use a HEPA filter for air conditioners, room filters, and the like. Refer to allergist. Complications Acute sinusitis Acute otitis media Rhinitis Medicamentosa Prolonged use of topical nasal decongestants (>3 days) causes rebound effects that result in severe and chronic nasal congestion. Patients present with daily severe nasal congestion and nasal discharge (clear, watery, mucus). Epistaxis (Nosebleeds) Anterior nasal bleeds are milder and more common than posterior nasal bleeds. Most episodes are self-limiting. Anterior nasal bleeds are the result of bleeding from Kiesselbach's plexus (vascular area). Posterior nasal bleeds can lead to severe hemorrhage. Aspirin use, NSAIDs, cocaine abuse, severe hypertension, and anticoagulants (i.e., warfarin sodium or Coumadin) place patients at higher risk. (Intranasal cocaine use can cause nosebleeds and nasal septum perforation.) 159128 Classic Case Complains of acute onset of nasal bleeding secondary to trauma (i.e., nose picking). Bright- red blood may drip externally through the nasal passages and/or the posterior pharynx. Profuse bleeding can result in vomiting of blood. Treatment Plan Apply direct pressure on the front of the nose for several minutes. Use of nasal decongestants (i.e., Afrin) to shrink tissue helps to stop bleeding. Apply triple antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly in front of the nose using cotton swab for a few days. Complications Posterior nasal bleeds may hemorrhage. Refer to ED. THROAT Streptococcal Pharyngitis/Tonsillopharyngitis (\"Strep\" Throat) An acute infection of the pharynx and/or palatine tonsils caused by group A streptococcal bacteria ( Streptococcus pyogenes ). Keep in mind that most pathogen is viral (rhinovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], etc.). Suspect viral etiology (or coinfection) if cough and symptoms such as stuffy nose, rhinitis with clear mucus, and watery eyes (coryza). Classic Case All ages are affected, but is most common in children. Abrupt onset of fever, sore throat, pain on swallowing, and mildly enlarged submandibular nodes. May have purulent exudate on tonsils. Anterior cervical nodes mildly enlarged and tender (anterior cervical adenitis). Adult may report having a child attending preschool. Note Centor criteria are a clinical decision tool used to help diagnose \"strep\" throat. Criteria for strep throat include tonsillar exudate, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, history of fever, and absence of cough. Objective Findings Pharynx dark pink to bright red. Adults usually afebrile (or mild fever). May have tonsillar exudate that is yellow to green color. May have petechiae on the hard palate (roof of the mouth). Anterior cervical lymph nodes mildly enlarged. Treatment Plan 160Rapid antigen detection testing (RADT) is a rapid \"strep\" test or throat C&S First line: Oral penicillin V 500 mg BID to TID \u00d7 10 days Alternative: Amoxicillin 500 mg BID Penicillin or beta-lactam allergy: Azithromycin (Tylenol) Symptomatic treatment: throat lozenges; drink more fluids Repeat C&S after antibiotic treatment (test-of-cure): History of mitral valve prolapse or heart valve surgery Complications Scarlet fever (scarlatina): Sandpaper-textured pink rash with sore throat and strawberry tongue (red sore tongue). Rash starts on the head and neck and spreads to the trunk, then the extremities. Next, the skin desquamates (peels off). Increased risk of acute rheumatic fever. Acute rheumatic fever: Inflammatory reaction to strep infection that may affect the heart and the valves, joints, and the brain. Peritonsillar abscess: Displaced uvula, red bulging mass on one side of anterior pharyngeal space, dysphagia, fever. Refer to ED stat . Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis : Abrupt onset of proteinuria, hematuria, dark-colored urine, and RBC casts (urine) accompanied by hypertension and edema. EARS AND SINUSES Acute Otitis Media (AOM; Purulent or Suppurative Otitis Media) Most cases occur in childhood. An acute infection of the middle ear cavity with bacterial pathogens due to mucus that becomes trapped in the middle ear secondary to temporary eustachian tube dysfunction. The infection is usually unilateral, but may at times involve both ears. Most have middle ear effusion (MEE). Organisms Adult infections usually due to S. pneumoniae . High rates of beta-lactamase resistance. S. pneumoniae (gram up to 40% of cases Haemophilus influenzae (gram negative; up to 50% of cases) Moraxella catarrhalis (gram negative; up to 20% of cases) Classic Case Complains of ear pain (otalgia), popping noises, muffled hearing. Recent history of a cold or flare-up of allergic rhinitis. Adult infections usually develop much more slowly than in children. Afebrile or low-grade fever. May be accompanied by rupture of the TM (reports blood and pus seen on pillowcase on awakening with relief of ear pain). Bullous Myringitis 161129 Type of AOM infection that is more painful due to the presence of blisters (bullae) on a reddened and bulging tympanic membrane. Conductive hearing loss. Caused by different types of pathogens (mycoplasma, viral, bacteria). Treat the same as bacterial AOM. Objective Findings Weber exam shows lateralization to the \"bad\"/affected ear (conductive hearing loss). Rinne test result is BC > AC (conductive hearing loss). TM: Bulging or retraction with displaced light reflex (displaced landmarks); may look opaque Erythematous TM Decreased mobility with flat-line tracing on tympanogram (most objective finding) If TM is ruptured, purulent discharge from affected ear (and relief of ear pain) Treatment Plan First Line Amoxicillin is first-line treatment for any age group (if no antibiotics in the prior month). Give amoxicillin 500 mg PO TID \u00d7 5 to 7 days. Mild to moderate disease: Treat 5 to 7 days. Severe disease: Treat 10 days. Most patients will respond in 48 to 72 hours. If no response to treatment, switch to second-line drug such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) (Avelox) daily \u00d7 5 days. In addition to antibiotic, treat symptoms of ear pain (otalgia) and eustachian tube dysfunction (becomes swollen due to inflammation and cannot drain.). Patient will complain of a \"plugged up\" ear (MEE) and decreased hearing in affected ear (temporary). When fluid in the middle ear drains, hearing will become normal. CLINICAL PEARLS MEEs can persist for 8 weeks or longer after treatment of AOM. Allergy pillow covers, allergy mattresses, and HEPA allergy filters for air conditioners are recommended for patients with allergic rhinitis. Many are allergic to dust mites, an indoor allergen. ACUTE BACTERIAL RHINOSINUSITIS (ABRS) The maxillary and frontal sinuses are most commonly affected. Reports a history of a \"bad cold\" or flare-up of allergic rhinitis. Fluid is trapped inside the sinuses, causing secondary bacterial ( S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae ) or viral infection. Classic Case Complains of unilateral facial pain or upper molar pain (maxillary sinus) with nasal 162130 congestion for 10 days or longer with purulent nasal and/or postnasal drip. If frontal sinusitis, pain is located over the frontal sinus. May report hyposmia (reduced ability to smell). Postnasal drip cough worsens when supine and may interfere with sleep. Self- treatment with OTC cold and sinus remedies provides no relief of symptoms. Objective Findings Posterior pharynx: Purulent dark yellow- to green-colored postnasal drip tender to palpation on the front cheek (maxillary) or on frontal sinus area above the inner canthus of the eye If seen with allergy flare-up, possible boggy swollen nasal turbinates Fever seen more often in children than adults Transillumination (frontal and maxillary sinuses: Positive (\"glow\" of light on infected sinus is duller compared with normal sinus); in transillumination, turn off the light (darken room). Place a bright light source directly on the surface of the cheek (on maxillary sinus). Instruct patient to open mouth and look at the roof of the mouth (hard palate) for a round glow of light. Compare both sides. The \"affected\" sinus has no glow or duller glow compared with the normal sinus. For frontal sinusitis, place the light under the supraorbital ridge in the medial aspect and compare glow of light. Treatment Plan There are two options when treating sinusitis: Symptomatic treatment without antibiotics if mild, uncomplicated ABRS in healthy patient). Follow up in 10 days (if better, no antibiotics needed). If symptoms are worse (or have not resolved) on follow-up visit, initiate antibiotic treatment. Treat with antibiotics if there are severe symptoms (toxic, high fever, pain, purulent nasal or postnasal drip for 2 to 3 days or longer), patient is immunocompromised, symptoms present for longer than 10 days (or have worsened). There is a high rate of spontaneous resolution in acute sinusitis (Gilbert, Chambers, Eliopoulos, Saag, & Pavia, 2016). Antibiotic (Adults) Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) 1,000/62.5 mg or 2,000 mg/125 mg one tablet PO BID \u00d7 5 to 7 days. Treatment of children is covered in Section IV, Pediatrics and Adolescents Review. Penicillin Allergy or Alternative Antibiotics Type 1 allergy (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema): Levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily or doxycycline BID \u00d7 5 to 7 days Type 2 skin Cefdinir (Omnicef), cefpodoxime (Vantin), cefuroxime (Ceftin) PO BID 7 days Symptomatic or Adjunct Treatment (Rhinosinusitis or Otitis Media) Pain or fever 163131 Naproxen sodium PRN Acetaminophen (Tylenol) every 4 Oral decongestants such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) or with guaifenesin (Mucinex D) Topical decongestants (i.e., Afrin): Use only for 3 days maximum or will cause rebound Saline nasal spray (Ocean spray) one to two sprays every 2 to 3 hours PRN Steroid nasal spray (Flonase, Vancenase) if allergic rhinitis do not crush, suck, or chew; toxic for children younger than age 10 years (seizures, cardiac arrest, death) Increase intake of fluids, avoid exposure to cigarette smoke and alcohol The use of systemic steroids is not recommended Treatment Failure If symptoms persist despite treatment (purulent nasal discharge, sinus pain, nasal congestion, fever), switch to another antibiotic. If on amoxicillin, change antibiotic to amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) PO q12h \u00d7 10 to 14 days or levofloxacin (Levaquin) 750 mg daily. Recurrent sinusitis, refer to otolaryngologist. Serious Complications of Otitis Media and Rhinosinusitis Refer to ED stat . Mastoiditis: Red and swollen mastoid that is tender to palpation. Preorbital or orbital cellulitis (more common in children): Swelling and redness at periorbital area, double vision or impaired vision and fever. Abnormal EOM (extraorbital muscles) movement of affected orbit (check cranial nerves, EOM). Altered level of consciousness (LOC) or mental status changes. Meningitis: Acute onset of high fever, stiff neck, severe headache, photophobia, toxic. Positive Brudzinski's or Kernig's sign. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: Complains of acute headache, abnormal neurological exam, confused, febrile. Life-threatening emergency with high mortality. Otitis Media With Effusion (OME; Serous Otitis Media) May follow AOM. Can also be caused by chronic allergic rhinitis. Complains of ear pressure, popping noises, and muffled hearing in affected ear. Sterile serous fluid is trapped inside middle ear. Objective Findings TM may bulge or retract. Tympanogram abnormal (flat line or no peak). TM should not be red. 164132 A fluid level and/or bubbles may be visible inside the tympanic membrane. Treatment Plan Oral decongestants (pseudoephedrine or phenylalanine) Steroid nasal spray BID to TID \u00d7 few weeks or saline nasal spray (Ocean spray) PRN Otitis Externa (Swimmer's Ear) Bacterial infection of the skin of the external ear canal (rarely fungal). More common during warm and humid weather (i.e., summer). Organisms Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram negative) S. aureus (gram positive) Classic Case Complains of external ear pain, swelling, discharge, pruritus, and hearing loss (if ear canal is blocked with pus). History of recent activities that involve swimming or getting ears wet. Objective Findings Ear pain with manipulation of the external ear or tragus. Purulent green discharge. Erythematous and swollen ear canal that is very tender to touch. Treatment Plan Polymyxin B-neomycin-hydrocortisone (Cortisporin ciprofloxacin otic ear drops BID \u00d7 7 days Keep water out of ear during treatment. If patient has recurrent episodes, prophylaxis is Otic Domeboro (boric) or alcohol and vinegar (VoSol). Infectious Mononucleosis Infection by the EBV (herpesvirus family). Peak ages of acute infection in the United States are between ages 15 and 24 years. After acute infection, EBV virus lies latent in oropharyngeal tissue. Can become reactivated and cause symptoms. Virus is shed mainly through saliva. Classic triad: Fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy (> 50% cases). Classic Case Teenage patient presents with history of sore throat, enlarged posterior cervical nodes, and fatigue (several weeks). Fatigue may last weeks to months. May have abdominal pain due to hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly. History of intimate kissing. Objective Findings CBC: Atypical lymphocytes LFTs: for several Heterophile antibody test (Monospot): Positive (80%-90% of adults) Nodes: Large cervical nodes that may be tender to of the abdomen until resolves Skin: Occasionally a generalized red maculopapular rash is present Treatment Plan Acute stages: Limit physical activity (sports, contact sports, weightlifting) for 4 weeks to reduce risk of splenic rupture. Order abdominal ultrasound if splenomegaly/hepatomegaly is present, especially if patient is an athlete, a physically active adult, or an athletic coach. Repeat abdominal ultrasound in 4 to 6 weeks if abnormal to document resolution. Treat symptoms. Avoid using amoxicillin if patient has \"strep\" throat (drug rash from 70% to 90%). Avoid close contact, kissing, sharing toothbrush, fork, spoon, knife, or using the same glass. Complications Splenomegaly/splenic rupture is a rare but serious complication of mononucleosis. If airway obstruction, hospitalize and give high-dose steroids to decrease swelling. Neurological CBC until lymphocytes normalized. EXAM TIPS Seasonal allergic rhinitis: Topical steroid nasal spray (e.g., Flonase) is Zyrtec work Benadryl sedation and effect lasts several hours. Zyrtec is nonsedating and lasts 24 hours. Acute or reactivated mononucleosis can present with generalized maculopapular rash, enlarged tonsils with cryptic exudate (white or darker color), sore throat, enlarged cervical nodes that are tender to touch. Treatment for otitis externa is Cortisporin Otic drops (topical antibiotic combined with a steroid). Common bacterial pathogen in otitis externa is P. aeruginosa . Ruptured spleen is a catastrophic event. Avoid contact sports (i.e., 4 weeks) until ultrasound documents resolution. Betimol (timolol) ophthalmic drops have the same contraindications as oral beta blockers. Cholesteatoma presents in affected ear with hearing loss, no TM, purulent 166134 exudate with odor, and yellowish to whitish cauliflower-like mass inside the middle ear. Penicillin-allergic patients, use macrolides, gram-positive coverage quinolones (avoid cephalosporins if had class I reaction or anaphylaxis from penicillins). Learn to recognize a description of eye findings such as pinguecula, pterygium, chalazion. Rinne test result of BC greater than AC with conductive hearing loss (i.e., ceruminosis, AOM). Weber test result is lateralization to the \"bad\" or affected ear with conductive hearing loss. Weber or Rinne are tests of the acoustic nerve or CN VIII. Lateralization (hearing sound louder on one side) on the Weber exam is an abnormal finding. Normal finding and sensorineural hearing loss results with the Rinne test is air conduction that lasts longer than bone conduction (AC > BC). Remember what 20/40 vision means: Patient can see at 20 feet what a person with normal vision can see at 40 feet. Carbamide peroxide (similar to hydrogen peroxide) is one of the most common OTC treatments for ceruminosis. Recognize herpes keratitis; cause is either trigeminal nerve ophthalmic If herpes keratitis, refer to ED, ophthalmologist stat . Use fluorescein strips to check for corneal abrasions, keratitis. 167135 6 Skin and Integumentary System Review DANGER SIGNALS Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) Patient presents with abrupt onset of high fever, chills, severe headache, nausea/vomiting, photophobia, myalgia, and arthralgia followed by a rash that erupts 2 to 5 days after onset of fever. The rash consists of small red spots (petechiae) that start to erupt on both the wrist, forearms, and ankles (sometimes the palms and soles). It rapidly progresses toward the trunk until it becomes generalized (approximately 10% RMSF patients do not develop a rash). Most cases of RMSF occur from April to September (spring to summer). Highest frequency among males, Native Americans, and people aged 40 years or older. Higher mortality if not treated during the first 5 days of the infection. First-line treatment is doxycycline (both children and adults). More than 60% of cases occur in five states (NC, OK, AK, TN, MO). Use of DEET-containing repellent on skin and permethrin on clothing and gear can repel dog and deer ticks. See Figure 6.1 and Table 6.1 . Brown Recluse Spider Bites Brown recluse spiders ( Loxosceles reclusa ) are found mostly in the midwestern and southeastern United States. Systemic symptoms include fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting. Deaths are rare but have occurred in young children (younger than age 7 years). Any child with systemic signs should be hospitalized (may cause hemolysis). Most spider bites are located on the arms, upper legs, or the trunk (underneath clothing). Bite may feel like a pinprick (or be painless). The bitten area becomes swollen, red, and tender, and blisters appear within 24 to 48 hours. Central area of bite becomes necrotic (purple-black eschar). When the eschar sloughs off, it leaves an ulcer, which takes several weeks to heal. 168136 Erythema Migrans (Early Lyme Disease) The classic lesion is an expanding red rash with central clearing that resembles a target. The \"bulls-eye\" or target rash usually appears within 7 to 14 days after a deer tick bite (range, 3- 30 days). The rash feels hot to the touch and has a rough texture. Common locations are the belt line, axillary area, behind the knees, and in the groin area. It is accompanied by flu- like symptoms. The lesion spontaneously resolves within a few weeks. It is most common in the northeastern regions of the United States. Use of DEET-containing repellent on skin and permethrin on clothing and gear can repel deer ticks. See Table 6.1 .

Meningococcemia (Meningitis) Symptoms include sudden onset of sore throat, cough, fever, headache, stiff neck, photophobia, and changes in level of consciousness (LOC; drowsiness, lethargy to coma). In some cases, there is abrupt onset of petechial to hemorrhagic rashes (pink to purple colored) in the axillae, flanks, wrist, and ankles (50%-80% of cases). Rapid progression in fulminant cases results in death within 48 hours. The risk is higher for first-year college students residing in dormitories and individuals with asplenia (no spleen), defective spleen (sickle cell anemia), HIV infection, or complement immune system deficiencies (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] recommends vaccination for these higher risk groups). Aerosol droplet precautions. Rifampin (BID for 2 days) prophylaxis is recommended for close contacts. See Table 6.1 . Shingles Infection of the Trigeminal Nerve (Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus) sight-threatening condition caused by reactivation of the herpes zoster virus that is located on the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). Patient reports sudden eruption of multiple vesicular lesions (ruptures into shallow ulcers with crusts) that are located on one side on the scalp, forehead, and the sides and the tip of the nose. If herpetic rash is seen on the tip of the nose, assume it is shingles until proven otherwise. The eyelid on the same side is swollen and red. The patient complains of photophobia, eye pain, and blurred vision. This is more common in elderly patients. Refer to an ophthalmologist or the ED as soon as possible. Melanoma Dark-colored moles with uneven texture, variegated colors, and irregular borders with a diameter of 6 mm or larger are observed. They may be pruritic. If melanoma is in the nail beds (subungual melanoma), it may be very aggressive. Lesions can be located anywhere on the body, including the retina. Risk factors include family history of melanoma (10% of cases), extensive/intense sunlight exposure, blistering sunburn in childhood, tanning beds, high nevus count/atypical nevus, light skin/eyes. See Figure 6.2 . Acral Lentiginous Melanoma This is the most common type of melanoma in African Americans and Asians, and it is a subtype of melanoma (<5%). These dark-brown to black lesions are located on the nail 170138 beds (subungual), palmar, and plantar surfaces, and rarely the mucous membranes. Subungual melanomas look like longitudinal brown to black bands on the nail bed. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) Superficial form (30%) of BCC looks like a pearly or waxy skin lesion with an atrophic or ulcerated center that does not heal. The color could be white, light pink, brown, or flesh colored. It may bleed easily with mild trauma. This is more common in fair-skinned individuals with long-term daily sun exposure. An important risk factor is severe sunburns as a child. See Figure 6.3 . Figure 6.2 Melanoma. This image can be found in color in the app. Source: National Cancer Institute (1985).

Peter. 171139 Actinic Keratosis Older to elderly fair-skinned adults complain of numerous dry, round, and red-colored lesions with a rough texture that do not heal. Lesions are slow growing. Most common locations are sun-exposed areas such as the cheeks, nose, face, neck, arms, and back. The risk is highest for those with light-colored skin, hair, and/or eyes. In some cases, a precancerous lesion of squamous cell carcinoma is a possibility. Patients with early- childhood history of severe sunburns are at higher risk for skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, BCC, melanoma). Subungual Hematoma Direct trauma to the nail bed results in pain and bleeding that is trapped between the nail bed and the finger/toenail. If the hematoma involves more than 25% of the area of the nail, there is a high risk of permanent ischemic damage to the nail matrix if the blood is not drained. One method of draining (trephination) a subungual hematoma is to straighten one end of a steel paperclip or to use an 18-gauge needle and heat it with a flame until it is very hot. The hot end is pushed down gently (90-degree angle) until a 3- to 4-mm hole is burned on the nail. The nail is pressed down gently until most or all of the blood is drained or suctioned with a smaller needle. Blood may continue draining for 24 to 36 hours. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) The classic lesions appear like a target (or a \"bulls-eye\"). Multiple lesions start erupting abruptly and can range from hives, blisters (bullae), petechiae, purpura, and necrosis and sloughing of the epidermis. Extensive mucosal surface involvement (eyes, nose, mouth, esophagus, and bronchial tree) is observed. There could be a prodrome of fever with flulike symptoms by 1 to 3 days before rashes appear. SJS is less severe (involves less than 10% body skin) compared with TEN (involves >30% of body skin). The most common triggers are medications such as to 30% (TEN). Risk factors are HIV-infection (100- fold higher risk), infection, genetics, lupus, malignancies, and others. HIV infected patients have a 40-fold increased risk of SJS/TEN from trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared with the general population. NORMAL FINDINGS Anatomy of the Skin Three layers: Epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous layer Epidermis: No blood vessels; gets nourishment from the dermis. Consists of two layers: Top layer consists of keratinized cells (dead squamous epithelial cells). 172 Bottom layer is where melanocytes reside and vitamin D synthesis occurs. Dermis: Consists of blood vessels, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles. Subcutaneous layer: Is composed of fat, sweat glands, and hair follicles. Skin Examination: Darker-Colored Skin Urticaria and wheals can appear paler than surrounding skin (palpate for induration and warmth). Very dry dark skin can appear ashy to gray in color (check arms and legs). Skin conditions that are more common in people of African background are keloids, hyperpigmentation, and traction alopecia (due to chronic tight Pseudofolliculitis barbae (barber's itch) affects up to 60% of African American men. It is caused by inflammation from the curly hair growing back into the skin. The \"treatment\" is to let the beard hair grow for 3 to 4 weeks. Advise patient to avoid shaving beard hair too short and too close to the skin. Vitamin D Synthesis People with darker skin require longer periods of sun exposure to produce vitamin D. A deficiency in pregnancy results in infantile rickets (brittle bones, skeletal abnormalities). SKIN LESIONS Screening for Melanoma The \"A, B, C, D, E\" of melanoma: A (asymmetry) B (border irregular) C (color varies in the same region) D (diameter >6 mm) E (enlargement or change in size) Other symptoms to watch for include intermittent bleeding with mild trauma and new onset of itching. Skin Cancer Statistics Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Basal cell skin carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. Skin Lesion Review Primary Skin Lesions Macule: Flat nonpalpable lesion less than 1 cm diameter Example : Freckles (ephelis), lentigo or lentigines (plural) Papule: Palpable solid lesion less than or equal to 0.5 cm in diameter 173140 Example : Nevi (moles), acne, small cherry angiomas Plaque: Flattened elevated lesion with variable shape greater than 1 cm in diameter Example : Psoriatic lesions Bulla: Elevated superficial blister filled with serous fluid and more than 1 cm in size Example: Impetigo, second-degree burn with blisters, SJS lesions Vesicle: Elevated superficial skin lesion less than 1 cm in diameter and filled with serous fluid Example : Herpetic lesions Pustule: Elevated superficial skin lesion less than 1 cm in diameter filled with purulent fluid Example : Acne pustules Secondary Skin Lesions Primary lesion that changes; complication of a primary lesion or injury Lichenification : Thickening of the epidermis with exaggeration of normal skin lines due to chronic itching (eczema) Scale : Flaking skin (psoriasis) Crust : be (impetigo) Ulceration : Full-thickness loss of skin (decubiti or pressure injury) Scar : Permanent fibrotic changes following damage to the dermis (surgical scars) Keloids/hypertrophic sca r: Overgrowth of scar tissue; more common in Blacks, Asians DERMATOLOGY TERMS Acral : Distal portions of the limbs such as the hand or feet (acral melanoma) Annular : Ring-shaped Flexural: flexures are body folds (eczema affects flexural folds) Maculopapular rash : Rash with color (usually pink to red) with small bumps that are raised above the skin (viral rashes) Morbilliform: Rash that resembles measles (pink rash with texture) Nummular : Coin-shaped, round (nummular eczema) Purpura : Bleeding into the skin; small bleeds are petechial (RMSF) and larger areas of bleeding are ecchymoses or purpura (meningococcemia) Serpiginous : Wart-like SKIN: CLINICAL FINDINGS Urticaria (Hives) Erythematous and raised skin lesions with discrete borders that are irregular, oval, or round. Lesions become more numerous and enlarge over minutes to hours, and then disappear. 174141 May occur as one episode or recurrent (usually daily) episodes that resolve in 24 hours and then recur. Skin that is compressed (e.g., with tight bra straps) may have lesions that assume a shape (such as linear-shaped lesions under bra strap). Urticaria is considered chronic if it lasts longer than 6 weeks. Most cases are self-limited. Urticaria has multiple etiologies (medications, viral/bacterial infections, insect bites, latex allergies, etc). If associated with angioedema or progresses to anaphylaxis, it can be life-threatening. See Figure 6.4 . Seborrheic Keratoses Soft, wart-like, fleshy growths in the trunk that are located mostly on the back. Skin lesions look like they are \"pasted\" on the skin. Lesions on the same person can range in color from light tan to black. Start to appear during middle age (or later) and become more numerous as patient gets older. Painless. Xanthelasma Raised and yellow-colored soft plaques that are usually located under the brow or upper and/or lower lids of the eyes on the nasal side. If the patient is younger than 40 years of age, rule out hyperlipidemia. About 50% of patients with xanthelasma have hyperlipidemia. If the xanthomas are located on the fingers, it is pathognomic for familial hypercholesterolemia. Order a fasting (9 hours) lipid profile. Also known as plane xanthomas . See Figure 6.5 . Figure 6.4 Urticaria. This image can be found in color in the app. Source: Courtesy of James Heilman, MD. 175142 Figure 6.5 Xanthelasma. This image can be found in color in the app. Source: Courtesy of Klaus D. Peter. Melasma (Mask of Pregnancy) Bilateral brown- to tan-colored stains located on the upper cheeks, malar area (cheeks and nose), forehead, and chin in some women who have been or are pregnant or on oral contraceptive pills (estrogen). The condition is more common in dark-skinned women. Stains are usually permanent but can lighten over time. Vitiligo White patches of skin (hypopigmentation) with irregular shapes that gradually develop and spread over time. It is chronic and progressive and it can be located anywhere on the body. Risk factors are presence of autoimmune disease (Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis [RA], psoriasis, pernicious anemia). Condition is more obvious and disfiguring in patients with darker skin. Refer to dermatologist for treatment options (topical steroids, light therapy, etc.). Advise patient to use sunscreen and avoid prolonged sun exposure (makes white patches more obvious). Psychic effects, such as low self-esteem, can occur. Cherry Angioma Benign small and smooth round papules that are a bright cherry-red color. Sizes range from 1 to 4 mm. Lesions are due to a nest of malformed arterioles in the skin. Always blanches with pressure. More common in middle-aged to older patients. No treatment is necessary. Benign. Lipoma Soft fatty cystic tumors that are usually painless and are located in the subcutaneous layer of the skin. Most are located on the neck, trunk, and arms. Most common type of benign soft tissue tumor. Tumors are round or oval shape and measure 1 to 10 cm or more, and they feel smooth with a discrete edge. They are asymptomatic unless they become too large or 176143 are irritated or ruptured. Surgical excision is an option. Nevi (Moles) Round macules to papules (junctional nevi) in colors ranging from light tan to dark brown. Their borders may be distinct or slightly irregular. Xerosis Inherited skin disorder that results in extremely dry skin and may involve mucosal surfaces such as the mouth (xerostomia) or the conjunctiva of the eye (xerophthalmia). Acanthosis Nigricans Diffuse velvety thickening of the skin that is usually located behind the neck and on the axilla. It is associated with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and cancer of the GI tract. Acrochordon (Skin Tags) Painless and pedunculated outgrowths of skin are the same color as the patient's skin. Common locations are the neck and axillary area. When twisted or traumatized (i.e., gets caught on a necklace), it can become necrotic and drop off the skin. Up to 50% of adults have skin tags. More common in diabetics and the obese. See Figure 6.6 . TOPICAL STEROIDS Avoid steroids in case of suspected fungal etiology because it will worsen the infection. Steroids range in potency from class 1 (superpotent) to class 7 (least potent). Children and the face: Do not use fluorinated topical steroids. Use class 7 (least potent) topical steroids such as 0.5% to 1% hydrocortisone. Class 6 (mild potency) steroids, such as fluocinolone acetonide (Synalar cream/solution), are prescription drugs. Next step if OTC hydrocortisone is not working. Topical steroids: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression may occur with excessive or prolonged use (>2 weeks), especially in infants and children, or with use of potent to ultrapotent topical steroids. These agents can cause striae, skin atrophy, telangiectasia, acne, and hypopigmentation. DISEASE REVIEW Psoriasis Inherited skin disorder in which squamous epithelial cells undergo rapid mitotic division 177and abnormal maturation. The rapid turnover of skin produces the classic psoriatic plaque. See Figure 6.7 . Special Findings Koebner phenomenon: New psoriatic plaques form over areas of skin trauma Auspitz sign: Pinpoint areas of bleeding in the skin when scales from a psoriatic plaque are removed Classic Case Patient complains of pruritic erythematous plaques covered with fine silvery-white scales along with pitted fingernails and toenails. The plaques are distributed in the scalp, elbows, knees, sacrum, and the intergluteal folds. Partially resolving plaques are pink colored with minimal scaling. Patient with psoriatic arthritis will complain of painful red, warm, and swollen joints (migratory arthritis) in addition to the skin plaques. Figure 6.6 Skin tags (achrocordon).

Used with permission. Medications Topical steroids, topical retinoids (tazarotene), tar preparations (psoralen drug class) Severe disease: biologics (etanercept, adalimumab) Black Box Warnings Topical Tacrolimus Rare cases of malignancy (including skin and lymphoma); use sunblock; avoid if patient is immunocompromised Severe Humira, Enbrel, and Remicade are associated with higher risk of serious/fatal infections, malignancy, tuberculosis (TB), fungal infections, sepsis, etc. (baseline purified protein derivative [PPD], CBC with differential). Goeckerman regimen (UVB light and tar-derived topicals) may induce remission in severe cases. Complications Guttate psoriasis (drop-shaped lesions) : Severe form of psoriasis resulting from a beta- hemolytic Streptococcus group A infection (usually due to \"strep\" throat) Actinic Keratoses Precancerous precursor to squamous cell carcinoma. Older adults with fair skin, light- 179145 colored hair (blond, red), and blue eyes who are skin type I or II (white skin) and a history of chronic sun exposure (UV light) have highest incidence of skin cancer. A past history of blistering sunburns as a child increases risk of skin cancer, especially melanoma. Classic Case Older to elderly adult complains of numerous dry, round, and pink to red lesions with a rough and scaly texture that do not heal. Lesions are slow growing and become more numerous with age; most common locations are sun-exposed areas such as the cheeks, nose, face, neck, arms, and back. Early childhood history of frequent sunburns places person at higher risk. Treatment Plan Refer to dermatologist for biopsy (gold standard diagnosis). Treatment ranges from surgery and cryotherapy to topical medications (fluorouracil cream 5% [5-FU], imiquimod, etc.). If there are only a small number of lesions, they can be treated with cryotherapy. With larger numbers, 5-FU cream is used over several weeks. It selectively destroys sun-damaged cells in the skin. Treatment with 5-FU cream (Efudex) causes inflammation that appears as erythema (redness), oozing, crusting, scabs, and soreness, which disappears in a few weeks. Tinea Versicolor Superficial skin infection caused by yeasts Pityrosporum orbiculare or Pityrosporum ovale . See Figure 6.8 . Classic Case Complains of multiple hypopigmented round macules on the chest, shoulders, and/or back that \"appear\" after skin becomes tan from sun exposure; asymptomatic. See Table 6.1 . Figure 6.8 Tinea versicolor. This image can be found in color in the app. 180146 Source: Courtesy of Sarahrosenau. Labs cream BID \u00d7 2 weeks. Advise patient that hypopigmented spots will not spontaneously disappear after treatment (may take several months for pigment to fill in). Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema) Chronic inherited skin disorder marked by extremely pruritic rashes that are located on the hands, flexural folds, and neck (older child to adult). The rashes are exacerbated by stress and environmental factors (i.e., winter). The disorder is associated with atopic disorders such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and multiple allergies (check for family history of atopy). Classic Case Infants up to 2 years of age have a larger area of rash distribution compared to teens and adults. The rashes are typically found on the cheeks, entire trunk, knees, and elbows. Older children and adults have rashes on the hands, neck, and antecubital and popliteal space (flexural folds). The classic rash starts as multiple small vesicles that rupture, leaving painful, bright-red, weepy lesions. The lesions become lichenified from chronic itching and can persist for months. Fissures form that can be secondarily infected with bacteria. Medications Topical steroids and emollients are first-line treatment. Mild Triamcinolone potency, group 4) Facial skin, skin folds (intertriginous area) are at higher for skin atrophy. Use hydrocortisone 1% (low potency, group 7). Halcinonide (Halog) is an example of a high-potency (group 2) topical steroid. Oral antihistamines for Avoid drying skin/xerosis because it will exacerbate eczema (i.e., no hot baths, harsh soaps, chemicals, wool clothing). Hydrating baths (avoid hot water/soaps) followed immediately by application of skin lubricants (Eucerin, Keri Lotion, Crisco, mineral oil). Do not wait until skin is dry before applying. Contact Dermatitis Inflammatory skin reaction caused by direct contact with an irritating external substance; can be a single lesion or generalized rash (i.e., sea-bather's itch). There are two types: 181147 irritant and allergic. Common offenders are poison ivy (Rhus dermatitis), nickel, latex rubber, chemicals, etc. Onset can occur within minutes to several hours after skin contact. Classic Case Acute onset of one to multiple bright-red and pruritic lesions that evolve into bullous or vesicular lesions; they easily rupture, leaving bright-red moist areas that are painful. May complain of burning or stinging. When rash dries, it becomes crusted; very pruritic and becomes lichenified from chronic itching. The shape may follow a pattern (i.e., a ring around a finger) or have asymmetric distribution. Medications Stop exposure to substance. Topical steroids applied once to twice a day \u00d7 1 to 2 weeks. If skin is lichenified or does not involve face or flexural areas, use steroid (triamcinolone, Halog), Calamine lotion, oatmeal baths (Aveeno) PRN. Consider referral to allergist for patch testing. Superficial Candidiasis Superficial skin infection from the yeast Candida albicans . Environmental factors promoting overgrowth are increased warmth and humidity, friction, obesity, diabetes, and decreased immunity. It can infect skin, mucous membranes (thrush, vaginitis), and systemically. Intertrigo/intertriginous areas of the body (or apposed areas of skin that rub together) can be infected by either fungal (candidal intertrigo) and/or bacterial organisms. Classic Case External (Skin) An obese adult complains of bright-red and shiny lesions that itch or burn, located on the intertriginous areas (under the breast in females, axillae, abdomen, groin, the web spaces between the toes). The rash may have satellite lesions (small red rashes around the main rash). Thrush Complains of a severe sore throat with white adherent plaques with a red base that are hard to dislodge on the pharynx. Thrush in \"healthy adults\" who are not on antibiotics may signal an immunodeficient condition. Treatment Plan Nystatin powder and/or cream in skin folds (intertriginous areas) BID. OTC topical antifungals are miconazole, clotrimazole. Prescription needed for terconazole, ciclopirox. dry and aerated. Administer clotrimazole troches (one troche dissolved in mouth slowly five times/day) miconazole mucoadhesive buccal tablets. Another option is nystatin is compounded and is for severe sore throat (thrush, canker sores, mouth ulcers). HIV-seropositive patients: Oropharyngeal candida is the most common opportunistic infection. Moderate to severe cases (or recurrent disease): Oral fluconazole is preferred systemic antifungal. Note People with liver disease or immunocompromise or women who are pregnant should avoid eating raw or undercooked oysters or clams due to the possibility of Vibrio vulnificus infection. High mortality rate (50%) from V. vulnificus septicemia. Cellulitis Acute skin infection of the deep dermis and underlying tissue, usually caused by gram- positive bacteria. There are two forms of cellulitis (purulent and nonpurulent). Points of entry are skin breaks, insect bites, abrasions, or preexisting skin infections strain (USA300 MRSA) is a virulent strain that causes aggressive skin infections. Orbital cellulitis and peritonsillar cellulitis: Refer to ED for parenteral antibiotics. Discussed in Chapter 5 . Purulent form of cellulitis: S. aureus (gram positive). Community-acquired MRSA now common. Most cases are located on the lower leg (85%). Nonpurulent form of cellulitis: Usually due to streptococci (but may also be staphylococcal). Dog and cat bites: Pasteurella multocida (gram negative). Puncture wounds (foot): Contaminated with soft foam liner material or puncture wounds through sneakers. May be at risk for infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa . V. vulnificus : Exposure of wound to brackish to saltwater (or eating raw oysters/clams) from the Gulf Coast or Chesapeake Bay can cause infection with this bacterium. Leading cause of shellfish-associated death in the United States. Classic Case Acute onset of diffused pink to red-colored skin that is poorly demarcated with advancing margins. The lesion feels warm to touch, and it may become abscessed or it may be fluctuant (pointing) or draining pus. Abscess (boils) usually due to Staphylococcus or MRSA. Infection may spread to lymph node chains (lymphangitis); this appears like red streaks radiating from the infected area. May involve lymphadenopathy. Patients may have systemic symptoms. Lower limb is most common location (85%). Clenched-Fist Injuries These injuries have a high risk of infection to joints (i.e., knuckles), fascia, nerves, and bones (osteomyelitis; especially if punched in the mouth or bitten by a human). Refer to ED for treatment. There may be a foreign body embedded, such as a tooth (x-ray needed) 183148 and/or a fracture. Necrotizing Fasciitis (\"Flesh-Eating\" Bacteria) Reddish to purple-colored lesion that increase rapidly in size. May have bullae. Infected area appears indurated (\"woody\" induration) with complaints of severe pain on affected site. Folliculitis Infection of hair follicle(s). May involve several follicles. Small (1-mm) round lesions filled with pus with erythema. Usually self-limiting. Avoid shaving or scrubbing area. Consider mupirocin (Bactroban) ointment or cream. Furuncles (Boils) An infected hair follicle that fills with pus (abscess). May have started out as folliculitis that worsened. It looks like a round red bump and is hot and tender to touch. When it is fluctuant, it can rupture and drain purulent green-colored discharge. Apply antibiotic ointment BID and cover with dressing until healed. See Figure 6.9 . For small boils, use warm compress BID. If abscess is greater than 2 cm, incise and drain of abscess and/or empiric antibiotic treatment may be adequate. If located over a joint, refer to ED for plain radiograph (x-ray) of joint to rule out osteomyelitis. Best imaging method is MRI to detect bone infection. Figure 6.9 Furuncle or boil (caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ). This image can be found in color in the app. Source: Courtesy of El Pantera. Carbuncles (Multiple Abscesses) Carbuncles are several boils that coalesce to form a large boil or abscess. Sometimes they 184149 may form several \"heads.\" They are usually treated with systemic antibiotics. Labs C&S advancing edge of lesion (if fluid or pus, vesicles, if fever or toxic or suspect necrotizing fasciitis (refer to ED) Treatment Plan This is for mild cases only. If toxic, rapid progression, immunocompromised, diabetic, joint involvement, suspect osteomyelitis and refer to ED for parenteral antibiotics. Nonpurulent cellulitis (non-MRSA): Dicloxacillin PO (orally) QID \u00d7 high rate of beta-lactam resistance); cephalexin QID or clindamycin Pack) \u00d7 5 days (macrolide) Suspect MRSA: Bactrim DS one tablet BID or doxycycline or minocycline PO BID \u00d7 10 days or clindamycin three to four times/day for 10 days (mild cases, duration of 5 days) Td booster: If last dose was more than 5 years ago Elevate affected limb Follow-Up Follow up with the patient within 48 hours. Patients treated with oral antibiotics usually start to show improvement in 48 to 72 hours. Refer cellulitis cases if: Systemic symptoms develop (i.e., fever, toxic) or worsen The cellulitis is not responding to treatment within 48 hours Cellulitis is spreading quickly or is a small lesion with black center (gangrene) associated with severe pain (necrotizing fasciitis) Patient is a diabetic, immunocompromised, or taking anti-TNF (rheumatoid arthritis) Complications Osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, sepsis Tendon and fascial extension Rarely, death (high fatality rates for V. vulnificus infections) Erysipelas A subtype of cellulitis involving the upper dermis and superficial lymphatics that is usually caused by group A Streptococcus . See Figure 6.10 . Classic Case Sudden onset of one large hot and indurated red skin lesion that has clear demarcated margins. It is usually located on the lower legs (the shins) or the cheeks. It is accompanied by fever and chills. Hospitalization may be needed for severe cases, infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. 185150 Figure 6.10 Erysipelas. This image can be found in color in the app. Source: Courtesy of Dr. Thomas F. Sellers. Bites: Human and Animal Human Bites The \"dirtiest\" bite of all. Watch for closed-fist injuries of the hands (may involve joint capsule and tendon damage). Eikenella corrodens and numerous bacteria may be involved. Dog and Cat Bites P. multocida (gram negative). Cat bites have a higher risk of infection than dog bites. Signs of infection are redness, swelling, and pain, and systemic symptoms may develop within 12 to 24 hours. Treatment Plan (Both Human and Animal Bites) Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) 875 mg/125 mg PO BID \u00d7 10 days. Penicillin allergy: Doxycycline BID, Bactrim DS BID plus coverage for anaerobes with metronidazole (Flagyl) BID or clindamycin TID Irrigate copiously with sterile saline. All bites and infected wounds need wound C&S Do not suture wounds at high risk for infection: Puncture wounds, wounds more than 12 hours old (24 hours on face), infected bite wounds, cat bites Cartilage injuries (cartilage does not regenerate); refer to plastic surgeon Tetanus prophylaxis (if last booster >5 years, needs booster) Follow up with patient within 24 to 48 hours after treatment Referral of Wounds Closed-fist injuries or crush injuries: Refer to hand surgeon Cartilage damage or wounds with cosmetic effects: Refer to plastic surgeon 186151 Compromised hosts: Consider adult diabetics, absent/dysfunction of the spleen, immunocompromised Rabies Consider bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes (domestic animals can also have rabies). Rabies immune globulin plus rabies vaccine may be required. Call local health department for advice. Consider if wild animal acts tame, copious saliva, unprovoked attack, or animal looks ill. Option: Quarantine a domestic animal for 10 days (look for signs/symptoms of rabies). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Chronic and recurrent inflammatory disorder of the apocrine glands that results in painful nodules, abscesses, pustules in locations such as the axilla (most common location), mammary area, perianal, and the groin. More common in women (3:1 ratio). Important risk factors include smoking and obesity. No cure. See Figure 6.11 . Classic Case Patient complains of recurrent episodes of painful, large, dark-red nodules, abscesses, and pustules. Ruptured lesions drain purulent green-colored discharge. Pain resolves when the abscess drains and heals. Lesions take from 10 to 30 days to heal. History of recurrent episodes on the same areas in the axilla results in sinus tracts, keloids, and multiple scars. Patient may be anxious and/or depressed. Figure 6.11 Hidradenitis suppurativa (mild). This image can be found in color in the app. Source: Courtesy of BRI72783. Treatment Plan Mild disease: Chlorhexidine (Hibiclens) 4% solution, benzoyl peroxide) \u00d7 12 187weeks Warm compresses, sitz baths, topical and/or oral pain medication for pain Diet: Avoid high glycemic foods, dairy Smoking cessation. Weight loss if obese Oral antibiotics: Tetracycline 500 mg BID; doxycycline or minocycline BID for 7 to 10 days for mild disease Refer to dermatologist. Options include surgery, hormonal therapy, interlesional steroids, oral retinoids, metformin, biologics, laser therapy, and cryotherapy Impetigo Acute superficial skin infection caused by gram-positive bacteria (beta streptococcus or S. aureus) . Most common bacterial skin infection in young children ages 2 to 5 years. More common in hot and humid environments (summer, subtropics, tropics). It can appear on normal skin or skin breaks (scratches, insect bites, acne, varicella lesions). If infection is Streptococcus ( Streptococcus pyogenes ), postglomerular types: bullous (30%) and nonbullous (70%). Classic Case Acute onset of itchy pink-to-red lesions, which evolve into vesiculopustules that rupture. Bullous impetigo appear as large blisters that rupture easily. After rupture, red weeping shallow ulcers appear. When serous fluid dries up, it looks like lesions covered with honey- colored crusts. See Table 6.1 . Can present with a few (two to three) to multiple lesions. Labs C&S of crusts/wound. 5 days (macrolides), clindamycin \u00d7 10 days. If few lesions with no topical 2% mupirocin ointment (Bactroban) or fusidic acid 2% cream \u00d7 10 days may be useful. Clean lesions with antibacterial soap, Betadine, or chlorhexidine (Hibiclens); then apply topical antibacterial to lesions. Shower/bathe daily with antibacterial soap until healed. Do not share towels. Children in day care: Do not return to school until 48 to 72 hours after initiation of treatment. Meningococcemia A serious life-threatening infection caused by Neisseria meningitides (gram-negative diplococci) that are spread by respiratory droplets. Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency. Mortality rate of 10% to 14%. Use droplet precautions. Do not delay treatment if high index of suspicion\u2014refer to ED stat . Classic Case 188152 Described earlier under \"Danger Signals.\" Prophylaxis Close contacts (give as early as possible): Rifampin PO every 12 hours \u00d7 2 days Close contacts: Defined as being in close proximity to patient (<3 feet) who has had prolonged contact (>8 hours) or directly exposed to patient's oral secretions, going back to 7 days before onset of patient's symptoms until 24 hours after initiation of antibiotic Meningococcal vaccination: CDC recommends vaccination with meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4 or Menactra) for freshman college students living in dormitories, military recruits, persons asplenia or a nonfunctioning spleen (i.e., sickle cell), patients on eculizumab (Soliris), others Routine meningococcal polysaccharide (MPSV 4 or Menomune) vaccine: Recommended for all preteens and teens (age 11 first dose with booster age 16 years) Labs Lumbar punctures: Culture cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Blood cultures, throat cultures, etc. (do not delay treatment to wait for lab results) CT or MRI of the brain Treatment Plan Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) 2 g IV every 12 hours plus vancomycin IV every 8 to 12 hours Hospital, isolation precautions, supportive treatment Complications Tissue infarction and necrosis (i.e., gangrene of the toes, foot, fingers, etc.) causing amputation Death Early Lyme Disease Erythema migrans is a skin lesion caused by the bite of an Ixodes tick infected with Borrelia burgdorferi . If untreated, infection becomes systemic and affects multiple organ systems. May only have rash or rash may be accompanied by flu-like symptoms. Classic Case Described earlier under \"Danger Signals.\" Labs Two-step (two-tier) testing recommended (designed to be done together) First step is enzyme immunoassay (EIA); if negative, no further testing is recommended If first test is positive (or equivocal/indeterminate), the second step test is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA or immunoblot test or \"western blot\" test) If both EIA and IFA tests are positive, person has Lyme infection Antibody tests may be false negative the first 4 to 6 weeks (infection present but no antibodies yet) 189153 Treatment Plan Early Lyme only: Doxycycline BID (twice daily) \u00d7 10 days (first-line drug for both adults and children) Alternative: Amoxicillin 500 mg TID or cefuroxime axetil (Ceftin) 500 mg BID \u00d7 14 days Complications Neuropathy (e.g., facial palsy), impaired memory Lyme arthritis, chronic fatigue Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Caused by the bite of a dog tick (wood tick) that is infected with the parasite Rickettsia rickettsii . If high index of suspicion, do not delay treatment (do not wait for lab results). Treatment most effective if started within first 5 days of symptoms. Doxycycline is the first- line treatment for all age groups (CDC, 2016). Check if resident of the southeastern or south-central states (NC, TN, OK, AK, and MO) or visitor to or vacationer in these states. Classic Case Described earlier under \"Danger Signals.\" Diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms and can later be confirmed by confirmatory laboratory tests. Labs Diagnostic: Antibody titers to R. rickettsii (by indirect lesion biopsy), CBC, treatment (adults and children): Doxycycline BID \u00d7 7 to 14 days; refer stat Complications Death Neurological sequelae (hearing loss, paraparesis, neuropathy, others) How to Remove a Tick 1. Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the part of the tick closest to the skin. 2. Pull it upward with steady, even pressure. Do not twist or jerk ( Figure 6.12 ). 3. After removing tick, clean bite area with rubbing alcohol, iodine scrub, or soap and water. Dispose tick by flushing it into toilet. Do not crush tick with bare fingers. Not effective : Painting tick with nail polish or petroleum jelly or using heat to make the tick detach. The goal is to detach tick as quickly as possible after it is found. 190154 Figure 6.12 How to remove a tick. This image can be found in color in the app. Source: CDC. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) Infections Chickenpox (varicella) and herpes zoster (shingles) are both caused by the same virus. The primary infection is called chickenpox (varicella), and the reactivation of the infection is known as shingles (herpes zoster). After primary infection (chickenpox), the virus becomes latent within a dermatome (sensory ganglia) and is kept under control by an intact immune system. Chickenpox: Contagious from 1 to 2 days before the onset of the rash and until all of the lesions have crusted over (chickenpox and shingles). Duration of illness is 2 weeks. Shingles: Contagious with the onset of the rashes until all the lesions have crusted over. Classic Case Chickenpox/Varicella Prodrome of fever, pharyngitis, and malaise that is followed within 24 hours by the eruption of pruritic vesicular lesions in different stages of development over a period of 4 days. The rashes start on the head and face and quickly spread to the trunk and extremities. It takes 1 to 2 weeks for the crusts to fall off and the skin to heal. Shingles Elderly or older adult reports acute onset of groups of papules and vesicles on a red base that rupture and become crusted. Crusted lesions follow a dermatomal pattern on one side of the body. Patient complains of pain, which can be quite severe. Some with prodrome may have severe pain/burning sensation at the site before the breakout. Shingles can last from 2 to 4 weeks. Immunocompromised and elderly patients are at higher risk for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Early treatment reduces risk. Treat within 48 to 72 hours after onset of breakout if patient is older than age 50 or immunocompromised. See Figure 6.13 . 191155 Figure 6.13 Shingles. This image can be found in color in the app. Labs Gold standard: Viral culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for VZV Medications Acyclovir (Zovirax) five times per day or valacyclovir (Valtrex) BID \u00d7 10 days for initial breakouts and 7 days for flare-ups. Most effective when started within 48 to 72 hours after the appearance of the rash Complications PHN: More common in elderly and immunocompromised patients. zoster ophthalmicus (CN V): Can result in corneal blindness. Refer immediately to ophthalmologist or ED (described under \"Danger Signals\"). Others: If Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster of ipsilateral facial paralysis, ear pain, and vesicles in the ear canal and auricle, refer to neurologist. Vaccines Varicella vaccine (1995): A person can still become infected with VZV but will have very mild disease with fewer lesions (compared with the unvaccinated). Advise reproductive-age women not to get pregnant within the next 1 month after vaccine administration. Shingles/zoster vaccine (2006): One dose is recommended for persons aged 60 years or older. A history of shingles or no history of chickenpox infection is not a contraindication to the shingles vaccine. Contraindications: People with AIDS, on chronic high-dose steroids, undergoing radiation or chemotherapy, and the immunocompromised should not get the vaccine. 192156 CLINICAL PEARLS A susceptible person (who has never had chickenpox or been vaccinated) can become infected from shingles, but that person's initial infection will manifest as chickenpox. Only a person who has had chickenpox (rarely the chickenpox vaccine) can get shingles. Herpetic Whitlow Herpetic whitlow is a viral skin infection of the finger(s) caused by herpes simplex (type 1 or type 2) virus infection and results from direct contact with either a cold sore or genital herpes lesion. See Figure 6.14 . Classic Case Patient complains of the acute onset of extremely painful red bumps and small blisters on the sides of the finger or the cuticle area or on the terminal phalanx of one or more fingers; may have recurrent outbreaks. Ask patient about coexisting symptoms of oral herpes or genital herpes. Figure 6.14 Herpetic whitlow. This image can be found in color in the app. Source: Courtesy of James Heilman, MD. Treatment Plan Usually the symptoms are treated. Self-limited infection: Analgesics or NSAIDs with acyclovir (Zovirax) 193Patient Education Avoid sharing personal items, gloves, towels. Cover skin lesion completely with large adhesive bandage until the lesions heal. Paronychia Acute local bacterial skin infection of the proximal or lateral nail folds (cuticle) that resolves after the abscess drains. Causative bacteria are S. aureus , streptococci, or pseudomonas (gram negative). Chronic cases are associated with coexisting onychomycosis (fungal infection of nails). See Figure 6.15 . Classic Case Complains of acute onset of a painful and red swollen area around the nail on a finger that eventually becomes abscessed. The most common locations are index finger and thumb. Reports a history of picking a hangnail, biting off hangnail, or of trimming of the cuticle during a manicure. Figure 6.15 Paronychia. This image can be found in color in the app. Source: Courtesy of C3f59. Treatment Plan Soak affected finger or toe in warm water for 20 minutes three times a day. Apply topical antibiotic, such as triple antibiotic or mupirocin, to affected finger after soaking. Abscess: Incision and drainage (use no. 11 scalpel) or use the beveled edge of a large- gauge needle to gently separate the cuticle margin from the nail bed to drain the abscess. Pityriasis Rosea Self-limiting illness (6-8 weeks); this is a skin condition that may be caused by a viral infection. Classic Case 194157 Complains of oval lesions with fine scales that follow skin lines (cleavage lines) of the trunk or a \"Christmas tree\" pattern. See Table 6.1 . Salmon-pink color in Whites. May be pruritic. \"Herald patch\" : This is the first lesion to appear and is largest in size; appears 2 weeks before full breakout. Treatment Plan Advise patient that lesions will take about 4 weeks to resolve. If high risk of STDs, check rapid plasma reagent (RPR) to rule out secondary syphilis. Scabies Infestation of the skin by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. The female mite burrows under the skin to lay her eggs; transmitted by close contact. May be asymptomatic the first 2 to 6 weeks. Even after treatment, the pruritus may persist for 2 to 4 weeks (sensitivity reaction to mites and their feces). Norwegian scabies: Lesions are covered with fine scales (looks like white plaques) and crusts; involves the nails (dystrophic nails), scalp, body; absent to mild pruritus; very contagious. Classic Case Complains of pruritic rashes located in the interdigital webs of the hands, axillae, breasts, buttock folds, waist, scrotum, and penis. Severe itching that is worse at nighttime and interferes with sleep. See Table 6.1 . Other family members may also have the same symptoms. Objective Findings The rash appears as serpiginous (snake-like) or linear burrows. Lesions can be papular, vesicular, or crusted. Higher incidence in crowded conditions (i.e., nursing homes, etc.) and in the homeless. Labs Scrape burrow or scales with glass slide; use coverslip (wet mount). Look for mites or eggs. Treatment Plan Permethrin 5% (Elimite): Apply cream from the neck to the feet and wash off after 8 to 14 hours. Repeat treatment in 7 days. Treat everyone in the same household at the same time. Any clothes/bedding used 3 days before and during treatment should be washed and dried using the hot settings. Pruritus usually improves in 48 hours but can last up to 2 to 4 weeks (even if mites are dead). Do not retreat (do wet mount to check for live mites). Treat itch with Benadryl and topical steroids. Long-term care facility: Treat all patients, staff, family members, and frequent visitors for scabies. Tinea Infections (Dermatophytoses) 195158 Infection of superficial keratinized nails) by tinea organisms. Tinea trichophyton, microsporum, and epidermophyton are classified as dermatophytes. Tinea infection is classified by location. Most cases of tinea can be treated with topical antifungal medication except for tinea capitis and moderate to severe onychomycosis or tinea unguium (toenails). See Figure 6.16 . Labs Fungal culture of scales/hair/nails or skin lesions KOH slide microscopy (low to medium power) reveals pseudohyphae and spores Figure 6.16 Tinea infections (ringworm).These images can be found in color in the app. Sources: Courtesy of Corina G; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Dr. Lucille K. George/CDC. Medications OTC topicals (creams, gels, solutions, powders) OTC allylamines: Terbinafine (Lamisil once a day to BID Tolnaftate (Tinactin) apply twice a day Avoid steroids unless severe inflammation (can reduce effectiveness antifungals) Tinea Capitis (Ringworm of the Scalp) Black dot tinea capitis (BDTC) is the most common type in the United States. African American children are at higher risk. Spread by close contact, fomites (shared hats, combs). Systemic treatment only (topicals are not effective). Classic Case School-aged child with asymptomatic scaly patch that gradually enlarges. The hairs inside the patch break off easily by the roots (looks like black dots) causing patchy alopecia. Black dot sign: Broken hair shafts leave a dot-like pattern on scalp. Treatment Plan 196159 Determine baseline LFTs and repeat 2 weeks after initiating systemic antifungal treatment. Monitor. Gold standard: Administer griseofulvin (microsize/ultramicrosize) daily to BID \u00d7 6 to 12 weeks. Avoid hepatotoxic substances (alcohol, statins, acetaminophen). Complications Kerion: Inflammatory and indurated lesions that follicles Tinea Pedis (Athlete's Foot) Two types: Scaly and dry form or moist type (strong odor). Dry type has scales. The scales can range from the entire sole, edges of the foot, or the toes only. Recurrences are common. Tinea pedis can spread to the fingernails of the dominant hand (from scratching feet). Moist lesions occur between toe webs, lesions are white-colored with a strong unpleasant odor. Tinea Corporis or pruritic rashes with a collarette of fine scales that slowly enlarge with some central clearing. Most cases respond to topical antifungals. Severe cases with extensive skin involvement can be treated with oral scales; may be mistaken for candidal infection (bright-red rashes with satellite lesions) or intertrigo (bright-red rash to bacterial infection). Tinea Manuum (Hands) Pruritic round rashes with fine scales found on the hands. Usually infected from chronic scratching of foot that is also infected with tinea (athlete's foot). Tinea Barbae (Beard Area) Beard area is affected. Scaling occurs with pruritic red rashes. Onychomycosis (Nails) The nail becomes opaque, yellowed, and thickened with scaling under the nail [hyperkeratosis]. Also known as tinea unguium. It is usually caused by dermatophytes, but it can become infected with yeast and molds. The most common type is called distal subungual onychomycosis. Nail may separate from nail-bed (onycholysis). Great toe is the 197most common location. Treated with systemic antifungals, except for mild cases. If mild, a trial of topical treatment (Penlac \"nail polish\") is appropriate. Labs Fungal cultures of affected nails for confirmation of infection; KOH slide for microscopy Medications Both pulse therapy and continuous therapy are acceptable. Baseline LFTs. Monitor periodically. Administer oral terbinafine (Lamisil) or itraconazole for 1 week per month for 2 to 3 months (pulse therapy). Mild to moderate cases: Topical antifungals such as efinaconazole (Jublia) and ciclopirox (Penlac). Apply Penlac nail lacquer \u00d7 several weeks. Works best in mild cases on fingernails. Not all patients with onychomycosis need treatment. Acne Vulgaris (Common Acne) Acne is inflammation and infection of the pilosebaceous units. Has multifactorial causes such as high androgen levels, bacterial infection ( Propionibacterium acnes ), and genetic influences. Lesions are located mainly on the face, shoulders, chest, and back. Highest incidence during puberty and adolescence. Mild Acne (Topicals Only) Open comedones (blackheads), closed comedones (noninflammatory acne), with or without small papules are considered mild acne. Prescription medications: Tretinoin topical (Retin-A), benzoyl peroxide gel with erythromycin Start at lowest dose: Tretinoin topical (Retin-A) 0.25% cream every other day at bedtime \u00d7 2 to 3 weeks, then daily application at bedtime; alternative is azelaic acid or salicylic acid (OTC). Retinoids also help decrease facial wrinkles and hyper/hypopigmentation. Advise patient that acne may worsen (first few weeks of use) with topical retinoids. In about 4 to 6 weeks, acne improves and clears up. The facial skin can become red and irritated (dryness, itch, peeling) in the first few weeks of use. Photosensitivity reaction is possible (use sunscreen). If no improvement in acne within 8 to 12 weeks, consider increasing Retin-A dose or adding benzoyl peroxide with erythromycin. Moderate Acne (Topicals Plus Antibiotic) Presence of papules and pustules (inflammatory lesions) with comedones is considered moderate acne. Treatment Plan Continue with prescription topicals such as Retin-A, benzoyl peroxide combined with erythromycin (Benzamycin) or benzoyl peroxide gel with clindamycin. Add oral antibiotics: Administer tetracycline (500 mg BID or minocycline (Minocin), doxycycline, erythromycin, or clindamycin. Tetracyclines can be given for acne starting at about age 13 as growth of permanent teeth is finished except wisdom teeth (or third molars), which erupt between the ages of 17 and 25 years, tooth discoloration is not a consideration. Tetracyclines (Category D): Cause permanent discoloration of growing tooth enamel. Tetracyclines decrease effectiveness of oral contraceptives (use additional method). Not given during pregnancy or to children younger than age 13. Others: Certain oral contraceptives (Desogen, Yaz) are indicated for acne. Role of diet: Limited evidence that some types of dairy (i.e., skim milk) may affect acne. Severe Cystic Acne Consists of all of the preceding findings plus painful indurated nodules, cysts, abscesses, and pustules over face, shoulders, and chest. Medications Isotretinoin (Accutane) is a category X drug (extremely teratogenic). It can only be prescribed by prescribers who are registered in the iPLEDGE program. Patients must use two forms of reliable contraception. Prescribe 1-month supply only. Monthly pregnancy testing with results shown to pharmacist is necessary before refills. Pregnancy test is needed 1 month after treatment is discontinued. Discontinue if the following are present: Severe depression, visual disturbance, hearing loss, tinnitus, GI pain, rectal bleeding, uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia, pancreatitis, hepatitis. Rosacea (Acne Rosacea) Chronic and relapsing inflammatory skin disorder that is more common in people with light-colored skin. There are four subtypes of rosacea. First-line management is aimed at symptom control and avoidance of triggers that cause exacerbations (spicy foods, alcohol, sunlight, others). Patients with rosacea have sensitive skin, advise to avoid irritating skin products (toners, alpha hydroxyl acids, strong soaps). Apply skin moisturizer frequently. Classic Case Light-skinned adult to older patient with Celtic background (i.e., Irish, Scottish, English) complains of chronic and small acne-like papules and pustules around the nose, mouth, and chin. Telangiectasias may be present on the nasal area and cheeks. Patient blushes easily. Patient usually is blond or red haired and has light-colored eyes. Some have ocular symptoms such as red eyes, eyes,\" or gel Low-dose oral tetracycline or minocycline given over several weeks Complications 199161 Rhinophyma: Hyperplasia of tissue at the tip of the nose from chronic severe disease Ocular rosacea: to 5-mm diameter) with central umbilication (white plug). Caused by skin infection with the poxvirus. Spread by skin-to-skin direct contact. More common in children. In immunocompetent host, it usually clears up by 6 to 12 months. The CDC considers it an STD if lesions are located on the genitals in sexually active adolescents and adults. See Figure 6.17 . Figure 6.17 Molluscum contagiosum. These images can be found in color in the app. Source: CDC. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/molluscum-contagiosum/index.html Burns (Thermal Burns) Superficial Thickness (First Degree; Table 6.2 ) Erythema only (no blisters); painful (i.e., sunburns, mild scalds) Cleanse with mild soap and water (or saline): Cold packs for 24 to 48 hours Intact skin does not require topical antibiotics; apply a topical OTC anesthetics such as benzocaine if desired or aloe vera gel Partial Thickness (Second Degree) Red-colored skin with superficial blisters (bullae); the burn is painful. Use water with mild soap or normal saline to clean broken skin (not hydrogen peroxide or full-strength Betadine). Do not rupture blisters. Treat with silver sulfadiazine cream (Silvadene) or triple antibiotic ointment such as Polysporin (bacitracin zinc and polymyxin B) and apply nonadherent dressings. Sulfadiazine can damage the eyes (do not use near the eyes). Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not use this agent. Other: Apply biological dressings (i.e., DuoDERM), Tegaderm, others. Alternative medicine: Use a topical application of honey or aloe vera. 200162 Full Thickness (Third Degree) Initial assessment: Rule out airway and breathing compromise. Smoke inhalation injury is a medical emergency. Third-degree burns are painless. Entire skin layer, subcutaneous area, and soft tissue fascia may be destroyed. Refer: Suspect inhalation injury if facial burns, electrical burns or burns on cartilaginous areas such as the nose and ears (cartilage will not regenerate). Also suspect if burns are on greater than 10% of body, circumferential (risk of compartment syndrome), and crosses major joints. Total Percentage of Body Surface Area Rule of Nines (Child): Body surface: 9% each arm Body leg Body surface: 18% front trunk, 18% of trunk Rule of Nines (Adult): Body surface: 9% (each arm, head) Body surface: 18% (each leg, anterior trunk, or posterior trunk) Example: A 40-year-old chef suffers hot oil burns while cooking. He reports that he immediately went to the kitchen sink to cool off his burns. The nurse practitioner notes that the patient has bright-red skin on the right arm and the right thigh. The skin on the patient's chest and abdomen is bright red with several bullae on the surface. What is this patient's diagnosis? Answer: Superficial-thickness burns (first-degree) on the right arm (9%) and right thigh (9% instead of 18% because it is on half of the leg) with partial-thickness burns (second-degree) on the chest and abdomen (anterior trunk 18%). The TBSA is 36%. Criteria for Burn Center Referral Burns involving the face, hands, feet, genitals, major joints Electrical burns, lightning burns Partial-thickness burns greater than 10% TBSA Third-degree burn in any age group Table 6.2 Minor Burn Criteria (American Burn Association) * Burn Type Description Partial-thickness burns <10% of TBSA in patients 10-50 years of age <5% of TBSA in patients younger than 10 or older than 50 years of age Full-thickness burns <2% of TBSA in any patient without other injury Above criteria plus May not involve face, hands, perineum, or feet May not cross major joints 201163 May not be circumferential No suspicion of inhalation injury No suspicion of high-voltage injury * If meets above criteria, refer to ED or burn center. TBSA, total body surface area. BIOTERRORISM Anthrax Infection caused by Bacillus anthracis (gram-positive rods). There are three types of anthrax: cutaneous, GI, and pulmonary. Cutaneous anthrax lesion(s) begins as a papule that enlarges in 24 to 48 hours and develops eschar (necrosis) and ulceration. Usually lesions are located on the arms and the neck or face. Check for history of exposure or handling animals or hides, hair, or wool. Pulmonary anthrax (inhalational anthrax) is caused by inhaling aerosolized spores through (1) working with animals, wool, or animal hides/hair or (2) through bioterrorism. Fulminant inhalational anthrax causes death within days. Symptoms are flulike and associated with cough, chest pain with cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, hypoxia, and shock. Cutaneous anthrax (naturally acquired): Doxycycline BID, ciprofloxacin BID, levofloxacin BID for 7 to 10 days (if bioterrorism suspected, treat for 60 days) Without treatment, 20% of people with cutaneous anthrax may die Postexposure prophylaxis (bioterrorism suspected): Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID \u00d7 60 days (alternate is doxycycline PO) Pathogens that have high mortality rates, are easily spread, and are airborne (i.e., aerosolized route) can be used for bioterrorism Highest-risk pathogens: Anthrax bacilli, smallpox virus Smallpox (Variola Virus) Infection targets respiratory and oropharyngeal mucosal surfaces. \"Eliminated\" in 1977. Incubation period of 2 weeks. Flu-like signs and symptoms. Numerous large nodules appear mostly in the center of the face and on the arms and legs. Treatment is symptomatic. Mortality rate is 20% to 50%. Smallpox Vaccine If vaccine is given within 3 to 4 days postexposure, can lessen severity of illness. Vaccinia immune globulin (for pregnant, immunosuppressed, etc.) is available from special clinics. EXAM TIPS Most of the color photos on the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) exam are on skin disease and eye findings. As of December 2016, the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners Certification Board (AANPCB) exam does not 202164 include photos, but this may change in the future. Check my website for updates ( www.npreview.com ). Red spot-like rashes that start on the hands/palms and feet/soles accompanied by fever, headache, and myalgia indicate RMSF. Regarding tick removal, grasp part of tick closest to the skin (head) and apply steady upward pressure. Do not remove ticks by using nail polish, petroleum jelly, or heat. Identify skin diseases by photograph. Google images of the skin cancers, psoriasis, tinea versicolor, tinea corporis, and candida rash (satellite lesions). Melanoma does not have to be flat; it can present as a brown to dark-colored papule (resembling a mole but with irregular borders and other signs of melanoma). Differentiate between contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. The best clue is the unilateral location and the shape of the lesions in contact dermatitis. Rashes that are very pruritic at night and located on the interdigital webs and/or penis are scabies until proven otherwise. Preferred antibiotic for human, dog, and cat bites is amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin). Do not confuse actinic keratosis (precursor with seborrheic keratoses (benign). Actinic keratosis is not physiological; it results from chronic UV exposure. MRSA infection: If patient is allergic to Bactrim, use doxycycline or minocycline or clindamycin. Know cutaneous anthrax and anthrax prophylaxis. Treatment for adult with recluse spider bite is antibiotic on wound, cold packs, NSAIDs. Know diagnosis and treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa. Be psoriasis and migrans (Lyme disease), contact dermatitis, and rosacea. Know target rash of early Lyme disease and treatment for Lyme disease. Actinic keratosis is precancerous lesion for squamous cell skin cancer. If extensive, 5-FU (Efudex) topical cream is used (antimetabolite topical). An example of an antimetabolite or disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) is methotrexate. Know how to treat mild and moderate acne. Mild acne is treated only with topicals. \"Herald patch\" or a such as amitriptyline also be drained by trephination (straighten one end of a large paper clip or 18-gauge needle and heat it with a flame, then gently drill down nail until blood seeps out). CLINICAL PEARLS The FDA recommends that health providers avoid prescribing oral ketoconazole 203(Nizoral PO) for fungal skin and nail infections because the harm (serious liver damage, etc.) outweighs the benefit. Topical ketoconazole shampoo is safe. Use ophthalmic-grade sterile cream and ointments for rashes near the eyes. Patients with scarlet fever are at higher risk for developing postglomerular nephritis (compared with \"strep\" throat). Recurrences of tinea pedis tinea cruris infection common (Goldstein & Goldstein, 2017). Patients on anti-TNF biologics are at higher risk for melanoma and squamous cell skin cancer. 204165 7 Cardiovascular System Review DANGER SIGNALS Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Also known as ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) . A middle-aged or older man complains of gradual onset of intense and steady chest discomfort or pain that is described as squeezing, tightness, crushing, heavy pressure (\"an elephant sitting on my chest\"), or band-like. The pain is provoked by physical exertion or eating a heavy meal. The pain or discomfort may radiate to the left side of the neck, jaw, and left arm (or both arms). Continues to have pain or discomfort at rest (angina relieved by rest and nitroglycerin). The patient may be diaphoretic with cool, clammy skin. Women and those who are elderly with MIs are more likely to present with nonspecific symptoms such as shortness of breath or dyspnea, weakness, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, and syncope. May complain of back pain instead of anterior chest pain. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Older patient complains of an acute (or gradual) onset of dyspnea, fatigue, dry cough, and swollen feet and ankles. The patient has a sudden (or gradual) increase in weight. Lung exam will reveal crackles on both the lung bases (bibasilar crackles) along with an S3 heart sound. History of preexisting coronary artery disease (CAD), angina, prior MI, or previous episode of CHF. Usually is taking diuretics and other antihypertensive medications. Infective Endocarditis (IE) Also known as bacterial endocarditis . Patient presents with fever, chills, and malaise that is associated with onset of a new murmur. Associated skin findings are found mostly on the fingers/hands and toes/feet. These are subungual hemorrhages (splinter hemorrhages on the nail bed), petechiae on the palate, painful violet-colored nodes on the fingers or feet (Osler 205166 nodes), and nontender red spots on the palms/soles (Janeway lesions). Funduscopic exam may show Roth spots or retinal hemorrhages. Usually fatal if not treated. Dissecting Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Elderly white male complains of sudden onset of severe, sharp, excruciating pain located in the abdomen, flank, and/or back. Accompanied by a distended abdomen and abnormal vital signs (hypotension). Older male patients who are smokers with hypertension (HTN) are at higher risk. Incidental finding on chest x-ray may show widened mediastinum, tracheal deviation, and obliteration of aortic knob (thoracic aortic dissection). NORMAL FINDINGS Anatomy Position of the Heart The right ventricle is the chamber of the heart that lies closest to the sternum. The lower border of the left ventricle is where the apical impulse is generated. The heart is roughly the size of a large adult fist. The apex beat is caused by the left ventricle. Apical impulse: Located at the fifth intercostal space (ICS) by the midclavicular line on the left side of the chest Displacement of the Point of Maximal Impulse (PMI) Severe left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and cardiomyopathy: The PMI is displaced laterally on the chest, is larger (more than 3 cm) in size, and is more prominent. Pregnancy, third trimester: As the uterus grows larger, it pushes up against the diaphragm and causes the heart to shift to the left of the chest anteriorly. The result is a displaced PMI that is located slightly upward on the left side of the chest. May hear S3 heart sound during pregnancy. Deoxygenated Blood Enters the heart through the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava Right atrium tricuspid valve ventricle pulmonic valve pulmonary artery the lungs alveoli (RBCs pick up oxygen and release carbon dioxide) Oxygenated Blood Exits the lungs through the pulmonary veins and enters the heart Left atrium mitral valve left ventricle aortic valve aorta general circulation Diastole The mnemonic to use is \"motivated apples.\" These two words give you several clues. They will remind you of the names of the valves (which produce the sound) and the type of valve (atrioventricular [AV] or semilunar valve). 206167 MOTIVATED APPLES M (mitral valve) A (aortic valve) T (tricuspid valve) P (pulmonic valve) AV (atrioventricular valves) S (semilunar valves) Heart Sounds S1 (Systole): \"Motivated\" (M = mitral and T = tricuspid and AV = AV valves) The \"lub\" sound (of \"lub-dub\") Closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves AV valves S2 (Diastole): \"Apples\" (A = aortic and P = pulmonic and S = semilunar valves) The \"dub\" sound (of \"lub-dub\") Closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves Semilunar valves S3 Heart Sound Usually indicative of heart failure or CHF Occurs during early diastole (also called a \"ventricular gallop\" or an \"S3 gallop\") Sounds like \"Kentucky\" Always considered abnormal if it occurs after the age of 35 to 40 years This can be a normal finding in children, pregnant women, and some athletes (older than 35 years of age). S4 Heart Sound Increased resistance due to a stiff left ventricle; usually indicates LVH Considered a normal finding in some elderly (slight stiffness of left ventricle) Occurs during late diastole (also called an \"atrial gallop\" or \"atrial kick\") Sounds like \"Tennessee\" Best heard at the apex or apical area (mitral area) using the bell of the stethoscope Stethoscope Skills Bell of Stethoscope Low tones such as the extra heart sounds (S3 or S4) Mitral stenosis Diaphragm of the Stethoscope over the pulmonic area (or second ICS on the upper left side of sternum); due to splitting of the aortic and pulmonic components. A normal finding if it appears during inspiration and disappears at expiration. S4 in the Elderly Some healthy elderly patients have an S4 (late diastole) heart sound; also known as the \"atrial kick\" (the atria have to squeeze harder to overcome resistance of a stiff left ventricle). If there are no signs or symptoms of heart/valvular disease, it is considered a normal variant. Pathological S4 is associated with LVH due to increased resistance from the left ventricle. SOLVING QUESTIONS: HEART MURMURS To solve a murmur question correctly, only two pieces of information are needed. Look for the timing of the murmur (systole or diastole). Look for the location of the murmur (aortic, Erb's Point or mitral area). All the murmurs seen on the exams will fit into the following two mnemonics. Timing Systolic Murmurs Location Auscultatory Areas It is necessary to memorize the locations of the auscultatory areas in order to correctly identify a heart murmur. Mitral Area The mitral area is also known as the apex or the apical area of the heart. Fifth left ICS is about 8 to 9 cm from the midsternal line and slightly medial to the midclavicular line. PMI or the apical pulse is located in this area. Aortic Area The aortic area is the second ICS to the right side of the upper border of the sternum. The location of the aortic area can also be described as the \"second ICS by the right side of the sternum at the base of the heart.\" It can also be described as a murmur that is located on the right side of the upper sternum. Erb's Point 208169 Erb's Point is located at the third to fourth ICS on the left sternal border. Heart Murmurs: Mnemonics MR. ASS (Use for Systolic Murmurs) Systolic murmurs are also described as occurring holosystolic, pansystolic, early murmurs, these murmurs are louder and can radiate to the neck or axillae. MR (Mitral Regurgitation) A pansystolic (or holosystolic) murmur: Heard best at the apex of the heart or the apical area Radiates to axilla Loud blowing and high-pitched murmur (use the diaphragm A midsystolic ejection murmur: This murmur is best heard at the second ICS at the right side of the sternum. It radiates to the neck. A harsh and noisy murmur (use diaphragm of stethoscope). Patients with aortic stenosis should avoid physical overexertion, because there is increased risk of sudden death. Refer to cardiologist. Aortic stenosis is monitored by serial cardiac sonograms with Doppler flow studies. Surgical valve replacement needed if it worsens. MS. ARD (Use for Diastolic Murmurs) Diastole is also known as the S2 diastole, late diastole, or middiastole . Diastolic murmurs are MS (Mitral Stenosis) A low-pitched best at the apex (or apical area) of the heart Also called an opening snap (use bell of the stethoscope) AR (Aortic Regurgitation) A high-pitched diastolic murmur (use diaphragm of the stethoscope): If AR is due to a diseased aortic valve, the murmur is located at the third ICS by the left sternal border (Erb's Point). If AR is due to an abnormal aortic root, the murmur is best heard at the right upper sternal border (aortic area). Heart Murmurs: Grading System Grade I: A very soft murmur heard only under optimal conditions. Grade II: This is a mild to moderately loud murmur. Grade III: Loud murmur that is easily heard once the stethoscope is placed on the 209170 chest. Grade IV: A louder murmur. First time that a thrill is present. A thrill is like a \"palpable murmur.\" Grade V: Very loud murmur heard with edge of stethoscope off chest. Thrill is more obvious. Grade VI: The murmur is so loud that it can be heard even with the stethoscope off the chest. The thrill is easily palpated. ABNORMAL FINDINGS Pathological Murmurs All diastolic murmurs are benign murmurs occur during systole (S2). Benign murmurs do not have a thrill; only very loud murmurs will produce a thrill. EXAM TIPS There are usually two questions regarding heart murmurs on the exam. Learn to use the mnemonics \"MR. ASS\" and \"MS. ARD.\" Memorize the locations of the mitral area as well as the aortic area. All murmurs with \"mitral\" in their names are only described as located: On the apex of the heart or the apical area or On the fifth ICS on the left side of the sternum medial to the midclavicular line If an apical/apex murmur occurs during S1, it is mitral regurgitation (MR. ASS). If an apical/apex murmur occurs during S2, it is mitral stenosis (MS. ARD). On the exam, only the systolic murmurs radiate (to the axilla in mitral regurgitation and to the neck with aortic stenosis). S3 is a sign of CHF; S4 is a sign of LVH. A split S2 is best heard at the pulmonic area (upper left sternum). Memorize the mnemonic \"motivated apples\" to help you remember the names of the valves that are responsible for producing S1 and S2. Grading murmurs: Be aware that the first time a thrill is palpated is at grade IV. Rule out AAA in an older male who has a pulsatile abdominal mass that is more than 3 cm in width. The next step is to order an abdominal ultrasound and CT. Learn the signs/symptoms of infective endocarditis (bacterial Atrial Flutter AF is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the United States. It is a major cause of stroke and classified as a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. AF may be asymptomatic. If patient is hemodynamically unstable (chest pain/angina, hypotension, heart failure, cold clammy skin, acute kidney failure) with new onset of AF with severe symptoms, call 911. Risk of stroke/death is higher in elderly patients. Risk Factors HTN, CAD, ACS, caffeine, nicotine, hyperthyroidism, alcohol intake (\"holiday heart\"), heart failure, LVH, pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep apnea, other Paroxysmal AF (intermittent or self-terminating): Episodes terminate with 7 days or less (usually in less than 24 hours); it is usually asymptomatic Classic Case Patient reports the sudden onset of heart palpitations accompanied by feelings of weakness, dizziness, dyspnea/dyspnea on exertion, and reduction in exercise capacity. May complain of chest pain and feeling like passing out (presyncope to syncope). Rapid and irregular pulse may be more than 110 beats/min with hypotension. AF can be paroxysmal and stop spontaneously (within 7 days) or be persistent or long-standing. Treatment Plan Search for underlying cause. Treatment depends on patient type and risk factors for stroke. Newer tool is the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score. CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scoring system (score of 0 is low risk): Score of 2 or more requires anticoagulation. C (CHF), H (HTN), A (age >75 years), D (diabetes), S 2 (stroke/TIA), V (vascular disease), A (age 65-74 years), S (sex: female gender is higher risk). Diagnostic test is the 12-lead EKG (does not show discrete P waves, irregularly irregular rhythm). New onset: EKG, TSH, sodium), (rule out heart troponin. Consider 24-hour monitor if paroxysmal AF. Digoxin level (if on digoxin). Order echocardiogram (rule out valvular pathology, which increases risk of stroke). Lifestyle: Avoid stimulants (caffeine, nicotine, decongestants) and alcohol (some patients). Medications Patients are referred to cardiologists for medical management. An option for new-onset AF with stable patients is cardioversion (first 48 hours) or rate control. Management varies based on AF severity and symptoms. Rate control: Use beta-blockers, amiodarone (Cordarone). Amiodarone has a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Black Box Warning of pulmonary and liver damage. Simvastatin with amiodarone can cause rhabdomyolysis. 211171 Warfarin (Coumadin; vitamin K antagonist) for anticoagulation remains the most prescribed therapy and the only recommended option for patients with severe or end- stage chronic kidney disease. Baseline INR, aPTT, CBC (check platelets), creatinine, LFTs. Initial daily dose equal to or less than 5 mg, but frail, sensitive, or elderly patients older than 70 years of age should take lower dose (2.5 mg). Full effect takes from 2 to 3 days. Check INR every 2 to 3 days until therapeutic for two consecutive checks; then recheck weekly and so on until INR is stable at 2 to 3. Check every 4 weeks when stable. You may wish to check the institutional protocols or refer to anticoagulation clinic. If you do not have experience with anticoagulation, best to refer to cardiologist. If suspect a bleeding episode, check the INR with the PT and the PTT. Drug interactions for warfarin are given in Chapter 3 . Antidote for warfarin is vitamin K. For nonvalvular apixaban (Eliquis) do not require INR monitoring, have no major dietary restrictions, and have fewer drug interactions. Platelet inhibitors, such as clopidogrel (Plavix), either alone or in combination with other anticoagulants may be better tolerated but less effective than warfarin. Complications Death caused by thromboembolic event (i.e., stroke, pulmonary embolism), CHF, angina, etc. Warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage has very high mortality and causes 90% of warfarin deaths. It is a medical emergency. Call 911. Stop all anticoagulants, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Initiate vitamin K to reverse. Warfarin can be reversed, as can Pradaxa (Praxbind [reversal agent] is available in all 50 Guidelines ( Table 7.1 ) Atrial Fibrillation INR: 2.0 to 3.0 Synthetic/Prosthetic Valves INR: 2.5 to 3.5 Patient Education: Dietary Sources of Vitamin K Advise patients to be consistent with their day-to-day consumption of vitamin K foods. Give patient a list of foods with high levels of vitamin K (\"greens\" such as kale, collard, mustard, spinach, iceberg or romaine lettuce, brussels sprouts, potatoes). Only one serving per day is recommended for very high vitamin K foods. Table 7.1 Elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR) INR Presence of Bleeding Action 212172 <5.0 None Skip next dose and/or reduce slightly the maintenance dose. Check INR once or twice a week when adjusting dose. Do not give vitamin K. 5.0-9.0 None Hold one or two doses; with or without administration of low-dosed vitamin K (1 to 2.5 mg). Monitor INR every 2 to 3 days until it is stable. Decrease the Coumadin maintenance dose. INR, international normalized ratio. Source: Adapted from Hull and Garcia (2017). Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT) EKG shows tachycardia with peaked QRS complex with P waves present. May be seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, which is more common in children. Causes include digitalis toxicity, alcohol, hyperthyroidism, caffeine intake, alcohol, illegal drug use, etc. Classic Case Patient complains of the abrupt onset of palpitations, rapid pulse, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and anxiety. Rapid heart rate can range from 150 to 250 beats/min. Treatment Plan Check EKG. If shows WPW syndrome or is symptomatic, refer to cardiologist. If hemodynamically unstable, may require electrical cardioversion. Call 911. Vagal maneuvers: Carotid sinus massage (patient supine, monitor vital signs). Monitor with EKG. If a carotid sinus massage is needed, refer to a cardiologist. Contraindicated if history of transient ischemic attack or stroke in past 3 months or has carotid bruits. Holding one's breath and straining hard, or splashing ice cold water on the face may interrupt and stop this arrhythmia but is rarely used (elicits the diving reflex). Pulsus Paradoxus Also known as a paradoxical pulse . The paradox is that the apical pulse can still be heard even though the radial pulse is no longer palpable. It is measured by using the blood pressure cuff (sphygmomanometer) and a stethoscope. Certain pulmonary and cardiac conditions that compress the chambers of the heart (impair diastolic filling) can cause an exaggerated decrease of the systolic pressure of more than 10 mmHg (a drop of <10 mmHg is not pulsus paradoxus). Pulmonary Cause Asthma, emphysema (increased positive pressure) Cardiac Cause Tamponade, pericarditis, cardiac effusion (decreases movement of left ventricle) EKG Interpretation 213173 Because family nurse practitioners (NPs) function in the primary care area (not the CCU), they very well may be expected to diagnose complex rhythms. The important ones to memorize (EKG appearance) are AF (irregularly irregular rhythm with no p waves; see Figure 7.1 ), ventricular tachycardia (jagged irregular QRS), and the norms such as sinus rhythm and sinus arrhythmia (see Figure 7.2 ). Figure 7.1 Atrial fibrillation. Anterior wall MI (see Figure 7.3 ) or an anterior STEMI is the most common and serious type of MI. EKG changes include ST segment elevation (leads V2 to V4) and Q waves. Wide QRS complex resembles a \"tombstone.\" Figure 7.2 Sinus arrhythmia. 214174 Figure 7.3 Anterior wall myocardial infarction. EXAM TIPS One EKG strip may show up in the FNP or AGNP exam (ANCC or AANP exam). Memorize appearance of EKG with AF and anterior wall MI (tombstone-like pattern). AF: Goal is INR of 2 to 3. AF have many causes, such as alcohol intoxication; CAD, CHF, history of MI, older age, hypertension; stimulants (caffeine, decongestants, cocaine, amphetamines, etc.). Learn the proper procedure to check for pulsus paradoxus. If INR is between 4.01 to 4.99, hold one dose. Check Table 7.1 . Do not give vitamin K. CLINICAL PEARLS Major bleeding episodes can occur even with a normal INR. Order an INR with the PT and the PTT if you suspect bleeding. It may take up to 3 days after changing the warfarin dose to see a change in the INR. Coumadin is an FDA category X drug. Hypertension Correct BP Measurement 215175 Avoid smoking or caffeine intake 30 minutes before measurement. Instruct patient not to cross their legs (increases SBP). Begin BP measurement after at least 5 minutes of rest (mercury sphygmomanometer preferred over digital machines). Two or more readings separated by 2 minutes should be averaged per visit. Higher number determines BP stage (BP 140/100 is stage II instead of stage I; see Table 7.2 ). Primary HTN Previously known as essential hypertension . It is usually asymptomatic. Both the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) and the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners Certification Board (AANPCB) exams are now based on the JNC 8 Hypertension Guidelines (2014). The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2017 guideline for high BP in adults has changed the BP classification and goals (BP <130/80). But as of May 2018, the JNC 8 is still the guideline that is followed on the exams. (Changes will be posted at www.npreview.com ) Peripheral Vascular Resistance \u00d7 Cardiac Output Any change in the PVR or CO results in a change in BP (increase/decrease). Examples: Na+ (Sodium): Water retention increases vascular volume, increased CO (BP increases) Table 7.2 Blood Pressure Stages Stage II : Increased vasoconstriction will increase PVR (BP increases). Younger patients have higher renin levels compared with the elderly. Sympathetic System Stimulation : Epinephrine secretion causes tachycardia and vasoconstriction (BP increases). Blockers : Drugs decrease peripheral vascular resistance from vasodilation (BP decreases). Pregnancy : Systemic vascular resistance is lowered due to hormones (systolic and diastolic BP decreases during the first and second trimesters). Labs Kidneys: Creatinine, urinalysis Endocrine: TSH, fasting blood glucose Electrolyte: Potassium (Na + ), calcium (Ca 2+ ) 216176 Heart: Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides (complete lipid panel) Anemia: CBC Baseline EKG and chest x-ray (to rule out cardiomegaly) Rule Out Target Organ Damage Look for the following clinical findings: Microvascular Damage Eyes Silver and/or copper wire arterioles Arteriovenous junction nicking (caused when an arteriole crosses on top of a vein) Flame-shaped hemorrhages, papilledema Microalbuminuria and proteinuria Elevated serum creatinine and abnormal eGFR (rule out kidney disease) Peripheral or generalized edema Macrovascular damage Heart S3 (CHF) S4 (LVH) Carotid due to plaque, increased risk of CAD) CAD and acute MI Decreased or absent peripheral pulses (peripheral arterial disease [PAD]) Brain Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) Hemorrhagic strokes Secondary HTN The causes of secondary HTN can be classified into three major groups: 1. Renal (renal artery stenosis, polycystic kidneys, chronic kidney disease) 2. Endocrine (hyperthyroidism, hyperaldosteronism, pheochromocytoma) 3. Other causes (obstructive sleep apnea, coarctation of the aorta) Renal artery stenosis is more common in younger adults. Middle-aged adults are more likely to have endocrine-related disorders. Chronic kidney disease is more common in elderly patients. Rule out secondary cause and maintain a high index of suspicion if the following: Age younger than 30 years Severe HTN or acute rise in BP (previously stable patient) Resistant HTN despite treatment with at least three antihypertensive agents Malignant HTN (severe HTN with end-organ damage such as retinal hemorrhages, papilledema, acute renal failure, and severe headache Other causes include: Coarctation of the aorta BP of the arms is higher than BP of the legs 217 Delayed or diminished femoral pulses (check both radial and femoral pulse at the same time) Sleep apnea Sleep partner will report severe snoring with apneic episodes during sleep Marked hypoxic episodes during sleep increases BP Clinical Findings Kidneys Bruit epigastric or flank area (renal artery stenosis); inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin with cystic renal masses (polycystic kidney) Increased creatinine and decreased GFR (renal insufficiency to failure) Endocrine Primary hyperaldosteronism HTN with hypokalemia (low K+) Normal to elevated sodium levels (high/normal Na+) Hyperthyroidism Weight loss, tachycardia, fine tremor, moist skin, anxiety New onset of AF (check EKG) Check Labile increase in BP accompanied by palpitations Sudden onset of anxiety, sweating, severe headache How to Diagnose HTN Check BP (serial BP) and confirm diagnosis at another subsequent visit from 1 to 4 weeks (after initial visit). Check BP at home and keep diary. Does office BP correlate with home BP monitoring results? If home BP numbers lower, rule out white-coat hypertension. JNC 8 treatment goals have been grouped by age, race, and disease (chronic kidney disease [CKD] and diabetes mellitus [DM]). In a nutshell, the goal is BP less than 140/90 mmHg for everyone. The exception is older patients (60 years of age or older) who do not have CKD and/or DM; the systolic BP can go up by 10 mmHg (<150/90 mmHg). See Tables 7.3 , 7.4 , and 7.5 for specific JNC guidelines. Table 7.3 JNC 8 Hypertension Treatment Goal (by Age) BP Goal Notes Age 60 years or younger <140/90 mmHg Same BP goal for all (including DM/CKD) Age 60 years or older <150/90 mmHg Systolic BP goal increased by 10 mm Hg except if DM and/or CKD CKD, chronic kidney disease; DM, diabetes mellitus; JNC, Joint National Committee.

To rule out, have patient check his or her BP outside of the clinic a few times and compare with office BP. Hypertensive Emergency Diastolic BP greater than 120 mmHg (severe hypertension) with clinical findings of target organ damage such as nausea and vomiting (increased intracranial pressure [ICP]), CVA/TIA, subarachnoid acute severe low-back pain (dissecting aorta). Isolated Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Caused by loss of recoil in the arteries (atherosclerosis), which increases PVR. Pulse pressure (systolic BP - diastolic BP) increases in this disorder. For frail patients with severe orthostatic hypotension (falls, syncope) or if older than age 60 (without CKD or DM), it is now acceptable to have a systolic BP of up to 150 mmHg. Treatment Plan 219178 Thiazide diuretics at low dose (chlorthalidone 12.5 to are at higher risk for orthostatic hypotension due to a less active autonomic nervous system and slower metabolism of drugs by the liver (prolongs half-life of drugs). To Evaluate for Orthostatic Hypotension Check BP in both supine and standing positions, especially in the elderly, before and after treatment for HTN. Ask patient if dizzy or lightheaded with changes in position. Lifestyle Recommendations This is the first-line therapy for HTN, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 DM: Lose weight if overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25-29.9) or obese (BMI 30 or higher). Normal weight is a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9. Stop smoking. Reduce stress level. Reduce dietary sodium: Less than 2.4 g per day (2,400 mg/d) Maintain adequate intake of potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Limit alcohol intake: 1 ounce (30 mL) or less per day for men 0.5 ounce or less per day for women Eat fatty cold-water fish (salmon, anchovy) three times a week. DASH Diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop HTN) Recommended for prehypertension, HTN, weight loss. Goal is to eat foods rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Reduce red meat and processed foods. Eat more whole grains, legumes. Eat more fish and poultry. Grains: Seven to eight daily servings Fruits and vegetables: Four to five daily servings Nuts, seeds, and dry beans: Four to five servings per week Fats, oils, or fat-free dairy products: Two to three daily servings Meat, poultry, and fish: Two or fewer daily servings Sweets: Try to limit to fewer than five servings per week Avoid high-sodium foods: Cold cuts, ready-made foods, any pickled foods (cucumbers, eggs, pork parts) Dietary Sources of Minerals Calcium (low-fat dairy) Potassium (most fruits and vegetables) Magnesium (dried beans, whole grains, nuts) Omega-3 oils (anchovy, krill, salmon, flaxseed) 220179 Exercise Advise that aerobic physical activity will reduce LDL cholesterol and BP.

Effect is Monitor electrolytes, especially K+. Thiazide Diuretics Action: Change the way that the kidney handles sodium, which increases urine output. Have a favorable effect with osteopenia/osteoporosis (slows down demineralization). All thiazides contain sulfa compounds. Avoid if patient has a sulfa allergy. Side Effects \"Hyper\" Hyperglycemia (be careful with diabetics) Hyperuricemia (can precipitate a gout attack) Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesteremia (check lipid profile) Hypokalemia increases risk of arrhythmias) restrict water intake, replace K+ loss) Contraindications Sensitivity to sulfa drugs and thiazides Examples Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg PO daily Chlorthalidone (Hygroton) 12.5 to 25 mg PO daily Indapamide (Lozol) PO daily Loop Diuretics Action: Inhibit the sodium-potassium-chloride pump of the kidney in the loop of Henle. Side Effects Hypokalemia (potentiates digoxin toxicity, increases risk of 221180 diuretic, restrict water intake, replace K+ loss) Hypomagnesemia Possibly altered excretion of lithium and salicylates Contraindications Sensitivity to loop diuretics Examples Furosemide (Lasix) PO BID Bumetanide (Bumex) PO BID Sulfa Allergy and Diuretics If people are allergic to sulfa, they may have cross-sensitivity to thiazides and loop diuretics. Other drugs with antibiotics, sulfasalazine, some protease inhibitors May also be sensitive to topical sulfas (ophthalmic Action: Antagonizes the action of aldosterone. Increases elimination of water in the kidneys and conserves potassium. Drug class also known as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists or antimineralcorticoid. Indications: Administer for HTN, heart failure, hirsutism, precocious puberty. Avoid combining with potassium-sparing diuretics, ACEIS, or potassium supplements. Side Effects Gynecomastia, galactorrhea Hyperkalemia GI (vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps), postmenopausal bleeding, dysfunction Contraindications Hyperkalemia insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL in men or greater than 1.8 mg/dL for women) DM type 2 with microalbuminuria Examples Spironolactone (Aldactone) daily Eplerenone (Inspra) daily Beta-Blockers Avoid abrupt discontinuation after chronic use. Wean slowly. May precipitate severe rebound hypertension. Action: Decreases vasomotor activity, CO, inhibits renin and norepinephrine release. Blocks beta receptors on the heart and the peripheral vasculature. There are two types of beta-blocker receptors in the body: B1 (cardiac effects) and B2 (lungs and peripheral 222181 vasculature). Contraindications Asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis, emphysema (chronic lung disease) Second- and third-degree heart block (fine to use with first-degree block) Sinus bradycardia Other Uses Acute MI: Reduces mortality during acute MI and post-MI Migraine headache: For prophylaxis only (not for acute attacks) Reduces intraocular pressure (Betimol ophthalmic drops for open-angle tachycardia <100 beats/min) Angina pectoris: Treats symptoms Post-MI: Decreases mortality Hyperthyroidism and pheochromocytoma: To control symptoms until primary disease treated Beta-blockers: Ends with \"-olol\": Metoprolol (Lopressor) 100 mg mg daily Propranolol (long-acting Inderal) 40 mg BID Do not use propranolol (plain Inderal) to treat HTN (shorter half-life) Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBS) Action : Blocks voltage-gated calcium channels in cardiac smooth muscle and the blood vessels. Results in systemic vasodilation. The nondihydropyridines depress the muscles of the heart (inotropic effect). The dihydropyridines slow down heart rate (chronotropic effect). Side Effects Headaches (due to vasodilation) Ankle edema (caused by vasodilation and considered benign) Heart block or bradycardia (depresses cardiac muscle and AV node) Reflex tachycardia (seen with dihydropyridines such as nifedipine) Contraindications Second- and third-degree heart block daily ACEIs and ARBs Blocks conversion of angiotensin I to II (more potent vasoconstrictor) DM and/or CKD: Drugs of choice (protect kidneys) Pregnancy Category C (First Trimester) and Category D (Second and Third Trimesters) Fetal kidney malformations and fetal hypotension Side Effects Dry hacking cough (up to 10% with ACEIs; less with ARBs) Hyperkalemia, angioedema (rare but may be life-threatening) Contraindications Moderate to severe kidney disease Renal artery stenosis Precipitates acute renal failure if given ACEI or ARB Hyperkalemia (this is also a side effect of ACEIs and ARBs; will have additive effect) Examples ACEIs Ramipril (Altace) once a day in one to two divided doses Benazepril (Lotensin) once a day initially Enalapril (Vasotec) once a day in one to two divided doses ARBs Losartan (Cozaar) once a day in one to two divided doses Candesartan (Atacand) once a day in one to two divided doses Olmesartan (Benicar) once a day in one to two divided doses Alpha-1 Blockers/Antagonists Also known as alpha-adrenergic blockers . Suffix of \"zosin.\" Potent vasodilators. Common side effects are dizziness and hypotension. Give at bedtime at very low doses and slowly titrate up. Side Effects \"First-dose orthostatic hypotension\" is common (warn patient). Side effects are dizziness and postural hypotension (common side effect). May cause severe hypotension and reflex tachycardia. Give at bedtime. Start at very low doses and titrate up slowly until good BP control. Advise patient to get out of bed slowly to prevent postural hypotension. Not a first-line choice for HTN except for with both HTN and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Alpha-blockers relax smooth muscle found on the bladder neck and the prostate gland and relieves obstructive voiding symptoms such as weak urinary stream, urgency, and nocturia. 224183 Examples Terazosin (Hytrin): Used for both HTN and (starting dose 1 mg PO at bedtime) (Cardura): Used for both HTN and BPH Used for BPH only Sample Case Scenarios (JNC 8) * Can initiate with one to two antihypertensive medications (combined or two separate agents). Stable heart failure : ACEI or ARB as first line, plus BB plus diuretic and others DM : ACEI or ARB as first line; if African American, can start with CCB or thiazide CKD : ARB or ACEI as first line; can add CCB or thiazides Stroke history : ACEI or ARB as first-line drugs; add CCB or thiazide as second-line drugs African Americans (including people with DM): Thiazides or CCBs EXAM TIPS Follow JNC 8 guidelines for both ANCC and AANPCB exams. Eye findings: Learn to distinguish the findings in hypertensive retinopathy (copper and silver wire arterioles, arteriovenous nicking) from diabetic retinopathy (neovascularization, cotton wall spots, microaneurysms). Arteriovenous nicking occurs when a retinal vein is compressed by an arteriole that causes the venule to collapse. Isolated systolic HTN in the measure both, the supine first, then standing BP. Memorize the side effects of thiazide diuretics. Side effect of spironolactone is gynecomastia ACEIs or ARBs: Use for DM, CKD, and heart failure. It may cause a dry cough (10%). Careful when combining ACEIs with potassium-sparing diuretics (i.e., triamterene, spironolactone) because of increased of Bilateral renal artery stenosis: ACEIs or ARBs will precipitate acute renal failure. Alpha-blockers are not first-line drugs for HTN except if patient has preexisting BPH. Women with HTN and osteopenia/osteoporosis should receive thiazides. Thiazides help bone loss by slowing down calcium loss (from the bone) and stimulating osteoclasts. CLINICAL PEARLS Hypertensive patients who are less than 20/10 mmHg above goal can initially be treated with monotherapy (Mann, 2017). 225184 Per JNC 8, consider chlorthalidone or indapamide (instead of hydrochlorothiazide); better evidence and longer half-life. Heart Failure Numerous causes and precipitating factors such as an acute MI, CAD, HTN, fluid retention, valvular abnormalities, arrhythmias, and so on. Ejection fraction (EF) less than 40% is also known as systolic heart failure (or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction/HFrEF). If EF more than 40%, also known as diastolic failure (or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction/HFpEF). Left Ventricular Failure Crackles, bibasilar rales (rales on lower lobes of the lungs), cough, dyspnea, decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, nocturnal nonproductive cough, wheezing (cardiac asthma), hypertension, and fatigue are symptoms of both left and right heart failure Right Ventricular Failure Jugular venous distention (JVD): Normal JVD is 4 cm or less Enlarged spleen, enlarged liver causes anorexia, nausea, and abdominal pain Lower extremity edema with cool skin Other PE Findings Presence of S3 gallop, which can be accompanied by anasarca (severe generalized edema due to effusion of fluid into the extracellular space) Labs Chest x-ray result will show increased heart size, interstitial and alveolar edema, Kerley B lines, and tests Echocardiogram with Doppler flow study Weight should be checked daily to detect fluid accumulation Treatment Plan If acute decompensated heart failure: Refer to ED (IV furosemide, oxygen, vasodilators, others). Stable HF (HFrEF) with hypertension: Start ARB, then add a beta-blocker, aldosterone-receptor antagonist (spironolactone), and other medications as needed (Colucci, 2018; Ferri, 2016). Limit sodium intake. Patients with HF are best managed by cardiologists or at a heart clinic. Use beta-blocker if heart failure with reduced EF (carvedilol, bisoprolol, extended- release metoprolol succinate); start dose; careful with initial dosing, can worsen; consult or refer to experienced heart clinic 226Use New York Heart Association (NYHA) system to classify patient's degree of cardiac disability ( Table 7.6 ) Refer to cardiologist; if in distress, refer to ED Table 7.6 New York Heart Association Functional Capacity Ratings Classification Degree of Disability Class I No limitations on physical activity Class II Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, exertional dyspnea Class III Marked limitation in physical activity Class IV Symptoms are present at rest, with or without physical activity Source: American Heart Association (2011). Lifestyle Modification for Heart Failure Restrict or abstain from alcohol. Smoking cessation if smoker; weight loss Restrict sodium to 2 to 3 g/d Fluid restriction (1.5-2 L/d) may help some patients Note Here is an easy way to remember whether a sign or symptom is from the left or right side of the heart: Both left and lung start with the letter L. Symptoms are lung related, such as dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Right-sided heart failure symptoms are GI related (anorexia, nausea, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain) Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Thrombi develop inside the deep venous system of the legs or pelvis secondary to stasis, trauma to vessel walls, inflammation, or increased coagulation. Pulmonary embolus is considered another manifestation of this thromboembolic disorder. Etiology (three categories): 1. Stasis: Prolonged travel/inactivity (more than 3 hours), bed rest, CHF 2. Inherited coagulation disorders: Factor C deficiency, Leiden, and so forth 3. Increased coagulation due to external factors: Oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, bone fractures especially of the long bones, trauma, recent surgery, malignancy Classic Case A patient with risk factors for DVT complains of gradual onset of swelling on a lower extremity after a history of travel (more than 3 hours) or prolonged sitting. The patient complains of a painful and swollen lower extremity that is red and warm. If patient has PE, it may be accompanied by abrupt onset of chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, or syncope. Many 227185 patients are asymptomatic. Treatment Plan Homan's sign: Lower leg pain on dorsiflexion of the foot (low sensitivity) CBC, platelets, clotting time (PT/PTT, INR), D-dimer level, chest x-ray, EKG Ultrasonography (whole leg or proximal leg) Hospital admission, heparin IV then warfarin PO (Coumadin) for 3 to 6 months (first episode) or longer For recurrent DVT or elderly, antithrombotic treatment may last a lifetime Complications Pulmonary emboli Stroke and other embolic episodes EXAM TIPS Memorize goal for atrial fibrillation is an INR of 2.0 to 3.0. Learn how to manage elevated INR (see Table 7.1 ). Memorize presentation of a patient with NYHA class II heart disease. First line medication for stable HF is an ACEI or ARB. The S3 heart sound is a sign of HF, although it can also be heard in pregnant women and children/young adults. Learn DVT risk factors. Superficial Thrombophlebitis Inflammation of a superficial vein due to local trauma. Higher risk if indwelling catheters, intravenous drugs (e.g., potassium), secondary bacterial infection ( S. aureus ). Some patients may have coexistent DVT. Classic Case Adult patient complains of an acute onset of an indurated vein (localized redness, swelling, and tenderness). Usually located on the extremities. The patient is afebrile with normal vital signs. Objective Findings Indurated cord-like vein that is warm and tender to touch with a surrounding area of erythema. There should be no swelling or edema of the entire limb (think of DVT). Treatment Plan Administer NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen or naproxen sodium (Anaprox DS), BID. Warm compresses. Elevate limb. If septic cause, admit to hospital. 228186 Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) Gradual (decades) narrowing and/or occlusion of medium to large arteries in the lower extremities. Blood flow to the extremities gradually decreases over time, resulting in permanent ischemic damage (gangrene of the toes/foot). Higher risk with HTN, smoking, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Previously known as peripheral vascular disease. Classic Case Older patient who has a history of smoking and hyperlipidemia complains of worsening pain on ambulation (intermittent claudication) that is instantly relieved by rest. Over time, symptoms worsen until the patient's walking distance is greatly limited. Atrophic skin changes. Some have gangrene on one or more toes. Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) ABI score equal or less than 0.9 is diagnostic for PAD. ABI score of 0.91 to 1.3 is normal. Procedure Systolic BP of the ankle and the arm (brachial) is checked after in a supine position for 10 minutes by using a BP cuff and ultrasound probe. An ABI score is done for each leg. To calculate ABI, the SBP of each foot is divided by the SBP of both arms. Objective Findings Skin: Atrophic changes (shiny and hyperpigmented ankles that are hairless and cool to touch); gangrene of the toe(s) Cardiovascular: Decreased to absent dorsal pedal pulse (may include popliteal and posterior tibial pulse), increased capillary refill time (less than 2 seconds), and bruits over partially blocked arteries Treatment Plan Initial method (low tech): Check pedal and posterior tibial pulses. Ankle-Brachial index (ABI) Score: Used to evaluate severity of PAD; done by checking systolic BP of ankles and upper arm; score of 0.9 or less is diagnostic of PAD. Encourage smoking cessation (smoking causes vasoconstriction) and daily ambulation exercises Pentoxifylline (Trental) if indicated, but effect is marginal (compared with cilostazol) Cilostazol (Pletal) is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (direct vasodilator); can be taken with aspirin or clopidogrel. Grapefruit juice, diltiazem, and omeprazole can increase serum concentration if taken together. Percutaneous angioplasty or surgery for severe cases Complications Gangrene of foot and/or lower limb with amputation Increased risk of CAD Increased risk of carotid plaquing (check for carotid Raynaud's Phenomenon Reversible vasospasm of the peripheral arterioles on the fingers and toes. Cause is unknown. Associated with an increased risk of autoimmune disorders (e.g., thyroid disorder, pernicious anemia, rheumatoid arthritis). Most patients are females (60% to 90%), with a gender ratio of 8:1. Patients with no underlying disease have \"primary\" Raynaud's phenomenon. Up to 95% of patients with scleroderma have \"secondary\" Raynaud's phenomenon. Classic Case A middle-aged woman complains of chronic and recurrent episodes of color changes on her fingertips in a symmetric pattern (both hands and both feet). The colors range from white (pallor) and blue (cyanosis) to red (reperfusion). Complains of numbness and tingling. Attacks last for several hours. Hands and feet become numb with very cold temperatures. Ischemic changes may be present after a severe episode such as shallow ulcers (that eventually heal) on some of the fingertips. Treatment Plan Avoid touching cold objects, cold weather; avoid stimulants (e.g., caffeine) Smoking cessation (e.g., Imitrex, ergots, pseudoephedrine/decongestants, amphetamines); avoid nonselective beta-blockers Complications Small the fingertips and toes EXAM TIPS Raynaud's phenomenon: Think of the colors of the American flag as a reminder for this disorder. Medicines for Raynaud's phenomenon include CCBs (nifedipine, amlodipine). Bacterial Endocarditis full-blown disease endocarditis. Bacterial pathogens are gram positive (i.e., viridans streptococcus, S. aureus , etc.). Also known as IE. Parenteral antibacterial treatment for native valve endocarditis can range from 4 to 6 weeks. Classic Case A middle-aged male presents with fever, chills, and malaise that are associated with subungual hemorrhages (splinter hemorrhages on nail bed) and tender violet-colored nodules on the fingers and/or on the toes (Osler's nodes). Palms and soles may have tender red spots on the skin (Janeway lesions). Some patients may have a heart murmur. 230188 Treatment Plan Refer to cardiologist or ED for hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics Blood cultures \u00d7 three (first 24 hours) CBC (elevated WBCs) and sedimentation rate greater than 20 mm per hour (elevated) Complications Valvular destruction, myocardial abscess, for: Mitral valve prolapse Genitourinary or GI incisions/invasive procedures (except if there is an existing infection present such as a urinary tract infection [UTI] before a cystoscopy) Standard regimen: Give 1 hour before procedure: Amoxicillin 2 g PO \u00d7 1 dose (adults) Amoxicillin 50 mg/kg 1 hour before procedure \u00d7 one dose (children) Table 7.7 Endocarditis Prophylaxis High Risk Condition Invasive Procedures Previous history of bacterial endocarditis Dental procedures that traumatize oral mucosa, gingiva, or the periapical area of the teeth Prosthetic valves Invasive procedures on the respiratory tract (especially if tissue is infected) Certain types of congenital heart disease Cardiac transplant with valvulopathy Source: Adapted from Wilson et al. (2007). Penicillin Allergy Clindamycin 600 mg or clarithromycin (Biaxin) 500 mg or cephalexin (Keflex) 2 g Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) The classic finding is an S 2 \"click\" followed by a systolic murmur. Some patients with MVP are at higher risk of thromboemboli, TIAs, AF, and ruptured chordae tendineae. Diagnosed by cardiac echocardiogram with Doppler flow study. Classic Case Tall and thin adult female patient complains of fatigue, palpitations, and lightheadedness (orthostatic hypotension) that is aggravated by May be asymptomatic. Associated with pectus excavatum, hypermobility of the joints, arm span greater than height (rule out Marfan's syndrome). Treatment Plan 231Asymptomatic MVP does not need treatment. MVP with palpitations is treated with beta-blockers, avoidance of caffeine, alcohol, and cigarettes. Holter monitoring is useful in detecting significant arrhythmias. Hyperlipidemia The treatment guidelines and type of statin and intensity (low, moderate, or high dose) are from the 2014 updated American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk. See the ACC web address for tool ( http://tools.acc.org/ascvd-risk-estimator ). To determine the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), use the ACC's new \"ASCVD Risk Estimator\" tool (or the Pooled Cohort Equations for ASCVD risk prediction). The free app is available and can be accessed directly online (see previous paragraph). Screening Guidelines Complete lipid profile (fasting) starting at age 20 (then every 5 years) Older than age 40 years, screen every 2 to 3 years Preexisting hyperlipidemia: Screen annually or more frequently Total Cholesterol Normal: Less than 200 mg/dL Borderline: Between 200 and 239 mg/dL High: Greater than 240 mg/dL HDL Cholesterol (HDL-C) Men: Greater than 40 mg/dL Women: Greater than 50 mg/dL If less than 40 mg/dL, associated with increased risk of CAD even if normal LDL or cholesterol High carbohydrate and low-fat diets and smoking are associated with low HDL Lifestyle modifications: Do regular moderate cardiovascular/aerobic exercises most days of the week, lose weight, eat healthy fats (salmon, tuna, nuts), eliminate trans fats, stop smoking LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) Optimal: Less than 100 mg/dL LDL: Less than 130 mg/dL for low-risk patients with fewer than two risk factors Very high: Greater than 190 mg/dL Heart disease or diabetes: Less than 100 mg/dL Triglycerides Normal: Less than 150 mg/dL High risk of acute pancreatitis: 1000 mg/dL or higher 232189 If triglycerides >500 mg/dL or higher: (Niaspan), fish oil: Lovaza 4 g/d; when triglycerides are under control, switch target to lowering LDL Possible causes: Metabolic syndrome, DM, familial hypertriglyceridemia, alcohol abuse, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, medications (anabolic steroids, Accutane, etc.) Lifestyle modifications: Decrease sugar and simple carbohydrates (junk food), avoid alcoholic drinks, follow low-fat diet, eat fish with omega-3 (salmon, sardines) twice a week, lose weight and increase aerobic type physical activity. Risk Factors: Heart Disease HTN Family history of premature heart disease (women with MI before age 65 years or men with MI before age 55 years) DM (considered a CHD risk equivalent even if patient has no history of preexisting heart disease) Dyslipidemia Low HDL-C (<40 mg/dL) Age (men older than 45 or women older than 55) Cigarette smoking Obesity (BMI 30 kg/m 2 Plan: Hyperlipidemia First-line treatment is lifestyle changes (weight loss, exercise most days of the week, better diet low in saturated fat, smoking cessation), but the presence of ASCVD and other factors, initiate statin therapy with lifestyle changes. Reduce dietary salt intake and learn about the DASH diet (low salt, low saturated fat <30%). Encourage use of soluble fiber in diet (e.g., inulin, guar gum, fruit, vegetables) to enhance lowering of LDL (lowers LDL by blocking absorption in GI tract up to 10%). Target goal is to lower LDL first (except if very high triglyceride levels). If high triglycerides (500 mg/dL or higher), treat hypertriglyceridemia first because patients are at high risk for acute pancreatitis. Low HDL alone (even if normal LDL and cholesterol) is a risk factor for heart disease. ACC and AHA Updated Guidelines The 2013 ACC and AHA updated guidelines have no recommendations for or against specific target levels for LDL or HDL in the primary or secondary prevention of ASCVD. The expert panel did not find evidence to support use of specific LDL-C or HDL-C target levels. Previously, the goal for secondary prevention was LDL of 70 mg/dL and for primary prevention LDL of less than 100 mg/dL. The ACC and AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce ASCVD Risk (2014) list four statin benefit groups, which are discussed in terms of type of 233190 prevention (secondary or primary). These are outlined here and summarized in Table 7.8 . Table 7.9 categorizes statin drugs by level of intensity of treatment. A. Secondary Prevention (ASCVD): 1. Patients with any form of ASCVD (history of MI, CAD, angina, stroke/TIA, PAD, coronary revascularization) Younger than 75 years: High-intensity statin Older than 75 years (or not candidate for high-intensity statin): Moderate- intensity statin B. Primary mg/dL or higher: High-intensity statin 3. DM (aged years) with LDL 70 to 189 mg/dL: Moderate-intensity statin 4. Without DM or ASCVD (aged 40-75 years) with an estimated 10-year 7.5% higher: risk to less than 7.5%): First-line therapy is a heart-healthy lifestyle. Table 7.8 ACC/AHA Updated Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol (2014) Characteristics Statin Intensity 21-75 years with ASCVD High intensity 21 years or older (low-density lipoprotein of 190 mg/dL or higher) but without ASCVD High intensity Older than 75 years with ASCVD (or not a candidate for high-intensity statin) Moderate intensity Estimated 10-year ASCVD risk 7.5% or higher (without DM or ASCVD) Moderate to high intensity *DM (40-75 years) with LDL 70-189 mg/dL Moderate intensity ACC, American College of Cardiology; AHA, American Heart Association; ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular mellitus; LDL, Table 7.9 Statin Intensity Dosages High Intensity Statins Moderate Intensity Statins Low Intensity Statins Lower LDL 50% LDL is not recommended by Food and Drug Administration; increases risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. Start at lower dose and titrate up 80-mg dose (if tolerated). LDL, low-density lipoprotein. Lipid-Lowering Medications HMG COA reductase inhibitors (statins) are best at lowering LDL, and some can moderately increase HDL. Under 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines, only two in \"real life,\" start at lower doses and titrate dose slowly until correct dose reached. If high-intensity statin candidate, start at lower doses and titrate up slowly. Some patients may not tolerate high-intensity statins (muscle pains, weakness, etc.) but can tolerate moderate-intensity statins. If not effective after a few months, fibrates, niacin, and/or ezetimibe increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis and drug-induced hepatitis and are now discouraged Nicotinic Acid and Fibrates acid: Niacin (OTC) daily. Avoid combining niacin with liver damage). Fibrates: Gemfibrozil (Lopid), fenofibrate (Tricor). Do not use with severe renal disease. Action: Reduces production of triglycerides by the liver and increases production of HDL. Very good agents for lowering triglycerides and elevating HDL level. Less effective at lowering LDLs compared with the statins. Side effects of niacin: Flushing, itching, tingling, hepatotoxicity; GI effects. Take ASA (aspirin) with niacin after a meal. Divide niacin and take half (or less) of the tablet until higher dose tolerated. Side effects of fibrates: Dyspepsia, gallstones, are the small intestine; interfere with fat absorption, including fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K) Alternative drug for patients who cannot tolerate statins, fibrates, and niacin 235192 Used alone, it is not as effective as statins in lowering LDL; no hepatotoxicity Side effects: Bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain; start at low doses and titrate up slowly Side effects mainly from the GI tract; advise patient to take multivitamin tablets daily Other Lipid-Lowering Drugs Ezetimibe (Zetia) and combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe (Vytorin) Can be taken alone or combined with a statin; can also cause rhabdomyolysis (rare) Side effects: Diarrhea, joint pains, tiredness Prescribe fish oil omega-3 DHA/EPA Lovaza 4 g/d (for high triglycerides) Lab Tests Avoid combination regimen (especially in high doses) of statins, fibrates, niacin, ezetimibe, and drugs that affect the CYP450 system; increases risk of rhabdomyolysis and drug-induced hepatitis. Test baseline LFTs and periodic testing as clinically indicated. Rhabdomyolysis Acute breakdown of skeletal muscle (myoglobins) will cause acute renal failure. Triad of muscle pain, weakness, and dark urine. Look for muscle pain and aches that persist (not associated with muscular exertion). Higher doses or combination therapy have higher risk. Labs: Order creatine kinase if markedly elevated (at least five times the upper limit of normal from 1,500 to >100,000 IU/L). Urine: Reddish-brown color (myoglobinuria) and proteinuria in up to 45% LFTs (will be elevated). Other labs are UA, BUN, creatinine, potassium/electrolytes, EKG, others. Acute Drug-Induced Hepatitis Anorexia, nausea, dark-colored urine, jaundice, fatigue, flu-like symptoms Labs: Elevated ALT and AST Patient Education Minimize alcohol intake or other hepatotoxic substances while on statins. Avoid prescribing to alcoholics. Advise patient to report symptoms of hepatitis or rhabdomyolysis. If present, tell patient to stop the drug and to call or go to ED. EXAM TIPS First-line treatment for hypertension (or prehypertension) is lifestyle and dietary changes. First-line treatment for hyperlipidemia is lifestyle, but presence of ASCVD or 236equivalents, need drug therapy, too. You must memorize some values. These are (list is not all inclusive): An adult (21-75 years) with any type of ASCVD (CAD, PAD, stroke, TIA, etc.) is given high-intensity statins such as atorvastatin 40 to 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20 to 40 mg. An adult with LDL greater than 190 mg/dL (without ASCVD or DM) is a candidate for high-intensity statin dosing. If 10-year estimated ASCVD risk (for up to 75 years of age) is 7.5% or higher, high-intensity statin dosing is recommended. But if risk is less (5%-7.5%), try lifestyle first. If patient has markedly high triglycerides (500 mg/dL or higher), lower triglyceride first (niacin or fibrate) before treating the high cholesterol and LDL levels. High triglycerides increase risk of acute pancreatitis. Educate to avoid alcohol, acetaminophen (hepatotoxic) use. Obese patients: Encourage weight loss and reduce simple carbohydrates, sugars, junk foods. Treat first before treating high LDL. Advise patient to reduce intake of simple carbohydrates, \"junk\" foods, and fried foods. Niacin and fibrates are best agents for lowering triglycerides. Become familiar with dietary sources of magnesium, potassium, and calcium. Bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis drug and dose, splinter hemorrhages on nails, Janeway lesions (red macules palms/soles not painful), Osler's nodes (painful violaceous nodes found mostly on pads of the fingers and toes, thenar eminence). CLINICAL PEARLS Statins may cause memory loss, confusion, etc. (cognitive effects), which are reversible upon discontinuation of statin therapy. Patients on simvastatin and lovastatin should avoid grapefruit juice. Also, they should not mix these two statins with macrolides. Muscle pain (mild to severe) from rhabdomyolysis is usually located on the calves, thighs, lower back, and/or shoulders. Urine will be darker than normal (reddish- brown color). Rule out rhabdomyolysis if patient on a statin complains of muscular pain with dark-colored urine. Obesity All obese and overweight patients should have their BMI and abdominal obesity calculated ( Table 7.10 ). Evaluate for metabolic syndrome and DM type 2. In the United States, more than one third (36.5%) of adults are obese (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). Non-Hispanic Blacks have the highest rates of obesity (48.1%), followed by Hispanics (42.5%) and non-Hispanic Whites (34.5%). Among the obese, 40.2% are middle-aged adults (age 40-59 years). 237193 Body Mass Index (BMI) >40.0 Abdominal Obesity The \"apple-shaped\" body type is considered more dangerous for health compared with the \"pear-shaped\" body type. Waist Circumference Males: Greater than 40 inches or 102 cm Females: Greater than 35 inches or 88 cm Waist-to-Hip Ratio Waist-to-hip ratio: 1.0 or higher (males) Waist-to-hip ratio: 0.8 or higher (females) Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a metabolic disorder with a cluster of symptoms. These patients are at higher risk for type 2 DM and cardiovascular disease. Criteria for Metabolic Syndrome (Adult Treatment Panel III) At least three characteristics must be present to diagnose metabolic syndrome: 1. Abdominal obesity (greater than 40 inches in men and greater than 35 inches in women) 2. HTN 3. Hyperlipidemia Fasting plasma glucose (>100 mg/dL) Elevated triglycerides (>150 mg/dL) Decreased HDL (<40 mg/dL) Labs Fasting (from 9 to 12 hours) lipid profile (especially triglycerides and HDL) Fasting blood glucose Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is caused by triglyceride fat deposits in the hepatocytes of the liver. Most are asymptomatic. Risk factors: Obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, HTN, certain drugs 238194 Classic Case Usually asymptomatic. Some patients may have hepatomegaly. Annual physical exam labs will show mild to moderate elevations of ALT and AST. If symptomatic, complains of fatigue and malaise with vague right upper quadrant pain. Associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, DM, and hyperlipidemia. Labs Liver function tests. ALT and AST may be slightly elevated. Order hepatitis A, B, and C profile. Refer to GI specialist for management and a liver biopsy ( gold standard ). Treatment Plan Lose weight. Exercise and watch diet. Discontinue alcohol intake permanently. Avoid hepatotoxic drugs (i.e., acetaminophen, isoniazid, statins). Recommend vaccination for hepatitis A and B. Recommend annual flu vaccine. Refer to GI specialist for liver biopsy. Calculating BMI The BMI is a measure of the ratio of weight to height. Muscular patients can have falsely elevated BMIs (higher muscle mass). Formula for BMI calculation: Weight (kilograms)/Height (meters) 2 Patient Education All obese and overweight patients should be advised to lose weight (especially diabetics). Lifestyle changes are important (diet, nutrition, exercise, portion control). Daily aerobic exercise (walking, swimming, biking, etc.) for 30 to 45 minutes is recommended. Weight Watchers: Some patients like the support and education (tertiary prevention). EXAM TIPS Know metabolic syndrome criteria (abdominal obesity, HTN, hyperlipidemia or elevated triglycerides and low HDL, elevated fasting glucose >100 mg/dL) caused by hyperinsulinemia and peripheral insulin resistance. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with metabolic syndrome and/or obesity. Look for slight elevation of ALT and AST (not related to alcohol or medications) and negative hepatitis A, B, and C. Abdominal obesity in males (>40 inches), females (>35 inches). Do not confuse BMI formula with the PEF (peak expiratory flow). PEF is calculated using the height, age, gender (mnemonic is \"HAG\"). A person with a BMI of 27 is overweight (initiate lifestyle education). __________ 239* Source: Joint National Committee (2014). 240195 8 Pulmonary System Review DANGER SIGNALS Pulmonary Emboli An older adult complains of sudden onset of dyspnea and coughing. Cough may be productive of pink-tinged frothy sputum. Other symptoms are tachycardia, pallor, and feelings of impending doom. Any condition that increases risk of blood clots will increase risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). These patients have a history of atrial fibrillation, estrogen therapy, smoking, surgery, cancer, pregnancy, long bone fractures, and prolonged inactivity. Impending Respiratory Failure (Asthmatic Exacerbation) An asthmatic patient presents with tachypnea (>20 breaths/min), tachycardia or bradycardia, cyanosis, and anxiety. The patient appears exhausted, fatigued, diaphoretic, and uses accessory muscles to help with breathing. Physical exam reveals cyanosis and \"quiet\" lungs with no wheezing or breath sounds audible. When speaking, the patient may speak only one to two words (cannot form complete sentence because needs to breathe). Treatment Plan Adrenaline injection stat . Call 911. Oxygen at 4 to 5 L/min; albuterol treatments; parenteral steroids, antihistamines (diphenhydramine), and H2 blocker (cimetidine). After treatment, a good sign is if breath sounds and wheezing are present (a sign that bronchi are becoming more open). Usually discharge with oral steroids for several days (e.g., Medrol Dose Pack). NORMAL FINDINGS 241196 Lower lobes: Vesicular breath sounds (soft and low) Upper lobes: Bronchial breath sounds (louder) Egophony Normal: Will hear \"eee\" instead of \"bah\" Abnormal: Will hear \"bah\" sound Normal: The \"eee\" sound is louder over the large bronchi because larger airways are better at transmitting sounds; lower lobes have a softer sounding \"eee\" Tactile patient to say \"99\" or \"one, two, three\"; use finger pads to palpate lungs and feel for vibrations Normal: Stronger vibrations are palpable on the upper lobes and softer vibrations on lower lobes Abnormal: The findings are reversed; may palpate stronger vibrations on one lower lobe (i.e., consolidation); asymmetrical findings are always abnormal Whispered Pectoriloquy Instruct patient to whisper \"99\" or \"one, two, three.\" Compare both lungs. If there is lung consolidation, the whispered words are easily heard on the lower lobes of the lungs. Normal: Voice louder and easy to understand in the upper lobes. Voice sounds are muffled on the lower lobes. Abnormal: Clear voice sounds in the lower lobes or muffled sounds on the upper lobes. Percussion Use middle or index finger as the pleximeter finger on one hand. The finger on the other hand is the hammer. Normal : Resonance is heard over normal lung tissue. Tympany or hyperresonance: Occurs with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema (overinflating). If empty, the stomach area may be tympanic. Dull tone: Bacterial pneumonia with lobar consolidation, pleural effusion (fluid or tumor). A solid organ, such as the liver, sounds dull. Pulmonary Function Tests Measures Severity of Obstructive or Restrictive Pulmonary Dysfunction Obstructive dysfunction (reduction in airflow rates) Asthma, COPD (chronic bronchitis and emphysema), bronchiectasis, others Restrictive dysfunction (reduction of lung volume due to decreased lung compliance) Pulmonary fibrosis, pleural disease, diaphragm obstruction, others 242197 DISEASE REVIEW Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) COPD includes both emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Some patients may also have an asthma component (chronic obstructive asthma). Most patients have a mixture; one or the other may predominate. The disease is characterized by the loss of elastic recoil of the lungs and alveolar damage that takes decades. The most common risk factors are chronic cigarette smoking and older age. Chronic lung disease is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Chronic Bronchitis This is defined as coughing with excessive mucus production for at least 3 or more months for a minimum of 2 or more consecutive years. Emphysema Permanent alveolar damage and loss of elastic recoil result in chronic hyperinflation of the lungs. Expiratory respiratory phase is markedly prolonged. Risk Factors Chronic smoking (etiology in up to 90% of cases of COPD), older age (>40 years) Occupational exposure (coal dust, grain dust) Alpha-1 trypsin deficiency (rare condition); patients have severe lung damage at earlier ages; alpha-1 trypsin protects lungs from oxidative and environmental damage Classic Case An elderly man with a history of many years of cigarette smoking complains of getting short of breath upon physical exertion that worsens over time; accompanied by a chronic cough that is productive of large amounts of white to light-yellow sputum (chronic bronchitis) or progressive dyspnea with minimal cough, barrel chest, and weight loss (emphysema). Objective Findings Emphysema component: Increased anterior-posterior diameter, decreased breath and heart sounds, use of accessory muscles, pursed-lip breathing, and weight loss Percussion: Hyperresonance sometimes present Chronic bronchitis component: Productive cough, wheezing, and coarse crackles Treatment Plan 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) treatment 243198 guidelines are listed in Table 8.1 . beta-agonists ( SABAs; albuterol, May cause adverse cardiac side effects (palpitations, tachycardia). Use with caution if patient has hypertension, angina, and/or hyperthyroidism. Avoid combining with caffeinated drinks. Anticholinergics ( prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or bladder neck obstruction. General Treatment of COPD Smoking cessation is very important ; options include nicotine patches or gum, bupropion (Zyban) or varenicline (Chantix), patient education, and behavioral counseling Annual influenza vaccination; give pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23/Pneumovax) and PCV13/Prevnar); administer 12 months apart Table 8.1 Treatment of COPD: GOLD Guidelines (2017) Patient Group (Category) Recommendations Category A (GOLD 1-2) Minimally symptomatic COPD (low risk of exacerbation) or in combination with short-acting anticholinergic (more effective). Category B (GOLD 1-2) More symptomatic (low risk of exacerbation) Long-acting B2 (LAMA). May SABA for rescue PRN. Category C (GOLD 3-4) Minimally symptomatic (but high risk of exacerbation) LAMA is first line. If poor control, use combination LABA and LAMA. Alternative is LABA with inhaled glucocorticoid, methylxanthines (theophylline). Category D (GOLD 3-4) High risk High-risk; refer to pulmonologist. COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; GOLD, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; PRN, as needed. Source: 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) (2017). Pulmonary hygiene (postural drainage, etc.) or pulmonary rehabilitation Treat lung infections aggressively Management of Stable COPD Once COPD has been diagnosed, effective management should be based on an individualized assessment of current symptoms and future risks. Reduce symptoms Relieve symptoms: Improve exercise tolerance Improve health status and prevent disease progression, prevent and treat exacerbations, and reduce mortality Nonpharmacological Treatment 244199 Nonpharmacological management of COPD should be in accordance with the individualized assessment of symptoms and exacerbation risk: Smoking cessation (can include pharmacological treatment) Physical activity Influenza vaccination Pneumococcal vaccination Pulmonary rehabilitation Pharmacological Treatment Treatment Tips For all COPD patients (or category A patients), prescribe a SABA to be used \"as needed\" for dypsnea; it can be used alone or combined with a short-acting anticholinergic or a LAMA If patient has poor symptom relief and is at low risk of exacerbation (category B), regular use of a LABA (with short-acting anticholinergic, as needed) or regular use of a LAMA (with a SABA as needed) are acceptable. GOLD categories and treatment options are listed in Table 8.1 (Ferguson & Make, 2017). Bronchodilators: Short-acting Combined use of SABAs or LABAs and short-acting anticholinergics or LAMAs may be considered if symptoms are not improved with single agents Inhaled bronchodilators are preferred over oral bronchodilators Treatment with theophylline is not recommended Corticosteroids and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors Long-term therapy with ICS plus LABA is recommended for patients with severe airflow limitation (GOLD 3-4 category) with frequent exacerbations; refer to specialist Long-term monotherapy with oral corticosteroids is not recommended The phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast (Daliresp) is used for severe COPD. This may increase the risk of suicide. Could be multiple serious drug interactions (dexamethasone, carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John's wort, others). Management of Exacerbations Patients with characteristics of a moderate to severe exacerbation should be hospitalized, as they are at higher risk of death. An exacerbation of COPD is defined as an acute event characterized by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variations and leads to a change in medication. The most common cause appears to be respiratory tract infections (viral or bacterial). Chest radiographs are useful in excluding alternative diagnoses. 245200 An EKG may aid in the diagnosis of coexisting cardiac problems. Spirometry tests are not recommended during an exacerbation because they can be difficult to perform and measurements are not accurate enough. At higher risk for Haemophilus influenzae pneumonia, suspect secondary bacterial infection if acute onset of fever, purulent sputum, increased wheezing, and dyspnea. Treatment options: Bactrim DS, doxycycline, or Ceftin BID for severe infection, Augmentin or respiratory quinolones (Avelox, Levaquin) for 3 to 7 days; Medrol Dose Pack PRN. Health care providers should strongly enforce stringent measures against active cigarette smoking. Patients hospitalized because of exacerbations of COPD are at increased risk for deep vein thrombosis and PE; thromboprophylactic measures should be enhanced. Referral Moderate to severe COPD Severe exacerbations or rapid progression Age younger than 40 Weight loss EXAM TIPS First-line treatment for mild COPD (2017 guidelines) is either a SABA or a short- acting anticholinergic. If poor relief on single agent, add a second agent. If on SABA, add short-acting anticholinergic (Atrovent). If short-acting meds are not controlling symptoms, next step is to start patient on a LABA (or a LAMA). Continue using short-acting SABA as needed. See Table 8.1 for more details. If poor control, switch to an not use LABAs (salmeterol, formoterol) for rescue treatment. The only drugs for rescue treatment are in the SABA class. CLINICAL PEARLS Long-term use of oral corticosteroids increases the risk of pneumonia. When you are treating a COPD patient, pick an antibiotic that has coverage against Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae (gram negative). COMMON LUNG INFECTIONS ( TABLE 8.2 ) 246Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CAP) Bacterial lung infection results in inflammatory changes and damage to the lungs. The bacterium causing the most deaths in outpatients is Streptococcus pneumoniae (gram positive). Table 8.2 Common Lung Infections Disease Signs and Symptoms Acute bacterial pneumonia (CAP) Acute onset. High fever and chills. Productive cough and large amount of green to rust-colored sputum. Pleuritic chest pain with cough. No.1 Streptococcus Crackles; decreased breath sounds, dull CBC: Leukocytosis; elevated neutrophils. Band may CXR reveals lobar infiltrates. Gradual onset. Low-grade Headache, sore throat. Cough. Wheezing. Sometimes, rash. CXR: Interstitial to patchy infiltrates. Viral pneumonia breath. Scanty sputum breath sounds, rales. Acute bronchitis Paroxysms of dry and severe cough that interrupts sleep. Cough dry to productive. Light-colored sputum. Can last up to 4-6 weeks. No antibiotics. Treat symptoms. CAP, community-acquired pneumonia; blood count; CXR, chest virus. Organisms The most common pathogens are S. pneumoniae pneumococcus (gram positive), atypical bacteria Mycoplasma parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus) Haemophilus influenzae : More COPD fibrosis (CF): Number one bacteria is Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram negative) Classic Case An older adult presents with sudden onset of a high fever (>100.4\u00b0F) with chills that is accompanied by a productive cough with purulent sputum (rust-colored sputum seen with streptococcal pneumonia). The patient complains of pleuritic chest pain with coughing and dyspnea. Elderly patients may have atypical symptoms (afebrile or low-grade fever, no cough or mild cough, weakness, confusion, etc.). Objective Findings Auscultation: Rhonchi, crackles, and wheezing Percussion: Dullness over fremitus and egophony: Increased Abnormal whispered pectoriloquy (whispered words louder) Labs 247201 CXR is the gold standard (definitive test) for diagnosing CAP, not sputum culture; repeat within 6 weeks to document clearing CXR result shows lobar consolidation in classic bacterial pneumonia Order a posttreatment CXR to ensure clearing of infection Order CBC: Leukocytosis (>10.5 \u00d710 9 /L) with a possible \"shift to the left\" (increased band forms) Routine diagnostic tests (sputum culture and sensitivity [C&S]) to identify etiologic diagnosis are an option for outpatients with CAP Treatment Plan Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Thoracic Society Guidelines for Outpatient CAP * No comorbidity (previously healthy and no risk factors for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae infection): Macrolides Clarithromycin (Biaxin) BID \u00d7 7 days If patient had an antibiotic in previous 3 months or macrolide-resistance (>25%): Doxycycline 100 mg BID \u00d7 5 to 7 days Levofloxacin (Levaquin) 750 mg \u00d7 5 days Azithromycin amoxicillin or Augmentin With comorbidity (i.e., alcoholism; congestive heart failure [CHF]; chronic heart, lung, liver or kidney disease; antibiotics in previous 3 months; diabetes; splenectomy/asplenia; others) or high rates (>25%) of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae : Respiratory fluoroquinolone as one -drug therapy (duration 5-7 days) Moxifloxacin (Avelox) 400 mg PO once a day Levofloxacin (Levaquin) 750 mg daily (minimum dose 750 mg/d) Gemifloxacin (Factive) 400 mg PO once a day or plus macrolide (duration 7 days) Amoxicillin clavulanate (Augmentin) PO BID \u00d7 7 days or Cefdinir (Omnicef) 300 mg PO every 12 hours \u00d7 7 days plus azithromycin or clarithromycin Poor prognosis (refer for hospitalization): Elderly: Age 60 years or older, acute mental status changes, CHF Multiple lobar involvement Acute mental status change Alcoholics (aspiration pneumonia) Patient meets the \"CURB-65\" criterion for hospital admission. \"CURB-65\" is a tool to assess whether a patient needs hospitalization (each factor is worth 1 point). If score >1, patient should be hospitalized (Lim, et al., 2003). C ( c onfusion) U (blood u rea <90/60 mmHg) 65 years of age or older Prevention Influenza vaccine for all persons older than 50 years or if contact with persons who are at higher risk for death from pneumonia, health care workers, others Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax) if older than 65 years or with high- risk condition Pneumococcal Vaccine Recommended Pneumococcal Vaccines for All Adults 65 Years or Older Dose of PCV13 first, followed by a dose of PPSV23, at least 1 year later. For patients having received any doses of PPSV23, the dose of PCV13 should be given at least 1 year after receipt of the most recent PPSV23 dose. For patients having received a dose of PCV13 at a younger age, another dose of PCV13 is not recommended. But with PPSV23, another dose is recommended within 5 years (do not confuse them with each other). Healthy Patients Single dosages usually sufficient at age 65 years (lifetime) 60% to 70% effective Underlying Disease 50% effective Severely Immunocompromised Only 10% effective Recommended for: Persons aged 65 years or older Impaired immunity Splenectomy, asplenia, or diseased spleen Alcoholics/cirrhosis of the liver HIV infection Chronic renal failure Preexisting heart and lung disease Asthma, congenital heart disease, emphysema, others Blood disorders Sickle cell anemia 249203 Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma High-Risk Patients Repeat vaccine in 5 to 7 years (boosts antibodies): If first dose was given before age of 65 years Asplenia, chronic renal failure (give at 19 years of age if asplenia, chronic renal disease) Immunocompromised states Blood cancers: Lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, leukemia Atypical Pneumonia An infection of the lungs by atypical bacteria. More common in children and young adults. Seasonal outbreaks (summer/fall). Highly contagious. Also known as walking pneumonia . in areas with moisture such as air conditioners (hospitalize, more severe with higher mortality) Classic Case A young adult complains of several weeks of fatigue that is accompanied by severe paroxysmal coughing that is mostly nonproductive. Gradual onset of symptoms. Illness may have started with cold-like symptoms (sore throat, clear rhinitis, and low-grade fever). Patient continues to go to work/school despite symptoms; may have coworkers with same symptoms. Objective Findings Auscultation: Wheezing and diffused crackles/rales Nose: 20% May normal results Medications Macrolides: Doxycycline 100 mg BID \u00d7 7 to 10 days - Azithromycin (Z-Pack) \u00d7 5 days Antitussives Increase fluids and rest Acute Bronchitis 250204 Acute viral (sometimes bacterial) infection of the bronchi causes inflammatory changes in the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, which results in increased reactivity of the upper airways. Usually self-limited. Also known as tracheobronchitis . Caused by adenovirus, influenza (winter/spring), coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, others. Classic Case A young adult complains of the sudden new onset of a cough that is keeping him awake at night. Cough is mainly dry, but it may become productive later with small amounts of sputum. The patient may have frequent paroxysms of coughing; may have low-grade fever, mild wheezing, and/or chest pain with cough. Objective Findings Lungs: Ranges from clear to severe wheezing (prolonged expiratory phase), rhonchi Percussion: Resonant CXR: Normal Afebrile to low-grade fever Treatment Plan Treatment is symptomatic. Increase fluids and rest; stop smoking (if smoker) Administer dextromethorphan BID PRN For severe consider short-term oral steroid (Medrol Dose Pack) Complications Exacerbation of asthma (increased risk of status asthmaticus) Pneumonia from secondary bacterial infection (pneumococcus, mycoplasma, others) Pertussis Also known as whooping cough . Caused by Bordetella pertussis bacteria (gram negative). A coughing illness of at least 14 days' duration with one of the following findings: paroxysmal coughing, inspiratory whooping (or posttussive vomiting) without apparent cause. Illness can last from a few weeks to months. Unvaccinated children and adults with expired vaccinations are risk factors for pertusssis. Pertussis has three stages (catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent). Most infectious period is early in the disease (catarrhal stage) up to 21 days of cough (if not treated with appropriate antibiotic). Classic Case Suspect pertussis in previously \"healthy\" patient with a severe hacking cough of greater than 2 weeks' duration. Initial symptoms are low-grade fever and rhinorrhea with a mild cough (catarrhal stage). Cough becomes severe with inspiratory \"whooping\" sound. The patient may vomit afterward (paroxysmal stage). Cough becomes less severe and less frequent and finally resolves (convalescent stage). 251205 Labs Nasopharyngeal swab for culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Pertussis antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) CBC: Elevated white blood cells (up 80% lymphocytes in WBC differential); CXR should be negative; if positive, due to secondary bacterial infection Treatment Plan (Adolescents to Adults) First line: Macrolides Azithromycin (Z-Pack) 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily from days 2 to 5 Erythromycin 500 mg QID \u00d7 14 days Alternative: droplet precautions needed Antitussives, mucolytics, rest, and hydration; frequent small meals Tdap Booster Aged 11 to 18 years (and 18 years to adulthood): Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using Tdap (instead of Td). Complications Sinusitis, otitis media, pneumonia, fainting, rib fractures, and others EXAM TIPS Recognize presentation of bacterial pneumonia versus atypical pneumonia. The top two bacteria in CAP are: S. pneumoniae H. influenzae The top pneumonia: More likely to have H. influenzae bacteria. Know presentation and treatment of pertussis (whooping cough). Symptomatic treatment for acute bronchitis. Do not pick antibiotics as a treatment option for acute bronchitis. Outpatient CAP: Diagnosis is based on presentation, signs and symptoms, and CXR. Do not order phlegm for C&S; instead, order CXR. CBC is not required for diagnosis. CLINICAL PEARLS 252Depending on the stage of the disease and hydration status, the CXR result may be \"normal\" during the early phase of bacterial pneumonia (lobar pneumonia). Suspect pertussis in a \"healthy\" adult with no fever who has been coughing for more than 2 to 3 weeks, especially if previously treated with an antibiotic (that was not a macrolide) and is getting worse (rule out pneumonia first). Emphasize importance of adequate fluid intake (best mucolytic, thins out mucus). Lung cancer can present as recurrent pneumonia (due to mass blocking bronchioles). If S. pneumoniae macrolide resistance greater than 25%, do not use macrolide monotherapy. See CAP treatment guidelines notes. Common Cold (Viral Upper Respiratory Infection) Self-limiting infection (range of 4-10 days). Most contagious from days 2 to 3. More common in crowded areas and in small children. Transmission is by respiratory droplets and fomites. Highly contagious. Most cases occur in the winter months. Classic Case A patient has acute onset of fever, sore throat, frequent sneezing in early phase accompanied by nasal congestion, runny eyes, and rhinorrhea of clear mucus (coryza). The patient may complain of headache. Objective Findings Nasal turbinates: Swollen with clear mucus (may also have blocked tympanic membrane) Anterior pharynx: Reddened Cervical nodes: Smooth, mobile, and small or \"shotty\" nodes (0.5 cm size or less) in the submandibular and anterior cervical chain Lungs: Clear Treatment Plan Treat symptoms; increase fluids and rest; wash hands frequently Analgesics (acetaminophen) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory PRN Topical nasal decongestants (i.e., Afrin) can be used BID up to 3 days PRN only; do not use for more than 3 days due to risk of rebound nasal congestion (rhinitis Acute otitis media Tuberculosis (TB) 253206 An infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. Most common site of infection is the lungs (85%). Other sites include the kidneys, brain, lymph nodes, adrenals, and bone. Most contagious forms are pulmonary TB, pleural TB, and laryngeal TB cavitations and adenopathy and granulomas on the hila of the lungs. High-Risk Populations Immigrants (from high-prevalence countries), migrant farm workers, illegal drug users, homeless, inmates of jails, nursing home and adult living facility residents, HIV-infected, immunocompromised Latent TB Infection (LTBI) An intact immune system causes macrophages to sequester the bacteria in the lymph nodes (mediastinum) in the form of granulomas. Not infectious. Prior Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) Vaccine * May cause false-positive reaction to TB skin test TB blood tests are preferred method of TB testing for people who received the BCG vaccine TB tests: disseminated TB disease . Infects multiple organ systems. More common in younger children (<5 years) and the elderly. CXR will show classic \"milia seed\" pattern. Multidrug-Resistant TB (or Extensively Drug-Resistant TB) Bacteria resistant to at least two of the best anti-TB drugs, isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (these drugs are considered first-line drugs). Reactivated TB Infection or Active TB Disease (Infectious) Latent bacteria become reactivated due to depressed immune system. Most TB cases (90%) of active disease in the United States are reactivated infections. Classic Case An adult patient (from high-risk population) complains of fever, anorexia, fatigue, and night sweats along with a mild nonproductive cough (early phase). Aggressive infections (later sign) will have productive cough with blood-stained sputum (hemoptysis) along with weight loss (late sign). Treatment Plan Report TB to local health department for contact tracing ASAP. TB is a reportable disease. All active TB patients should be tested for HIV infection. Initial regimen for suspected TB before C&S results are available. Use four drugs: INH, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Duration is 2 months of intensive treatment 254207 and 18 weeks of continuation phase treatment. Narrow down number of medications after C&S results reveal most effective drugs. Several treatment regimens are available. Check TB website ( www.cdc.gov/TB ). Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) Mandatory for noncompliant patients. Success is dependent on medication compliance. How: Patient is observed by a nurse when he or she takes the medications. Mouth, cheek, and area under the tongue are checked to make sure the pill was swallowed adequately. Warning Ethambutol causes optic neuritis. Avoid if patient has abnormal vision (i.e., blindness, retinal vein occlusion, and so forth). Recent Mantoux Test (PPD) Converters and Chemoprophylaxis for Latent TB infection (LTBI) Recent PPD converter is defined as a person with history of negative PPD results who then converts to a positive PPD. Higher risk of active TB disease (up to 10%) within first 1 to 2 years after seroconversion. Assess for signs and symptoms of TB (cough, night sweats, weight loss) Order CXR (make sure has no upper lobe cavitations and mediastinal adenopathy) HIV-negative: Prescribe INH 300 mg/d for 9 months HIV-positive: Prescribe INH 300 mg/d for at least 12 months Check baseline liver function tests and monitor Generally, preventive treatment for LTBI is encouraged for those younger than 35 years of age. After age of 35 years, much higher risk of liver damage from INH chemoprophylaxis. Assess risk versus benefits and discuss with the patient. TB Skin Test (Mantoux Test) ( Table 8.3 ) Look for an induration (feels harder). The red color is not as important. If a PPD result is a bright-red color but is not indurated (skin feels soft), it is a negative result. Induration of 5 mm or greater: HIV (+) Recent contact with infectious TB cases CXR with fibrotic changes consistent with previous TB disease Any child who had close contact with an infected person or TB symptoms (before age of 5 years) Immunocompromised (i.e., organ transplant, bone marrow transplant, renal failure, patients on biologic drugs, others) Induration of 10 mm or greater: Recent immigrants (within the past 5 years) from high-prevalence countries (Latin America, Asia, Africa, India, Pacific islands) Child younger than 4 years of age or children/adolescents exposed to high-risk adult Intravenous drug user, health care worker, homeless Employees or residents from high-risk congregate settings (jails, nursing homes) 255208 Induration of 15 mm or greater: Persons with no known risk factors for TB Labs TB Skin Test (TST) Mantoux test / TST: Inject 0.1 mL of 5TU-PPD subdermally. Do not use the tine test (has not been used for many years). Blood Tests for TB QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-tube test or the T-SPOT TB test (also known as interferon- gamma release assays [ IGRAs ] ): Blood tests that measure gamma-interferon (from lymphocytes). IGRA test results: Available within 24 hours (only one visit required). If history of previous BCG vaccination, IGRA blood tests preferred. Sputum Tests for TB Early morning deep cough specimen; collect for 3 consecutive days Sputum nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is a rapid test (1-3 days) Table 8.3 TB Skin Test Results (Mantoux or the PPD) Size Test Results 5mm HIV (+) Recent contact with infectious TB cases CXR with fibrotic changes consistent with previous TB disease Any child who had close contact or has TB symptoms (before age of 5 years) Immunocompromised (i.e., organ transplant, bone marrow transplant, renal failure, patients on biologic drugs, others) 10mm Recent immigrants (within past 5 years) from high-prevalence countries (Latin America, Asia, Africa, India, Pacific islands) Child younger than 4 years of age or children/adolescents exposed to high-risk adult Intravenous drug user, health care worker, homeless Employees or residents from high-risk congregate settings (jails, nursing homes) 15mm Persons with no risk factors for TB CXR, chest x-ray; PPD, purified protein derivative; TB, tuberculosis. Sputum for C&S is gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary TB infection; can take <8 weeks to grow Acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear: Positive AFB is not diagnostic, but it suggestive of TB infection Order sputum for NAAT, C&S, and smear if suspect active TB infection Booster Phenomenon (LTBI) A person with LTBI can have a false negative reaction to the tuberculin skin test (TST) or the PPD if they have not been tested for many years. Two-step tuberculin skin testing is recommended by the CDC. 256209 Explanation When the TST/PPD is done the first time, there is no reaction (false negative). The first TB skin test \"jogs the memory\" of the immune system. If PPD repeated (1-3 weeks later), a positive reaction (boosted reaction) means that the patient has latent TB infection. Follow up with chest x-ray and inquire about signs/symptoms of TB infection. Offer LTBI prophylaxis. If the second PPD is negative, it means the person probably does not have a TB infection (CDC, 2014). EXAM TIPS A PPD result may be listed as 9.5 mm. If the patient falls under the 10-mm group, then it is negative (by definition) unless the patient has the signs/symptoms and/or CXR findings suggestive of TB. Memorize the criteria for the 5-mm and 10-mm results. You may be asked to identify a photograph of a CXR (radiography) of a patient with pulmonary TB or bacterial pneumonia (usually right middle-lobe pneumonia). An example of a TB chest film photograph appears in Figure 8.1 at the end of this chapter. Memorize the appearance of a posterior-anterior CXR of a person with healed pulmonary TB. The classic findings are pulmonary nodules and/or cavitations (round black holes) on the upper lobes with or without fibrotic changes (scars). With right middle-lobe pneumonia, look for consolidation (white-colored area) on the right middle lobe, which is located at about the same level as the right breast on the front of the chest. CLINICAL PEARLS The QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-tube and the T-SPOT TB tests are available at public health clinics. They only require one visit for the patient to be tested (one vial of blood). Never treat TB with fewer than three drugs. According to the CDC, on the average, about 10 contacts are listed for each index person with infectious TB. Persons with HIV infection with CD4 fewer than 500 or patients who are taking tumor necrosis factor antagonists (or biologics) are at very high risk for active TB disease after initial exposure (primary TB). The tuberculin skin test is considered both valid and safe to use throughout pregnancy. Younger children are more likely than older children to develop life-threatening forms of TB disease. 257210 Asthma Reversible airway obstruction caused by chronic inflammation of the bronchial tree. Results in increased airway responsiveness to stimuli (internal or external). Genetic predisposition with positive family history of allergies, eczema, and allergic rhinitis (atopy or atopic history). Exacerbations can be life-threatening (status asthmaticus). Rule out allergic asthma (refer allergy testing), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), rhinitis, sinusitis, stress. Treatment Goals (All Asthmatics) Can perform usual \"normal\" activities with no limitations (can attend school full time, play \"normally,\" go to work full time, no job absence due to asthmatic symptoms) Minimal to no exacerbations (daytime and nighttime) Minimal use of rescue medicine (<2 days a week albuterol use) Avoid emergency department (ED) visits/hospitalization Maintain near normal pulmonary function (reduce permanent lung damage) Classic Case A young-adult patient with asthma complains of worsening symptoms after a recent bout of a viral upper respiratory infection (URI). The patient is using her albuterol inhaler more than normal (about three times/day or more) to treat the symptoms; complains of shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness that is sometimes accompanied by a dry cough in the night and early morning (e.g., 3 a.m.) that awakens her from sleep. Objective Findings Lungs: Wheezing with prolonged expiratory phase. As asthma worsens, the wheezing occurs during both inspiration and expiration. With severe bronchoconstriction, breath sounds are faint or inaudible. Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, rapid pulse, is seen. Trigger Factors for Asthma Viral URIs, airborne allergens Airborne allergens: Dust mites, mold, cockroaches Food allergies: Sulfites, red and yellow dye, seafood Cold air or cold weather and fumes from chemicals or smoke Emotional stress and exercise (exercise-induced asthma) GERD (reflux of acidic gastric contents irritates airways) Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or NSAIDs (patients with nasal polyps are more sensitive to ASA and NSAIDs) Treatment Plan Nebulizer treatments: Give up to three treatments every 20 minutes as needed. Short course of oral corticosteroids may be needed for exacerbations. If low-dose ICSs, add LABAs (or increase dose to medium-dose ICSs only). Asthma Medications \"Rescue\" Medicine 258211 Only one used for PRN Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA): Two inhalations every 4 to 6 hours PRN; less likely to cause cardiac stimulation (fewer palpitations, less tachycardia) Quick onset (15-30 min) and lasts about 4 to 6 hours Used for quick relief (of wheezing) but does not treat underlying inflammation With nebulizer, give up to three treatments every 20 minutes as needed; short course of oral corticosteroids may be needed for exacerbations (Medrol Dose Pack) Long-Term Control Medications for Asthma ( Table 8.4 ) ICSs alone or with LABAs must be taken every day to be effective. LABAs are not rescue drugs. Must be taken BID. LABAs (used alone) increase the risk of death from asthma. Combination of LABA and ICS is safer. as an adjunct drug. Acts as a bronchodilator. Monitor levels to reduce risk of toxicity. The drug has multiple drug interactions such as the following: Macrolides, quinolones Normal is 12 to 15 mg/dL Spacers or Chambers Use of a \"spacer\" or \"chamber\" (AeroChamber) is encouraged. It will increase delivery of the aerosolized drug to the lungs and minimize oral thrush (for inhaled steroids). Table 8.4 Asthma: Long-Term Control Medications Drug Class Brand Name Side Effects/Adverse Effects Inhaled corticosteroids Triamcinolone (Azmacort) BID Budesonide (Pulmicort) thrush after BID Formoterol BID Warn patients of increased risk of asthma deaths; not to be used as rescue drug Combination of LABA with corticosteroid Salmeterol + daily effects (agitation, aggression, depression, others) Zileuton (Silo) daily Monitor liver function tests United States; cromolyn for nebulization still available Methylxanthines Theophylline (not used often) daily Sympathomimetic. Avoid with seizures, hypertension, stroke Starting dose 300 mg/day BID Several drug interactions Anti-immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE) Omalizumab (Xolair) Anaphylaxis can occur with first dose or after long-term use. Be equipped and prepared to treat anaphylaxis when starting this drug BID, twice a times a day. Asthma Classification, Stepwise Approach, and Treatment Guidelines (12 Years or Older) * Step 1 Intermittent asthma (FEV1 >80% predicted) Daytime symptoms less than 2 days/week; nighttime awakenings less than two per month SABA: Albuterol (Ventolin) metered-dose inhaler as needed Step 2 Mild persistent asthma (FEV1 >80% predicted). Daytime symptoms more than 2 days/week but not daily. Nighttime awakenings three to four per month. Albuterol (Ventolin) metered-dose leukotriene receptor Moderate asthma (FEV1 60%-80% of predicted daily symptoms): Nighttime awakenings more than one per week (but not nightly) Albuterol metered dose inhaler as needed Plus Preferred metered dose formoterol steps 3 to treatment is medium-dose ICS plus LTRA (montelukast, zafirlukast), theophylline, or zileuton Note : Steps 5 and 6 are not discussed (not needed for exam) Lab Monitoring Theophylline requires serum concentration monitoring Zileuton (Zyflo); must monitor liver function Patient Education Review inhaler technique (use spacer if patient has problems) Teach about rescue medications and long-term controller medications Develop a written asthma action plan; partner with patient and family Control and limit exposure to allergens if allergic asthma; consider immunotherapy with allergist Teach how to use spirometer; recognize worsening Exercise-Induced Asthma (Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm) Premedicate 10 to 15 minutes before the activity with two puffs of a SABA (albuterol/Ventolin, levalbuterol/Xopenex, pirbuterol/Maxair). Effect will last up to 4 hours. SUMMARY: ASTHMA TREATMENT Every asthma patient should be on an SABA (albuterol) PRN. Next step is ICS (preferred drug). Dose depends on asthma severity. If ICS is not enough, add an LABA (use combination medications Advair, Symbicort) or increased ICS dose (low to medium dose). Alternatives: Use leukotriene inhibitors, sustained-release theophylline, or mast cell stabilizer. Asthmatic Exacerbation Respiratory distress: Tachypnea, using accessory muscles (intercostals, abdominal) to breathe, talks in brief/fragmented sentences, severe diaphoresis, fatigue, agitation. Lungs: Minimal to no breath sounds audible during lung auscultation. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) less than nebulizer treatment: Albuterol or levalbuterol/saline solution by nebulizer. May repeat every 20 minutes (for three doses). If unable to use inhaled bronchodilators, give epinephrine IM. After nebulizer treatment(s): Listen for breath sounds. If inspiratory and expiratory wheezing is present, this is a good sign (signals opening up of airways). If there is a lack of breath sounds or wheezing after a nebulizer treatment, this is a bad sign (patient is not responding). Call 911. Discharge: For moderate to severe exacerbations: Medrol Dose Pack or prednisone tabs 40 mg/day \u00d7 4 days (no weaning necessary if 4 days or less and not steroid dependent). Continue medications and increase dose (or add another controller drug). Refer to ED (call 911): If poor to no response to nebulizer treatment (PEF <40% of expected), call 911. If no response to nebulizer treatment, impending respiratory arrest: Give Epi-Pen stat . Call 911. Peak Expiratory Flow Rate: PEFR or PEF Measures effectiveness of treatment, worsening symptoms, and exacerbations. During expiration, patient is instructed to blow hard using the spirometer (three times). The highest value is recorded (personal best). PEF is based on height (H), age (A), and gender (G), or HAG Mnemonic: HAG (height, age, gender) Spirometer Parameters Green Zone: 80% to 100% of expected volume Maintain or reduce medications. Yellow Zone: 50% to 80% of expected volume Maintenance therapy needs to be increased or patient is having an acute exacerbation. Red Zone: Below 50% of expected If after treatment patient's PEFR is still 50% below expected value, call 911. If in respiratory distress, give epinephrine injection. Call 911. CHEST RADIOGRAPH (CXR) INTERPRETATION You may see one CXR film on the exam. Here are some basics. \"X-rays\" are radiation (gamma rays) that pass through the human body and hit a metal target (the film). Depending on the type of tissue, they are absorbed differently. Posterior-anterior (PA) view is when the x-ray goes through the back. Anterior-posterior (AP) view is when the x-ray goes through the front of the chest. Lateral view is the view from the side of the chest. 262214 Appearance Air: Appears as black color (low density so less absorption) over lung field Bones: Appears as white Metals: Bright white (high absorption) Tissue: Different grayish shades (medium Fluid: Grayish to whitish visible: Trachea, bronchus, aorta, heart, lungs, pulmonary arteries, diaphragm, gastric bubble, ribs Abnormal Conditions Emphysema: Black color in the hilum (above the clavicles), a lot of black color in hyperinflated lungs, blunted costovertebral angle white areas on a or lobes of lung (consolidation) from purulent fluid TB: Upper lobe with cavitation (black round holes), fibrosis (scarring), and pulmonary infiltrates (fluid) in active Figure 8.1 ) Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)/cardiomyopathy: Heart occupies more than 50% of the chest diameter; it is enlarged Figure 8.1 Chest radiograph: Tuberculosis.

Memorize an asthma stage because you may get \"numbers\" and have to figure out the asthma severity of a patient. Suggest memorizing Step 3 (i.e., FEV1 of 60%-80%, etc.). If FEV1 is greater than 80%, it is either intermittent or mild persistent asthma. Check night awakenings. If they occur less than two times per month, it is intermittent asthma. If patient on low-dose ICS and has poor control (Step 2), add cromolyn or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs; montelukast, zafirlukast). If Step 3, should be on low-dose ICS plus LABA (i.e., Advair). Memorize factors needed to figure out PEF (use HAG mnemonic). Do not confuse asthma \"rescue\" drugs with \"long-term controller\" drugs. Remember that all asthmatics need an SABA (i.e., albuterol). Chronic use of high-dose inhaled steroids can cause osteoporosis, growth failure in children, glaucoma, cataracts, immune suppression, hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal suppression, and other effects. Recognize respiratory failure. Severe respiratory distress: Tachypnea, disappearance of or lack of wheezing, accessory muscle use, diaphoresis, and exhaustion. During a severe asthmatic exacerbation, it is hard to hear breath sounds. After SABA treatment, expect to hear inspiratory and expiratory wheezing. First-line treatment for severe asthmatic exacerbation or respiratory distress is an adrenaline injection. CLINICAL PEARLS If you suspect that the patient has allergic asthma, check serum immunoglobulin G allergy panels (mold allergy, grass allergy panels, others). Refer to allergist for scratch testing and treatment. Consider supplementing with calcium with vitamin D 1,200 mg tabs QD for menopausal women and other high-risk patients (for osteoporosis) such as males who are on medium- to high-dose inhaled steroids long term. Consider bone density testing (in males or females) who are on chronic steroids to rule out osteopenia or osteoporosis Annual eye exams if on long-term steroids since higher risk of cataracts and glaucoma. Exercise-induced bronchospasm is a marker for inadequate asthma control. __________ * Adapted from Mandell et al.

Complains of weakness, feels like \"passing out,\" hand tremors, and anxiety. Difficulty concentrating. More common in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM; only 5%-10% of DM is type 1, average of two episodes per week). If severe hypoglycemia is uncorrected, it will progress to coma. Nondiabetic hypoglycemia is rare and is either reactive (diet related) or fasting (disease related). For diabetic individuals, the American Diabetes Association defines level 1 hypoglycemia (glucose alert) as fasting blood sugar (FBS) 70 mg/dl or less. Level 2 hypoglycemia is blood glucose of 54 ml/dl or less. A blood glucose of this level is sufficiently low to indicate serious, clinically important hypoglycemia. Symptoms of hypoglycemia can range from difficulty concentrating, weakness, and \"hand tremors\" to anxiety and irritability. Left uncorrected severe hypoglycemia can lead to coma or death. Type 1 DM School-aged child with recent onset of persistent thirst (polydipsia) with frequent urination (polyuria) and weight loss. Feeling of hunger even though eating increased amount of food; weight loss. May be accompanied by blurred vision (osmotic effect on the lens). Breath has a \"fruity\" odor. Large amount of ketones in urine. Children may present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA); with neurological symptoms, such as drowsiness and lethargy, which can progress to coma. May report a recent viral-like illness before the onset of symptoms. Diagnosis peaks from ages 4 to 6 years and again from ages 10 to 14 years. Thyroid Cancer 265218 A single thyroid nodule, usually located on the upper half of one lobe in a patient, which may be accompanied by enlarged cervical lymph node lump, swelling, or pain. May complain of hoarseness and problems with swallowing (dysphagia, dyspnea, or cough). Higher incidence in the Asian race. Radiation therapy during childhood for certain cancers (Wilms' tumor, lymphoma, neuroblastoma) and/or a low-iodine diet increases risk. Higher prevalence in women (3:1). Highest incidence from age 20 to 55 years. Positive family history of thyroid cancer. Metastasis is by lymph route. Pheochromocytoma A pheochromocytoma is a rare hormone-releasing adrenal tumor. It generally occurs in ages 20 to 50, but can be at any age. Random episodes of headache (can be mild to severe), diaphoresis, and tachycardia accompanied by hypertension. Episodes resolve spontaneously. In between attacks, patient's vital signs are normal. Triggers include physical exertion, anxiety, stress, surgery, anesthesia, changes in body position, or labor and delivery. Foods high in tyramine (some cheeses, beers, wines, chocolates, dried or smoked meats), as well as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and stimulant drugs are other triggers. Hyperprolactinemia Can be a sign of a pituitary adenoma. Slow onset. Women may present with amenorrhea. Galactorrhea in both males and females. Serum prolactin is elevated. When tumor is large enough to cause a mass effect, the patient will complain of headaches and vision changes. NORMAL FINDINGS The endocrine system works as a \"negative feedback\" system. If a low level of \"active\" hormone occurs, it stimulates production. Inversely, high levels of hormones stop production. The hypothalamus stimulates the anterior pituitary gland into [TSH]). These \"stimulating hormones\" tell the target organs (ovaries, thyroid, etc.) to produce \"active\" hormones (estrogen, thyroid hormone, etc.). High levels of these \"active\" hormones work in reverse. The hypothalamus directs the anterior pituitary into stopping production of the stimulating hormones (TSH, LH, FSH, etc). ENDOCRINE GLANDS ( FIGURE 9.1 ) interact to form the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Hypothalamus 266219 Coordinates the nervous and endocrine system by sending signals via the pituitary gland. The gland interacts to form the HPA axis. Produces neurohormones that stimulate or stop production of pituitary hormones. Pituitary Gland Located at the sella turcica (base of the brain). Stimulated by the hypothalamus into producing the \"stimulating hormones\" such as FSH, LH, TSH, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain (sella turcica). It has two lobes (anterior and posterior). It produces hormones that directly regulate the target organs (ovary, testes, thyroid, adrenals, etc.). FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) Stimulates the ovaries enabling growth of follicles (or eggs) Production of estrogen LH (luteinizing hormone) Stimulates the ovaries to ovulate Production of progesterone (by corpus luteum) 267 In males, LH stimulates the testicles (Leydig produce (T4) the body ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) Stimulates the adrenal glands (two portions (cortisol) and milk production Melanocyte-stimulating hormone Production of melatonin in response to UV light; highest levels at night between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. Posterior Pituitary Gland Secretes antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) and oxytocin, which are made by the hypothalamus but stored and secreted by the posterior pituitary. Thyroid Gland A butterfly-shaped organ (two lobes) located below the prominence of the thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple). It is 2 inches long, and the lobes are connected by the isthmus. Uses iodine to produce T3 and T4. Parathyroid Glands Located behind the thyroid glands (two glands behind each lobe). Produces parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is responsible for the calcium balance of the body by regulating the calcium loss or gain from the bones, kidneys, and GI tract (calcium absorption). Pineal Gland Pea-sized gland located inside the brain that Melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Darkness stimulates melatonin production and light suppresses it. DISEASE REVIEW Primary Hyperthyroidism (Thyrotoxicosis) The classic finding is a very low (or undetectable) TSH with elevations in both serum free T4 and T3 levels. The most common cause for hyperthyroidism (70%-80%) in the United States is a chronic autoimmune disorder called Graves' disease . 268220 Graves' Disease Graves' disease accounts for 60% to 80% of all types of hyperthyroidism. An autoimmune disorder causing hyperfunction and production of excess thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). Higher incidence in women (7:1 ratio). These women are also at higher risk for other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and pernicious anemia (PA) and for osteopenia/osteoporosis due to increased metabolism. Classic Case Middle-aged woman loses a large amount of weight rapidly with anxiety and insomnia. Cardiac symptoms (due to overstimulation) are palpitations, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or premature atrial contractions. Warm and moist skin with increased perspiration. May present with ophthalmopathy and lid lag (Graves' ophthalmopathy). More frequent bowel movements (looser stools). Amenorrhea and heat intolerance. Enlarged thyroid (goiter) and/or thyroid nodules present. May be accompanied by pretibial myxedema (thickening of the skin usually located in the shins giving an orange-peel appearance). Objective Findings Thyroid : Diffusely enlarged gland (goiter), toxic adenoma, or multinodular goiter. May be tender to palpation or asymptomatic Extremities : Fine tremors on both hands, sweaty palms, pretibial myxedema Eyes: Lid lag. Exophthalmos in one or both eyes Cardiac: Tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy Integumentary : Fine hair, warm skin Neurological : Brisk deep tendon reflexes Labs Look for very low TSH (<0.5 mU/L) with elevated serum free T4 and T3. Graves' disease, will have positive thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb), which is also known as the thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) . The thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO) is positive with Graves' disease as well as in Hashimoto's disease. Workup as follows: Check TSH. If low, order thyroid panel. Look for very low TSH (<0.5 mU/L) with elevated serum free T4 and elevated T3. (In some patients with very low TSH, only either the serum T4 or the serum T3 will be elevated.) Next step is to order antibody tests to confirm whether Graves' disease is present (TRAb and TPO or TSI). If thyroid has a single palpable mass/nodule, order thyroid ultrasound. Refer to endocrinologist for management. Imaging studies: Thyroid ultrasound, 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) shows diffuse uptake (goiter). If solitary toxic nodule, shows warm or \"hot\" nodule or \"cold\" nodule. Absolute contraindications for and breastfeeding. Medications (Thionamides) Propylthiouracil (PTU): Shrinks thyroid gland/decreases gland/decreases hormone production Side effects: rash, granulocytopenia/aplastic anemia, platelets), hepatic necrosis (monitor CBC, LFTs) Adjunctive Treatment Given before thyroid under control to alleviate the symptoms of hyperstimulation (i.e., anxiety, tachycardia, palpitations). Beta-blockers are effective (i.e., propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol). Radioactive Iodine Contraindicated during pregnancy or lactation. Permanent destruction of thyroid gland results in hypothyroidism for life (needs thyroid supplementation for life). Pregnancy: (hyperthyroidism): PTU is preferred treatment, if needed. High-risk pregnancy, refer to obstetrician. PTU is preferred treatment for moderate to severe hyperthyroidism (can cause liver failure). Complications Thyroid storm (thyrotoxicosis): During the thyroid storm, an individual's heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature can soar to dangerously high levels. Acute worsening of symptoms due to stress or infection. Look for decreased level of consciousness (LOC), fever, abdominal pain. Life-threatening. Immediate hospitalization needed. Thyroid Gland Tests Thyroid gland ultrasound: to versus cystic masses Fine-needle biopsy: Used as a diagnostic test for thyroid cancer Thyroid scan (24-hour thyroid scan with RAIU): Shows metabolic activity of thyroid gland Cold spot: Not metabolically active (more worrisome; rule out thyroid cancer); fine needle biopsy Metabolically active nodule with homogeneous uptake; usually benign; helpful in diagnosing recurrent disease Laboratory Findings of Thyroid Disease TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone or thyrotropin): Normal range: TSH of 0.5 to 5.0 mU/L (third-generation test) has normal range. TSH is used for both screening and monitoring response to treatment. - Recheck TSH every 6 to 8 weeks. Dose of levothyroxine (Synthroid) is based on the TSH level. Goal is a TSH less than 5.0 mU/L. - When TSH is stable, recheck every 6 to 12 months. Treatment Alternative/natural medication (controversial): Armour thyroid is produced from 270222 desiccated (dried) pig thyroid glands (contains both T3 and T4). Drug-induced thyroid disease: Lithium, amiodarone, high doses of iodine, interferon- alfa, dopamine. Monitor TSH. Primary Hypothyroidism The classic lab finding for hypothyroidism is a high TSH with low free T4 levels (do not confuse with total T4). Diagnosis is based on the lab findings. Some of the most common causes are Hashimoto's thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis, and thyroid ablation with radioactive iodine (to treat hyperthyroidism). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States. Hashimoto's Thyroiditis A chronic autoimmune disorder of the thyroid gland. There is generally no pain with this thyroid swelling. The body produces destructive antibodies (TPO) against the thyroid gland that gradually destroys it. Almost all patients (90%) with Hashimoto's thyroiditis have elevated TPOs. Most patients have developed a goiter. More common in women with ratio of 8:1 (women:men). Classic Case A middle-aged-to-older woman who is overweight complains of fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and menstrual abnormalities. May have alopecia on the outer one third on both eyebrows. Serum cholesterol is elevated. May have a history of another autoimmune disorder (RA, PA, etc.). Severe hypothyroidism (myxedema) is an endocrine emergency that is now rare (mortality 30%-40%). Patients presents with cognitive symptoms such as slowed thinking, poor short-term memory, depression (or dementia), hypotension, and hypothermia. Labs 9.1 ) (TSH mU/L). elevated, again with free T4 (free thyroxine). If TSH is high and serum free T4 is low, diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Next step is to order TPOs to confirm Hashimoto's thyroiditis (most common cause of hypothyroidism). TPOs: If elevated, confirms Hashimoto's thyroiditis Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Subclinical (Nonpregnant Adults) If TSH 5 mU/L (elevated), but serum free T4 is within normal range, diagnosis is subclinical hypothyroidism (asymptomatic to mild symptoms of hypothyroidism). Decision to treat with Synthroid should be individualized. Some choose not to treat, but recheck same labs again in 12 months. Treatment Plan Starting dose of levothyroxine (Synthroid) ranges from 25 to 50 mcg/day. 271223 Start with lowest dose (Synthroid 12.5 mcg) for elderly or patients with history of heart disease (watch for angina, acute myocardial infarction [MI], atrial fibrillation). Increase Synthroid TSH is normalized (<5.0 mU/L). Recheck TSH every 6 weeks until TSH is normalized (TSH <5.0 mU/L). When under control, check TSH every 12 months. Advise patient to report if palpitations, nervousness, or tremors because this means that Synthroid dose is too high (decrease dose until symptoms are gone and TSH in normal range). EXAM TIPS Learn to diagnose subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH elevated with normal free (TSH for hypothyroidism (order TSH, free T4, etc.). Start elderly patients at low dose of Synthroid (12.5-25 mcg/d) and gradually increase to avoid adverse cardiac effects from overstimulation (palpitations, angina, MI). Patient with normal free T4 elevated TSH\u2014do not treat (subclinical hypothyroidism). Recheck TSH in about 6 months. Check TSH every 6 to 8 weeks (do not order earlier than 6 weeks) to monitor treatment response. If TSH is 0.5 to 5.0 mU/L, it is within normal limits and the patient is at the right dose (Synthroid). Radioactive iodine treatment results in hypothyroidism for life. Supplement with thyroid hormone (i.e., Synthroid) for life. If TSH is suppressed (e.g., TSH 0.1 mU/L), workup needed for hyperthyroidism. Chronic amenorrhea and hypermetabolism result in osteoporosis. Supplement with calcium with vitamin D 1,200 mg; engage in weight-bearing exercises. CLINICAL PEARLS Many patients with subclinical hypothyroidism will eventually develop overt hypothyroidism. 272224 Advise patient to crush Synthroid tablets with teeth inside mouth before swallowing with water for better absorption. These tablets are synthetic T4 (levothyroxine). Alternative medicine practitioners are more likely to prescribe Armour thyroid tablets (desiccated thyroid glands from pigs), which contain natural T3 and T4 for hypothyroidism. All hyperthyroid patients should be referred to an endocrinologist as soon as possible. DIABETES MELLITUS A chronic metabolic disorder affecting the body's metabolism of carbohydrates and fat. The result is microvascular and macrovascular damage, neuropathy, and immune and neuropathy Macrovascular damage: Atherosclerosis, heart (coronary artery disease, MI) Target organs: Eyes, kidneys, heart/vascular system, peripheral nerves, especially in the feet; DM is the most common reason for chronic renal failure requiring dialysis and lower limb amputations in the United States Type 1 DM The massive destruction of B-cells in the islets of Langerhans results in an abrupt cessation of insulin production. If uncorrected, body fat will be used for fuel. Ketones, the metabolic product of fat breakdown, build up in the body until the result is diabetic ketotic acidosis (ketoacidosis) and coma. Most patients are juveniles; occasionally occurs in adults (maturity onset diabetes of the young [MODY]). The CDC reports 5% to 10% of U.S. cases. Type 2 DM Progressive decreased secretion of insulin (with peripheral insulin resistance) resulting in a chronic state of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Has strong genetic component. Type 2 DM represents 90% to 95% of U.S. cases. Obesity epidemic is increasing rates of type 2 DM in younger patients. Risk Factors for Type 2 DM (Screen These Patients) Overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] 25 or greater) Abdominal obesity; sedentary lifestyle Metabolic syndrome Hispanic, African American, Asian, Pacific Islander, or American Indian ancestry, or positive family history History of gestational diabetes or infant weighing greater than 9 lbs at birth Impaired fasting blood sugar/glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is considered at higher risk for type 2 DM (prediabetes) Metabolic Syndrome Presence of any three of the following four traits: 273 Obesity, abdominal obesity. Waist: - In men, greater than 40 inches/102 cm - In women, greater than 35 inches/88 cm Hypertension or BP of more than 130/85 mmHg Dyslipidemia: Triglycerides greater than 150 mg/dL, HDL less than 40 (males) or less than 50 (females) Hyperglycemia: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) greater than 100 mg/dL or type 2 DM Other names are insulin-resistance syndrome or syndrome X Affected people have higher risk of type 2 DM and cardiovascular disease Increased Risk of DM (Prediabetes) Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) between 5.7% and 6.4% or Fasting glucose of 100 to 125 mg/dL (impaired FPG) or 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 75 g load) of 140 to 199 mg/dL Diagnostic Criteria for DM A1C equal to or greater than 6.5% or FPG equal to or greater than 126 mg/dL (fasting is no caloric intake for at least 8 hours) or Symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia) plus random blood glucose equal to or greater than 200 mg/dL or Two-hour plasma glucose greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL during an OGTT with a 75-g glucose load Serum Blood Glucose Norms (Nondiabetic Adults; Table 9.2 ) FPG: 70 to 100 than 180 mg/dL Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C: <6.0%) Defined as the average blood glucose levels over previous 3 months; no fasting required; test measures excess glucose that attaches to the hemoglobin of the red blood cells If able to tolerate A1C goal of 6% (especially younger diabetics), continue with the same goal Less stringent goals are acceptable for some (frail elderly, history of severe hypoglycemia, extensive comorbidity, limited life expectancy) A1C goal of up to 8% is acceptable Labs Newly diagnosed diabetics: Check A1C every 3 months until blood glucose controlled or when changing therapy, then check twice a year (every 6 months) 274225 Lipid profile at least once a year with 9- to 12-hour fasting Table 9.2 Recommendations for Nonpregnant Adult Diabetics Test Goal Blood pressure <140/80 mmHg <100 mg/dL A1C <7% (exceptions 70 to 130 mg/dL Peak postprandial capillary plasma glucose (2 hours after meal) mg/dL LDL, low-density lipoprotein. Source: American or \"on spot\" urine for microalbuminuria at least once a year Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio better than microalbumin test (spot urine sample) for evaluating microalbumin (the earliest sign of diabetic renal disease) If positive, order 24-hour urine for protein and creatinine Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with tighter control of blood glucose/A1C may help renal disease Check electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, sodium), liver function panel, and TSH Treatment Plan Every visit: Check BP, feet, weight and BMI, blood sugar. Check feet: Check for vibration sense (128-Hz tuning fork): Place on bony prominence of the big toe (metatarsophalangeal [MTP] joint); if unable to sense vibration or asymmetry, patient has peripheral neuropathy Light and deep touch, numbness: Place at right angle on plantar surface, push into skin until it buckles slightly (monofilament tool) Check pedal pulses, ankle reflexes, and skin are examined for acanthosis nigricans, insulin injection or insertion sites, lipodystrophy Recommendations: Preventive Care CDC recommends adults older than 50 be given SHINGRIX in two doses, 2 to 6 months apart. Influenza immunization every year Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine: If vaccinated before 65 years of age, give one- time revaccination in 5 years; if age 65 years, give one dose of the vaccine only Prescribe aspirin 81 mg if high risk for MI, stroke (if younger than 30 years of age, not recommended) Ophthalmologist: Yearly dilated eye exam needed: If type 2: eye exam at diagnosis; if type 1 DM, first eye exam needed 5 years after diagnosis Podiatrist: Refer to once to twice a year, especially with older diabetics BP goal: Goal is 130/80 mmHg 275226 Dental/tooth care: Important (poor oral health associated with heart disease) Dietary and Nutrition Recommendations (or Macronutrients) Alcohol: Advise females not to exceed one drink per day and for males two drinks per day Monitor carbohydrate intake (i.e., carbohydrate counting) Saturated fat (animal fats, beef fat) intake should be less than 7% of total calories Reduce intake of trans fats (will lower LDL and increase HDL), such as most fried foods and \"junk foods\" Refer patient to a dietician at least once or more often if problems with diet Routine vitamin supplementation of antioxidants is not yet advised Hypoglycemia High risk: Level 1 hypoglycemia (glucose alert): FBS 70 mg/dL or less; level 2 hypoglycemia: blood glucose 54 mg/dL or less Look for: Sweaty palms, tiredness, dizziness, rapid pulse, strange behavior, confusion, and weakness; if patient on beta-blockers, the hypoglycemic response can be blunted or blocked Treatment Plan Glucose (15-20 g) is preferred treatment for conscious patients. Other options are 4 oz of orange juice, regular soft drink, hard candy. Recheck blood glucose 15 minutes after treatment. When blood glucose is normalized, eat a meal or snack afterward (complex carbohydrates, protein). Glucagon: Prescribe for patients at significant risk for severe hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as blood glucose less than 54 mg/dL. Illness and Surgery Do not stop taking antidiabetic medicine. Keep taking insulin or oral medications as scheduled unless fasting blood glucose (FBG) is lower than normal. Requires frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose. Eat small amounts of food every 3 to 4 hours to keep FBG as normal as possible. Contact health care provider if: Dehydrated, vomiting, or diarrhea for several hours, blood glucose is greater than 300 mg/dL, changes in LOC (feel sleepier than normal/cannot think clearly). Exercise Increases glucose utilization by the muscles. Patients may need to reduce their usual dose of medicine (or eat snacks before the activity and afterward to compensate). If patient does not compensate (reducing the dose of insulin, increasing caloric intake, snacking before and after), there is an increased risk of hypoglycemia within a few hours. Example: If patient exercises in the afternoon, high risk of hypoglycemia at night/bedtime if he or she does not compensate by eating snacks, eating more food at dinner, or lowering insulin dose. 276227 Snacks for Exercise Eat simple carbohydrates (candy, juices) before or during exercise. Eat complex carbohydrates (granola bars) after exercise (avoids postexercise hypoglycemia). Other Diabetic Issues Dawn Phenomenon This is a normal physiological event; a hormonal surge in all people causing an elevation in the FBG occurs daily, early in the morning between 4:00 and 8:00 a.m. Without normal insulin responses, diabetics experience rising FBG levels. Healthy people can make the insulin to combat this phenomenon. Somogyi Effect (Rebound Hyperglycemia) Severe nocturnal hypoglycemia stimulates counterregulatory hormones, such as glucagon, to be released from the liver. The high levels of glucagon in the systemic circulation result in high fasting blood glucose by 7:00 a.m. The condition is due to overtreatment with the evening and/or bedtime insulin (dose is too high). More common in people with type 1 DM. Diagnosis: Check blood glucose very early in the morning (3:00 a.m.) for 1 to 2 weeks. Treatment: Eat a snack before bedtime, or eliminate dinnertime intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) dose or lower the bedtime dose for both NPH and regular insulin. Diabetic Retinopathy Neovascularization (new growth of fragile arterioles in retina), microaneurysms (dot and blot hemorrhages due to neovascularization), cotton-wool spots or soft exudates (nerve fiber layer infarcts), and hard exudates. Patients with type 1 DM: Screen after age 10 years. Patients with type 2 diabetes: Refer to ophthalmologist shortly after diagnosis; then eye exam needed every 6 to 12 months. Diabetic Foot Care Patients with peripheral neuropathy should avoid excessive running or walking to minimize the risk of foot injury. Patients with type 2 diabetes: Refer to podiatrist at least once a year. Wear shoes that fit properly. Never go barefoot. Check feet daily, especially the soles of the feet (use mirror). Trim nails squarely (not rounded) to prevent ingrown toenails. Report redness, skin breakdown, or trauma to health care provider immediately (main cause of lower leg amputations in the United States). Charcot's Foot and Ankle (Neuropathic Arthropathy) Deformity of the foot that is caused by joint and bone dislocation and fractures due to neuropathy and loss of sensation to the foot and ankle. May affect only one foot or both feet. If severe, foot deformity includes collapse of midfoot arch (rocker bottom foot). 277228 Diabetic Medications Biguanides First line: Metformin (Glucophage): Decreases gluconeogenesis and decreases peripheral insulin resistance. Very rarely may cause hypoglycemia. Prescribe in addition to diet and exercise (lifestyle). Metformin is preferred for obese patients. According to the 2018 position statement and by the American Diabetes Association it is reported that metformin is neutral for weight change and has a potential for a modest weight loss. Metformin may cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as diarrhea and nausea. For decreased vitamin B 12 levels (7%), consider vitamin supplementation. Contraindications : Do not use if renal disease, hepatic disease acidosis, alcoholics, hypoxia. Labs : Monitor renal function (serum creatinine, GFR, UA) and LFTs. Increased <7.25): Occurs during hypoperfusion, renal insufficiency. IV contrast dye testing: Hold metformin on day of procedure and 48 hours after. Check baseline creatinine and recheck after procedure. If serum creatinine remains elevated after the procedure, do not restart metformin. Serum creatinine must be normalized before drug can be resumed. Sulfonylureas Stimulates the beta cells of the pancreas to secrete more insulin. First generation: Administer chlorpropamide (Diabinese) daily or BID. Long half-life (12 hours). Not commonly used because of high risk of severe hypoglycemia. Second generation: Administer glipizide (Glucotrol, Glucotrol XL) maximum dose dose of 20 mg/d, glimepiride (Amaryl) maximum dose of 8 mg/d Adverse Effects The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a special warning on increased risk of cardiovascular mortality based on studies of an older sulfonylurea (tolbutamide). Hypoglycemia (diaphoresis, pallor, sweating, tremor); increased risk of photosensitivity (use sunscreen) Blood dyscrasias (monitor CBC) Avoid if impaired hepatic or renal function (monitor LFTs, creatinine, UA) Causes weight gain (monitor weight and BMI) Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) Pioglitazone (Actos): Enhances insulin sensitivity in muscle tissue (decreases peripheral tissue resistance) and reduces hepatic glucagon production (gluconeogenesis). Take daily with meal at breakfast. Can be combined metformin, Black Box warning: DO NOT USE with NYHA class III and class IV heart disease, symptomatic heart failure (congestive heart failure [CHF]). Causes water retention and edema (aggravates or will precipitate heart failure [CHF]). Avoid if bladder cancer or history of bladder cancer (UA, urine cytology), active liver disease, type 1 DM, pregnancy. Causes weight gain (monitor weight and production and may reduce intestinal absorption of glucose Take with meals; lowers LDL Side effects are GI related, such as nausea, bloating, constipation, increased triglycerides Side effects are a common reason for noncompliance; start patient on a low dose and titrate up slowly Kidney and liver with postprandial hyperglycemia Weight-neutral; may cause hypoglycemia Rapid-acting with a very short half-life (<1 hour) Take before meals or up to 30 minutes after a meal Hold dose if skipping a meal Side effects are bloating, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, flatulence Diabetic Medications: Subcutaneous Route This is not an inclusive list. For specific information about types of insulin, see Table 9.3 . 279229 Rapid-Acting Insulin Humalog (insulin lispro) NPH Considered a \"basal (has no \"peaks\") Humulin N Lantus (insulin glargine), Levemir (insulin detemir) Give once a day at the same time Insulin Mixtures Humulin 70/30 (70% NPH insulin, 30% regular insulin) If mixing NPH and regular insulin, use the mixture immediately Rapid-acting insulin can be mixed with NPH, but it should be used 15 minutes before a meal Insulin Pumps Insulin pumps require intensive training; the insulin pumps are expensive. Can be used for both type 1 or type 2 diabetics. Patients should remove pump when swimming or showering. 280230 Other Medications for Diabetes Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitor Slows intestinal carbohydrate digestion and absorption; a nonsystemic oral drug Does not cause hypoglycemia; modest effect on A1C level GI side effects Stimulate GLP-1, causing an increase in insulin production and inhibits postprandial glucagon release (will decrease postprandial hyperglycemia); increases satiety Causes weight loss, suppress appetite, does not cause hypoglycemia May cause pancreatitis (monitor amylase, lipase), medullary thyroid tumors in animals, and C-cell hyperplasia Warning: Contraindicated if personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia (proximal nephron) and increases glucosuria Effective in all stages of type 2 DM; no hypoglycemia FDA warning: May lead to DKA; symptoms: difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion, and unusual fatigue or sleepiness Causes weight loss, hypotension (volume depletion) Renal signs and symptoms: Polyuria, increased creatinine; increase in UTIs and pyelonephritis concentrations Increase insulin secretion and decrease glucagon; no hypoglycemia FDA warning: May cause joint pain that can be severe and disabling (may occur on day 1 or years later) May cause angioedema/urticaria, acute pancreatitis Note Do not weight loss 281231 Route: Injectable; frequent dosing; requires patient training Causes hypoglycemia if used with insulin (decrease insulin dose) SOLVING AN INSULIN-RELATED QUESTION The nurse practitioner certification exams are based on the primary care model of care. In general, it is not necessary to memorize specific doses. Keep in mind some broad concepts such as the peak and duration of each type of insulin. For example: Rapid-acting insulin covers \"one meal at a time\" Regular insulin lasts \"from meal to meal\" NPH insulin \"from breakfast to dinner\" Lantus is \"once a day\" Case Scenario A patient with type 1 diabetes is on regular insulin and NPH insulin (not premixed, but separate) injected twice a day. The first dose is injected before breakfast and the second dose is injected at bedtime. The blood sugar results from the patient's diary (fasting, before lunch, dinner, and bedtime) show that the lunchtime values are higher than normal. Which insulin dose should be increased or decreased? In this case, the NPH component of the morning dose should be increased. Regular insulin peaks between breakfast and lunch (most of it is gone by lunchtime). In contrast, NPH insulin peaks between 6 and 14 hours. Therefore, it will cover the postprandial spike after lunch. CLINICAL INFORMATION Rapid-acting insulins (insulin lispro) are used mostly by type 1 diabetics before each meal. Intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) can be used once to twice a day. Summary of Prescribing Medications for Type 2 Diabetics Try lifestyle changes (weight loss) for 3 to 6 months if mild A1C elevation. In addition to lifestyle, metformin is first-line treatment for most type 2 diabetics. Start on metformin 500 mg daily (maximum dose is 2,000 mg/dL or 2 g). If metformin dose is at maximum (and blood sugar or A1C is still high), add a sulfonylurea (e.g., Glucotrol XL 20 mg/d). or If patient is on a sulfonylurea at the maximum dose (e.g., Glucotrol XL 40 mg/d) and blood sugar/A1C is still elevated, then add metformin. Choice of second or third agent are any of other drug classes used to treat type 2 DM. If on maximal metformin dose (2 g), other choices to add not combine insulins with meglitinides (severe hypoglycemia). If blood sugar or A1C is still elevated and patient is on both metformin and sulfonylurea, consider starting patient on a basal insulin (Lantus SC once a day). If patient refuses insulin, other options are thioglitazones (Actos), Byetta, others. Keep in mind the contraindications for each drug class. Antidiabetic Medications: Effect on Weight Causes weight loss: to dietician to learn about carbohydrate counting. The American Diabetes Association (2017) recommends including fat and protein counting. Lifestyle changes are first-line treatment. Weight loss improves metabolic control in type 2 diabetics. Eating more fiber and whole grains (brown rice, whole wheat) may help. Exercise increases cellular glucose uptake in the body. Type 2 diabetics not well controlled on multiple oral agents, diet, and lifestyle changes are good candidates for basal insulin therapy. DM: Possible Complications Eyes: Cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, blindness Cardiovascular: Hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, MI, hypertension Kidneys: Renal disease, renal failure Feet: Foot ulcers, skin infections, peripheral neuropathy, amputation Gynecological/genitourinary: Balanitis (candidal infection of the glans penis), candidal vaginitis Primary Prevention For individuals at high risk of type 2 DM: Encourage weight loss (7% of body weight) and regular physical activity (150 min/week). Increase dietary fiber and foods with whole grains. EXAM TIPS First-line medication for type 2 DM is metformin (Glucophage). If patient on metformin 500 mg daily and A1C is high (>7%), raise dose to metformin 500 mg BID. If A1C is still high (>7%) and on metformin 500 mg BID, increase dose to metformin 1,000 mg BID (or 1 g BID). If taking maximum dose of metformin (1 g BID), can use several drug classes with it such as a sulfonylurea like glipizide (Glucotrol XL) 5 mg PO daily (do not exceed glipizide 9 or higher, start on basal insulin. Or if on two oral drugs and A1C is 9 or higher, start on basal insulin. Photographs of fundi appear on the exam. Search for photographs online of diabetic retinopathy. Findings are cotton wool spots (soft exudates), neovascularization, microaneurysms with dot and blot hemorrhages. Learn what cotton wool spots (or soft exudates) look like. Hypertensive retinopathy findings are silver wire/copper wire arterioles, arteriovenous nicking. Hemoglobin A1C is the average blood glucose level in previous 3 months (12 weeks). Actos can cause water retention, which may precipitate CHF. Contraindicated if history of heart failure or NYHA class III or IV (moderate to severe heart failure). Tell patient to disconnect insulin pump if swimming, bathing, or showering. Certain sports (e.g., wrestling) require that an insulin pump be disconnected during activity. Microvascular complications of diabetes are retinopathy, nephropathy, or neuropathy. Macrovascular complications are coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, or stroke. Charcot's foot and ankle is more common in diabetics. Lid lag is a symptom of Graves' opthalmopathy (hyperthyroidism). Alopecia of outer one third of eyebrow and myxedema are symptoms of hypothyroidism. CLINICAL PEARLS People with subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism are at higher risk of bone (osteopenia/osteoporosis) and cardiac (atrial fibrillation) complications. New-onset atrial fibrillation, check TSH. Keep TSH between 1.0 and 4.0 mU/L as goal for thyroid hormone supplementation. Diabetics are at higher risk for cataracts and glaucoma. In morbidly obese patients, bariatric surgery can result in remission of type 2 diabetes. 284233 10 Gastrointestinal System Review DANGER SIGNALS Acute Appendicitis Patient who is a young adult complains of an acute onset of periumbilical pain that is steadily getting worse. Over a period of 12 to 24 hours, the pain starts to localize at McBurney's point. The patient has no appetite (anorexia). Classic exam findings include low-grade fever and right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain (McBurney's point) with rebound and guarding. The psoas and obturator signs are positive. When the appendix ruptures, clinical signs of acute abdomen occur, such as involuntary guarding, rebound, and a board-like abdomen. Acute Cholecystitis Overweight female patient complains of severe right upper quadrant (RUQ) or epigastric pain that occurs within 1 hour (or more) after eating a fatty meal. Pain may radiate to the right shoulder. Accompanied by nausea/vomiting and anorexia. If left untreated, may develop gangrene of the gallbladder (20%). May require hospitalization. Acute Diverticulitis Elderly patient with acute onset of high fever, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, and left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain. Risk factors for acute diverticulitis include increased age, constipation, low dietary fiber intake, obesity, lack of exercise, and frequent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Signs of acute abdomen are rebound, positive Rovsing's sign, and board-like abdomen. CBC will show leukocytosis with neutrophilia and shift to the left. The presence of band forms signals severe bacterial infection (bands are immature neutrophils). Complications include abscess, sepsis, ileus, small bowel be life- 285234 threatening. Acute Pancreatitis Adult patient complains of the acute onset of fever, nausea, and vomiting that is associated with rapid onset of abdominal pain that radiates to the midback (\"boring\") located in the epigastric region. Frequent causes include drugs (approximately 90% of cases of acute pancreatitis), biliary factors, and alcohol abuse. Abdominal exam reveals guarding and tenderness over the epigastric area or the upper abdomen. Positive Cullen's sign (blue discoloration around umbilicus) and Grey-Turner's sign (blue discoloration on the flanks). The patient may have an ileus, may show signs and symptoms of shock. Refer to ED. Clostridium difficile Colitis Severe watery diarrhea from 10 to 15 stools a day that is accompanied by lower abdominal pain with cramping and fever. Symptoms usually appear within 5 to 10 days after initiation of antibiotics. Antibiotics, such as clindamycin (Cleocin), fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and penicillins, have been implicated as more likely to cause C. difficile infection. Most cases occur in patients in hospitals as well as in those residing in nursing facilities. Colon Cancer Very gradual (years) with vague GI symptoms. Tumor may bleed intermittently and patient may have iron-deficiency anemia. Changes in bowel habits, stool, or bloody stool. Heme- positive stool, dark tarry stool, mass on abdominal palpation. Older patient (older than 50 years of age), especially with history of multiple polyps or inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Crohn's Disease (CD) Inflammatory bowel disease that may affect any part(s) of GI tract from mouth (canker sores), small to large intestine, rectum, and anus. If ileum involved, there is watery diarrhea without blood or mucus. If colon involved, there is bloody diarrhea with mucus. During relapses, fever, anorexia, weight loss, dehydration, fatigue with periumbilical to RLQ abdominal pain occur. Fistula formation and anal disease only occur with CD (not UC). May palpate tender abdominal mass. Remissions and relapses are common. Higher risk of toxic megacolon and colon cancer. Risk of development of lymphoma is also increased, especially for patients treated with azathioprine. More common in Ashkenazi Jews. Ulcerative Colitis Inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon/rectum. Bloody diarrhea with mucus (hematochezia) more common with UC than with CD. Severe \"squeezing\" cramping pain located on the left side of the abdomen with bloating and gas that is exacerbated by food. Relapses characterized by fever, anorexia, weight loss, and fatigue. Accompanied by 286235 arthralgias and arthritis (15%-40%) that affect large joints, sacrum, and ankylosing spondylitis. May have iron deficiency anemia or anemia of chronic disease. Disease has remissions and relapses. Increased risk of colon cancer. Risk of toxic megacolon. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome A gastrinoma located on the pancreas or the stomach; secretes gastrin, which stimulates high levels of acid production in the stomach. The end result is the development of multiple and severe ulcers in the stomach and duodenum. Complaints of epigastric to midabdominal pain. Stools may be a tarry color. Screening by serum fasting gastrin level. NORMAL FINDINGS Route of Food or Drink From the Mouth Esophagus stomach (hydrochloric acid, upper quadrant (RUQ): Liver, gallbladder, ascending colon, kidney (right), pancreas (small portion); right kidney is lower than the left because of displacement by the liver Left upper quadrant (LUQ): Stomach, pancreas, descending colon, kidney (left) Right lower quadrant (RLQ): Appendix, ileum, cecum, ovary (left) Suprapubic area: Bladder, uterus, rectum ABDOMINAL MANEUVERS Acute Abdomen or Peritonitis Psoas/Iliopsoas Positive finding if right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain occurs during maneuver. Indicates irritation to the iliopsoas group of hip flexors in the abdomen. A positive finding suggests peritoneal irritation. With patient in supine position, have patient raise right leg against the pressure of the professional's hand resistance With patient on left side, extend the right leg from the hip Obturator Sign (Supine Position) Positive if inward rotation of the hip causes RLQ abdominal pain. Rotate right hip through full range of motion. Positive sign is pain with the movement or flexion of the hip. 287236 Rovsing's Sign (Supine Position) Deep palpation of the left lower quadrant of the abdomen results in referred pain to the RLQ, which is a positive Rovsing's sign. McBurney's Point Area located between the superior iliac crest and umbilicus in the RLQ. Tenderness or pain is a sign of possible acute appendicitis. Markle Test (Heel Jar) Instruct patient to raise heels and then drop them suddenly. An alternative is to ask the patient to jump in place. Positive if pain is elicited or if patient refuses to perform because of pain. Involuntary Guarding With abdominal palpation, the abdominal muscles reflexively become tense or board-like. Rebound Tenderness Patient complains of worsening abdominal pain when hand is released after palpation of abdomen compared to the pain felt during deep palpation. Murphy's Maneuver ( Figure 10.1 ) Press deeply on the RUQ under the costal border during inspiration. Midinspiratory arrest is a positive finding (Murphy's sign). Figure 10.1 Murphy's sign. 288237 DISEASE REVIEW Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Forty percent of U.S. adults have GERD. Acidic gastric contents regurgitate from the stomach into the esophagus due to inappropriate relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. Chronic GERD causes damage to squamous epithelium of the esophagus and in about 10% of GERD patients may result in Barrett's esophagus (a precancer), which increases risk of squamous cell cancer (cancer of the esophagus). Classic Case Middle-aged to older adult complains of chronic heartburn of many years' duration. Symptoms associated with large and/or fatty meals that worsen when supine. Long-term history of self-medication with over-the-counter (OTC) antacids and H2-blockers. Risk factors may include the chronic use of NSAIDs, aspirin, or alcohol. Objective Findings Acidic or sour odor to breath Reflux of sour acidic stomach contents, especially with overeating Thinning tooth enamel (rear molars) due to increased hydrochloric acid Chronic sore red throat (not associated with a cold) Chronic coughing Treatment Plan First-line (mild/intermittent GERD) treatment is lifestyle changes. Avoid large and/or high-fat meals, especially 3 to 4 hours before bedtime; lose weight; avoid mints, chocolate, and alcohol (relaxes gastric sphincter); and avoid aspirin, NSAIDs, caffeine, carbonated beverages, and other aggravating foods. Cease smoking. Smoking increases stomach acid and lowers esophageal sphincter pressure. Ask whether on medications with a GERD side effect such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and alpha-1 or alpha-2 adrenergic receptor changes with antacids and/or H2-blockers (low-dose H2- receptor antagonists) as needed. If poor response, next step is to prescribe medications. Medications with hip fractures, pneumonia, and C. difficile infection. Do not discontinue PPIs abruptly because doing so can cause rebound symptoms (worsens symptoms); taper dose to with certain medications such as tetracycline and levothyroxine (Synthroid) If no relief after 4 to 8 weeks therapy, high risk for Barrett's esophagus (long-term 289238 GERD, White male older than 50 years) or worrisome symptoms, refer to GI specialist for upper endoscopy/biopsy (gold standard) Worrisome symptoms: Progressive dysphagia (difficulty swallowing that is worsening), iron-deficiency anemia (blood loss), weight loss, Hemoccult positive Complications Barrett's esophagus (a precancer for esophageal cancer) Esophageal cancer EXAM TIPS Barrett's esophagus is a precancer (esophageal cancer). Diagnosed by upper endoscopy with biopsy. Know lifestyle factors to teach patient (no mints, avoid caffeine, etc.) Know Cullen's sign (edema and bruising of the subcutaneous tissue around the umbilicus) and Grey-Turner's sign (bruising/bluish discoloration of the flank area that may indicate retroperitoneal hemorrhage). Classic pain of acute pancreatitis is severe midepigastric pain that radiates to midback. Know Rovsing's sign. Be aware of presentation of acute appendicitis. Psoas and obturator signs are positive for acute appendicitis. Know how to perform psoas maneuver. CLINICAL PEARLS Any patient with at least a decade or more history of chronic heartburn should be referred to a gastroenterologist for an endoscopy to rule out Barrett's esophagus. Patients with Barrett's esophagus have up to 30 times higher risk of cancer of the esophagus (adenocarcinoma type). Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) A chronic functional disorder of the colon (normal colonic tissue) marked by exacerbations and remissions (spontaneous). Commonly exacerbated by excess stress. It may be classified as diarrhea predominant or constipation predominant. In some cases, it may alternate between the two. Classic Case Young adult to middle-aged female complains of intermittent episodes of moderate to severe cramping pain in the lower abdomen, especially in the LLQ. Bloating with flatulence. Relief obtained after defecation. Stools range from diarrhea to constipation or both types with increased frequency of bowel movements. 290Objective Findings A complete physical exam should be performed to exclude other causes. Vital signs are typically normal. Abdominal exam: Tenderness in lower quadrants during an exacerbation. Otherwise the exam is normal. Rectal exam: Stool is normal with no blood or pus. Stools are heme negative. Treatment Plan Increase dietary fiber. Supplement fiber with psyllium (Metamucil or Konsyl), methylcellulose (Citrucel), wheat dextrin (Benefiber). Start at low dose (causes gas). Avoid gas-producing foods: Beans, onions, cabbage, high-fructose corn syrup. If poor response, use a trial diet of lactose avoidance or gluten avoidance. Antispasmodics for abdominal pain: Administer dicyclomine (Bentyl) or hyoscyamine as needed. IBS with constipation: Begin a trial of fiber supplements, polyethylene glycol (osmotic laxative). If severe constipation: Prescribe lubiprostone or linaclotide (contraindicated in pediatric patients younger than 6 years, has caused death from dehydration). IBS with diarrhea: Take loperamide (Imodium) before regularly scheduled meals. Severe diarrhea-predominant IBS: Administer alosetron (warning: ischemic colitis, which can be fatal). Decrease life stress. Address anxiety/stress with patient and offer treatment strategies. Rule out: Amoebic, parasitic, or bacterial infections; inflammatory disease of the GI tract; and so forth. Check stool for ova and parasites (especially diarrheal stools) with culture. PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE (PUD) Gastric Ulcer and Duodenal Ulcer Disease Duodenal ulcers are more common than gastric ulcers. Gastric ulcers have higher risk of malignancy (up to 10%) compared with duodenal ulcers, which are mostly benign. Helicobacter pylori is a common cause of both duodenal and gastric ulcers. Etiology H. pylori (gram-negative bacteria) Chronic NSAID use, which disrupts prostaglandin production; results in reduction of GI blood flow with reduction of protective mucus layer Tobacco and/or alcohol use; stress after acute illness, ventilator support, extensive burns, or head injury Bisphosphonates (Fosamax, Actonel) Worrisome symptoms: Early satiety, anorexia, anemia (bleeding), recurrent vomiting, hematemesis, weight loss 291239 Classic Case Middle-aged to older adult complains of episodic epigastric pain, burning/gnawing pain, or ache (80%). Pain relieved by food and/or antacids (50%) with recurrence 2 to 4 hours after a meal. Pain also recurs when hungry or stomach is empty. Self-medicating with OTC antacids. May be taking NSAIDs or aspirin. Black or stool (hematochezia), coffee-ground emesis, iron-deficiency anemia indicates GI bleeding. Objective Findings Abdominal exam: Normal or mildly tender epigastric area during flare-ups Hemoccult can be positive if actively bleeding Labs CBC (iron-deficiency anemia means bleeding) and fecal occult blood test (FOBT) are needed. All patients diagnosed with PUD should be tested for H. pylori infection. If positive, refer to gastroenterologist. Serology (titers): H. pylori immunoglobulin (IgG) levels elevated. Do not use document eradication (use urea breath test or stool antigen test). Urea breath test: Indicative of active H. pylori infection and is commonly used to document eradication of H. pylori after treatment. Stool antigen : Can be used for screening and posttreatment to document eradication. - Urea breath test and stool/fecal antigen test are more sensitive for active infection than serology/titers. Gold standard: Upper endoscopy and biopsy of gastric and/or duodenal tissue are gold-standard tests. Multiple severe ulcers: Use fasting gastrin levels to rule out Zollinger-Ellison syndrome as needed. Treatment Plan Treatment for H. pylori-Negative Ulcers Stop use of NSAIDs. If a patient needs long-term NSAIDs, ulcer formation risk can be decreased if combined with a PPI or misoprostol. Encourage smoking cessation. Combine lifestyle changes with PPIs or H2-blockers. Duration of therapy is from 4 to 8 weeks. Treat with H2-blockers or with PPIs. If recurrent ulcers, poor response after 4 to 8 weeks of therapy, suspect bleeding ulcer, refer to GI. H2-blockers (or H2-antagonists): Ranitidine (Zantac) 150 mg BID or 300 mg at bedtime Nizatidine (Axid) 150 mg BID or 300 mg (Pepcid) 40 mg (Prevacid 15-30 mg daily Treatment for H. pylori-Positive Ulcers Triple therapy Clarithromycin (Biaxin) 500 mg BID plus amoxicillin 1 g BID or metronidazole (Flagyl) 500 mg BID if allergic to amoxicillin \u00d7 14 days plus PPI for 4 to 8 weeks to allow ulcer to heal Quadruple therapy Bismuth subsalicylate tab 600 mg QID plus Metronidazole tab 250 mg QID plus Tetracycline cap 500 mg QID \u00d7 2 weeks plus PPI for 4 to 8 weeks to allow ulcer to heal Sequential therapy and other \"new\" treatment regimens for H. pylori are available for clinical use, but not necessary information for the exam EXAM TIPS Determine whether question is about H. pylori -negative ulcers or H. pylori -positive ulcers. H. pylori -positive ulcers require antibiotics for 14 days. Barrett's esophagus is a precursor for esophageal cancer. Worrisome symptoms for esophageal cancer include pain on swallowing, early satiety, and weight loss. Treatment is the same as for acute diverticulitis. IBS: Increase fiber intake. Recognize UC versus CD (see discussion earlier in chapter). If patient needs treatment for GERD, start with H2-blockers; if poor relief, step up to PPIs. Know how to perform Rovsing's and Markle maneuvers. Positive tests mean acute abdomen. Positive psoas or obturator signs are caused by appendicitis. CLINICAL PEARLS High rates of clarithromycin resistance (42%) in the United States. Avoid using clarithromycin therapy if there is high resistance in your area. Eradication rates in the United States using traditional triple therapy are now less than 80%. PPIs cure ulcers faster than H2-blockers. Diverticulitis Diverticula are small pouch-like herniations on the external surface of the colon secondary to a chronic lack of dietary fiber; higher incidence in Western societies Diverticulitis occurs when diverticula; high risk of rupture and bleeding; can be life- threatening 293241 Hospitalize if: Patient is elderly, has high fever, leukocytosis, comorbidities, or is immunocompromised Classic Case Elderly patient presents with acute onset of fever with LLQ abdominal pain with anorexia, nausea, and/or vomiting. Abdominal palpation reveals tenderness on the left lower quadrant. Hematochezia (bloody stool) and anemia if hemorrhaging. Objective Findings Acute diverticulitis: If acute abdomen, positive for rebound, positive Rovsing's sign, and board-like abdomen, refer to ED Diverticulosis: Physical exam is normal; no palpable mass; no tenderness Labs CBC with leukocytosis, neutrophilia greater than 70% and shift to the left (band forms); the presence of band forms signals severe bacterial infection; bands are immature neutrophils; refer to ED FOBT positive if bleeding Reticulocytosis if acute bleeding and low hemoglobin/hematocrit Treatment Plan Uncomplicated cases of diverticulitis can usually be treated in the outpatient setting. While the routine use of antibiotics in uncomplicated diverticulitis is controversial, one recommendation would be to cover for anaerobes and gram-negative organisms. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID plus metronidazole (Flagyl) 500 mg TID \u00d7 10 to 14 days Opiates should be avoided during the acute phase because they make increased intraluminal pressure and promote an ileus Increasing fiber intake is not recommended in the acute management of diverticulitis Probiotics have been used to prevent recurrences with mixed success Close follow-up: If no response in 48 to 72 hours or symptoms worsen (high fever, toxic), refer to ED; moderate to severe cases: hospitalize Chronic Therapy for Diverticulosis High-fiber diet with fiber supplementation such as psyllium (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel); avoiding nuts, seeds, and popcorn is not evidence based Complications Abscess, perforation with peritonitis Ileus, sepsis, death Acute Pancreatitis Acute inflammation of the pancreas secondary to many factors such as alcohol abuse, gallstones (cholelithiasis), elevated triglyceride levels, infections Pancreatic enzymes become activated inside pancreas, causing autodigestion Varies in severity from mild to life-threatening/death 294242 Elevated triglycerides (>800 mg/dL) at very high risk for acute pancreatitis Classic Case Adult patient complains of the acute onset of fever, nausea, and vomiting that is associated with rapid onset of abdominal pain that radiates to the midback, located in the epigastric region. Abdominal exam reveals guarding and tenderness over the epigastric area or the upper abdomen. Positive Cullen's and Grey-Turner's sign. May have ileus, signs and symptoms of shock. Refer patient to ED. Objective Findings Cullen's sign: bowel sounds (ileus), jaundice, guarding, and board-like upper abdomen if peritonitis Labs pancreatic enzymes such as serum amylase, bilirubin, leukocytosis, and other values Abdominal ultrasound and CT Complications Multiple serious complications such as ileus, sepsis, shock, multiorgan failure, death May cause diabetes Clostridium difficile Colitis C. difficile infection is a gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacillus that releases toxins that produce clinical disease. The classic symptom is watery diarrhea a few days after starting antibiotic treatment due to changes in intestinal flora caused by antibiotics. Antibiotics such as clindamycin (Cleocin), fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and penicillins are more likely to C. difficile infection. C. difficile is a gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Most cases occur in hospitalized patients; may also occur in institutionalized patients (nursing facilities). It is spread by fecal oral contact. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer's are ineffective against C. difficile . Classic Case Severe watery diarrhea from 10 to 15 stools a day accompanied by lower abdominal pain with cramping and fever. Patient is currently on antibiotics or recently completed a course of antibiotics. Symptoms usually appear within 5 to 10 days after initiation of antibiotics. Labs Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing is preferred for identification of C. difficile . It is rapid, highly sensitive, and highly specific. toxins 295243 Repeat testing during this same episode of diarrhea is not recommended because infective agents, such as parasites, can persist for 3 to 6 weeks after treatment. Testing and treatment of asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Treatment (for nonsevere disease) Metronidazole (Flagyl) TID for 10 to 14 days Avoid antimotility agents (loperamide) or opiates because they can worsen and prolong disorder Probiotic use is controversial Increase fluid intake; eat food as tolerated HEPATITIS Hepatitis Serology IgG Anti-HAV (Hepatitis A Antibody IgG Type)-Positive Antibodies present (immune) No virus present and not infectious How: History of native hepatitis A infection or vaccination with hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix) IgM Anti-HAV (Hepatitis A Antibody IgM Type)-Positive Acute infection; patient is contagious Hepatitis A virus still present (infectious); no immunity yet HBsAg (Hepatitis B Surface Antigen) Screening test for hepatitis B If positive, patient has the virus and is infectious How: Presence of antigen means either an acute infection or chronic hepatitis B infection Anti-HBs (Hepatitis B Surface Antibody)-Positive Antibodies present and is immune Presence may be due to either a past infection or vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine HbeAg (Hepatitis B \"e\" Antigen) Indicates active viral replication; may be highly infectious Persistence of the \"e\" antigen indicates chronic hepatitis B Chronic Hepatitis Infection: Two Types Chronic infection with mildly elevated LFTs Chronic and active infection with elevated LFTs (active viral replication) Patient is at higher risk for cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer Anti-HCV (Antibody Hepatitis C Virus) 296244 Screening test for hepatitis C Up to 85% of cases become carriers Unlike hepatitis A and B, a positive anti-HCV (antibody) does not always mean that the patient has recovered from the infection and has developed immunity; it may instead indicate current infection because up to 85% of cases become carriers If this test is positive: Order HCV RNA or HCV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to rule out chronic infection If positive, then patient has hepatitis C; refer to GI specialist for liver biopsy/treatment Hepatitis D (Delta Virus) Requires the presence of hepatitis B to get the infection; can be an acute or a chronic infection Infection with both hepatitis B and hepatitis D increases the risk of fulminant hepatitis, cirrhosis, and severe liver damage; low prevalence in the United States Liver Function Tests (LFTs) Aspartate Aminotransferase Normal: 0 to 45 mg/dL Present in the liver, heart muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, and lung Not specific for liver injury because it is elevated in other conditions (e.g., acute myocardial infarction) Alanine 0 to 40 mg/dL Found mainly in the liver; a positive finding indicates liver inflammation More specific for hepatic inflammation than AST AST/ALT Ratio (or SGOT/SGPT Ratio) A ratio of 2.0 or higher may be indicative of alcohol abuse Serum GGT Sensitive indicator of alcohol abuse. May be a \"lone\" elevation Level is elevated in liver disease and acute pancreatitis Alkaline Phosphatase Enzyme derived from bone, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, GI tract, and placenta Higher levels seen during growth spurts (bones) in children and teens Also may be elevated with healing fractures, osteomalacia, bone malignancy, vitamin D deficiency, and others 297245 Viral Hepatitis Hepatitis A, B, and C Hepatitis A No chronic or carrier state exists for hepatitis A Transmission: Transmitted via fecal and oral route from contaminated food or drink Self-limiting infection; treatment is symptomatic; vaccine available (Havrix) and recommended for travelers to areas where hepatitis A is endemic Hepatitis A is reportable to the public health department Advise patients to avoid use of oral contraceptive pills and hormone replacement therapy to avoid cholestasis; avoid alcohol use Avoid working in food-related jobs for 1 week after onset of infection Hepatitis B Transmission: Transmitted via sexual activity (semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva), blood, blood products, organs Vertical transmission occurs from mother to infant; hepatitis B can either be acute and self-limiting or it can be a chronic infection Treatment: First-line agents for treatment of hepatitis B include pegylated alfa (PEG-IFN-a), entecavir (ETV), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) Hepatitis C Transmission: Transmitted via sharing needles, blood transfusions before 1992, mother to infant (vertical transmission), needle-stick injuries in health care settings. Less common, spread by sexual contact, sharing personal items (razors or toothbrushes). Approximately 75% to 85% of people who become infected with hepatitis C will develop chronic infection. The disease is the most common cause of liver cancer and liver transplantation in the United States. High-risk groups: Intravenous drug users, hemophiliacs, or anyone with history of frequent transfusions, or persons born between 1945 and 1965 are at risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends screening (at least once) adults born from 1945 through 1965. Hepatitis C has the highest risk of chronic hepatitis infection and cirrhosis (30%). Cirrhosis markedly increases the risk of liver cancer or liver failure. Refer to GI for management. Advise patient not to share razors, toothbrushes, and nail clippers and to cover cuts and sores. Report acute cases of hepatitis C to the health department. Treatment: Administer antivirals such as ledipasvir-sofosbuvir (Harvoni), ribavirin, and pegylated interferon alpha-2a/2b. Use liver biopsy to stage disease. Acute Hepatitis An acute liver inflammation with multiple causes. Examples include viral infection, hepatotoxic drugs (i.e., statins), excessive alcohol intake, and toxins. 298246 Classic Case Sexually active adult complains of a new onset of fatigue, nausea, and dark-colored urine for several days. New sexual partner (<3 months). Objective Findings Skin and sclera have a yellow tinge (jaundiced or icteric) Liver: Tenderness over the liver occurs with percussion and deep palpation Labs ALT and AST: Levels are elevated up to 10\u00d7 normal during the acute phase of the illness Other LFTs, such as the serum bilirubin and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT); these may be elevated Treatment Plan Remove and treat the cause (if possible). Avoid hepatotoxic agents such as alcoholic drinks, acetaminophen, and statins (e.g., pravastatin or Pravachol). Treatment is supportive. Case Studies for Viral Hepatitis Patient A HBsAg: negative Anti-HBs: positive HBeAg: negative Results: Patient A indicative of either: History of old hepatitis B infection; has antibodies for hepatitis B (anti-HBs positive) or history of vaccination against hepatitis B Not a carrier of hepatitis B (HBeAg negative, HBsAg negative) Patient B HBsAg: positive HBeAg: positive Anti-HBs: negative Anti-HAV: positive Anti-HCV: negative Results: Patient B indicative of: Current hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive) Chronic carrier of hepatitis B (both HBsAg and HBeAg are positive) Presence of antibodies to hepatitis A (anti-HAV); patient either had a previous hepatitis A infection or received the hepatitis A vaccine This patient is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus; if the HBeAg is positive, it means that the patient is highly contagious EXAM TIPS 299There will be a serology question (as just shown). You will have to figure out what type of viral hepatitis the patient has (A, B, or C). It is usually hepatitis B. HBsAg- positive status always means an infected patient (new infection or chronic). PCR tests are not antibody tests. They test for presence of viral RNA. A positive result means that the virus is present. This test can be performed for diagnosing disease such as hepatitis C or HIV. Hepatitis C has highest risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Screening test for hepatitis C virus is called the HCV antibody (HCV Ab). If positive, next step is to order HCV RNA test. If positive, patient has hepatitis C. GGT is elevated in liver disease and biliary obstruction. A \"lone\" elevation in the GGT is a sensitive indicator of possible alcoholism. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is normally elevated during the teen years due to bone growth. The ALP may also be elevated in bone disorders such as vitamin D deficiency, Paget's disease, and bone cancer. A GGT, which would be elevated with liver disease, may be drawn to differentiate between liver disease and bone disorders. A person must have hepatitis B to become infected with hepatitis D. Hepatitis D requires the hepatitis B helper cells to replicate and become active. There is no vaccine for hepatitis D, but hepatitis B vaccination will prevent acquisition of hepatitis D. ALT is more sensitive to liver damage than AST. AST is also found in other organs such as the heart and skeletal system. AST and ALT may be elevated and may reflect acute liver injury or inflammation. However, these levels may be normal in chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis. Be aware of GERD management and treatment. Acute pancreatitis symptoms: Amylase and lipase are sensitive tests used for pancreatic inflammation (pancreatitis). 300247 11 Renal System Review DANGER SIGNALS Acute Pyelonephritis Patient presents with acute onset of high fever, chills, nausea/vomiting, dysuria, frequency, and unilateral flank pain. The flank pain is described as a deep ache. May complain of nausea (with/without vomiting). May have recent history of urinary tract infection (UTI). Indications for hospitalization include inability to maintain oral hydration, persistently high fever (>101 F/ >38.4 C), toxic appearance, immune-compromised, or suspect noncompliance to treatment. Acute Kidney Injury (Acute Renal Failure) Patient presents with the abrupt onset of oliguria, edema, and weight gain (fluid retention). Complains of lethargy, nausea, and loss of appetite. Rapid decrease in renal function. Elevated serum creatinine. During the early stages, the serum creatinine and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may not accurately reflect true renal function. Most cases of acute kidney injury (acute decline of GFR) are usually reversible. Bladder Cancer Elderly male patient (median age at diagnosis: 73 years), a smoker, presents with painless hematuria. The hematuria can be microscopic or gross (urine pink to reddish color). Some patients only notice a problem after they see a blood-tinged stain on underwear (males, menopausal females). The hematuria may only appear at the end of voiding. May have irritative voiding symptoms (dysuria, frequency, nocturia) that are not related to a UTI. Order a UA, urine C&S, and urine for cytology. Patients who have advanced disease with metastases may complain of lower abdominal or pelvic pain, perineal pain, low-back pain, 301248 or bone pain. NORMAL FINDINGS Kidneys The kidneys are located in the retroperitoneal area. The right kidney is lower than the left kidney because of displacement by the liver. The basic functional units of the kidney are the nephrons, which contain the glomeruli. Function Kidneys are the body's regulators of electrolytes and fluids. Water is reabsorbed back into the body by the action of antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone. Kidneys excrete water- soluble waste products of metabolism (i.e., creatinine, urea, uric acid) into the urine. They also produce the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates bone marrow into producing more RBCs. The average daily urine output is 1,500 mL. Oliguria is defined as a urinary output of less than 400 mL per day (adults). Kidneys also secrete several hormones such as erythropoietin (RBC production), renin and bradykinin (blood pressure), prostaglandins (renal perfusion), and calcitriol/vitamin D 3 (bone). LABORATORY TESTING Serum Creatinine Male: 0.7 to 1.3 mg/dL Female: 0.6 to 1.1 mg/dL When renal function decreases, the creatinine level will increase. Creatinine is the end- product of creatine metabolism, which comes mostly from muscle. Serum creatinine may be falsely decreased in people with low muscle volume (elderly). Elevated values are seen with renal damage or failure, nephrotoxic drugs, etc. Factors that affect the serum creatinine are gender (males have higher levels), race (African Americans have more muscle mass), and muscle mass. Creatinine Clearance (24-Hour Urine) When renal function decreases, the creatinine clearance also decreases. This test is ordered to evaluate patients with proteinuria, albuminuria, and microalbuminuria. It is a more sensitive test than the serum creatinine alone because it reflects the renal function within a 24-hour period. Creatinine clearance is relatively constant and is not affected by fluid status, diet, or exercise. Creatinine clearance is doubled for every 50% reduction of the GFR. Exercise should be avoided immediately prior to and during the period of specimen collection. 302249 Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) Normal: eGFR greater mL/min Renal failure: eGFR less than 15 mL/min (stage 5 chronic kidney disease) The eGFR is the number derived by using the serum creatinine in a prediction equation (i.e., Cockcroft-Gault). The more damaged the kidneys, the lower the eGFR value. The GFR is the amount of fluid filtered by the glomerulus within a certain unit of time. It is used to evaluate renal function and to stage chronic kidney disease. Best if patient does not eat cooked meat 12 hours before the blood test GFR is less reliable (interpret with care): Drastic increase/reduction muscle mass (bodybuilders, amputees, wasting disorders), pregnancy, and acute renal failure Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) Among patients with heart failure, lower GFR with higher BUN is associated with higher mortality. The BUN is not as sensitive as the serum creatinine or the GFR. A high BUN may be caused by acute renal failure, high-protein diet, hemolysis, congestive heart failure, or drugs. Low BUN can be caused by liver damage or liver disease. If a patient has an abnormal BUN level, check the eGFR. If the eGFR is normal, the renal function is probably normal. The BUN is a measure of the kidney's ability to excrete urea (waste product of protein metabolism). BUN-to-Creatinine Ratio The ratio between the BUN and serum creatinine (BUN:Cr). It is used to help evaluate dehydration, hypovolemia, acute renal failure, and it is useful for classifying the type of renal failure (renal, infrarenal, or postrenal). Urinalysis (UA) Epithelial Cells Large amounts of squamous epithelial cells in a urine sample indicate contamination. A few epithelial cells are considered normal. (Squamous epithelial cells are associated with the external urethra and transitional epithelial cells, the bladder.) Leukocytes Normal WBCs in urine: less than or equal to 10 WBCs/mL Called leukocyte esterase test with dipstick strips Presence of leukocytes in urine (pyuria) is always abnormal in males (infection) UA is a more sensitive test for infection in males than females Urine for Culture and Sensitivity Greater than or equal to 10 5 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of bacteria of one dominant bacteria (usually Escherichia coli ) are indicative of a UTI If multiple bacteria are present, it is considered a contaminated sample Lower values are indicative of bacteriuria 303250 Red Blood Cells Few RBCs (<5 cells) is considered normal Hematuria is seen with kidney stones, pyelonephritis, and sometimes in cystitis Can be contaminated by menses or hemorrhoids Protein Indicates kidney damage (chronic kidney disease) May be present in acute pyelonephritis (resolves after treatment) Urine dipsticks detect only albumin, not microalbumin (Bence-Jones proteins) Order 24-hour urine for protein and creatinine clearance Nitrites Indicative of probable infection with E. coli Due to breakdown of nitrates to nitrites by certain Pseudomonas ). Casts Casts are shaped like cylinders because they are formed in the renal tubules Hyaline casts are \"normal\" and may be seen in concentrated urine and after strenuous exercise WBC cast may be seen with infections (UTI, pyelonephritis) RBC casts and proteinuria are diagnostic of glomerulonephritis Ph (4.6-8.0 reference range) Useful in the evaluation of kidney stones and infections. Citrus and low carbohydrate diet are associated with lower acidity and high protein diet is associated with higher acidity. DISEASE REVIEW Hematuria Microscopic hematuria is revealed by a positive urine dipstick for heme or by microscopic UA (presence of three to five RBCs or more per high-power field). It can be transient or persistent. Suspect gross (or visible) hematuria if color of urine is pink, red, or brown or blood clots are present. If dipstick is heme positive, next step is to order a microscopic UA. If infection is suspected, order urine for C&S. If malignancy is suspected, send urine for cytology. Risk factors for urothelial or renal malignancy are age older than 50 years, male, smoker, and gross hematuria. Asymptomatic Bacteriuria No antibiotic treatment is recommended for patients with Foley catheters, suprapubic, or condom catheters (chronic or intermittent), the elderly (institutionalized), and those with 304spinal cord injury. Defined as urine culture growth of 100,000 CFU/mL or more. Symptomatic bacteriuria (leukocytosis, fever, chills, malaise) is treated as a UTI. Always treat pregnant women with antibiotics (up to 30% risk of pyelonephritis). Urinary Tract Infections Cystitis (urinary bladder inflammation) can be uncomplicated, recurrent, a reinfection, or relapse. The majority of infections are caused by E. coli (75%-95%). Other causal agents are Klebsiella pneumoniae . UTIs younger than age 3 and pregnant women (20%-40% chance) are more likely to progress to pyelonephritis. Infancy : UTIs are common in boys (usually due to anatomical abnormality) Children : UTIs in children need further evaluation. May indicate vesicoureteral reflux or even possible sexual abuse. Females: Highest incidence is during the reproductive-age years Risk Factors Female gender; pregnancy History of a recent UTI or history of recurrent infections Diabetes mellitus (or immunocompromised status) Failure to void after sex or increased sexual intercourse (i.e., honeymoon bladder) Spermicide use within past year (alone or with diaphragm) Other risk factors: Infected renal calculi, low fluid intake, poor hygiene, catheterization Classic Case A sexually active female complains of new onset of dysuria, frequency, frequent urge to urinate, and nocturia. May also complain of suprapubic discomfort. Not associated with fever. Urine dipstick will show a moderate to large number of leukocytes and will be positive for nitrites. May show a few RBCs (due to inflammation), and be negative for ketones (unless fasting), and protein. Labs UA dipstick (midstream sample): Leukocyte positive (WBCs 10/mcL) casts Urine C&S: Definitions UTI infection : 100,000 CFU/mL (or 10 5 CFU/mL) with pyuria Multiple bacteria : Contaminated sample Bacteriuria (with or without indwelling catheter): More than 100,000 CFU/mL Urinary casts (tubular-shaped structures) RBC casts : Microscopic bleeding in the glomeruli; suspect glomerulonephritis (accompanied by edema, weight gain, dark cola-colored urine or hypertension) WBC casts : Due to inflammation; rule out pyelonephritis, interstitial nephritis Medications Uncomplicated UTIs 305251 Healthy female patients aged 18 years to 65 years can have the \"3-day\" treatment regimen (these agents are used for 5-7 days for complicated UTIs). Routine urine C&S before and after treatment is not recommended for this population. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra) BID \u00d7 3 days Bacterial resistance greater than 20% or sulfa-allergic: Nitrofurantoin BID \u00d7 5 days, or Fosfomycin 3 g \u00d7 one dose or Augmentin 875/125 mg BID \u00d7 5 7 days Alternatives: Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) BID or levofloxacin (Levaquin) daily (age 18 years or older) \u00d7 3 days Phenazopyridine (Pyridium) by mouth BID \u00d7 2 days PRN AZO); pyridium will turn urine an orange/yellow color; will stain contact lenses; avoid if liver or renal disease, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) anemia Increase fluid intake to more than 2.5 L/d (except if heart failure); restrict dietary oxalate; high oxalate foods are beans, spinach, beets, potato chips, french fries, nuts, tea Note If clinical symptoms persist 48 to 72 hours after initiating antibiotics, order urine C&S and UA. Rule out pyelonephritis. Switch to another antibiotic drug class and treat for 7 to 10 days. Complicated UTIs Must treat these patients for a minimum of 7 days or longer Males Poorly controlled diabetes Pregnant women Children or elderly Immunocompromised (chronic high-dosed steroids, biologics, HIV infection) Recurrent UTIs or reinfections Anatomical abnormalities (including kidney stones, reflux, obstruction) Treatment regimens Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) 500 mg BID or levofloxacin 750 mg once a day for 7 to 10 days Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra) BID or cefixime (Suprax) 400 mg BID for 7 to 10 days Postcoital UTIs : Bactrim or Bactrim DS one tablet after sex (or low-dose nitrofurantoin, Cipro, Keflex); increase fluids before and after sex prophylaxis (recurrent UTI): Bactrim one Ceclor, Cipro (older than 18 years); consider prophylactic antibiotics for 6 months or longer (after ruling out pathology) 306252 Labs UA and urine C&S before and after treatment (to document resolution) UTIs : Special categories Males UTIs are never \"normal\" in males. Rule out ureteral stricture, infected kidney stones, anatomical abnormality, acute prostatitis, sexually transmitted diseases, and so forth. Must be evaluated further. Refer to urologist. Recurrent UTI s (in Women) Three or more UTIs in 1 year or two infections within 6 months; never normal in males Rule out urological abnormality : Infected stones, reflux, fistulas, ureteral stenosis, and so forth are abnormalities Note Long-term use of nitrofurantoin is associated with lung problems, chronic hepatitis, and neuropathy. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated with renal insufficiency. Baseline chest x-ray, liver function tests, and neurological exam should be obtained and patients monitored closely. Acute Pyelonephritis Acute bacterial infection of the kidney(s) is most commonly due to gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli (75%-95%), P. mirabilis , and K. pneumoniae (gram-negative anaerobe). Outpatient treatment is only for milder cases that are uncomplicated (immunocompetent adult female with normal urinary/renal systems without comorbidities) and for compliant patients. Classic Case Adult patient presents with acute onset of high fever, chills, nausea/vomiting, and one- sided flank pain. Some patients may also have symptoms of cystitis such as dysuria, frequency, and urgency. Physical Exam Temperature equal or greater than 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) Costovertebral angle tenderness on one kidney UA : Large amount of leukocytes, hematuria, WBC casts, and mild proteinuria Urine C&S : Presence of 10 5 CFU/mL organism CBC : Leukocytosis (WBC >11,000/mcL), neutrophilia (>80%) with shift to the left Shift to the left : Presence of bands or stabs (immature neutrophils) means serious infection Chemistry profile (serum creatinine, others) 307253 Treatment Plan May treat mild uncomplicated cases as outpatients with close follow-up (or refer to urology). For moderate to severe (or complicated) cases, hospitalization is required. Outpatient treatment for young, healthy adults may include a fluoroquinolone. Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) 1 g intramuscular injection (one dose) during office visit may be given if fluoroquinolone resistance suspected (>10%), or susceptibility unknown. Treat with ciprofloxacin (Cipro) BID \u00d7 7 days or Septra) BID \u00d7 14 days (use only if bacteria is known to be susceptible). Close follow-up needed for 12 to 24 hours Coexisting condition that compromises immune system or is toxic: Refer or hospitalize. Refer : Pregnant women, children/elderly, anatomical abnormalities, diabetics, others should be referred to a physician for treatment. Fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides are contraindicated in pregnancy. Complications : Gram-negative septicemia, shock, renal failure are complications of pyelonephritis. Nephrolithiasis (Urolithiasis) The majority of kidney stones are made up of calcium oxalate (70%-80%). The location and the size of the stone determine the pain. For example, stones located in the upper urethra or renal pelvis cause flank pain and tenderness, whereas stones on the lower urethra cause pain that radiates to the testicle or the labia of the vagina. Both can cause abdominal pain. Risk Factors Family history of stones, low fluid intake, gout Bariatric surgery (excrete higher levels of oxalate) Classic Case Adult with acute onset of severe colicky flank pain on one side that comes in waves. When the pain is most severe, the patient cannot stay still and may stand and walk. The pain builds in intensity, then lessens and disappears (until the stone moves again). Painful episodes may last from 20 to 60 minutes. For some, the pain can be extreme and associated with nausea and vomiting. Majority have gross or microscopic hematuria. Majority (50%) will pass stone within 48 hours. Patient should be asked about history of previous episodes, high-protein diet, gout, gastric bypass, high-dose vitamin C. Labs Instruct patient to strain urine for several days and to bring kidney stone to office (if passed) for analysis by laboratory Order renal ultrasound to determine location and stone size UA needed until the episode resolves Refer to urology: Large stone, inability to pass stone, acute renal failure 308254 Refer to ED: High fever (possible urosepsis), extreme pain, acute renal failure Pregnant women who present with abdominal pain should be evaluated for an ectopic pregnancy, abruptio placentae, preterm labor, cholilithiasis, and kidney stones Diet Increase fluid intake up to 2 L/d (if tolerated); if calcium oxalate stones, dietary modifications should be advised Avoid high-oxalate foods such as rhubarb, spinach, beets, chocolate, tea, and meats EXAM TIPS Memorize definition of UTI (>100,000 CFU/mL of one organism). Recognize classic case of UTI and acute pyelonephritis, and be able to distinguish between the two. Healthy women diagnosed with uncomplicated UTIs may be treated using a 3-day treatment plan. Become familiar with UA results of UTIs. Pyelonephritis may be treated with a shortened 7-day course of antibiotics when using fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and levofloxacin with pyelonephritis. Serum creatinine is a better measure of renal function than the BUN or BUN:Cr ratio. But the eGFR is considered the best measure of renal function in primary care. Right kidney sits lower than the left kidney because of displacement by the liver. Large numbers of squamous epithelial cells in the urine sample mean contamination. Memorize the normal WBC count (10.5) and the neutrophil or segs (segmented neutrophils; >80%). Neutrophils make up from 50% to 75% of all the WBCs in a sample. Presence of band or stabs (immature WBCs) in CBC is indicative of a serious bacterial infection. Use of spermicides can increase the risk of UTIs in females. CLINICAL PEARLS A study showed that some women with the classic symptoms of acute UTI may have lower counts of bacteria (<10,000 CFU/mL). Of these women, 88% had a UTI. Avoid long-term use of nitrofurantoin, if possible (associated with lung problems, chronic hepatitis, and neuropathy). Serum potassium should be monitored upon initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy if the patient has kidney disease. Potassium levels may initially rise and then taper off in 2 to 3 months. Continued monitoring of serum potassium is recommended. 309Patients with preexisting kidney disease and/or diabetes are at higher risk of kidney damage from contrast media. CT, MRI, and angiogram contrast media may damage kidneys (2%) or cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Imaging test with the highest sensitivity/specificity for kidney stones is noncontrast CT scan (initial imaging is renal ultrasonography). 310255 12 Nervous System Review DISEASE REVIEW Dangerous Headaches Abrupt onset of severe headache (\"thunderclap\" headache) \"Worst headache of my life\" First onset of headache at age 50 years Sudden onset of headache after coughing, exertion, straining, or sex (exertional headache) Sudden change in level of consciousness Focal neurological signs (such as unequal pupil size) Headache with papilledema (increased intracranial pressure [ICP] secondary to any of those listed here) \"Worse-case\" scenario of headaches (rule out) includes the following: Subarachnoid hemorrhage or acute ICP Brain abscess Brain tumor Acute Bacterial Meningitis Acute onset of high fever, severe headache, and stiff neck and meningismus. Meningococcal disease (discussed in \"Danger Signals\" section in Chapter 6 ). Classic purple-colored petechial rashes appear. Accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and photophobia. Rapid worsening of symptoms progressing to lethargy, confusion, and finally coma. If not treated, fatal. Bacterial meningitis is a reportable disease. 311256 Temporal Arteritis (Giant Cell Arteritis) Acute onset of headache that is located on one temple on an older patient. The affected temple has an indurated, reddened, and cord-like temporal artery (tender to touch) that is accompanied by scalp tenderness. Abrupt onset of visual disturbances and/or transient blindness of affected eye (amaurosis fugax). Some may complain of jaw pain or jaw claudication (caused by artery obstruction). Markedly elevated sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Patients with polymyalgia rheumatica are at very high risk of developing temporal arteritis (up to 30%). If untreated, temporal arteritis will lead to blindness. Acute/Narrow Angle-Closure Glaucoma Acute onset of headaches behind an eye or around one eye accompanied by eye pain, blurred vision (like looking through a steamed window), and nausea and/or vomiting. The cornea looks hazy and the affected pupil is dilated midway. More common in older adults. Refer to emergency department (ED). Stroke (Cerebrovascular Accident; CVA) Classified as either embolic (80%) or hemorrhagic (20%). patient who has risk factor(s) for embolization (i.e., atrial fibrillation, prolonged immobilization) presents with acute onset of stuttering/speech disturbance, one-sided facial weakness, and weakness of the arms and/or legs (hemiparesis). Patients who have hemorrhagic stroke often have poorly controlled hypertension and present with the abrupt onset of a severe headache, nausea/vomiting, and nuchal rigidity (subarachnoid bleed). Call 911. Chronic Subdural Hematoma (SDH) Chronic SDH presents gradually and symptoms may not show until a few weeks after the injury. Patient with a history of head trauma (falls, accidents) presents with a history of headaches and gradual cognitive impairment (apathy, somnolence, confusion). More common in alcoholics, the elderly, and those who are on anticoagulation or aspirin therapy. The area of bleeding is between the dura and subarachnoid membranes of the brain. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) Sudden onset of severe headache described as \"the worst headache of my life\" accompanied by photophobia, nausea/vomiting, meningeal irritation (stiff neck, positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs) with a rapid decline in level of consciousness. Patient may have a period of brief lucidity followed by coma (sometimes referred to as a \"talk and die\" bleed). In the elderly, the most common cause is head trauma during a fall; among younger patients, it is motor vehicle accidents. Some suffer a \"sentinel headache\" or the sudden onset of a severe headache (caused by a minor leak) that resolves before the major hemorrhage happens. Sentinel headaches can occur from a few days up to 20 days before the event. Call 911. 312257 NEUROLOGICAL TESTING Neurological Exam Mental Status (Frontal Lobes) Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) Cranial nerve exam MMSE Orientation (name, age, address, job, time/date/season) Registration (Recite three unrelated words. Distract patient for 5 minutes, then ask the patient to repeat the words.) Attention and calculation Spell \"world\" backward or indicate serial 7s (subtract 7 starting at 100) Language While speaking to patient, look for aphasia (impairment in language resulting in difficulty speaking) Cerebellar System Romberg test : Tell patient to stand with arms/hands straight on each side and with the feet together, then instruct patient to close both eyes while standing in the same position and observe Positive: Test is positive if excessive swaying, patient falls down, keeps feet far apart to maintain balance Next tell patient to hold arms straight forward and close eyes, then observe Tandem gait : Tell patient to walk a straight line in normal gait, then instruct patient to walk in a straight line with one foot in front of the other Positive: Test is positive if patient is unable to perform tandem walking, loses balance, and falls Cerebellar Testing Coordination (Diadochokinesia) Rapid alternative movements: Tell patient to place lower arms on top of each thigh and to move them by alternating between supination and pronation positions. Heel-to-shin testing: Patient is in a supine position with extended legs. Tell patient to place the left heel on the right knee and then move it down the shin (repeat with right heel on left knee). Sensory System (Tell Patient to Close Eyes for These Tests) Vibration sense : Use 128-Hz tuning fork and tap lightly, then place one end into the distal joint of each thumb. Patient should have eyes closed. Sharp-dull touch : Use the sharp end of a safety pin for sharp touch and the other end for dull. Temperature : Test the ability to differentiate hot or cold. 313258 Stereognosis (Ability to Recognize Familiar Object Through Sense of Touch Only) Place a familiar object (i.e., coin, key, pen) on the patient's palm and tell the patient to identify the object with the eyes closed. Graphesthesia (Ability to Identify Figures \"Written\" on Skin) \"Write\" a large letter or number on the patient's palms using fingers (patient's eyes are closed). Motor Exam Gait : Observe the patient's \"normal gait.\" Check quadriceps and other leg muscles for atrophy. Pronator drift test: Have patient stretch out the arms with palms facing up, then close eyes. Wait for 5 to 10 seconds. Test is positive if one arm goes downward or drifts. Gross (legs) and fine motor movements (hands). Test walking, using hands for manipulation/pincer grasp, jumping, and so forth. Reflexes Both sides should be compared to each other and should be equal. Grading Reflexes 0 No response 1+ Low response 2+ Normal or average response 3+ Brisker than average 4+ Very brisk response (sustained clonus) Reflex Testing Quadriceps Reflex (Knee-Jerk Response) Reflex center at L2 to L4. Tap patellar tendon briskly on each side. Achilles Reflex (Ankle-Jerk Response) Reflex center at L5 to S2 (tibial nerve). With patient's legs dangling off the exam table, hold the foot in slight dorsiflexion and briskly tap the Achilles tendon. Plantar Reflex (Babinski's Sign) Reflex center L4 to S2. Stroke plantar surface of foot on the lateral border from heel toward the big toe (plantar flexion is normal response). Babinski's sign is positive if toes spread like a fan. Adults should have a negative Babinski sign. NEUROLOGICAL MANEUVERS 314259 These tests are used to assess for meningeal irritation. All of these tests are done with the patient in a supine position. In general, these are more sensitive tests in children compared with adults. Kernig's Sign Flex patient's hips one at a time, then attempt to straighten the leg while keeping the hip flexed at 90 degrees. Positive : There is resistance to leg straightening because of painful hamstrings (due to inflammation on lumbar nerve roots) and/or complaints of back pain. Brudzinski's Sign ( Figure 12.1 ) Passively flex/bend the patient's neck toward the chest. Positive : Patient reflexively flexes the hips and knee to relieve pressure and pain (due to inflammation of lumbar nerve roots). Figure 12.1 Brudzinski's test. Nuchal Rigidity Tell patient to touch chest with the chin. Inability to touch the chest secondary to pain is a positive finding. Cranial Nerve (CN) Testing Mnemonic : \"On Old Olympus Towering Tops, A Finn and German Viewed Some 315260 Hops.\" The first letter stands for the name of the cranial nerve. The word order corresponds to the sequential numbering of the cranial nerves. Memorization tips on CN I: You have one nose. have two eyes. CN VIII: The number 8 stands for two ears sitting on top of each other. CN XI: The number reminds you of the shoulders shrugging together. Because cranial nerves are listed only by number on the test (not by name), the correct chronological order is important. Memorize the mnemonic to guide you. Herpes zoster infection (shingles) of CN V ophthalmic branch can result in corneal blindness. Rash at tip of nose and the temple area: Rule out shingles infection of the trigeminal nerve. CNs are listed by number only. DISEASE REVIEW Acute Bacterial Meningitis A serious acute bacterial infection of the leptomeninges that cover the brain and the spinal cord. The most common pathogens in adults are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitides , and influenzae (the are gram negative). Bacterial meningitis is a reportable disease (local health department). Classic Case 316Acute onset of high fever, severe headache, stiff neck (nuchal rigidity), and rapid changes in mental status and level of consciousness (LOC). Up to 78% of patients have mental status changes (confusion, lethargy, stupor). Other symptoms include photophobia and nausea/vomiting. Some patients may not present with all three symptoms (triad of fever, nuchal rigidity, and change in LOC). Labs Lumbar puncture: CSF contains large numbers of WBCs (CSF cloudy). Definitive diagnosis made from bacteria isolated from the CSF, with presence of elevated protein and low glucose levels in the CSF. Elevated opening pressure. Obtain CT or MRI scan. Lab tests: Obtain CBC with differential, metabolic panel, coagulation profile, platelet counts, and blood cultures \u00d7 2. Gram stain and C&S of the CSF fluid and the blood are needed (before antibiotics are begun). Medications (IV) Infants : Ampicillin or third-generation cephalosporin Adults : Third-generation cephalosporin plus 50 : Amoxicillin plus third-generation cephalosporin Prophylaxis of close contacts with rifampin or ceftriaxone Immunization with the pneumococcal vaccination shown to decrease incidence Complications Patients who recover usually have permanent neurologic sequelae. Elderly patients have a higher mortality rate due to the presence of comorbid conditions. Migraine Headaches (With or Without Aura) Migraine headache with aura (precedes the migraine headache) may present as scotomas (blind spots on visual field) or flashing lights that precede the headache. A positive family history and being female puts one at higher risk (3:1). In children, migraine headaches can present as abdominal pain. Classic Case An adult woman complains of the gradual onset of a bad throbbing headache behind one eye that gradually worsened over several hours. Reports sensitivity to bright light (photophobia) and to noise (phonophobia). Frequently accompanied by nausea and/or vomiting, which can be severe. Migraines can last from 2 to 3 days and may become bilateral if it is not treated ( Table 12.1 ). Treatment Plan Neurological exam will be normal. Rest in a quiet and darkened room with an ice pack to forehead. Nausea : Drink ginger ale or chew dry toast. 317261 Avoid heavy fatty meals. Avoid precipitating foods or activities as: Monosodium glutamate (MSG) in Chinese food; chocolate; nitrates/nitrites found in hot dogs, luncheon meat, and sausage Red wines, beer, caffeine Sleep changes, stress, barometric weather changes Odor trigger such as tobacco smoke, perfumes, and strong odors Visual triggers such as strobe lights, sunlight, glares Abortive Treatment 5-HT-1 agonists: Sumatriptan (Imitrex): First, rule out cardiovascular disease. Do not use if history or signs of ischemic heart disease (MI, angina), CVA, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), uncontrolled hypertension, or hemiplegic migraine. Warn patient of possible flushing, tingling, chest/neck/sinus/jaw discomfort, etc. Supervise first dose, especially if patient has risk factors for cardiovascular disease (diabetics, obese, males >40 years, high lipids, etc.). Give first dose in office (theoretical risk of an acute MI). Consider EKG monitoring if patient is at high risk for heart disease. Higher risk of serotonin syndrome if combined with selective serotonin reuptake selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; weeks of monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) use. Do not combine with ergots or within 24 hours of ergot use (i.e., codeine, hydrocodone). Table 12.1 Classic Signs and Symptoms: Headaches Headache Symptoms Aggravating Factors Migraine without aura Throbbing pain behind one eye Photophobia, phonophobia Nausea/vomiting Red wine, MSG, aspartame, menstruation, stress, etc. with aura Preceding symptoms plus scotoma, scintillating lights, halos, etc. Foods high in triptans Teenage to middle-age females Trigeminal neuralgia (CN V) Intense and very brief; sharp stabbing pain; one cheek (2nd branch CN V) Cold food, cold air, talking, touch, chewing Older adults and elderly Cluster Severe \"ice-pick\" piercing pain behind one eye and temple; with tearing, rhinorrhea, ptosis, and miosis on one side (Horner's syndrome) Occurs at same time daily in clusters for weeks to months Middle-aged males Temporal arteritis (also known as giant cell arteritis ) Unilateral pain, temporal area with scalp tenderness; skin over artery is indurated, tender, warm, and reddened; amaurosis fugax (temporary blindness) may occur Medical urgency Polymyalgia rheumatica common in these patients (up to 50%) Older adults and elderly 318262 Muscle tension Bilateral \"band-like\" pain, continuous dull pain, may last day; may be accompanied by spasms of the trapezius with other vasoconstrictors (triptans, decongestants, etc.) Common side effect is nausea Ergots and triptans should not be given within 14 days of an MAOI Antiemetics: Trimethobenzamide (Tigan) is administered via IM, suppository, peristalsis in : Propranolol (Inderal) daily BID (other beta-blockers can also be used) Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) : Amitriptyline (Neurontin); topiramate should not be prescribed, or it should be discontinued, if the patient has a history of kidney stones Contraindications (Vasoconstricting Drugs) Suspected or known cardiovascular disease (angina, MI, peripheral arterial disease) Suspected or known CVA and/or TIAs Hyperlipidemia, males older than 40 years of age, menopausal females Uncontrolled hypertension Complex migraine (i.e., basilar/hemiplegic migraine) Basilar or Hemiplegic Migraines Focal neurological findings (i.e., CN exam) with stroke-like signs and symptoms. Resembles a TIA. These patients are at higher risk of stroke. Avoid giving estrogens or any agents promoting clot formation. EXAM TIPS Distinguish the drugs used for abortive treatment versus chronic prophylaxis. Answer options may list the drug class instead of the generic name. Temporal Arteritis (Giant Cell Arteritis) Acute onset of a unilateral headache that is located on the temple and is associated with temporal artery inflammation. A systemic inflammatory disorder (vasculitis) of the medium 319263 and large arteries of the body. Mean age of diagnosis is 72 years of age. Visual loss is not uncommon and occurs in 15% to 20% of patients (despite availability of steroids). Classic Case An older man complains of headache on his temple along with marked scalp tenderness on the same side. Presence of an indurated cord-like temporal artery that is warm and tender. Sometimes accompanied by jaw claudication (pain with chewing that is relieved when he stops chewing). Complains of visual symptoms such as amaurosis fugax (transient monocular loss of vision or partial visual field defect) or blindness. Can be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as low-grade fever and fatigue. Sedimentation rate is markedly elevated (see Table 12.1 ). Labs Check ESR/sedimentation rate (often reaches 100 mm/hr or more) Normal range is between 0 to 22 mm/hr (men) and 0 to 29 mm/hr (women) Check the CRP, which will be elevated Treatment Plan Refer to ophthalmologist, rheumatologist, or refer to ED stat Temporal artery biopsy is definitive test (gold standard) and is done by an ophthalmologist or surgeon High-dosed steroids are part of first-line treatment (prednisone 40-60 mg PO daily) Complications Permanent blindness may occur if not diagnosed early (ischemic optic neuropathy) EXAM TIPS Temporal arteritis is treated with high-dosed prednisone for several weeks. Referral to rheumatology specialist for management. Sedimentation rate is screening test for temporal arteritis (elevated). Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) PMR patients are at very high risk (up to 40%-50%) of developing temporal arteritis. Educate patients diagnosed with PMR on how to recognize symptoms of temporal arteritis. Signs/symptoms : Bilateral joint stiffness and aching (lasting 30 minutes or longer, commonly in the morning hours) located in the shoulders, neck, hips, and torso (difficulty putting on clothes/bra, having difficulty getting up out of bed or a chair). Females 50 years of age or older are commonly affected. Symptoms usually respond quickly to oral steroids (i.e., prednisone daily). 320264 CLINICAL PEARLS If history and physical exam are suggestive, treat with oral steroids as soon as possible. Order sedimentation rate and CRP. Both will be elevated. Serial labs (ESR, CRP) should be ordered until symptoms improve and should be monitored frequently. Trigeminal Neuralgia (Tic Douloureux) The trigeminal (V2), and the mandibular (V3) branches. Most cases are caused by compression of the nerve root by an artery or tumor, causing a unilateral facial pain that follows one of the branches of the trigeminal nerve. The pain is usually located close to the nasal border and the cheeks. There are two types. Type 1 involves extreme, shock-like facial pain, lasting from seconds to 2 minutes per episode, which may last up to 2 hours at a time. Type 2 is constant, aching, burning facial pain of lower intensity. May also occur together. More common in women and peaks in their 60s (see Table 12.1 ). Classic Case An older woman complains of the sudden onset of severe and sharp shooting pains on one side of her face or around the nose that are triggered by chewing, eating cold foods, and cold air. The severe lacerating pain (piercing knife-like pain) lasts a few seconds. The patient may stop chewing or speaking momentarily (few seconds) if it causes the pain. Treatment Plan Administer high doses of anticonvulsants such as used an anticonvulsant. Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) most recently used as first-line drug with fewer side effects. Gabapentin and topiramate also used effectively. Obtain MRI or CT scan to rule out a tumor/artery pressing on a nerve or multiple sclerosis (MS). Bell's Palsy Abrupt onset of unilateral facial paralysis due to dysfunction of the motor branch of the facial nerve (CN VII). Facial paralysis can progress rapidly within 24 hours. Skin sensation remains intact, but tear production on the affected side may stop. Most cases resolve spontaneously. Etiology ranges from viral infection, an autoimmune process, or pressure from a tumor or blood vessel. Classic Case An older adult reports waking up that morning with one side of his face paralyzed. Complains of difficulty chewing and swallowing food on the same side. Unable to fully 321265 close eyelids. Treatment Plan Rule out stroke, TIA, mastoid infections, bone fracture, Lyme disease, and tumor Administer corticosteroids at high doses \u00d7 10 days (wean) Administer acyclovir (Zovirax) if herpes simplex suspected Protect cornea from drying and ulceration with applications of an eye lubricant (a.m.) and lubricating ointment at bedtime; patch eye if patient is unable to fully close the eyelid to protect the eye from injury Complications Can cause corneal ulceration. Prolonged cases (several weeks) may leave permanent neurological sequelae, such as permanent facial weakness, in up to 10% of patients. Cluster Headache An idiopathic and severe one-sided headache that is marked by recurrent episodes of brief \"ice-pick\" (lacerating pain) located behind one eye that is accompanied by tearing and clear rhinitis (see Table 12.1 ). Abrupt onset; may get agitated during a headache episode The attacks happen several times a day (cluster) Resolves spontaneously, but may return in the future in some patients More common in adult males in their 30s to 40s Classic Case A 35-year-old man complains of the abrupt onset of recurrent episodes of brief \"ice-pick\" (lacerating pain) headaches behind one eye that are accompanied by autonomic symptoms such as tearing and clear nasal discharge (rhinitis). Some may have drooping eyelid (ptosis). Treatment Plan Acute treatment: High-dose oxygen may relieve headache (100% oxygen at least 12 L/min by mask); continue oxygen treatment for 15 minutes. Do not use this treatment if a patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Administer sumatriptan (Imitrex) by injection or intranasal route Prophylaxis: If chronic, verapamil PO daily is effective for use as prophylaxis Complications Higher risk of suicide (males) compared with the other types of chronic headaches Muscle Tension Headache Emotional/psychic stress in some people causes the muscles of the scalp and the neck to become chronically tense (or in contraction). This is a bilateral headache. Classic Case 322266 An adult patient complains of a headache that is \"band-like\" and feels like \"someone is squeezing my head.\" The pain is described as dull and constant. Often accompanied by tensing of the neck muscles (see Table 12.1 ). The headache may last several days. Patient reports recent increased life stressor(s). Treatment Plan NSAIDs, such as naproxen sodium (Anaprox DS), BID or mg QID analgesics (acetaminophen QID) or aspirin PRN Narcotics and butalbital are habit forming and increase the risk of rebound headaches Combination over-the-counter (OTC) medications of analgesics/aspirin plus caffeine (Anacin, Excedrin, others); use with caution due to increased risk of addictive use of these medications Stress reduction and relaxation: Try yoga, tai chi; exercise several times per week; gradually reduce and stop caffeine intake; follow a regular eating/sleep schedule; pursue counseling with therapist Rebound Headache Patient complains of daily headaches (or almost daily headaches). May be accompanied by irritability, depression, and insomnia. Caused by overuse of abortive medicines such as analgesics, NSAIDs, aspirin, or narcotics. Treatment is to discontinue the medicine immediately (if not contraindicated) or to gradually taper the dose and/or reduce frequency. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) A TIA is a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal ischemia (brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia) without acute infarction of the brain as seen in stroke. The timing for resolution (24 hours, included in previous definition) has been removed. It is now known that permanent neurological damage can occur with TIAs (as seen in cerebrovascular accidents [CVAs], or strokes). TIA is also known as a \"mini-stroke\" or \"minor stroke.\" These patients are at very high risk for severe stroke in the future. Depending on severity of the TIA, the signs and symptoms can be subtle to severe. The longer the episode of the TIA, the higher the risk of ischemic brain damage. The TIA can progress into a full-blown stroke. Signs and symptoms of CVA or stroke can be insidious and start a few days before the major episode occurs. Note Up to 20% of patients with TIA will have a stroke within 90 days, and from 25% to 50% of these strokes occur within the first 48 hours. Classic Case Adult to elderly male patient reports acute onset of one-sided weakness of the right 323arm and right leg accompanied by dizziness, vertigo, and poor balance. The patient is difficult to understand because his speech is slurred (dysphasia). When instructed to smile and grimace, the right side of his face has no movement and is lopsided. Patient is accompanied by a spouse who reports that he has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. If symptoms progress to stroke, one-sided weakness worsens and level of consciousness ranges from confusion, stupor, to coma. If a TIA episode, the signs and symptoms eventually resolve, but patient remains at higher risk of future stroke. \"FAST\" Mnemonic for Recognizing Stroke F Face drooping (Instruct patient to smile. Is face lopsided?) A Arm weakness (Instruct patient to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?) S Speech difficulty (Instruct patient to say, \"The sky is blue.\") T Time to call 911 (Even if symptoms go away, call 911.) (Do not delay; American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, n.d.) Hospitalization Criteria Consider hospitalization within first 24 to 48 hours if: Patient's first TIA or duration of TIA is 1 hour or longer High risk for cardiac emboli (e.g., atrial fibrillation) Symptomatic internal carotid stenosis greater than 50% Hypercoagulable state Crescendo TIAs (two or more TIAs in 1 week) High ABCD2 score ( Table 12.2 ; higher scores are associated with higher risk of stroke at 2, 7, 30, and 90 days after TIA) Treatment Plan Refer patient to ED for further evaluation. Find out cause of TIA (or stroke) such as atrial fibrillation, carotid/vertebral atherosclerosis, hypercoagulable state, cocaine use, hypertension, etc. Perform workup to find the extent of brain damage. Schedule CT and/or MRI scan as soon as possible (within first 24 hours of the episode). The diffusion-weighted MRI is the preferred imaging method. Rule out intracranial hemorrhage before starting aspirin (50-325 mg/d), plus extended- or clopidogrel. Maintain blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. Table 12.2 ABCD2 Score Risk Factor Points Score Age >65 years 1 BP: Systolic 140 mmHg or diastolic 90 mmHg 1 Clinical features of TIA (choose one only) 2 Unilateral weakness with/without speech impairment 1 Speech impairment without unilateral weakness Duration TIA duration >60 minutes 2 324267 TIA duration 10-59 minutes 1 Diabetes 1 Total ABCD2 score (0-7) BP, blood pressure; TIA, transient ischemic attack. Scores: Four to 5 points (hospitalization justified in most situations); 6 to 7 points (hospitalization observation worthwhile). Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) or Stroke A stroke can be caused either by emboli/thrombosis or by hemorrhage. In both, permanent neurological damage results from ischemia to the affected brain tissues. The most common risk factors for stroke are atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Other risk factors include aneurysms, trauma, bleeding abnormalities and use of anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin [Coumadin]), use of stimulants (cocaine/illicit drugs), sickle cell disease, diabetes, oral contraceptive use, smoking, and thrompophilia. Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indian/Alaskan Natives have a higher prevalence of stroke. The sources of bleeding can be intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). An ischemic stroke is due to emboli that broke off from thrombus formation in the body; common locations are the lower extremities and the heart (atrial fibrillation). Classic Case A patient with embolic stroke presents with the abrupt onset of difficulty speaking, unilateral hemiparesis, and weakness of the arms or legs (or both). Patients with hemorrhagic stroke often initially present with severe headache, nausea/vomiting, photophobia, and nuchal rigidity that is accompanied by hemiparesis and difficulty speaking. Hemorrhagic Stroke SAH or ICH: Sudden onset of severe \"thunderclap\" headache that is described as \"the worst headache of my life.\" The pain from the headache may radiate to the neck or back. Rapid decrease in level of consciousness (coma, death). SAH usually begins abruptly compared to more gradual ICH. Vomiting is more common in hemorrhagic strokes (compared with embolic strokes). Usually caused by a ruptured aneurysm or vascular malformations. \"Sentinel headache\" may be seen in SAH. About 30% of patients have minor hemorrhagic episodes that present with sudden severe headache as the only symptom. Acute Ischemic Stroke Signs and symptoms are dependent on artery involved. For example: Left middle cerebral artery: Right side of face, right arm, right leg with aphasia (expressive, receptive, or both) Right middle cerebral artery: Left side of face, left arm, left leg with hemineglect and possible hemianopsia Treatment Plan 325268 Call 911 Assess the \"ABCs\" as soon as possible; check for airway patency, chest movement, breath sounds from both lungs, and circulation Check vital signs and neuro status Emergency Department Management Assess the ABCs and stabilize patient Initial imaging study in the ED is CT scan (without contrast), then an MRI study; decide whether patient is a candidate for antithrombolytic therapy, interventional radiological procedures, and so on Labs PT, PTT, INR CBC with differential and platelet count Serum blood glucose Total lipid profile (cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides) EKG (rule out acute MI) Electrolytes, creatinine, urea nitrogen Screening for Visual Field Loss Homonymous hemianopsia: Visual field loss involving either the two left halves (or the two right halves) of the visual field; most common cause is stroke; there are many types of hemianopsia. Perform screening test: Visual fields by confrontation Example: Left-Sided Homonymous Hemianopsia The diagram at right shows the intact and missing visual fields of a person who has left-sided homonymous hemianopsia. The \"x\" signifies the missing visual fields and the equal signs \"==\" are the intact visual field. Left Eye xxxxx==== xxxxx==== xxxxx==== Right Eye Temporal Lobe Patient has difficulty performing purposeful movements. Broca's aphasia : Also known as \"nonfluent aphasia.\" Patient comprehends speech relatively well (and can read), but has extreme difficulty with the motor aspects of speech. Speech length is usually less than four words. Wernicke's aphasia : Also known as \"fluent aphasia.\" Patient has difficulty with comprehension, but has no problem with producing speech. Reading and writing can be markedly impaired. Frontal lobe damage : The frontal lobes are the areas where intelligence, executive skills, logic, and personality reside. Damage will cause dementia, memory loss/difficulties, inability to learn, etc. Long-Term Management 326269 Remove or treat the cause of the emboli (e.g., strokes: Avoid heparin, warfarin, aspirin Rehabilitation: Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy Patient should be in the care of a neurologist after stroke Primary care NPs do not start anticoagulation for stroke; needs physician or AGAC-NP Common Drugs: Headache Treatment ( Table 12.3 QID Side effects: GI pain/bleeding/ulceration, damage, increased BP in hypertension Triptans Administer sumatriptan (Imitrex) injection, inhalant, PO tablets, or sublingual tablets Side effects: Nausea, acute MI, etc. Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities Triptans should not be given within 24 hours of an ergot Do not give within 14 days of an MAOI Table 12.3 Treatment of Headaches Headache Acute Treatment Prophylaxis/Other Migraine Ice pack on forehead; rest in quiet and darkened room TCAs Episodic migraine (<14 headache to ED or ophthalmologist stat . Lab: ESR (sed rate) (screening lab test) Permanent blindness can result; temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard diagnosis High-dose steroids Cluster 100% oxygen at 12 L/min; use mask; Dilantin for several weeks to months; watch for drug interactions Muscle tension NSAIDs, Tylenol, hot bath/shower, massage, etc. Stress reduction, Medications Topiramate (Topamax) BID Requires titration to maximum dose of 100 mg/24 hr Should not be prescribed in patients with a history of kidney stones Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) Commonly caused by activities that require repetitive wrist/hand motion. Both hands affected in 50% of patients. Median nerve ( Figure 12.2 ) compression due to swelling of the carpal tunnel. Other factors that increase risk are hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and obesity. Classic Case An adult patient who uses his hands frequently for his job (i.e., computer typing) complains of gradual onset (over weeks to months) of numbness and tingling (paresthesias) on the thumb, index finger, and middle finger areas. Hand grip of affected hand(s) is weaker. May complain of problems lifting heavy objects with the affected hand. Chronic severe cases involve atrophy of the thenar eminence (the group of muscles on the palm of the hand at the base of the thumb), which is a late sign. History of an occupation or hobby that involves frequent wrist/hand movements. Tinel's Sign ( Figure 12.3 ) Tap anterior wrist briskly Positive finding : \"Pins and needles\" sensation of the median nerve over the hand after lightly percussing the wrist Phalen's Sign ( Figure 12.4 ) Engage in full flexion of wrist for 60 seconds Positive finding : Tingling sensation of the median nerve over the hand evoked by passive flexion of the wrist for 1 minute 328Figure 12.2 Median nerve. Figure 12.3 Tinel's sign. 329271 Figure 12.4 Phalen's sign. EXAM TIPS Recognize both Tinel's and Phalen's signs (tests for carpal tunnel syndrome). Learn classic presentation of CTS (inflammation of the median nerve). Alternative headache remedy is an herb called butterburr. With the exception of muscle tension headaches, which are bilateral, all of the headaches seen on the exam (and notes) are unilateral. Muscle tension: Causes band-like head pain; may last for days. Migraine: Presents with throbbing, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia. Cluster: Only headache accompanied by tearing and nasal congestion; severe pain is behind one eye/one side of head. Occurs several times a day. Spontaneously resolves. Seen more in middle-aged males. Treated with high-dose oxygen (contraindicated in COPD). Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux): Pain on one side of face/cheek is precipitated by talking, chewing, cold food, or cold air on affected area. Temporal arteritis: Indurated temporal artery, pain felt behind eye/scalp. Treated with high dose steroids or other anti-inflammatory medication. Untreated may lead 330272 to blindness. Always order cerebral imaging for patients with a change in their usual headache pattern (change in frequency, duration, severity, location, etc.). 331273 13 Hematological System Review DANGER SIGNALS Acute Hemorrhage Blood loss of 15% or higher results in orthostatic hypotension (systolic BP drop of >20 mmHg). Look for signs and symptoms of shock. When checking the CBC, be aware that the initial hemoglobin and hematocrit (during active bleeding) may be in the normal range. The correct hemoglobin value will not show up until about 24 hours after onset of the hemorrhage. The normal bone marrow will respond to blood loss by releasing immature RBCs (reticulocytosis). Neutropenia Individuals with neutropenia have frequent infections (especially bacterial) with symptoms of fever, sore throat, oral thrush, and so forth. Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 1,500/mm 3 . African Americans may have a lower ANC count that is \"benign\" (bone marrow aspirate normal). Vitamin B 12 Deficiency Gradual onset of symmetrical peripheral neuropathy starting in the feet and/or arms. Other neurological signs are numbness, ataxia (positive Romberg test), loss of vibration and position sense, impaired memory, and dementia (severe cases). Peripheral smear shows macro-ovalocytes, some megaloblasts, and multisegmented to six lobes). Hodgkin's Lymphoma 332274 A cancer of the beta lymphocytes (B cells). Night sweats, fevers, and pain with ingestion of alcoholic drinks. Generalized pruritus with painless enlarged lymph nodes (neck). Anorexia and weight loss. Higher incidence among young adults (20-40 years) or older adults (>60 years), males, and Whites. Identified by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells. Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma A cancer of the lymphocytes (usually B cells) and killer cells. Usually occurs in the older adult (>65 years) and presents with night sweats, fever, weight loss, generalized lymphadenopathy (painless). The prognosis is poor. Multiple Myeloma A cancer of the plasma cells. Symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and bone pain that is usually located in the back or chest. Causes proteinuria with Bence-Jones proteins, hypercalcemia, normocytic anemia. More common in older adults. Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000/ L. Symptoms usually do not show until the platelet count is less than 100,000/ L. Look for easy bruising (ecchymosis, petechiae), bleeding gums, spontaneous nosebleeds, hematuria, etc. Normal platelet count : Range is from 150,000-450,000/ L. Easy Bruising Bruising on the distal lower and upper extremities is usually related to physical activities. Children commonly have bruises on the anterior shin area. The presence of petechiae and/or purpura, large hematomas (from mild trauma) not accompanied by other symptoms (fever, headaches, infection) is suspicious. Check medications (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], NSAIDs, heparin, warfarin, selective serotonin reuptake steroids, Evaluate patient for a possible coagulation disorder (von Willebrand disease, vitamin C deficiency or scurvy, etc.). Initial labs to order are CBC, PT, and PTT. Platelet count greater than 150,000/ L is normal (rules out thrombocytopenia). LABORATORY TESTING Laboratory Norms Hemoglobin Males : 14.0 to 18.0 g/dL Females : 12.0 to polycythemia) Hematocrit 333275 The proportion of RBCs in 1 mL of plasma Males : 42% to 52% Females : 37% to 47% Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) Normal: 80 to 100 fL (femtoliter) A measure of the average size of the RBCs in a sample of blood MCV less than 80 fL with microcytic anemia MCV between 80 and 100 fL with normocytic anemia MCV more than 100 fL with macrocytic anemia Mean Corpuscular Hgb Concentration (MCHC) A measure of the average color of the RBCs in a sample of blood Decreased in iron-deficiency anemia and thalassemia (hypochromic); normal in macrocytic and normocytic anemias Normal : 31.0 to 37.0 g/dL Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) Indirect measure of the color of RBCs. Decreased values mean pale or hypochromic RBCs. MCH is decreased in iron-deficiency anemia and thalassemia. Normal with the macrocytic anemias. Normal : Range is 25.0 to 35.0 pg/cell. Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC) A measure of available transferrin that is left unbound (to iron). Transferrin is used to transport iron in the body. Elevated if there is not enough iron to transport (as seen with iron-deficiency anemia). Normal TIBC is seen with thalassemia, vitamin B 12 deficiency, and folate-deficiency anemia (because iron levels are normal). Normal : Range is 250 to 410 mcg/dL. Serum Ferritin Serum ferritin is the stored form of iron. Produced in the intestines. Stored in body tissue such as the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Correlates with iron storage status in a healthy adult. Most sensitive test for iron-deficiency anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia : Serum ferritin is markedly decreased. Thalassemia trait : Levels are normal to high. May be high if patient was misdiagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia and erroneously given iron supplementation. Avoid iron supplements before testing serum ferritin level. Normal : Range is 20 to 400 ng/mL. Serum Iron Decreased in iron-deficiency anemia. Normal to high in thalassemia and the macrocytic anemias. Not as sensitive as ferritin. Affected by recent blood transfusions. Normal : Range is 50 to 175 mcg/dL. Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) 334276 A measure of the variability of the size of RBCs in a given sample. Elevated in iron- deficiency anemia and thalassemia. Reticulocytes Immature RBCs that still have their nuclei. Reticulocytes are slightly larger in size than a RBC. After 24 hours in circulation, reticulocytes lose their nuclei and mature into RBCs (no nuclei). The bone marrow normally will release small amounts to replace damaged RBCs. RBCs survive 120 days before being sequestered by the spleen and broken down by the liver into iron and globulin (recycled) and bilirubin (bile). Normal : Range is 0.5% to 2.5% (of total RBC count). Reticulocytosis (More Than 2.5% of Total RBC Count) An elevation of reticulocytes is seen when the bone marrow is stimulated into producing RBCs. It is elevated with supplementation of iron, folate, or vitamin B 12 (after deficiency), after acute bleeding episodes, hemolysis, leukemia, and with erythropoietin (EPO) treatment. Chronic bleeding does not cause elevation of the reticulocytes due to compensation. If no reticulocytosis after an acute bleeding episode (after 3 to 4 days), hemolysis, or after appropriate supplementation of deficient mineral (iron, folate, or vitamin B 12 ), or with EPO, rule out bone marrow failure (i.e., aplastic anemia). Diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy. Poikilocytosis (Peripheral Smear) Seen with severe iron-deficiency anemia. RBCs abnormal with variable shapes seen in the peripheral smear. May be accompanied by anisocytosis (variable sizes of RBCs). Serum Folate and Vitamin B 12 Low values if deficiency exists. Deficiency will cause a macrocytic anemia. Normal folate level : Range is 3.1 to 17.5 ng/mL. Normal vitamin B 12 level : More than 250 pg/mL is normal. White Blood Cells With Differential White cell differential : Percentage of each type of leukocyte in a sample of blood. The differential for each type of WBC should add up to a total of 100%. Normal WBC count (child older than 2 years to adults) is 5.0 to 10.0 \u00d7 10 9 (5,000 to 10,000/10 mm or segs (segmented The gold-standard (definitive) test to diagnose hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell anemia, the thalassemias, and many others. Normal hemoglobin contains two alpha and two beta chains. Adult norms : Hemoglobin A (HbA) 97% and hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) 2.5%. An extremely small amount (<1%) of total hemoglobin is fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is a normal finding. Secondary Polycythemia Chronic smokers, individuals with long-term chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), long-term residence at high altitudes, or EPO treatment have a higher incidence of secondary polycythemia (as opposed to primary polycythemia vera). Polycythemia is defined as: Hematocrit in adults of more than 48% (women) and more than 52% (men) Hemoglobin in adults of more than 16.5% (women) and more than 18.5% (men) High-Altitude Stress Lower barometric pressure causes a reduction in the arterial PO 2 . Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), or sickle cell anemia are at higher risk of complications. DISEASE REVIEW ANEMIAS Anemia is simply defined as a decrease in the hemoglobin/hematocrit value below the norm for the patient's age and gender. See Table 13.1 for laboratory characteristics. Iron-Deficiency Anemia Microcytic and hypochromic anemia (small and pale RBCs) are caused by iron deficiency. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia in the world for all races, ages, and gender. Classic Case Pallor of the skin, conjunctiva, and nail beds. Complaints of daily fatigue and exertional dyspnea. May have glossitis (sore and shiny red tongue) and angular cheilitis (irritated skin or fissures at the corners of the mouth). Cravings for nonfood items such as ice or dirt (pica). Severe anemia will cause spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia), systolic murmurs, 336tachycardia, or heart failure. Etiology Most common cause is blood loss (overt or occult). Reproductive-aged females (heavy periods, pregnancy), poor diet, GI blood loss, postgastrectomy, and increased physiologic requirement are risk factors. Infants : Rule out chronic intake of cow's milk before 12 months of age (causes GI bleeding) in anemic infants. Labs Decreased Hemoglobin and hematocrit MCV less than 80 fL MCHC (paler color) Ferritin and iron level Increased TIBC Peripheral Smear Anisocytosis (variations in size) and poikilocytosis (variations in shape) Table 13.1 Laboratory Findings: Anemia Type of Anemia Diagnostic Tests Red Blood Cell Changes Iron deficiency Ferritin/serum minor Hemoglobin electrophoresis Abnormal if if MCHC (hypochromic) Pernicious anemia Antiparietal antibodies Most common cause of vitamin B 12 - deficiency anemia MCV >100 fL (macrocytic) Normal B B 12 level Hypersegmented fL (normal-sized RBCs) History of inflammatory disease such as Normochromic RBCs 337278 rheumatoid arthritis Sickle cell anemia Hemoglobin electrophoresis Sickle-shaped RBCs with shortened life span of 10 to 20 days (norm is 120 days) HbS and HbF both elevated Reticulocytosis A hemolytic anemia and target cells (peripheral smear) Normocytic/normochromic Note: Boldfaced lab tests are diagnostic or the gold standard for the exams. HbF, fetal hemoglobin; HbS, hemoglobin RDW, red cell distribution width; TIBC, total iron-binding capacity. Treatment Plan Identify cause of anemia and correct cause (if possible). Rule out GI malignancy. Ferrous sulfate 325 mg PO TID between meals (take with vitamin C or orange juice for better absorption). Treat iron-deficiency anemia from 3 to 6 months to restore ferritin stores. Use of cast-iron cookware also provides additional iron. Increase fiber and fluids. Consider fiber supplements (psyllium, guar gum) for constipation. Iron-rich foods are red meat, some beans (e.g., black beans), and green leafy vegetables. Common side effects of iron : Constipation, black-colored stools, stomach upset may occur. Interactions : Avoid taking iron supplement at the same time as antacids, dairy products, quinolones, or tetracyclines (inactivates iron). Check the reticulocyte count and CBC approximately 2 weeks after starting supplementation to check for treatment response (elevated reticulocytes, hemoglobin/hematocrit will increase). Pernicious anemia : Initially, give B 12 injections 1,000 mcg (1 mg) per week for 4 weeks; then monthly B 12 injections for lifetime. Alternative is very high oral doses of B 12 (1,000-2,000 mcg) PO daily. Oral vitamin B 12 replacement may be as effective as parenteral vitamin B 12 . Parenteral replacement should be used for patients with neurologic changes and/or concerns regarding gastric absorption of vitamin B 12 . Thalassemia Minor (or Trait) A genetic disorder in which the bone marrow produces abnormal hemoglobin (defective alpha- or beta-globin chains). Normal hemoglobin contains two alpha and two beta chains. Results in a microcytic/hypochromic anemia. Ethnic groups : Occurs in people from the Mediterranean, North Africa, Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Alpha thalassemia is more common in Southeast Asians (Chinese, Cambodians, Filipinos, Thai people). 338279 Classic Case Vast majority of individuals are asymptomatic. Discovered incidentally because of abnormal CBC results, which reveal microcytic and hypochromic RBCs. Total RBC count may be mildly elevated. Ethnic background is either Mediterranean or Asian. Treatment Plan Gold-standard diagnostic test : Hemoglobin electrophoresis In beta-thalassemia, abnormal (elevated hemoglobin, HbA2, HgF) In poikilocytosis ferritin and Normal (but low in iron-deficiency anemia) Genetic counseling: Educate about the possibility of having a child with the disease if partner also has trait (25% chance, or one in four, of their children) Thalassemia minor/trait does not need treatment (asymptomatic genetic disease) Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Anemia of CKD is a hypoproliferative, normocytic, and normochromic anemia. Defined as hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL in pregnant women, less than 12 g/dL in nonpregnant women, and less than 13 g/dL in men. Occurs due to the decrease in renal EPO production secondary to the CKD, which reduces the production of reticulocyte and RBC production and causes worsening anemia. In addition, patients may also have functional iron deficiency and/or acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. Initial testing : Obtain CBC, serum ferritin, and reticulocyte count. Treatment Plan The anemia should be treated using conventional methods. If not improving, then erythropoiesis-stimulating agents should be used. Iron therapy (PO or IV) may also be used. PO iron may be used for patients not treated with dialysis. IV iron is used for hemodialysis patients and/or other patients with severe iron deficiency. EXAM TIPS The screening test for all anemias is the CBC (hemoglobin/hematocrit). The diagnostic test for thalassemia and sickle cell anemia is the hemoglobin electrophoresis. Learn to differentiate the lab results of thalassemia from iron-deficiency anemia. If the ferritin level is low, the patient has iron-deficiency anemia. If the ferritin level is normal to high, the patient has thalassemia minor/trait. The ethnic background may not be \"revealed\" in a question about thalassemia. 339280 Patients with chronic illness and/or autoimmune disease have higher risk of normocytic anemia. CLINICAL PEARLS Best absorbed form of iron supplementation (and cheapest) is ferrous sulfate (available over the counter [OTC]). If patient took an antacid, wait about 4 hours before taking iron pill (minimizes binding). Iron interacts with tetracycline antibiotics, levothyroxine, and bisphosphonates (decreases effectiveness). To avoid, take iron 2 hours before or after antibiotic. Failure to respond (if treatment compliant) may be a sign of continuing blood loss, misdiagnosis (has thalassemia instead of iron-deficiency anemia), malabsorption (i.e., celiac disease). Iron poisoning in children (especially if age <6 years) may cause death. Advise patient to store iron supplements in an area that is not accessible to children (or to grandchildren). Medications reported to lower hemoglobin levels and worsen anemia include angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in of diseases (CKD, diabetes, chronic HF, hypertension). Aplastic Anemia Aplastic anemia is caused by destruction of the pluripotent stem cells inside the bone marrow and has multiple causes (radiation, adverse effect of a drug, viral infection, others). Bone marrow production slows or stops\u2014all cell lines are affected. The result is pancytopenia (leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia). Classic Case Patient with severe case of anemia presents with fatigue and weakness. Skin and mucosa are a pale color. Tachycardia and systolic flow murmur are present. Neutropenia results in bacterial and fungal infections. Thrombocytopenia results in large bruises from trauma and bleeding. Signs and symptoms depend on the severity of the aplastic anemia. Labs CBC with differential Platelet count Gold standard is the bone marrow biopsy Treatment Plan Refer to hematologist as soon as possible. If septic, refer to the emergency department. Macrocytic/Megaloblastic Anemias 340281 Vitamin B 12 -Deficiency Anemia Caused by a deficiency in vitamin B 12 , which is necessary for the health of the neurons and the brain, and for normal DNA production of RBCs. Total body supply of vitamin B 12 lasts from 3 to 4 years. Common causes of vitamin B 12 -deficiency anemia include malabsorption (due to pernicious anemia, gastric disease/infections or medications such as antacids, H2-receptor antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors and metformin). Chronic vitamin B 12 deficiency causes nerve damage (i.e., peripheral neuropathy, paraplegia) and brain damage (dementia if severe). Neurologic damage may not be reversible. Highest incidence in older women. Most common cause is pernicious anemia. Pernicious Anemia An autoimmune disorder caused by the destruction of parietal cells in the fundus (by antiparietal antibodies) resulting in cessation of intrinsic factor production. Intrinsic factor is necessary in order to absorb vitamin B 12 from the small intestine. Cobalamin (vitamin B 12 ) deficiency may result from dietary insufficiency of vitamin B 12 . May occur in patients with stomach, small bowel, and pancreatic disorders; infections; and severe dietary deficiencies of meats and milk, as seen in strict vegetarians. Dietary deficiency may take more than 5 years to occur. Iron deficiency commonly coexists with pernicious anemia. Patients with pernicious anemia have a two- to threefold increase in incidence of gastric carcinoma. Other causes of vitamin B 12 deficiency : Alterations in gastric anatomy (i.e., bariatric surgery, gastrectomy), strict vegans, alcoholics, small bowel disease Vitamin B 12 sources : All foods of animal origin (meat, poultry, eggs, milk, cheese) Classic Case Older to elderly woman complains of gradual onset of paresthesias on her feet and/or hands that is slowly getting more severe. She has pallor, pale conjunctiva, glossitis, and other signs of anemia. Neuropathic symptoms may include any of the following: Tingling/numbness of hands and feet Neuropathy starts in peripheral nerves and migrates centrally Difficulty walking (gross motor) Difficulty in performing fine motor skills (hands) Objective Findings Decreased reflexes in affected extremity. If the legs are involved, the ankle jerk (Achilles reflex) will be reduced (\"+1\" is sluggish and \"0\" is none). Normal reflex is grade \"+2.\" Motor tests : Weak hand grip, decreased vibration sense, abnormal Romberg, and so forth. Inflamed tongue, or glossitis (not a specific finding because it is found in other disorders) are seen. Warning Always check both serum B 12 and serum folate levels in macrocytic anemia. A patient can 341be deficient in both B 12 and folate. The hemoglobin and hematocrit will go up with folate supplementation only (even if still deficient in B 12 ). Untreated B 12 deficiency anemia results in permanent neurologic sequelae (neuropathy, brain damage). Treatment Plan Check for both vitamin B 12 level and folate level (both levels must always be checked together). Decreased vitamin B 12 level (<150 pg/mL) Antibody tests : Antiparietal and anti-intrinsic factor (IF) antibody 24-hour urine test for methylmalonic acid (MMA): elevated Homocysteine level : Elevated in vitamin B 12 (and folate) deficiency Schilling test : Not commonly used now; positive if vitamin B 12 (radioactive) excretion is normal after administration of intrinsic factor (but has poor excretion when given vitamin B 12 alone) Peripheral blood smear : Macrocytosis, hypersegmented neutrophils (more than 5 to 6 lobes), evidence of defective erythropoiesis Check the reticulocyte count and CBC approximately 2 weeks after starting supplementation to check for treatment response (elevated reticulocytes, hemoglobin/hematocrit will increase). Medications Pernicious anemia : Initially, give B 12 injections 1,000 mcg (1 mg) per week for 4 weeks; then monthly B 12 injections for lifetime. Alternative is very high oral doses of B 12 (1,000-2,000 mcg) PO daily. Oral vitamin B 12 replacement may be as effective as parenteral vitamin B 12 . Parenteral replacement should be used for patients with neurologic changes and/or concerns regarding gastric absorption of vitamin B 12 . EXAM TIPS Pernicious anemia results in: Vitamin B 12 -deficiency anemia Macrocytic/megaloblastic normochromic anemia Neurologic symptoms A cheap screening test for sickle cell is the Sickledex, but the gold standard is hemoglobin electrophoresis. Every state in the United States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories requires that every newborn be tested for sickle cell disease as part of the newborn screening test after birth. If the parietal antibody test (antiparietal antibody) and/or the intrinsic factor antibody test (anti-IF) are elevated, the patient has pernicious anemia. 342282 CLINICAL PEARLS In a person with normal bone marrow, supplementing the deficient substance (iron, B12, folate) will cause the hemoglobin/hematocrit to increase starting at 1 to 2 weeks; the hemoglogin/hematocrit will be back to normal within 4 to 8 weeks. Serum vitamin B 12 levels may be normal in up to 5% of patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency. Do not rely on vitamin B 12 levels alone. Also check antibodies, urine MMA, etc. Missing a diagnosis of vitamin B 12 deficiency can result in irreversible neurological damage. Any patient complaining of neuropathy or who has dementia should have vitamin B 12 levels checked. Almost one out of every 500 African Americans in the United States has sickle cell anemia. Folic Acid-Deficiency Anemia Deficiency in folate results in damage to the DNA of RBCs, which causes macrocytosis (MCV >100 fL). The body's supply of folate lasts 2 to 3 months. Does not cause neurologic damage. Most common cause : Inadequate dietary intake (elderly, infants, alcoholics, overcooking vegetables, low citrus intake). Chronic alcoholism and poor nutrition contribute to a decrease in the amount of vitamin B 12 released from dietary proteins. Other causes : Increased physiologic need (pregnancy), malabsorption (gluten enteropathy) cause folic acid-deficiency Classic Case Elderly patient and/or alcoholic older man complains of anemia signs/symptoms (tiredness, fatigue, pallor, and a reddened and sore tongue, or glossitis). No neurological complaints. If anemia is severe (applies to all anemias), may have tachycardia, palpitations, angina, or HF. Treatment Plan CBC : Decreased hemoglobin hematocrit, increased MCV Peripheral smear : Macro-ovalocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils (more than 5 to 6 lobes) Folate level : Low (if more than 4 ng/mL, rules out folate deficiency) Food sources : Leafy green vegetables (kale, collard greens), grains, beans, liver Medications Correct primary cause. Improve diet. Stop overcooking vegetables. Administer folic acid PO 1 to 5 mg/d. Treat until RBC indicators and anemia are 343283 normal. Women of childbearing age: It is recommended that all women who may become pregnant take a folic acid supplement, 400 mcg daily, at least 1 month (or longer) prior to conception to enhance normal fetal development and decrease the incidence of neural tube defects. Women who have had a previous child born with a neural tube defect require higher doses of folic acid, 4 mg daily. Sickle Cell Anemia Sickle cell anemia is a genetic hemolytic anemia (autosomal recessive). It takes many forms, ranging from sickle cell trait to various forms of full-blown disease. Persons with sickle cell anemia have an increased resistance to malarial infection ( Plasmodium falciparum from mosquito bite). Higher risk of death from infection with encapsulated bacteria (i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae , etc.) due to hyposplenia. Patients with splenectomy (for other causes) are also at higher risk of death. In the United States, it is most commonly found in African Americans (one in 500 have the disease and more than 2 million carry the trait). Higher prevalence in people from Africa, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and some areas of India. Mean hemoglobin of about 8 g/dL and a shortened RBC life span (17 vs. 120 days). Sickledex is the screening test and hemoglobin electrophoresis is the diagnostic test Hemoglobin electrophoresis: 80% to 100% HbS, elevated HbF (no HbA) Classic Case Most patients with sickle cell trait are asymptomatic. Patients who have the full-blown sickle cell disease are extremely anemic, have frequent sickling episodes, and have painful crises (of affected organ systems). Signs and symptoms include ischemic necrosis of bones or skin, renal and/or liver dysfunction. priapism, hemolytic episodes, hyposplenism, frequent infections, others. Labs CBC is the screening test Gold-standard test is the hemoglobin electrophoresis (HbS) Treatment Plan Refer patients with disease to hematologist. As of 2008, screening for sickle cell disease is mandatory for all states in the United States (Vinchinsky & Mahoney, 2016). Sickle cell is an autosomal recessive pattern genetic disease. Genetic counseling needed if both partners are at risk. If each parent has the sickle cell trait, one child out of four will have the disease. Prenatal screening is available as early as 8 to 10 weeks gestation via chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. EXAM TIPS 344284 If patient has anemia with MCV 76, the next step is to order TIBC, ferritin, serum iron. If ferritin/iron levels are low, patient has iron deficiency, but if these tests are normal, patient probably has thallassemia trait. Order both vitamin B 12 and folate levels when evaluating MCV greater than 100 fL (even if no neurological symptoms). Pernicious anemia results in vitamin B 12 deficiency. Pernicious anemia is a macrocytic anemia. Learn food groups for both folate and vitamin B 12 . RBC size is described in many ways, such as: MCV <80 fL: Microcytic larger than normal RBCs, or RBCs with enlarged cytoplasms Ethnic background may not be mentioned in a thalassemia problem, or it may be a distractor. Only vitamin B 12 -deficiency anemia has neurologic symptoms (tingling, numbness). SUMMARY: MICROCYTIC ANEMIAS Iron-Deficiency Anemia Versus Thalassemia Trait Ferritin Level Low in iron deficiency Normal to high in thalassemia Serum Iron Decreased in iron deficiency Normal to high in thalassemia TIBC Elevated in iron deficiency Normal or borderline thalassemia MCHC A measure of RBC color Decreased in iron deficiency Normal in thalassemia Hemoglobin Electrophoresis Normal in iron deficiency Abnormal in thalassemia Ethnic Background Ethnicity or age does not matter in iron-deficiency anemia 345Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common anemia overall in any age group, gender, or ethnicity Thalassemia is seen in people from Southeast Asia (e.g., China), the Mediterranean (e.g., Italy), North Africa (e.g., Morocco), the Middle East (e.g., Libya), and Asia (e.g., India) Alpha thalassemia is more common in Asians 346285 14 Musculoskeletal System Review DANGER SIGNALS Navicular Fracture (Scaphoid Bone Fracture; Figure 14.1 ) Wrist pain on palpation of the anatomic snuffbox. Pain on axial loading of the thumb. History of falling forward with outstretched hand (hyperextension of the wrist) to break the fall. Initial x-ray of the wrist may be normal, but a repeat x-ray in 2 weeks will show the scaphoid fracture (due to callus bone formation). High risk of avascular necrosis and nonunion. Splint wrist (thumb spica splint) and refer to a hand surgeon. Figure 14.1 Navicular space. Colles Fracture Fracture of the distal radius (with or without ulnar fracture) of the forearm along with dorsal displacement of wrist. History of falling forward with outstretched hand (as in 347286 navicular fracture). This fracture is also known as the \"dinner fork\" fracture due to the appearance of arm and wrist after the fracture. It is the most common type of wrist fracture. Hip Fracture Patient has a history of slipping or falling. Sudden onset of one-sided hip pain. Unable to walk and bear weight on affected hip. If mild fracture, may bear weight on affected hip. If displaced fracture, presence of severe hip pain with external rotation of the hip/leg (abduction) and leg shortening. More common in elderly. Elderly have a 1-year mortality rate from 12% to 37%, related to complications of immobility such as pneumonia and deep vein thrombophlebitis. Pelvic Fracture History of significant or high-energy trauma such as a motor vehicle or motorcycle accident. Signs and symptoms depend on degree of injury to the pelvic bones and other pelvic structures such as nerves, blood vessels, and pelvic organs. Look for ecchymosis and swelling in the lower abdomen, the hips, groin, and/or scrotum. May have bladder and/or fecal incontinence, vaginal or rectal bleeding, hematuria, numbness, etc. May cause internal hemorrhage, which can be life-threatening. Check airway, breathing, and circulation first (the ABCs). Cauda Equina Syndrome Acute onset of saddle anesthesia, bladder incontinence (or retention of urine), and fecal incontinence. Accompanied by bilateral leg numbness and weakness. Pressure (most common cause is a bulging disk) on a sacral nerve root results in inflammatory and ischemic changes to the nerves. A surgical emergency. Needs spinal decompression. Refer to ED. Low-Back Pain (From a Dissecting Abdominal Aneurysm) Acute and sudden onset of \"tearing\" severe low-back/abdominal pain. Presence of abdominal bruit with abdominal pulsation. Patient has signs and symptoms of shock. More common in elderly males, atherosclerosis, White race and smokers. NORMAL FINDINGS Joint Anatomy Synovial fluid : Thick serous clear fluid (sterile) that provides lubrication for the joint Cloudy synovial fluid can be indicative of infection; order C&S Synovial space : Space between two bones (the joint) filled with synovial fluid Articular cartilage : The cartilage lining the open surfaces of bones in a joint Meniscus or menisci (plural) : Crescent-shaped cartilage located in each knee; two menisci 348287 in each knee Damage to menisci may cause locking of the knees and knee instability Tendons : Connects muscles to the bone; ligaments connect bone to bone Bursae : Saclike structures located on the anterior and posterior areas of a joint that act as padding; filled with synovial fluid when inflamed (bursitis) Cloudy fluid is abnormal and is indicative of infection Benign Variants Genu recurvatum : Hyperextension or : Genu varum Bowlegs EXAM TIP valgum, think of \"gum stuck between the knees\" (knock-knees). The opposite is varus, or bowlegs. EXERCISE AND INJURIES Within the first 48 hours, acutely inflamed joints should not: Be exercised in any form (not even isometric exercises) Have applications of heat of any form for 24 to 48 hours (i.e., hot showers or tub baths, hot packs) Engage in any active range-of-motion (ROM) exercises; if done too early, they will cause more inflammation and damage to the affected joints Avoid exacerbating activities and protect joint RICE Mnemonic Within the first 48 hours after musculoskeletal trauma, follow these rules: R est : Avoid using injured joint or limb. I ce : Apply cold packs on injured area (i.e., 20 minutes on, 10 minutes off) for first 48 hours. C ompression : Use an elastic bandage wrap over joints to decrease swelling and provide support. Joints that are usually compressed are the ankles and the knees. E levation : This prevents or decreases swelling. Avoid bearing weight on affected joint. Isometric Exercise Useful during the early phase of recovery before regular active exercise is performed Defined as the controlled and sustained contraction and relaxation of a muscle group Less stressful on joints than regular exercise 349Usually done first before active exercise postinjury Non-weight-bearing exercise: Isometric exercises are non-weight-bearing exercises that are performed in a fixed state in which the muscle is flexed against a stationary object. Examples are pushing one fist against the palm of the other hand, which is stationary, biking, and swimming. Weight-bearing exercise: In weight-bearing exercises, the bones/muscles are forced against gravity. Weight- bearing exercise is recommended for treating osteoporosis to help strengthen bone durability. Examples are walking, skiing, yoga, tai chi, lifting weights, etc. ORTHOPEDIC MANEUVERS Test both extremities. Use the normal limb as the \"baseline\" for comparison. Drawer Sign ( Figure 14.2 ) Drawer sign is a test for knee stability. It is a diagnostic sign of a torn or ruptured ligament. The positive anterior drawer sign is the test for the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The posterior drawer sign is the test for the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Finkelstein's Test ( Figure 14.3 ) De Quervain's tenosynovitis is caused by an inflammation of the tendon and its sheath, which is located at the base of the thumb. The screening test is Finkelstein's, which is positive if there is pain and tenderness on the wrist (thumb side) upon ulnar pain and a \"click\" sound upon manipulation of the knee are positive. A positive McMurray's test suggests injury to the medial meniscus. Gold-standard test for joint damage is the MRI. Lachman's Sign ( Figure 14.5 ) Knee joint laxity is positive. Suggestive of ACL damage of the knee. More sensitive than the anterior drawer test for ACL damage. 350288 Figure 14.2 Drawer sign. Figure 14.3 Finkelstein's test. This image can be found in color in the app. Source : Courtesy of InvictaHOG. 351289 Figure 14.4 McMurray's test. Figure 14.5 Lachman's sign. Collateral Ligaments (Knees) Positive finding is an increase in laxity of the damaged knee (ligament tear). Valgus stress test of the knee: Test for medial collateral ligament (MCL) Varus stress test of the knee: Test for the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) JOINT INJECTIONS Administering intra-articular/periarticular joint injections with steroids (e.g., 352290 triamcinolone) is a controversial treatment for osteoarthritis (OA). Some expert panels suggest about four injections per joint (such as a knee) in a lifetime. If high resistance is felt when pushing syringe, do not force. Withdraw needle slightly (do not remove from joint) and redirect. Complications : Tendon rupture, nerve damage, infection, bleeding, hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) suppression, others. Joint injections are contraindicated in patients requiring anticoagulation therapy due to the risk of hemarthrosis. RADIOGRAPHY, CT SCANS, AND MRI SCANS Plain x-ray films (radiographs): Show bone fractures, OA (joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation), damaged bone (osteomyelitis, metastases), metal, and other dense objects. Not recommended for soft tissue structures such as the meniscus, tendons, and ligaments. MRI : Gold standard for injuries of the cartilage, menisci, tendons, ligaments, or any joint of the body. The MRI uses a magnetic field and not radiation (compared with x- rays and CT scans). Can be done with contrast. Contraindicated: Metal implants, pacemakers, aneurysm clips, insulin pumps, metallic foreign body in the eye, \"triggerfish\" contact lens, cochlear implant, electrodes for deep brain stimulation, and metallic joints. CT : Costs less than MRI. Uses radiation to view structures. Can be done with contrast. Detects bleeding, aneurysms, masses, pelvic and bone trauma, fractures. Uses x-ray images to form three-dimensional picture. CLINICAL PEARLS MRI : Best for soft tissue injuries such as tendons and cartilage X-rays (radiographs) : Best for bone injuries such as fractures ORTHOPEDIC TERMINOLOGY Abduction and Adduction Abduction (varus) : Movement going away from the body Adduction (valgum) : Movement going toward the body Hands and Feet Carpal (carpo) : Refers to the bones of the hands and the wrist Phalanges : Fingers and the toes; singular form of the term is \"phalanx\" Tarsal (tarso): Refers to bones of the feet or the ankle 353291 Proximal and Distal Proximal : Body part located closer to the body (compared to distal) Distal : Body part farther away from the center of the body DISEASE REVIEW Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome or Fracture Lower extremity injury caused by overuse resulting in microtears and inflammation of the muscles, tendons, and bone tissue of the tibia. Also known as \"shin splints.\" More common in runners and people with flat feet. If severe, it can progress into a stress fracture. Females are at higher risk of stress fracture, especially those with \"female athlete triad\" (amenorrhea, eating disorder, and osteoporosis). Onset precipitated or worsened with intensification of activity (increased mileage and/or frequency of training). Classic Case Complains of recurrent shin pain in one (or both) leg(s) that becomes more severe over time. The pain is located along the inner border (inside edge) of the tibia and occurs during and after exercise. There may be mild swelling and a focal area of tenderness that is painful on palpation (suggestive of stress fracture of tibia). In contrast, the pain is more vague without localized tenderness with medial tibial stress syndrome. Treatment Plan Follow RICE mnemonic. Several weeks of rest are recommended. Use cold packs during acute exacerbation, for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Compression bandage or sleeve may help decrease swelling. Using cushioned shoes (sneakers) for daily activity helps decrease tibial stress. If aerobic exercise is desired, recommend lower impact exercises (e.g., swimming, stationary bike, elliptical trainer). If stress fracture is suspected, advise patient to avoid exercising. Imaging test of choice: bone scan and/or MRI. A radiograph (x-ray) does not show stress fractures. Refer to orthopedic specialist. Plantar Fasciitis Acute or recurrent pain on the bottom of the feet that is aggravated by walking. Caused by microtears in the plantar fascia due to tightness of the Achilles tendon. Higher risk with obesity (body mass index [BMI] greater than 30), diabetes, aerobic exercise, flat feet, prolonged standing. Classic Case Middle-aged adult complains of plantar foot pain (either on one or both feet) that is worsened by walking and weight bearing. Complains that foot pain is worse during the first few steps in the morning, and continues to worsen with prolonged walking. 354Treatment Plan Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Naproxen (Aleve) PO BID, 4 to 6 hours Topical NSAID: Diclofenac gel (Voltaren Gel) applied to soles of feet BID Use orthotic foot appliance at night for a few weeks; apply ice pack to affected foot Stretching and massaging of the foot: Roll a golf ball with sole of foot several times a day Weight loss (if overweight) Consider x-ray to rule out fracture, heel spurs, complicated case; refer to podiatrist PRN Morton's Neuroma Inflammation of the digital nerve of the foot between the third and fourth metatarsals. Increased risk with high-heeled shoes, tight shoes, obesity, dancers, runners. Classic Case Middle-aged woman complains of many weeks of plantar foot pain that is worsened by walking, especially while wearing high heels or tight narrow shoes. The pain is described as burning and/or numbness and is located on the space between the third and fourth toes (metatarsals) on the forefoot. Physical exam of the foot may reveal a small nodule on the space between the third and fourth toes. Some patients palpate the same nodule and report it as \"pebble-like.\" Mulder Test This is a test for Morton's neuroma. Done by grasping the first and fifth metatarsals and squeezing the forefoot. Positive test is hearing a click along with a patient report of pain during compression. Pain is relieved when the compression is stopped. Treatment Plan Avoid wearing tight narrow shoes and high heels. Use forefoot pad. Wear well-padded shoes. Diagnosed by clinical presentation and history. Refer to podiatrist. Degenerative Joint Disease (DJD, or OA) DJD, or OA, occurs when the cartilage covering the articular surface of joints becomes damaged from overuse and with age. Large weight-bearing joints (hips and knees) and the hands are most commonly affected. Risk factors include older age, overuse of joints, and positive family history. Goal of Treatment Relieve pain Preserve joint mobility and function Minimize disability and protect joint Classic Case 355292 Gradual onset (over years). Early-morning joint stiffness with inactivity. Shorter duration of joint stiffness (less than 15 minutes) compared to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pain aggravated by overuse of joint. During exacerbations, involved joint may be swollen and tender to palpation. May be one sided (e.g., right hip only). Absence of systemic symptoms (not a systemic inflammatory illness like RA). Heberden's and/or Bouchard's nodes may be noted ( Figure 14.6 Heberden's nodes : Bony nodules interphalangeal (PIP) joints Figure 14.6 Bouchard's and Heberden's nodes. This image can be found in color in the app. Nonpharmacological Management Exercise (with care) at least three times a week. Lose weight. Stop smoking. Do isometric exercises to strengthen quadriceps muscles (knee OA). Engage in weight-bearing exercise (walking, lifting weights); resistance-band exercises. Avoid aggravating activities. Use cold or warm packs and ultrasound treatment. Use walking aids. Patellar taping by physical therapist will reduce load on knees. Alternative medicine: Use glucosamine supplements, SAM-e, tai chi exercises, acupuncture. Treatment Plan * First-line medication is acetaminophen 325 to 650 mg every 4 to 6 hours (maximum 4 g/d) PRN. or Tylenol 325 mg to 1,000 mg every 4 to 6 hours (maximum dose 4 g [4,000 mg] per 24 hours) PRN. Dehydration increases risk of hepatic adverse effects; drink a lot of water. If no relief with acetaminophen, switch to a short-acting NSAID. Start with NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil), one to two tablets every 4 to 6 hours or 356293 naproxen (Aleve) BID or Anaprox DS one tablet every 12 hours PRN. For added GI protection (if long term), add a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI; omeprazole) or misoprostol (Cytotec). If patient is at high risk for both GI bleeding and cardiovascular side effects, avoid NSAIDs. GI bleed risk factors: History of uncomplicated platelet disorder Opioid analgesics: Avoid if possible (especially if patient is a recovering addict/alcoholic) Age older than 75 years: Use topical (vs. oral) NSAIDs for treatment Rule out osteoporosis and order bone mineral density test Topical Medicine NSAID : Diclofenac gel (Voltaren Gel); apply to painful area and massage well into skin QID. Capsaicin cream : Apply to painful area QID. Avoid contact with eyes/mucous membranes. Do not use on wounds/abraded skin. Avoid bathing/showering afterward (so that it is not washed off). Capsaicin comes from chili peppers. Also used to treat neuropathic pain (e.g., postshingles). NSAID Risk Highest risk of GI bleeding: Ketorolac Highest risk of cardiovascular events: and celecoxib at higher doses Lowest cardiovascular risk: Naproxen EXAM TIPS Heberden's and/or Bouchard's nodes have appeared many times on the exam. Memorize the location of each. The following may help: Heberden's: The \"-den\" ending on the word is the letter \"D\" for DIP joint. By the process of elimination, Bouchard's is on the PIP joint. Another way to distinguish them is by using the alphabet. The letter \"B\" comes before the letter \"H.\" Therefore, Bouchard's node comes before Heberden's nodes. Types of treatment methods used for DJD: Analgesics, NSAIDs (PO and topical), steroid injection on inflamed joints ( no systemic/oral steroids), surgery (i.e., joint replacement). Do not confuse the treatment options for OA with those for RA. Recognize signs and symptoms of a medial tibial stress fracture. 357294 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) A multisystem autoimmune disease that is more common in women (9:1 ratio). Characterized by remissions and exacerbations. More common in African American and Hispanic women. Organ systems affected are the skin, kidneys, heart, and blood vessels. Milder form of lupus is called cutaneous lupus erythematosus . Classic Case Typical patient is a woman between 20 and 35 years of age. Classic rash is the maculopapular butterfly-shaped rash on the middle of the face (malar rash). May have nonpruritic thick scaly red rashes on sun-exposed areas (discoid rash). UA is positive for proteinuria. Treatment Plan Refer to rheumatologist (topical and oral steroids, Plaquenil, methotrexate, biologics). Patient Education Avoid sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. (causes rashes to break out). Cover skin with high SPF (UVA and UVB) sunblock. Wear sun-protective clothing such as hats with wide brims, long-sleeved shirts. Use nonfluorescent light bulbs (more sensitive to indoor fluorescent lighting). Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Systemic autoimmune disorder that is more common in women (8:1). Mainly manifested through inflammation of multiple joints and possibly joint damage. The goal of treatment is to prevent joint damage. Patients are at higher risk for other autoimmune disorders, such as Graves' disease, pernicious anemia, and others. Classic Case Adult, commonly middle-aged, woman complains of gradual onset of symptoms over months with daily fatigue, low-grade fever, generalized body aches, and myalgia. Complains of generalized joint pain, which usually involves the fingers/hands, elbows, wrists, and/or feet. Commonly reports early-morning stiffness/pain and warm, tender, and swollen fingers in the DIP/PIP joints (also called \"sausage joints\"). Objective Findings Joint involvement is symmetrical with more joints involved compared to DJD. Most common joints affected: Hands, wrist, elbows, ankles, feet, and shoulders \"Sausage joints\" Morning stiffness occurs for at least 1 hour and has been present for more than 6 weeks Rheumatoid nodules present (chronic disease) Swan neck deformity (50%): Flexion of the DIP joint with hyperextension of the PIP joint Boutonniere deformity: Hyperextension of the Labs 358295 Sedimentation rate: or Rheumatoid factor (RF) : Positive 75% to 80% of patients Radiographs : Bony erosions, joint space narrowing, subluxations (or dislocation) Treatment Plan Refer to rheumatologist for early aggressive management to minimize joint damage Surgery: Joint replacement (hip, knees) ameliorates RA Careful assessment is necessary: Never prescribe a biologic or anti-TNF medication if signs and symptoms of infection (fever, sore throat, etc.) are present are present. TB testing should be ordered prior to start of anti-TNF therapy. Medications NSAIDs (i.e., ibuprofen, naproxen sodium) help to relieve inflammation and pain Steroids: Systemic oral doses Steroid joint injections (synovial space) Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, cyclosporine, and (an antimalarial drug) If poor response to nonbiologic DMARDs, use other options such as biologic agents, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cancer, lymphoma. Complications Uveitis (eyes): Inflammation of the uvea (middle layer eyeball). Sudden onset of eye redness, pain, blurred vision. Can cause vision loss. Refer to ophthalmologist stat . RA increases risk of anterior uveitis, scleritis, vasculitis, pericarditis, etc. RA increases risk of certain malignancies, such as lymphoma. When prescribing Plaquenil, all patients must have an eye exam prior to starting the medication. Frequent eye-exam monitoring should be performed every 6 months or as recommended by the ophthalmologist to assess and prevent retinal damage, which can lead to blindness. EXAM TIPS Distinguish between RA and OA in terms of classic presentation. With RA, joint stiffness lasts longer. It involves multiple joints, and has a symmetrical distribution. RA is accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fatigue, fever, normocytic anemia, others. Treatment of RA includes all DJD treatment methods plus systemic both OA/DJD and RA (located on PIP). Heberden's nodes are seen only with OA/DJD (located on PIP). Uveitis: swelling of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye that supplies blood to the retina (refer to ophthalmologist stat ). Patient treated with high-dose steroids for several weeks. Higher risk of uveitis with inflammatory disease (ankylosing spondylitis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, others). Plaquenil is an antimalarial. Methotrexate is a DMARD. It is contraindicated for use during pregnancy. When prescribing methotrexate to childbearing women, contraception must be prescribed and adhered to while taking methotrexate. Know the presentation of RA and lab findings. Distinguish between presentation of OA and RA. NSAIDs injure the GI tract by blocking COX-1 and COX-2, resulting in lower levels of systemic prostaglandins. COX-1 has mucosal protective effect. COX-2 has mucosal lining of stomach versus COX-1 or NSAIDs Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is a type of NSAID. It affects platelets and clotting. Gout Deposits of uric acid crystals inside joints and tendons due to genetic excess production or low excretion of purine crystals (by-product of protein metabolism). High levels of uric acid crystallize in joints with predisposition for first joint of large toe. More common in middle-aged males older than 30 years of age. The gold standard for diagnosing gout is performed by joint aspiration of the synovial fluid of the joint. Microscopy exam using a polarized light is used to identify uric acid crystals in the synovial fluid to diagnose gout. Classic Case Middle-aged man presents with painful, hot, red, and swollen metatarsophalangeal joint of great toe (podagra). Patient is limping due to severe pain from weight bearing on affected toe. History of previous attacks at same site. Precipitated by ingestion of alcohol, meats, or seafood. Chronic gout has tophi (small white nodules full of urates on ears and joints). Labs Uric acid level : Elevated (>7 mg/dL) During the acute phase, uric acid level is normal; uric acid level does not begin to rise until after the acute phase Test uric acid level 2 weeks after acute attack CBC: WBC level elevated ESR: Elevated Treatment Plan Acute Phase First goal is to provide pain relief . Two types of NSAIDs are most effective: indomethacin (Indocin) BID and naproxen sodium (Anaprox DS) BID PRN. Do not use narcotics (not effective for gout pain). 360297 If no relief, combine NSAID with colchicine 1.2 mg (two tablets) at onset of attack and may repeat colchicine 0.6 mg (one tablet) in 1 hour. Continue colchicine 0.6 mg one to two times daily until symptoms resolve. May stop therapy when symptom-free for 2 to 3 days. After acute phase is over, wait at least 4 to 6 weeks before initiating maintenance treatment. Patients taking allopurinol should stop during acute phase and restart 4 to 6 weeks after resolution of symptoms. Maintenance Administer allopurinol (Zyloprim) daily for years to lifetime. Check CBC (affects bone marrow). Probenecid (a uricosuric) lowers uric acid. Colchicine has anti-inflammatory effects and can be used during acute phase (with NSAIDs) and for maintenance phase. Patients should be instructed to avoid alcohol, high-purine foods, and to remain well hydrated. Complication Joint destruction, kidney failure Ankylosing Spondylitis More common in males (two to three times) and those who are HLA-B27 positive. Average age of onset is the 20s to 30s. Chronic inflammatory disorder (seronegative arthritis) that affects mainly the spine (axial skeleton) and the sacroiliac joints. Some other joints affected are the shoulders and hips. Pain improves with exercise and is not relieved by rest. Classic Case Young adult man complains of a chronic case of back pain (>3 months) that is worse in the upper back (upper thoracic spine). Joint pain keeps him awake at night. Associated with generalized symptoms such as low-grade fever and fatigue. May have chest pain with respiration (costochondritis). Long-term stiffness improves with activity. Some may have midbuttock pain (sciatica). Objective Findings Causes a marked loss of ROM of the spine such as forward bending, rotation, and lateral bending. Decreased respiratory excursion down to less than 2.5 cm (normal 5 cm). Some have lordosis. Hyperkyphosis (\"hunchback\") occurs after 10 years or more with disease. Uveitis (up to 40% patients): Complains of eye irritation, photosensitivity, and eye pain. Scleral injection and blurred vision occur. Refer to ophthalmologist as soon as possible (treated with steroids). Labs Sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein slightly elevated; RF is negative Spinal radiograph \"bamboo Plan Refer to rheumatologist. Instruct patient in postural training and advise patient to buy a mattress with good support. First-line treatment is NSAIDs (dramatic response). If high risk of bleeding, prescribe PPI with NSAIDs, or COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib or Celebrex). For severe cases, treatment options are DMARDs, biologics (anti-TNF drugs), spinal fusion. Complications Anterior uveitis Aortitis (inflammation of the aorta) Fusing of the spine with significant loss of ROM; spinal stenosis Low-Back Pain Very common disorder with a lifetime incidence of 85%. Usually due to soft tissue inflammation, sciatica, sprains, muscle spasms, or herniated disks (usually on L5 to S1). Rule out fracture and other etiology (see text that follows). Further Evaluation (Recommended) History of significant trauma Suspect cancer metastases Suspect infection (osteomyelitis) Suspect spinal fracture (elderly with osteoporosis, chronic steroid use) Patient age older than 50 with new onset of back pain (rule out cancer) or pain that wakes a patient from sleep Suspect spinal stenosis (rule out ankylosing spondylitis) Symptoms worsening despite usual treatment Herniated disk with symptoms: Common site is at L5 to S1 (buttock/leg pain) Labs MRI : Best method for diagnosing a herniated disk. Bone scan may be helpful in identifying occult, lytic lesions. Treatment Plan Treatment depends on etiology. For uncomplicated back pain, use NSAIDs (naproxen sodium); apply warm packs if muscle spasms Muscle relaxants if associated with muscle spasms (causes drowsiness; warn patient) Abdominal and core-strengthening exercises after acute phase Consider chiropractor for uncomplicated low-back pain Note 362298 Bed rest is not recommended except in severe cases of low-back pain because it will cause deconditioning (loss of muscle tone and endurance) and increased risk of pneumonia. Complications Cauda Equina Syndrome Acute pressure on a sacral nerve root results in inflammatory and ischemic changes to the nerve. Sacral nerves innervate pelvic structures such as the sphincters (anal and bladder). Considered a surgical emergency. Needs decompression. Refer to ED. Signs Bowel incontinence Bladder incontinence Saddle anesthesia EXAM TIPS Ankylosing spondylitis: Know signs and symptoms so you are able to diagnose it on the exam. Bamboo spine is pathognomonic for ankylosing spondylitis. Spinal radiograph will show \"bamboo spine.\" Name of cast for fractures of the wrist is \"thumb spica cast\" (also available as a splint). Learn how to treat gout flare up. If no relief on NSAIDs for gout, combine NSAID with colchicine 1.2 mg (two tablets) at onset of attack and may repeat 0.6 mg (one tablet) in 1 hour. Do not overuse colchicine; will cause GI effects such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. Learn signs/symptoms of cauda equina. If suspected, refer to ED. CLINICAL PEARLS Naproxen is the NSAID with the fewest cardiovascular effects, but it has the same GI adverse effects as other NSAIDs. It can, however, increase BP, so this should be monitored. The innervation of the bladder and anal sphincter comes from the sacral nerves and, with cauda equina, symptoms include new-onset incontinence of urine (and/or bowel), saddle-pattern paresthesia, sciatica, etc. Acute Musculoskeletal Injuries Treatment RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) 363299 Ice is best during first 48 hours postinjury 20 minutes per hour several times/day (frequency varies) Rest and elevate affected joint to help decrease swelling Compress joints as needed. Use elastic bandage wrap (joints most commonly compressed are knees and ankles); helps with swelling and provides stability Administer NSAIDs (naproxen BID, ibuprofen QID) for pain and swelling PRN Tendinitis (All Cases) Microtears on a tendon(s) cause inflammation resulting in pain. Usually due to repetitive microtrauma, overuse, or strain. Gradual onset. Follow RICE mnemonic for acute injuries. Supraspinatus Tendinitis Common cause of shoulder pain. Also called cuff tendinitis . Due to inflammation of the supraspinatus tendon. Classic Case Patient complains of shoulder pain with certain movements. Movements that aggravate the pain are arm elevation and abduction (e.g., reaching to the back pocket). There is local point tenderness over the tendon located on the anterior area of the shoulder. Epicondylitis Common cause of elbow pain. Lateral epicondyle tendon pain (tennis elbow) or medial epicondyle tendon pain (golfer's elbow). Lateral Epicondylitis (Tennis Elbow) Classic Case Gradual onset of pain on the outside of the elbow that sometimes radiates to the forearms. Pain worse with twisting or grasping movements (opening jars, shaking hands). Medial Epicondylitis (Golfer's Elbow) Classic Case Gradual onset of aching pain on the medial area of the elbow (the side of the elbow that is touching the body). Higher risk in baseball players, bowlers, and golfers. Occurs in the part of the elbow also called the \"funny bone.\" Complications Ulnar nerve neuropathy and/or palsy (long-term pressure/damage). Complaint of numbness/tingling on the little finger and the lateral side of the ring finger and weakness of the hand. Worse-case scenario is development of a permanent deformity called \"claw hand.\" Chronic neuropathy is treated phenytoin, and pain medications. 364300 SPRAINS Ottawa Rules (of the Ankle) Ottawa rule are used to determine whether a patient needs radiographs of the injured ankle in the ED. In mild to moderate sprains during acute phase, use RICE and elastic bandage wrap. Grade I Sprain Mild sprain (slight stretching and some damage to ligament fibers); patient is able to bear weight and ambulate. Grade II Sprain Moderate sprain (partial tearing of ligament); ecchymoses are present, moderate swelling, and pain. Joint tender to palpation. Ambulation and weight bearing are painful. Mild to moderate joint instability occurs. Consider x-ray, referral. Grade III (Complete Rupture of Ligaments) Referral to ED for ankle fracture. Ankle series (done in the ED) needed if: Inability to bear weight immediately after the injury Inability to ambulate at least four steps Tenderness over the posterior edge of the lateral or medial malleolus Other findings (not part of criteria) are resistance to any foot motion, severe bruising, and severe pain Meniscus Tear (of Knees) The meniscus is the cartilaginous lining between certain joints that is shaped like a crescent. Tears in the meniscus result from trauma and/or overuse. Classic Case Patient may complain of clicking, locking, or buckling of the knee(s). Some patients are unable to fully extend affected knee. Patient may limp. Complains of knee pain and difficulty walking and bending the knee. Some complain of joint line pain. Decreased ROM. Best test : MRI; refer to orthopedic specialist for repair. Ruptured Baker's Cyst (Bursitis) A Baker's cyst is a type of bursitis that is located behind the knee (popliteal fossa). The bursae are protective, fluid-filled synovial sacs located on the joints that act as a cushion and protect the bones, tendons, joints, and muscles. Sometimes when a joint is damaged and/or inflamed, synovial fluid production increases, causing the bursa to enlarge. Classic Case Physically active patient (jogs or runs) complains of ball-like mass behind one knee that is 365301 soft and smooth. Causes pressure pain or is asymptomatic. If cyst ruptures, will cause an inflammatory reaction resembling cellulitis on the surrounding area (the calf) such as redness, swelling, and tenderness. Labs Diagnosed by clinical presentation and history. MRI if diagnosis is uncertain. Rule out plain bursitis from bursitis with infection (\"septic joint\"). Treatment Plan Follow RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevation) procedures. Gentle compression with elastic bandage wrap. Administer NSAIDs as needed. Large bursa can be drained with syringe using 18-gauge needle if causing pain. Synovial fluid is a clear, golden color. If cloudy synovial fluid is present and the joint is red, swollen, and hot, order a C&S to rule out a septic joint infection. Medial Tibia Stress Syndrome (Shin Splints) and Medial Tibial Stress Fracture More common in runners (higher incidence in females). Overuse results in inflammation of the muscles, tendons, and bone on the tibia. Classic Case Female runner reports that she recently increased frequency/distance running and complains of recent onset of pain on the inner edge of the tibia. Pain may be sharp and stabbing or dull and throbbing. Aggravated during and after exercise. Complains of a sore spot on the shin anterior aspect. Focal area of tenderness that is tender when touched. Some may develop a stress fracture on the tibia. Treatment Plan Advise to stop activity and rest (several weeks). Apply cold packs for 20 minutes on shin area BID first 24 to 48 hours and then PRN. Take NSAIDs (ibuprofen TID or naproxen BID) PRN. When pain is gone, wait about 2 weeks after before resuming exercise. Stretch before exercise and start at lower intensity. Wear supportive sneakers. If suspect stress fracture, imaging tests are bone scan and MRI. EXAM TIPS Fracture of the wrist: The name of the cast is \"thumb spica cast.\" Know Baker's cyst presentation. Plain radiograph of a joint (such as x-ray of knee) will show bony changes or narrowing of joint space (OA), but not soft tissue such as the meniscus. The best imaging test for cartilage, meniscus, or tendon damage is the MRI. 366302 The gold-standard test for assessing any joint damage is the MRI. CLINICAL PEARLS Do not forget that NSAIDs increase cardiovascular risk, renal damage, and GI bleeding. Experts state that dramatic response to NSAIDs is helpful with diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis. __________ * Adapted from the American College of Rheumatology (2012). 367303 15 Psychosocial Mental Health Review DANGER SIGNALS Suicide Risk Factors Older people who have lost a spouse (due to death or divorce) Plan involving a gun or other lethal weapon History of attempted suicide and/or family history of suicide Mental illness such as depression, bipolar disorder History of sexual, emotional, and/or physical abuse Terminal illness, chronic illness, chronic pain Alcohol abuse, substance abuse Significant loss (divorce, breakup with boyfriend/girlfriend, job loss, death of someone close to the person) Females make more attempts compared to males, but males have a higher success rate Bipolar disorder (also known as manic-depressive disorder ) Two types of bipolar disorder: type 1 (classic manic episodes) and type 2 (hypomanic episodes). Strong genetic component. Peak incidence of onset is in the 20s (ranges from age 14 to age 30 years). Moods cycle between mania and depression. Severe anxiety, rage, and chronic relationship difficulties occur. Classic manic symptoms include labile moods, euphoria, talkativeness, flight of ideas, grandiosity, and less need for sleep. A person with bipolar disorder is at higher risk of suicide during the depression phase of the illness. Look for signs and symptoms of depression and suicide warning signs. Acute Serotonin Syndrome Occurs from high levels of serotonin accumulating in the body due to the introduction of a new drug (drug interaction) and an increase in the dose. Has acute onset with rapid 368304 progression. Signs and symptoms are sudden onset of high fever, muscular rigidity, mental status changes, hyperreflexia/clonus, and uncontrolled shivering. Look for dilated pupils (mydriasis). Higher risk if combining two drugs that both block serotonin (i.e., selective to another drug affecting serotonin, wait a minimum of 2 weeks. Acute serotonin syndrome is a potentially life- threatening reaction. Malignant Neuroleptic Syndrome Rare life-threatening idiopathic reaction from typical and atypical antipsychotics. These drugs affect the dopaminergic system of the brain. Syndrome usually develops following initiation or an increase in dose. Signs and symptoms are sudden onset of high fever, muscular rigidity, mental status changes, fluctuating BP, and urinary incontinence. Look for a history of mental illness and prescription of an antipsychotic(s). This is a potentially life-threatening reaction. PSYCHIATRIC-MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION At-Risk Patients The Baker Act The Baker Act allows 72 hours (3 days) of involuntary detention for evaluation and treatment of persons who are considered at very high risk for suicide and/or for hurting others. Common Mental Health Questionnaires Beck Depression Inventory-II A multiple-choice self-report inventory for evaluating depression. Based on the theory that negative cognitions about the self and the world in general can cause depression. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM-5 ; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013) The diagnostic manual for mental and emotional disorders used and created by the APA. Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Second Edition (MMPI-2) A popular questionnaire used to assess for mental illness. Mini-Mental State Exam, Second Edition, also known as Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE-2; Table 15.1 ) A questionnaire used to evaluate an individual for confusion and dementia (Alzheimer's, stroke, others). Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) A 30-item (yes/no response) questionnaire. Shorter version contains 15 items. Used to assess depression in the elderly. Self-assessment format. 369305 Table 15.1 Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) Cognitive Skill Action Required Orientation What is the date today? (current day, month, year) Location?

Selective Inhibitors (SSRIs) First-line treatment for: Major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder Premenstrual dysphoric disorder Common SSRIs Fluoxetine (Prozac): Longest half-life of all SSRIs and the for noncompliant patients) Paroxetine (Paxil): Shortest half-life Citalopram (Celexa): Has fewer drug interactions other loss of libido in men and women, erectile dysfunction, anorexia, insomnia Avoid with anorexic patients and undernourished elderly (depresses appetite more) Paxil: Common side effect is erectile dysfunction Contraindications Avoid SSRIs within 14 days of taking an MAOI (serotonin syndrome) Can induce mania with bipolar patients Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) Not considered first-line treatment for depression Other uses: Postherpetic neuralgia (chronic pain), stress urinary incontinence Avoid if patient at high risk for suicide because may hoard pills and overdose (suicide attempt) Overdose will cause fatal cardiac (ventricular norepinephrine in the brain Duloxetine (Cymbalta): Can (Pristiq) Monoamine Oxidase used because of serious food (high tyramine content) and drug interactions Phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine combine MAOI with SSRI or TCA Wait at least 2 weeks before initiating SSRI or TCA (high risk of serotonin syndrome) High-Tyramine Foods and MAOIs The combination can cause the tyramine pressor response (elevates BP, risk of stroke); avoid combining with fermented foods such as beer, Chianti wine, some aged cheeses, fava beans, and others High-tyramine foods can also cause migraine headache in susceptible persons Benzodiazepines (Tranquilizers) Benzodiazepines are indicated for anxiety disorders, panic disorder, and insomnia Diazepam (Valium) is also used for severe alcohol withdrawal and seizures 372308 Do not discontinue abruptly because it increases risk of seizures; wean slowly avoid with the elderly DISEASE REVIEW Major and Minor Depression Also known as unipolar depression (vs. bipolar depression). Minor depression is a milder form. The criteria of signs and symptoms are the same as major depression except that there are fewer symptoms (at least two, but less than five). Attributed to dysfunction of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine. Has a strong genetic component. Symptoms of Depression Mood : Depressed mood most of the time; may become tearful Anhedonia : Diminished interest or pleasure in all or most activities Energy : Fatigued or loss of energy Sleep : Insomnia or hypersomnia Guilt : Feelings of worthlessness and inappropriate guilt Concentration : Diminished concentration and difficulty making decisions Suicide : Recurrent/obsessive thoughts of death and suicidal ideation Weight : Weight loss (>5% body weight) or weight gain Agitation : Psychomotor agitation or retardation Immediate Goal: Assess for Suicidal and/or Homicidal Ideation or Plan If patient is considered to be a real and present threat of harm to self or to others: Refer to a psychiatric hospital. Patient must be driven by a family member or a friend. If none are available, call 911 for police. The police can \"Baker Act\" the patient. A Baker Act proceeding is a means of providing emergency services for mental health treatment on a voluntary or involuntary basis. Differential Diagnosis Rule out organic causes such as hypothyroidism, anemia, autoimmune disorders, vitamin B 12 deficiency. Screening Tools for Depression Beck Depression Inventory: Contains 21 items Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (99% specificity): Contains seven items Two-item question: Ask these two questions: 1. During the past month, have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless? 2. During the past month, have you felt little interest or pleasure doing things? 373309 If answered yes to either question (or both), positive finding Labs CBC, chemistry profile, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), folate and vitamin B 12 levels, UA Rule out organic causes; toxicology screen to rule out illicit drug use Treatment Plan Rule out diseases such as anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid TSH/thyroid panel), chemistry panel (low potassium for Addison's disease), and vitamin B 12 anemia Refer for psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy can reduce symptoms (comparable to an antidepressant medication) and is usually effective; if necessary, refer to psychiatrist If psychotic, refer to the ED Psychotherapy plus antidepressants work better than either method alone Medications First-line medication : SSRIs. Advise patients that antidepressant effect may take from 4 to 8 weeks (up to 12 weeks) to manifest. SSRIs are also first-line therapy for elderly patients because they have fewer side effects. Initiation of medications for elderly patients and patients diagnosed with renal or hepatic disorders should begin at a low dose and increase slowly and gradually as tolerate After initiation, follow up in 2 weeks to check for compliance and side effects Wait for at least 4 to 8 weeks before changing medication Continue SSRI therapy for at least 4 to 9 months after symptoms have resolved (usually on first episode); frequent relapse means patient may need lifetime treatment Other antidepressants : Administer TCAs (amitriptyline/Elavil, nortriptyline/Pamelor). Prefer bedtime dosing due to sedation. postherpetic neuralgia, chronic pain, stress urinary incontinence Avoid TCAs with suicidal patients because the patient may hoard the pills and take an overdose (causes fatal arrhythmia) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Black Box Warnings : There is increased risk of death in elderly (with dementia) on antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol (Haldol) and chlorpromazine (Thorazine) SSRIs: Special Considerations FDA Black Box Warnings : Increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults; the risk of suicidality is increased in young adults ages 18 to 24 years during initial treatment (first 1-2 months) Elderly patients : Consider using citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro). These drugs cause fewer drug interactions than other SSRIs; may prolong QT interval Patients with sexual dysfunction caused by an SSRI : Consider adding bupropion (Wellbutrin) to the SSRI prescription Depressed patient who wants to quit smoking : Consider bupropion (Zyban). Can be 374combined with nicotine-avoidance products (patches, gum) Depressed patient with peripheral neuropathy : Consider duloxetine (Cymbalta), which is also indicated for neuropathic pain Depressed patient with postherpetic neuralgia and chronic pain: Consider TCAs Depressed patient with stress urinary incontinence: Consider TCAs Antipsychotics: Adverse Effects Pill-rolling, shuffling gait, caused by chronic use of antipsychotics Extrapyramidal symptoms: Akinesia (inability to initiate movement) Akathisia (a strong inner feeling to move, unable to stay still) Bradykinesia (slowness in movement) when initiating activities or actions that require successive steps such as buttoning a shirt Tardive dyskinesia: Involuntary movements of the lips (smacking), tongue, face, trunk, and extremities (more common in schizophrenics) Anticholinergics: Side Effects Many drug classes have strong anticholinergic effects such as antipsychotics, TCAs, decongestants, and antihistamines retention), glaucoma, preexisting heart SAD CUB mnemonic to help remember anticholinergic side effects: S edation A D ry mouth onfusion and constipation U rinary retention B PH Complementary/Alternative Treatment Complementary treatments for depression include various herbs and supplements, guided imagery, and lifestyle measures such as exercise and yoga ( Table 15.3 ). Be aware of herb- drug interactions. Table 15.3 Alternative Medicine for Depression Name Drug Interactions Adverse Effects St. John's wort SSRIs (citalopram/Celexa, paroxetine/Paxil, etc) Decreases digoxin effectiveness Causes breakthrough bleeding that decreases effectiveness of birth control pills Tricyclics (amitriptyline/Elavil, imipramine/Tofranil, etc.) MAOIs, Xanax, protease inhibitors (indinavir), and Amino such as HTP, L-tryptophan SSRIs MAOIs Omega-3 fatty acids (cold-water fish oil such as salmon) No major drug interactions High doses of omega-3 fish oil may increase risk of bleeding Supplements are usually stopped about 1 week before surgery Folate and vitamin B 6 (pyridoxine) Exercise, yoga, massage, guided imagery, acupuncture, light EXAM TIPS Know how to diagnose minor depression and major depression. Differentiate presentations for bipolar disorder and depression. Antipsychotics lead to an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and hypothyroidism. Learn how medication use should be monitored (see Table 15.2 ). Know FDA Black Box Warnings of SSRIs and antipsychotics. Know MAOI and high-tyramine foods to with BPH (urinary retention), narrow-angle glaucoma, preexisting heart disease. In general, there are now more questions on alternative treatments (see Table 15.3 ). St. John's wort is used for depression, menopausal symptoms, and other conditions. Herb-drug interactions of St. John's wort are indinavir (protease inhibitor), cyclosporine, oral contraceptives, SSRIs, TCAs, and others. Kava-kava and/or valerian root are both used for anxiety and insomnia. Do not mix with benzodiazepines, hypnotics, or any CNS depressants. A question on the MMSE (or the MME) will describe an action (such as asking a patient to spell \"world\" backward). The exam will ask you to indicate the name of the tool that is being used. CLINICAL PEARLS Patients starting to recover from depression may commit suicide (from increase in psychic energy). Monitor closely. If potentially suicidal, be careful when refilling or prescribing certain medications that may be fatal if patient overdoses (i.e., benzodiazepines, hypnotics, narcotics, 376311 amphetamines, TCAs). Give the smallest amount and lowest dose possible, with close follow-up. Alcoholism Alcoholism is a compulsive desire to drink alcohol despite personal, financial, and social consequences. Individuals have a strong craving for alcohol and are unable to limit drinking. With alcohol dependence, a patient experiences cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms that are generated from persistent and chronic use. Abrupt cessation causes withdrawal symptoms. Alcohol abuse occurs when a maladaptive behavior pattern occurs from repeated alcohol use. Definitions Elevated blood alcohol level greater than 0.08% is illegal for driving (blood alcohol or breathalyzer) in all U.S. states Standard drink sizes in the United States (considered as \"one drink\"): Beer: 12-ounce bottle Wine: 5 ounces Liquor/spirits: 1.5 ounces or a \"shot\" of 80-proof gin, vodka, rum, or whiskey Dietary Guidelines for Americans (Alcohol Limits) Women : One drink per day Men : Two drinks per day Binge drinking: A pattern of alcohol consumption that brings the blood alcohol level to 0.08% or higher on one occasion (generally within 2 hours) Males : At least five drinks or more in a single occasion Women : At least four drinks or more in a single occasion Women metabolize alcohol (50%) more slowly than do men Lab Results Gamma Glutamyl Transaminase Lone elevation (with/without ALT and AST) is a possible sign of occult alcohol abuse AST/ALT Ratio (Liver Transaminases) Both AST and ALT are usually elevated (with or without elevated GGT) in alcoholism Ratio of 2:1 with AST/ALT (AST level is double the level of ALT) is associated with alcohol abuse (alcoholic hepatitis) ALT is more specific for the liver than AST because AST is also found in the liver, cardiac and skeletal muscle, kidneys, and lungs Mean Corpuscular Volume ( MCV ) RBCs may be larger size (MCV >100) due to folate deficiency that resembles mild macrocytic anemia. 377312 Quick Screening Tests for Identification of Alcohol Abuse/Alcoholism CAGE Test Positive finding of at least two (out of four) is highly suggestive of alcoholism: C: Do you feel the need to cut down ? A: Are you annoyed when your spouse/friend comments about your drinking? G: Do you feel guilty about your drinking? E: Do you need to drink early in the morning? (an eye-opener ). Examples of some quotes using CAGE: C: \"I would like to drink less on the weekends.\" \"I only drink a lot on weekends.\" A: \"My wife nags me about my drinking.\" \"My best friend thinks I drink too much.\" G: \"I feel bad that I don't spend enough time with the kids because of my drinking.\" E: \"I need a drink to feel better when I wake up in the morning.\" Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (SMAST) Questionnaire A 13-item questionnaire that is a shorter version of the original MAST Questionnaire (contains 24 items) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) A 10-question tool that is used with women, minorities, and adolescents Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) One of the most successful methods for recovering alcoholics. Founded by Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith Patient is paired with a mentor (a recovered alcoholic); believes in a \"higher power\" Must follow a 12-step program and attend AA meetings (uses \"chip\" reward) Support group for family members and friends is called Al-Anon (Al-Anon Family Groups) Support group for teen children of alcoholics is called Alateen Acute Delirium Tremens This is characterized by a sudden onset of delusions; transient auditory, disturbed psychomotor behavior (picking at clothes); and grand mal seizures Considered a medical emergency so refer to ED Treatment Plan Benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), antipsychotics if needed (i.e., folate 1 mg PO/IV daily, and multivitamins with high-calorie diet Refer to AA (12-step program), therapist, and/or a recovery program Avoid prescribing a recovering alcoholic/addict drugs with abuse potential such as narcotics or any medication that contains alcohol (cough syrup) Medications 378313 Disulfiram (Antabuse): Causes severe nausea/vomiting, headache, other unpleasant effects Naltrexone (Vivitrol): Decreases alcohol cravings Korsakoff's Syndrome (Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome) This is a complication from chronic alcohol abuse. A neurological disorder with symptoms that include hypotension, visual impairment, and coma. Signs include mental confusion, ataxia, stupor, coma, and hypotension. Treated with high-dose thiamine (vitamin B 1 ). Korsakoff's Amnesic Syndrome This is a type of amnesia caused by chronic thiamine deficiency due to chronic alcohol abuse. Problems with acquiring (and learning) new information (antegrade amnesia) and retrieving older information (retrograde amnesia). Symptoms include confabulation, disorientation, attention deficits, and visual impairment. Chronic thiamine deficiency damages the brain permanently. Smoking Cessation Tobacco use is the most common cause of preventable death. Discuss smoking cessation at every visit with patients who are smokers. Nicotine gum use: Follow \"chew and park\" pattern. Chew gum slowly until the nicotine taste appears, then \"park\" next to the cheeks (buccal mucosa) until the taste disappears. Repeat pattern several times and discard nicotine gum after 30 minutes of use. Patient cannot smoke while on nicotine patches. Do not use with other nicotine products (e.g., gum, inhaler); patient will overdose on nicotine. Nicotine overdose can cause acute myocardial infarction, hypertension, and agitation in susceptible patients. Nicotine products can be used with bupropion (Zyban). Bupropion (Zyban) decreases cravings to smoke. Patients can still smoke while on bupropion; can be combined with nicotine products. Individual eventually loses desire to smoke and finally quits. Contraindications include seizure disorder, history of anorexia/bulimia, abrupt cessation of ethanol, benzodiazepines, antiseizure drugs, severe stroke, and brain tumor. Be careful with depressed patients; may increase risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Prescribe varenicline (Chantix) therapy for a 12-week course. Advise patient to quit smoking within 1 to 4 weeks after starting varenicline. Take a careful psychiatric history and avoid prescribing to mentally unstable patients or those with a history recent suicidal ideation. Adverse effects include neuropsychiatric symptoms; may impair ability to drive or operate heavy machinery. (The Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] prohibits pilots and air traffic controllers from taking drug.) Insomnia (Sleep Disorder) It is thought that 7 to 8 hours of sleep is the ideal amount. About 40 to 70 million Americans (20% of the population) suffer from either transient (<1 week), short-term (1-3 379314 weeks), or chronic (>3 weeks) insomnia. Insomnia in the aged occurs due to changes in sleep pattern, physical activity, health, and increased used of medications. Insomnia can manifest either as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia) or falling asleep but waking up during the night or too early and being unable to go back to sleep. Can cause daytime drowsiness, fatigue, tension headache, irritability, and difficulty concentrating/focusing on tasks. Patient self-medicating or using alcohol to facilitate sleep may indicate a coexistent alcohol/drug-dependence problem. Abrupt cessation of these agents may cause increased insomnia and/or anxiety. Risk Factors Depression, severe anxiety, gastroesophageal reflux disease, female gender, illicit drug use, musculoskeletal illness, pain, chronic health problems, shift work, alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. Certain medications (SSRIs, cardiac, BP, allergy, steroids) can cause insomnia. Etiology Circadian rhythm disorders, psychic issues, mental illness, obstructive sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, environmental factors, certain medications, idiopathic, and others. Classification Primary insomnia (25%) : Not caused by disease, mental illness, or environmental factors Secondary insomnia : Caused by disease (physical, emotional, mental) or environmental factors Short-term insomnia : Also known as transient insomnia; duration of less than 3 months; caused by pain, stress, grief, or other factors; expected to resolve when stressor is gone or when patient has adjusted Chronic insomnia : Presence of symptoms for at least 3 months; occurs at least 3 nights per week; it can be primary or secondary insomnia Treatment Plan Sleep hygiene is first-line treatment Improve sleep hygiene (maintain regular sleeping time, nighttime ritual, avoid caffeine/tobacco/heavy meals before bedtime, get out of bed in 30 minutes if not asleep, use bed only for sleep and sex) Refer to sleep lab (polysomnography), it is the gold-standard test for sleep apnea; after diagnosis, refer to otolaryngologist Medications Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), an over-the-counter antihistamine, can cause excess sedation and confusion in the elderly. It is the most sedating antihistamine. Avoid with elderly. Benzodiazepines/Hypnotics (Listed Under Psychotropic Drugs) Some benzodiazepines are more sedating and are ideally used for a short duration. But many insomniacs continue using sleeping pills daily to help them sleep. Physical dependence may develop with long-term use. If a patient has been on a benzodiazepine for a long time, do not discontinue abruptly (will increase risk of seizures). Wean off slowly and gradually. Short acting : Hypnotics These drugs have quick onset (15-30 minutes). Do not take if unable to get 7 to 8 hours of sleep. Adverse effects include agitation, hallucinations, nightmares, suicidal ideation. There have been cases in which a person wakes up and does his or her normal routine (sleep driving, eating, working) but is unable to recall the incident. Zolpidem (Ambien) for sleep-onset or inability to stay asleep Eszopiclone (Lunesta) for sleep-onset or inability to (avoid mixing with alcohol, tranquilizers, hypnotics; will increase sedation); do not give kava-kava, valerian herbal supplements to children, lactating/pregnant women Valerian root (sedating, also used for anxiety) Melatonin (also for circadian rhythm disorders such as shift work, jet lag) Chamomile tea Meditation, yoga, tai chi, acupuncture, regular exercise (avoid 4 hours before bedtime) EXAM TIPS Lone GGT elevation can be a sign of occult alcohol abuse. AST/ALT ratio of 2.0 or higher is more likely in alcoholism. Recognize Korsakoff's syndrome and that it is caused by chronic thiamine deficiency. Al-Anon is the support group for an alcoholic's family and friends. A person who drinks one glass of wine or one beer per day is not considered an alcoholic. Questions may be asked about who is most likely (or least likely) to become an alcoholic. Do not mix nicotine patches with nicotine gum. Do not smoke while on patches. Bupropion (Zyban) is for smoking cessation. Patients can smoke while on Zyban. Women are allowed one drink/day and men are allowed two drinks/day. Kava-kava and valerian root are natural supplements used for insomnia/anxiety. Do not mix with benzodiazepines or hypnotics. Discuss smoking cessation with patients (who are smokers) at every visit. 381Bipolar Disorder Bipolar disorder is characterized by mania and depression. There are two types: bipolar type 1 and bipolar type 2 (has hypomania instead of mania). They are at higher risk of suicide; 10% to 15% die by suicide. Manic symptoms are increased energy/activity, grandiosity, less need for sleep, disinhibition, and euphoric mood. The depressive symptoms are similar to major depression. May have psychotic episodes (delusions, hallucinations) Bipolar patients have higher rates of substance abuse (40%-60%) and other comorbidities (ADHD, anxiety, OCD, eating disorders) Refer to psychiatrist for management Medications Lithium salts (adverse affects kidney and thyroid gland), anticonvulsants (valproate, carbamezapine), and antipsychotics (treats manic episodes) Schizophrenia Psychotic symptoms include delusions and paranoia (disorganized speech and behavior). Hallucinations are common (usually auditory) with loss of ego boundaries; flat and restricted affect with poor social skills; executive function is very poor (ability to plan and organize day-to-day activities) Onset is usually around the second decade; peak incidence is between 16 and 30 years of age Refer patients to a psychiatrist for management Medications Safety Issues Use of typical antipsychotics increase the risk of sudden death among elderly who are in long-term care Antipsychotics can prolong QT intervals (EKG needed) and cause a fatal arrythmia Nervosa Onset is usually during adolescence. It is an irrational preoccupation with an intense fear of gaining weight along with distorted perception of body shape and weight. Patients tend to be secretive, perfectionistic, and self-absorbed. Characterized by severe restriction of food intake, marked weight loss (BMI <18.5), lanugo (face, back, and shoulders), and amenorrhea for 3 months or longer. If purging, loss of dental enamel may be present. Anorexics engage in severe food restriction or binge eating and purging. Some examples of purging are use of laxatives, vomiting; excessive daily exercise is common. Complications Osteopenia/osteoporosis is due to prolonged estrogen depletion (from amenorrhea) and 382316 low calcium intake; higher risk of stress fractures Peripheral edema may occur (low albumin from low protein intake) Cardiac complications are the most common cause of death (arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia, etc.) Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, intrusive thoughts, avoidance of reminders of trauma, sleep disturbance, and hypervigilance. Causes include being in combat/war, sexual assault (12%), myocardial infarction, stroke, ICU stay (20%). Comorbidity, such as depression, anxiety, antisocial disorder, and substance abuse, is higher in PTSD. Assessment tools include the PTSD checklist (PCL-5), a 20-item self-report measure (screening and for monitoring symptoms over time). The first-line drug treatment of PTSD is SSRIs such as paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft). A therapeutic trial of SSRIs is needed for at least 6 to 8 weeks to find out whether it is effective. Other treatment includes cognitive behavioral therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). Munchausen Syndrome Also known as \"factitious disorder imposed on self.\" Patient falsifies symptoms of factitious disorders (abdominal pain, chest pain, seizures, etc.) and/or injures self and seeks medical treatment, including multiple surgeries. Munchausen by proxy, a related disorder, refers to a parent using a child (and making the child sick) to obtain medical care. These are rare conditions (1%) that are hard to diagnose. EXAM TIPS Recognize how anorexic patients present (i.e., lanugo, peripheral edema, amenorrhea, BMI Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is contraindicated for anorexic/bulimic patients. It increases the seizure threshold. Paroxetine has a short half-life (compared with other SSRIs) and patients need to be weaned. Do not discontinue abruptly; will cause withdrawal symptoms. A common side effect of paroxetine (Paxil) is erectile dysfunction. Bupropion is used off-label for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction caused by SSRIs. An elderly patient who is depressed (and has multiple medications) can be prescribed citalopram. Citalopram (Celexa) does have drug interactions, but fewer than the other SSRIs. TCAs: Used for herpetic neuralgia, migraine headache prophylaxis (not treatment). Abuse: All Types 383317 Abusive behaviors are multifactorial. They may include physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, and/or neglect, as well as economic abuse or material exploitation. Abuse can happen at any age and during pregnancy (higher risk). The state of pregnancy is also associated with a higher incidence of abuse due to jealousy over the pregnancy. Upon presentation to the ED, for example, the pattern of the injuries is inconsistent with the history given. Elderly who are most likely to be abused are those older than 80 years old and/or who are frail. Children with mental, physical, or other disabilities, and stepchildren are more likely to be abused. Types of abuse are physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional/psychological abuse, and neglect. A common finding is a delay in seeking medical treatment for the injury. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is defined as intentional control or victimization performed by a person to another with whom the person has an intimate or spousal relationship. The most significant reason for missing the diagnosis of IPV or other abuse is failure to ask. Risk Factors That Increase Likelihood of Abuse (All Types) Increased stress (partner/parent/caregiver) Alcohol/drug abuse Personal history of abuse, positive family history of abuse Major loss (financial, job loss, others) Social isolation Pregnancy (domestic abuse) Elderly abuse. Frail elderly and those with dementia are more likely to be abused; about two thirds of all elder abuse is perpetrated by family members (usually an adult child or a spouse); most abused elderly also suffer economic abuse. Only certain states have mandatory reporting of partner abuse; be mindful of institutional abuse of elderly, children, and the disabled Physical Exam: Abuse (All Types) Another health provider (witness) should be in the same room during the exam. Interview victim without abuser in the same room. Collect visual evidence of trauma via Polaroid or digital camera to document all injuries. Keep all evidence in a safe place. Use a ruler to identify and document the size of the injuries. Document direct \"quotes\" in the patient's history. Use the abuse assessment screening tool with a body map to document assessment findings. Look for spiral fractures (greenstick fracture), multiple healing fractures, especially in rib area, burn marks with pattern, welts, and so forth. Look for signs of neglect (dirty clothes, inappropriately dressed for the weather, etc.). For partner abuse, focus on developing a plan for safety with the patient when appropriate. Give the patient the phone number of the crisis center and/or a safe place. Sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing: Chlamydial and gonorrheal cultures (must use cultures in addition to the Gen Probe) HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis, herpes type 2 Genital, throat, and anal area culture and testing must be done 384318 Abused patient is very fearful and quiet when with the \"abuser\" Treatment Plan Provide prophylactic treatment against several STDs (with parental consent for minors) Teach the patient the cycle of abuse; educate the patient regarding safety issues and having an escape plan ready for use Health care professionals must report actual or suspected child abuse Be aware of individual state guidelines on reporting suspicion of elder abuse Abuse of a disabled person must be reported to the Disabled Person Protective Commission; contact adult protective services or law enforcement agencies with concerns regarding self-neglect Good Communication Concepts State things objectively; do not be judgmental Example: Say: \"You have bright-red stripes on your back\" instead of \"It looks as if you have been whipped on your back.\" Open-ended questions are preferred. Example: Say: \"How can I help you?\" instead of \"What type of object was used to hurt your back?\" Do not reassure patients (this stops a patient from talking more about his or her problems). Example: Say: \"We will make sure you get help\" instead of \"Don't worry, everything will be fine.\" Let the patient vent his or her feelings. Do not discourage patient from talking. Example: Say: \"Please tell me why you feel so sad.\" Validate feelings. Example: Say: \"Yes, I understand your anger when someone hits you.\" EXAM TIPS Of all the SSRIs, Paxil is most likely to cause erectile dysfunction. There will always be a few questions on physical abuse. The questions may address physical abuse, child abuse, sexual abuse, and/or elder abuse. The abuser is described as a person who does not want the abused person out of sight or interviewed alone. The abuser typically answers all the questions for the patient and will exhibit \"controlling\" behaviors toward the abused patient. Abuse cases: Interview together and then separately. Any answer choice that reassures patients is always wrong. Delaying an action (i.e., waiting until the patient feels better, etc.) is always wrong. Bupropion is used to treat major depression, seasonal affective disorder, and smoking cessation. It increases risk of seizures; avoid if patient at higher risk of seizures (during abrupt discontinuation of ethanol, benzodiazepines). 385319 320 Reproductive Review III 386321 16 Men's Health Review DANGER SIGNALS Priapism Male complains of a prolonged and painful erection for several hours (at least 2-4 hours). Males with sickle cell disease are at very high risk (6%-45%). Other risk factors are high doses of erectile dysfunction drugs, cocaine, quadriplegia, and others. There are several types of priapism. The ischemic form of priapism is a medical/surgical emergency. Testicular Cancer Teenage to young adult male complains of nodule, sensation of heaviness or aching, one larger testicle, and/or tenderness in one testicle. Testicular cancer can present as a new onset of a hydrocele (from tumor pressing on vessels). Usually painless and asymptomatic until metastasis. More common in White males aged 15 to 30 years. Rare in African Americans. Prostate Cancer Older to elderly man complains of a new onset of low-back pain, rectal area/perineal pain or discomfort accompanied by obstructive voiding symptoms such as weaker stream and nocturia. May be asymptomatic. More common in older (>50 years), obese, and Black men, and men with a family history of prostate cancer (father, brother). Torsion of the Appendix Testis (Blue Dot Sign) School-age boy complains of the abrupt onset of a blue-colored round mass located on the testicular surface. The mass resembles a \"blue dot.\" The appendix testis is a round, small (0.03 cm), pedunculated polyp-like structure that is attached to the testicular surface (on the anterior superior area). The blue dot is caused by infarction and necrosis of the 387322 appendix testis due to torsion. More common during childhood. Not testicular torsion. Refer to emergency department (ED). Testicular Torsion A male (usually adolescent) reports waking up at midnight or in the morning with abrupt onset of an extremely painful and swollen red scrotum. Frequently accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Affected testicle/scrotum is located higher and closer to the body than the unaffected testicle. The cremasteric reflex is missing. Majority of cases (two thirds) occur between the ages of 10 and 20 years. NORMAL FINDINGS Spermatogenesis Ideal temperature (for sperm production) is from 1\u00b0 to 2\u00b0C (33.8\u00b0 to 35.6\u00b0F) lower than core body temperature Sperm production starts at puberty and continues for the entire lifetime of the male Sperm are produced in seminiferous tubules of the testes Sperm require 64 days (about 3 months) to mature Testes Cryptorchidism (undescended testes) increases risk of testicular cancer Production of testosterone/androgens is stimulated by release of luteinizing hormone Spermatogenesis is stimulated by both testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone The left testicle usually hangs lower than the right Prostate Gland Heart-shaped gland that grows throughout the life cycle of the male Produces prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostatic fluid Prostatic fluid (alkaline pH) helps the sperm survive in the vagina (acidic pH) Up to 50% of 50-year-old men have benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) Epididymis Coiled tubular organ that is located at the posterior aspect of the testis. Storage area for immature sperm (sperm takes 3 months to mature). Resembles a \"beret\" on the upper pole of the testes. Vas Deferens (Ductus Deferens) Tubular structures that transport sperm from the epididymis toward the urethra in preparation for ejaculation. These tubes are cut/clipped during a vasectomy procedure. 388323 Cremasteric Reflex The testicle is elevated toward the body in response to stroking or lightly pinching the ipsilateral inner thigh (or the thigh on the same side as the testicle). Reflex is absent with testicular torsion. Transillumination: Scrotum Transillumination is useful for evaluating testicular swelling, mass, bleeding, or cryptorchidism Direct a beam of light behind one scrotum (turn off room light) Hydrocele will transilluminate (serous fluid inside scrotum) Testicular tumor will transilluminate (solid tumor blocks light) Varicocele (\"bag of worms\") will not transilluminate DISEASE REVIEW Testicular Cancer Most common tumor in males age 15 to 30 years; more common in White males Classic Case Teenage to young adult male complains of nodule, sensation of heaviness or aching, one larger testicle, or tenderness in one testicle. May present as a new onset of a hydrocele (from tumor pressing on vessels). Usually painless and asymptomatic until metastasis. Objective Findings Affected testicle feels \"heavier\" and more solid May palpate a hard, fixed nodule (most common site is the lower pole of the testes) Twenty percent of cases will have a concomitant hydrocele Labs and Treatment Plan Ultrasound of the testicle reveals solid mass Gold standard of diagnosis: Testicular biopsy Refer to (orchiectomy) Testicular Torsion When the spermatic cord becomes twisted, the testis's blood supply is interrupted. Permanent testicular damage results if not corrected within the first few hours (<6 hours). If not corrected within 24 hours, 100% of testicles become gangrenous and must be surgically removed. More common in males with the \"bell clapper deformity.\" Most cases are idiopathic. Classic Case 389324 A 14-year-old boy reports the sudden onset of severe testicular pain with an extremely swollen red scrotum. Some may have acute hydrocele (severe edema). Complains of severe nausea and vomiting. The affected testicle is higher than the normal testicle. Cremasteric reflex is missing. Treatment Plan Call 911 as soon as possible Preferred test in the ED is the Doppler ultrasound with color flow study Treatment can be manual reduction or surgery with testicular fixation using sutures Prostate Cancer Most common cancer in men (incidence). African American males have a higher risk of prostate cancer. Average age of diagnosis is 71 years. Risk factors are age older than 50 years, African American, obesity, and positive family history (first-degree relative will double the risk). Routine prostate cancer screening (digital rectal exam [DRE] with PSA) is not recommended (USPSTF, 2012). Studies show that absolute risk reduction of prostate cancer deaths with screening is very small. Individualize management, based on patient's risk factors and age. Objective Painless and hard fixed nodule (or indurated area) on the prostate gland on an older male that is detected by DRE. Elevated PSA: Greater than 4.0 ng/mL Diagnostic test: Biopsy of prostatic tissue (obtained by transurethral ultrasound) Screening test: PSA level with DRE; if limited life span (<10 years), not recommended Treatment Plan Refer to urologist if PSA greater than 4.0 ng/mL; suspect prostate cancer Individualize screening is based on risk factors; discuss risk (bleeding, infection, impotence, procedures, and psychological trauma) versus benefits Most cancers are not aggressive and are slowgrowing; watchful waiting/monitoring by urologist is common Initiate drug therapy with antiandrogens (Proscar), hormone blockers (i.e., Lupron), others Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Seen in 50% of men older than age 50 (up to 80% of men >70 years); rarely seen in those younger than age 40; rule out prostate cancer Use the American Urological Association (AUA) urinary symptom score/International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire to assess the severity of the patient's BPH symptoms Classic Case Older man complains of gradual development (years) of urinary obstructive symptoms such 390325 as weak urinary stream, postvoid dribbling, feelings of incomplete emptying, and occasional urinary retention. Nocturia is very common. Objective Findings PSA is elevated (norm is 0-4 ng/mL) Prostate that is symmetrical in texture and size (rubbery texture) is enlarged Lifestyle changes may help decrease symptoms and include reduction of caffeine and alcohol intake, avoiding fluids before bedtime, and avoidance of diuretic medications (if possible) Medications Terazosin testosterone): Finasteride (Proscar) Duration of treatment ranges from a few months to daily for many years Avoid drugs that worsen symptoms: Cold medications (antihistamines, decongestants), caffeine Herbal: Saw palmetto (mild improvement for some); does not work for everyone Watch for an adverse effect of alpha blockers, which is orthostatic hypotension Advise patients that they may have dizziness due to low BP Instruct patients to take medication at bedtime Tamsulosin may have less effect on BP than the other alpha blockers (Cunningham & Kadmon, 2017) If hypotension is a problem, discontinue and start on a trial of finasteride (Proscar) EXAM TIPS Finasteride (Proscar) inhibits type 2 5 -reductase (it blocks the androgen receptor) and acts directly on the prostate gland to shrink it (temporarily) while on the medication. If patient stops taking Proscar, the size of the prostate gland returns back to its original size. The prostate shrinks by 50% while on Proscar (so PSA must be doubled or multiplied by 2). Proscar is a category X drug (teratogenic). It should not be touched with bare hands by reproductive-aged females (adversely affects male fetus). Male with BPH and hypertension: Start with alpha-blocker (Hytrin) first. Works by relaxing smooth muscles on prostate gland and bladder neck. Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis Chronic (>6 weeks) infection of the prostate. Some men report a history of acute urinary tract infection (UTI) or of acute bacterial prostatitis. Others are asymptomatic. More common in older men. Caused most commonly by Escherichia coli and Proteus . Nonbacterial prostatitis has same symptoms but is culture negative. Classic Case 391Elderly man with a history of several weeks of suprapubic or perineal discomfort that is accompanied by irritative voiding symptoms such as dysuria, nocturia, and frequency. Not accompanied by systemic symptoms. Some men are asymptomatic. Objective Findings Prostate may feel normal or slightly \"boggy\" to palpation; not tender UA: Normal (unless patient has cystitis) Urine mixed with prostatic fluid: Positive for E. coli Labs Urine and prostatic fluid cultures Use three tubes: First, urethra; second, bladder; third, urine with prostatic fluid (obtained after prostatic massage) PSA will be elevated (inflammation) Medications Administer trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) PO BID for 4 to 6 weeks (if sensitive) Some prefer ofloxacin (Floxin) BID or levofloxacin (Levaquin) daily for 4 to 6 weeks Acute Prostatitis Acute infection of the prostate. Infection ascends into urinary tract. Most common non- sexually transmitted cause is Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Proteus). If condition occurs in a male younger than 35 years of age, it is treated like gonococcal or chlamydial urethritis. Classic Case Adult to older man complains of sudden onset of high fever and chills with suprapubic and/or perineal pain/discomfort. Pain sometimes radiates to back or rectum. Accompanied by UTI symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, nocturia with cloudy urine. DRE reveals extremely tender prostate that is warm and boggy. The patient may have an accompanying infection of the bladder (cystitis) or epididymitis. Objective Findings Gently examine prostate. Prostate will be extremely tender and warm. Warning: Vigorous palpation and massage of an infected prostate can cause bacteremia. Labs CBC: Leukocytosis with shift to the left (presence of band cells) UA: Large amount of white blood cells (pyuria), hematuria Urine C&S (if possible, also obtain urine after gentle prostatic massage) Medications Based on age and presumptive organism: Age younger than 35 years: Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM and doxycycline 100 mg BID \u00d7 10 days 392326 Age older than 35 or unlikely sexual transmission: Ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin PO BID or levofloxacin (Levaquin) PO daily for 4 to 6 weeks Others: Levofloxacin (Levaquin) PO daily, Bactrim PO without laxative (Colace), sitz baths, hydration Patient should be hospitalized if septic or toxic EXAM TIPS Learn to distinguish between chronic prostatitis and acute prostatitis. Chronic is of gradual onset; prostate can feel normal with DRE (older males). Acute prostatitis presents as sudden onset; prostate is swollen and very tender (younger males). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) cause erectile dysfunction in men. The SSRI that has the highest risk of erectile dysfunction is paroxetine (Paxil). Acute Bacterial Epididymitis Bacteria ascend the urethra (urethritis) and reach the epididymis, causing an infection. Also known as bacterial epididymo-orchitis . Rule out testicular torsion (can mimic condition). Sexually active males younger than 35 years of age More likely to be infected with a sexually transmitted disease (chlamydia, gonorrhea) Males older than 35 years of age Usually due to gram-negative E. coli Classic Case Adult to older man complains of acute onset of a swollen red scrotum that hurts. Accompanied by unilateral testicular tenderness with urethral discharge. Scrotum is swollen and erythematous with induration of the posterior epididymis. Sometimes accompanied by a hydrocele, and signs and symptoms of UTI. May have systemic symptoms such as fever. Discharge: Green-colored purulent or serous clear (chlamydia, viral, chemical, others) Positive Prehn's sign: Relief for Gram stain Testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia (urine or Gen-Probe) Medications Age younger than 35 years (or suspect STD): Doxycycline PO BID \u00d7 10 days plus ceftriaxone 250 mg IM \u00d7 one dose; do not forget to treat sex partner Age greater than 35 years: Ofloxacin (Floxin) 300 mg PO \u00d7 10 days or levofloxacin (Levaquin) 500 mg PO 7 to 10 days; caution patient regarding risk of tendon injury and discourage vigorous lower extremity exercise while on fluoroquinolone 393327 Treat pain with NSAIDs naproxen) or (severe pain) Employ scrotal elevation and scrotal ice packs; bed rest for few days Give stool softeners (i.e., docusate sodium or Colace) if constipated Refer to ED if septic, severe intractable pain, abscessed, others Erectile Dysfunction Inability to produce an erection firm enough to perform sexual intercourse. Vascular insufficiency, neuropathy (diabetics), medications (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers), smoking, alcohol, hypogonadism. May be psychic causation or mixture of both. Organic cause: Inability to have an erection under any circumstance. Due to neurovascular or vascular damage Psychiatric cause: Spontaneously has early-morning erections or can achieve a firm erection with masturbation Medications First line: Treat with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors drug class Take Viagra on an empty stomach for optimal effectiveness; food and fats delay drug action; Levitra can be taken regardless of food intake with one exception\u2014fatty foods have been shown to decrease the onset of effect Sildenafil citrate (Viagra) 25/50/100 mg; take one dose 30 to 60 minutes before sex; use only one dose every 24 hours Vardenafil (Levitra); take one dose 30 to 60 minutes before sex; duration is 4 hours Tadalafil (Cialis) 5 to 20 mg; take 2 hours before sex; duration is up to 36 hours; may also be prescribed as a daily dose for combined BPH and erectile dysfunction (5-10 mg) Adverse effects: May cause headache, facial flushing, dizziness, hypotension, nasal congestion, alpha-blockers, recent postmyocardial infarction (MI), postcerebrovascular accident, major surgery, or any condition in which exertion is contraindicated. Peyronie's Disease An inflammatory and localized disorder of the penis that results in fibrotic plaques on the tunica albuginea. Results in penile pain that primarily occurs palpable nodules and penile deformity (crooked penile erections) occur. May resolve spontaneously or worsen over time. Surgical correction if needed. Labs 394328 None; clinical diagnosis is used Treatment Plan Refer patient to urologist Other Conditions Balanitis Candidal infection of the glans penis; more common in uncircumcised men, diabetics, and/or immunocompromised men. Use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and empagliflozin (Jardiance) may cause balanitis; also increases the risk of candidal infections and UTIs. Treated with topical OTC azole creams. If partner has candidiasis, treat at the same time. Cryptorchidism Undescended testicles that remain in the abdominal cavity. Can affect both or only one testicle. Markedly increases the risk of testicular cancer. Usually corrected during infancy. Phimosis Foreskin cannot be pushed back from the glans penis because of edema; usually seen in neonates. Varicocele ( Figure 16.1 ) New-onset varicocele can signal testicular tumor (20%) or a mass that is impeding venous drainage. Order an ultrasound of the scrotum. Can contribute to male infertility if large enough (increases temperature of affected testicle). Treatment is surgical removal of varicosities if infertile. 395Figure 16.1 Varicocele of left scrotum (adult). This image can be found in color in the app. Source: Courtesy of Mulief. Hydrocele More common in infants. Serous fluid collects inside the tunica vaginalis. During scrotal exam, hydroceles are located superiorly and anterior to the testes. Most hydroceles are asymptomatic. Will glow with transillumination. If hydrocele in an adult or enlarging hydrocele, order scrotal ultrasound and refer to urologist. 396329 17 Women's Health Review DANGER SIGNALS Dominant Breast Mass/Breast Cancer Adult to older female with a dominant mass on one breast that feels hard and is irregular in shape. The mass is attached to the skin/surrounding breast tissue (or is immobile). Among the most common locations are the upper outer quadrants of the breast (the tail of Spence). Skin changes may be seen, such as the \"peau d'orange\" (localized area of skin that resembles an orange peel), dimpling, and retraction. Mass is painless or may be accompanied by serous or bloody nipple discharge. The nipple may be displaced or become fixed. Order a mammogram and refer the patient to breast surgeon. Paget's Disease of the Breast (Ductal Carcinoma In Situ) Older female reports a history of a chronic scaly red-colored rash resembling eczema that starts on the nipple and spreads to the areola of one breast. Some women complain of itching, pain, or burning sensation. The skin lesion slowly enlarges and evolves to include crusting, ulceration, and/or bleeding on the nipple. Inflammatory Breast Cancer Recent or acute onset of a red, swollen, and warm area in the breast of a younger woman. Can mimic mastitis. Often, there is no distinct lump on the affected breast. Symptoms develop quickly (few weeks to months). The skin may be pitted (peau d'orange) or appear bruised. More common in African Americans. A rare but very aggressive form of breast cancer (1%-5%). BRCA1- and BRCA2 -Associated Hereditary Breast and 397330 Ovarian Cancer Patients with a family history of breast cancer (before age 50), male breast cancer, breast cancer that is triple-negative (before age 60), or ovarian and other types of gynecological cancers are at higher risk for BRCA (breast cancer susceptibility gene) mutations. In one study of 9,800 female BRCA mutation carriers, the \"cumulative rate of breast and ovarian cancer until age 80 years were 72% and 44% for BRCA1 carriers and & Isaacs, 2017). Men with BRCA mutations are at higher risk of breast cancer and prostate cancer. A patient who reports being positive for a BRCA mutation should be referred to breast specialists. They are screened using both an MRI of the breast and a mammogram. Ask at what age the family member(s) with breast cancer were diagnosed and screen 10 years earlier. For example, if a sister was age 45 when diagnosed with breast cancer, then screening for breast cancer can start at the age of 35 years. BRCA mutations are more common among Ashkenazi Jews. Refer high-risk patients for pre- and posttest genetic counseling and BRCA mutation testing. Ovarian Cancer The typical patient is a middle-aged or older woman with vague symptoms of abdominal bloating and discomfort, low-back pain, pelvic pain, and changes in bowel habits. Look for family history of having two or more first- or second-degree relatives with a history of ovarian cancer or a combination of ovarian cancer, especially women of Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity with a first-degree relative (or second-degree relatives on the same side of the family) with breast or ovarian cancer (American Cancer Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], 2012). Very-high-risk women with suspected BRCA 1 / BRCA 2 mutations should be referred for genetic counseling pre- and posttest. The screening starts at age 30 years (or 5 to 10 years before the earliest age of first diagnosis of ovarian cancer in a family member). Ectopic Pregnancy Sexually active female who has not had a period (or had period with light to scant bleeding) in 6 to 7 weeks complains of lower abdominal/pelvic pain or cramping (intermittent, persistent, or acute). Pain worsens when supine or with jarring. If ruptured, pelvic pain worsens and can be referred to the right shoulder. Medical history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), tubal ligation, or previous ectopic pregnancy. Leading cause of death for women in the first trimester of pregnancy in the United States. NORMAL FINDINGS Anatomy Breasts Puberty in girls starts with breast buds (Tanner stage II) and ends at stage V. 398331 During puberty, it is common for both girls and some boys (45%) to have tender and asymmetrical breasts (gynecomastia). One breast may be larger than the other breast. The upper outer quadrant of the breasts (called the \"tail of Spence\") is where the majority of breast cancer is located. Very-high-risk factors for breast cancer includes the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation or a history of radiation therapy to the chest between the ages of 10 and 30 years. (Risk factors for breast cancer in men are cryptorchidism, positive family history, others.) The diagnostic test for breast cancer (or any type of solid tumor) is the tissue biopsy. Cervix A cervical ectropion looks like bright-red bumpy tissue with an irregular surface on the cervical surface around the os ( Figure 17.1 ). It is a benign finding, made up of glandular cells (same cells that are inside the cervical os). It is more friable (bleeds easily) compared with the squamous epithelial cells on the surface of the cervix (smooth pale pink color cervical surface). Some adolescents and adult women taking birth control pills, and pregnant women, may have large ecropions and this is considered a normal finding (due to high estrogen). It can change in size (or shape) and disappear or regress over time. If an ectropion is present, it is important to sample the surface of the transformation zone area (or the transitional zone) when performing a Pap test. The transformation zone (or the squamocolumnar junction) is an area where abnormal cells are more likely to develop (due to metaplasia). It is the border between the brighter red ectropion and the smoother surface of the cervix. Figure 17.1 Cervical ectropion (6 weeks postpartum). This image can be found in color in the app. Source: O'Nell Starkey. Beautiful Cervix Project. Cervical and Vaginal Mucus Varies from scant (\"dry\"), thick white, runny white (white and clear mucus) to clear stringy mucus 399332 Can be mixed with blood and appear as a red to dark-brownish color during the menstrual cycle Uterus Fibroids (uterine leiomyoma or myoma) can enlarge the uterus. The symptoms are heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), pelvic pain or cramping, and bleeding between periods. Fibroids (uterine leiomyoma/myoma) are usually benign. Can cause heavy menstrual bleeding and cramping, pelvic pain, and urgency (due to fibroid pressing on the bladder). On rare occasions, fibroids can be malignant and cause uterine cancer (leiomyosarcoma). Ovaries The ovaries produce estrogen, progesterone, and a small amount of testosterone (androgens). Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have multiple cysts on their ovaries and high androgen levels (causes acne, hirsutism, oligomenorrhea, insulin resistance). During menopause, the ovaries become atrophied. A palpable ovary in a menopausal woman is always abnormal. Rule out ovarian cancer. Order a pelvic/intravaginal ultrasound and refer to a gynecologist. Benign Variants Supernumerary nipples form a V-shaped line on both sides of the chest down the abdomen and are symmetrically distributed. MENSTRUAL CYCLE This example is based on a perfect 28-day menstrual cycle. Follicular Phase (Days 1 to 14) Estrogen is the predominant hormone during the first 2 weeks of the menstrual cycle. It stimulates the development and growth of the endometrial lining. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary stimulates the follicles (or the \"eggs\") into producing estrogen. known as the proliferative phase . Midcycle (Day 14): Ovulatory Phase is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, which induces ovulation of the dominant follicle. The follicle migrates to the fimbriae of the fallopian tube. Luteal Phase (Days 14 to 28) 400333 Progesterone is the predominant hormone during the last 2 weeks of the cycle. It is produced by the corpus luteum and helps to stabilize the endometrial lining. Menstruation If not pregnant, both estrogen and progesterone fall drastically, inducing menses. Low hormone levels stimulate the hypothalamus, then the anterior pituitary (FSH), and the cycle starts again. Fertile Time Period Sexual intercourse during the 1 to 2 days before ovulation offers the highest chance of pregnancy (Welt, 2017). This time period is characterized by copious amounts of clear mucus that feels thin and elastic in the vagina. This sign is used in the cervical-mucus method of birth control to indicate the fertile period of the cycle. There are now ovulation kits (over the counter) that can detect urinary LH, which appears within 12 hours after it is in the serum (released by the anterior pituitary). False-positive results are possible with women with PCOS, ovarian insufficiency, and menopause. LABORATORY PROCEDURES Pap Test and Liquid-Based Cervical Cytology ( Table 17.1 ) Both the Pap test (also called a Pap smear) and liquid-based cytology are used as cervical screening tests. These tests have a high false-negative rate of 20% to 45%. The liquid-based cervical cytology test (ThinPrep), which is read by a computer, is now more popular in the United States than the conventional Pap smear kit. If the cervix bleeds easily when the brush is inserted to obtain the sample, it may be a sign of inflammation. Rule out cervicitis. Some females may have slight spotting after a Pap test. Do not perform a Pap test or liquid-based cytology during the menstrual period. The best time to perform a Pap test is between 10 and 20 days after the last menses. About 1 to 2 days before the Pap test, tell patient to avoid douching, vaginal foams/medicines, and intercourse if possible. Note The USPSTF (2012) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG; 2015) provide the following guidelines for cervical cancer screening: USPSTF: Cervical cancer is rare before age 21 years. Therefore, the USPSTF (2012) does not recommend Pap tests or human papillomavirus (HPV) testing before age 21 years (do not co-test for HPV before age 21). At the age of 30 years, can perform Pap test with co-testing (HPV testing). Can space routine Pap smears to every 5 years if co-testing (except if abnormal Pap). ACOG: HIV-positive women are the exception to the recommendation against cervical cancer screening before age 21 years. But ACOG is still against co-testing 401if younger than age 30 years. Liquid-Based Cervical Cytology Test (ThinPrep) Insert the broom-shaped plastic brush into the cervical os and rotate in the same direction for five turns. Place the brush in the liquid medium and swish gently. Remove brush and cover with the plastic cap. The cervical cytology test is read by a computer, and abnormal results are reviewed by a cytologist and/or pathologist. Conventional Pap Smear Use wooden spatula to scrape cervical surface (ectocervix). Then insert the brush into the cervical os (endocervix) and twist gently in a circle. Smear the glass slide with both samples. Spray the liquid fixative on the glass slide and label. By sampling the ectocervix first, the chances of bleeding are minimized. Table 17.1 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines Age Screening Exam Screening Interval Age 20 years (or younger) Do not screen (regardless of age of onset of sexual activity) Do not screen Ages 21-29 Liquid-based cytology or conventional Pap test Every 3 years Against HPV co-testing if younger than 30 years Ages 30-65 Liquid-based cytology Every 3 years or or Conventional Pap smear Every 5 years (if co-testing) or If not co-testing, needs Pap test every 3 years Liquid-based cytology plus co- testing (for high-risk HPV) Age older than 65 Can stop screening If not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer * Hysterectomy (with cervical removal) not due to cancer Can stop screening * If not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer * No history of CIN stages 2 to 3, AIS, or cervical cancer * If no history of CIN stages 2 to 3, AIS, or cervical cancer within previous 20 years. AIS, adenocarcinoma in situ; CIN, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; HPV, human papillomavirus. USPSTF (2012). The Bethesda System (Crum & Huh, 2016; Nayar & Kurtycz, 2014) is a standardized system that is used for reporting cervical cytology results. Cervical cytology (Pap test) 402334 combined with HPV testing is used to screen for cervical cancer. A specimen is satisfactory only if both squamous epithelial cells and endocervical cells are present. If lacking either type of cell, specimen is incomplete. Repeat Pap test. If endocervical cells or transformation zone components are missing (unsatisfactory specimen), repeat cytology/Pap test. If cells are obscured by inflammation, treat infection before repeating Pap test. Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASC-US) Ages 20 years or younger: Repeat cytology/Pap test in 12 months. Ages 21 to 24 years: Preferred is repeat Pap test in 12 months (acceptable is reflex HPV test). Ages 25 to 29 years: Preferred is reflex HPV test. Acceptable is repeat Pap test in 12 months. Ages 30 years or older: If oncogenic HPV positive (subtypes 16 and 18), refer for colposcopy. If HPV negative, repeat co-testing in 3 years (ACOG, 2016). Atypical Glandular Cells (AGCs) More common in older women (ages 40-69 years). Associated with premalignancy or malignancy in 30% of cases. Risk of cancer goes up with age. Presence of endometrial cells: LSIL means that cervical cells show changes that are mildly abnormal. They are usually caused by an HPV infection. Ages 21 to 24 years: Repeat Pap test in 12 months. Ages 25 to 29 years: Refer for colposcopy with cervical biopsy. Ages 30 years or older: If HPV negative, repeat Pap test in 12 months (or colposcopy). If HPV positive, refer for colposcopy with cervical biopsy. Treatment ranges from cryotherapy Lesions (HSIL) more serious changes in the cervix than LSIL. They are more likely than LSIL to be associated with precancer and cancer. Ages 21 to 24 years: Refer for colposcopy with cervical biopsy. Ages 25 years or older: Refer for immediate excisional treatment. It can done by LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision) or cervical conization surgery (ACOG, 2016). HPV DNA Test (Reflex HPV Testing) HPV types 16 and 18 together cause 70% of all cases of cervical cancer in the United States (National Cancer Institute, n.d.). Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by HPV infection. Gardasil (males or females) and Cervarix (females only) are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines given at age 11 or 12 years (or as young as age 9 years through 26 years). Colposcopy 403335 A colposcope is a specialized \"microscope\" used to view the cervix. Colposcopy can be performed by a trained physician, nurse practitioner (NP), or physician assistant (PA). The diagnostic test for cervical cancer is a biopsy of the cervix, which is obtained during a colposcopy. A vaginal speculum is used to expose the cervix. After the cervix is studied, it is washed with acetic acid 3% to 5% (vinegar), which helps remove mucus and causes the abnormal areas of the cervix to turn a bright-white color that resembles leukoplakia (acetowhitening). Biopsy samples are obtained from the acetowhitened areas on the cervix, cervical os (glandular cells), and squamocolumnar junction. After a colposcopy, a small amount of cramping and bloody spotting is normal (red, brown, black) in the next few days after the procedure. Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) The loop electrosurgical instrument is a device that is used like a scalpel to cut through the cervix (conization) to treat cervical cancer. Depending on the result of the biopsy (size, depth, and severity), the cancerous cells can be removed by cryotherapy for mild lesions, laser ablation, or surgical conization of cervix. Potassium Hydroxide Slide Useful for helping with the diagnosis of fungal infections (hair, nails, skin). Potassium hydroxide (KOH) works by causing lysis of the squamous cells, which makes it easier to see hyphae and spores. Vaginal specimens do not require KOH to visualize Candida . Whiff Test A test for bacterial vaginosis (BV). A positive result occurs when a strong, fish-like odor is released after one to two drops of KOH are added to the slide (or a cotton swab soaked with discharge). Tzanck Smear Used as an adjunct for evaluating herpetic infection (oral, genital, skin). A positive smear will show large abnormal nuclei in squamous epithelial cells. Not commonly used. EXAM TIPS Recognize menopausal female body changes. If palpable ovary (abnormal), rule out ovarian cancer and order an intravaginal ultrasound. Be familiar with physical breast exam findings (hard irregular mass that is not mobile) and follow-up of breast cancer. For patients aged 21 to 24 years with LSIL Pap result, repeat Pap test in 12 months. 404336 But if aged 25 to 29 years, follow up with colposcopy with cervical biopsy. Pap/cytology and HPV testing are not recommended before age 21 years, even if sexually active, has sexually transmitted disease/infection (STD/STI), or multiple sex partners. If endometrial cells are seen in Pap test, refer for endometrial biopsy. Do not confuse endometrial biopsy with colposcopy, a test used to visualize the cervix and to obtain cervical biopsy. CLINICAL PEARLS Using a small amount of K-Y Jelly to lubricate the tips of the speculum (in patients with atrophic vaginitis to reduce pain and vaginal bleeding) will not affect the Pap test results. In reproductive-age teens or women who present with acute pelvic pain or lower abdominal pain, always perform a pregnancy test (use good-quality urine human chorionic gonadotropin strips). Girls and teenagers have larger ectropions. Some adult women on birth control pills may develop ectropion. CONTRACEPTION There is up to an 85% chance of becoming pregnant within 1 year of unprotected sexual intercourse. Women seeking to prevent pregnancy can choose from among several options with varying degrees of reported effectiveness ( Figure 17.2 ). Figure 17.2 Effectiveness of contraceptive methods. 405337 LNG, Levonorgestrel (Mirena). Source: Association of Reproductive Health Professionals (2014); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2016). ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs; 9% Typical Use Failure Rate) Dosed Monophasic Pills Loestrin FE 1/20: 21 consecutive days of estrogen/progesterone (same dose daily). For the last 7 days of the cycle, the placebo pills contain iron supplementation (7 days of iron pills). Biphasic Pills Ortho-Novum 10/11 : Contains two different progesterone doses (two phases). The progesterone dose increases about halfway through the cycle. Other brands are Mircette, Jenest, etc. Triphasic Pills Ortho Tri-Cyclen: Contains 21 days of active pills and 7 days of placebo pills. The dose of hormones varies weekly for 3 weeks (\"triphasic\"). Progestin used is norgestimate. Indicated for acne. Other Cyclessa, Tri-Norinyl, Tri-Levlen, Triphasil, etc. Extended-Cycle Pills Seasonale: Contains 84 consecutive days (3 months) of estrogen/progesterone with a 7- day pill-free interval. This method typically results in four periods per year although breakthrough bleeding is not uncommon. Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone Yaz (24 active pills and four placebo pills)/ Yasmin: Uses drospirenone (a spironolactone analog) as the progestin component. Consider for women with acne, PCOS, hirsutism, or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). vein thrombosis (DVT) and hyperkalemia. Labs: Check the potassium level is on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), (POPs; 9% Typical Use Failure Rate) Safe for breastfeeding women, and most effective if woman is exclusively breastfeeding. Also known as the \"minipill.\" It is very important to take the pill at the same time each day. If dose is late (3 hours) or a day is missed, the woman should use condoms (backup contraception) or abstain from sexual intercourse for 2 days (Kaunitz, 2017). There is no placebo week with progestin-only pills (Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, 2014). Micronor: Take one pill daily at about the same time each day (each pack contains 28 406338 pills). Start taking pill on day 1 of menstrual cycle. Contraindications to Oral Contraceptive Use Absolute Contraindications Any condition (past or present) that increases the risk of blood clotting History of thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders (i.e., DVT) Genetic coagulation defects such as factor V Leiden disease Major surgery with prolonged immobilization Smoker older than the age of 35, more than 15 cigarettes per day Also considered a relative contraindication because women younger than 35 years who smoke can take the pill (if no other contraindications exist) Any condition that increases the risk of strokes Migraine with aura or focal neurological symptoms or migraine without aura age 35 years or older History of cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) Hypertension mmHg or diastolic BP >100 mmHg) Inflammation and/or acute infections of the liver with elevated LFTs In acute infection or inflammation of the liver (i.e., mononucleosis) with elevated LFTs, estrogen is contraindicated When LFTs are back to normal, can go back on birth control pills Hepatocellular adenomas or malignant (hepatoma) Cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy Known or suspected cardiovascular disease Moderately to severely impaired cardiac function, complicated valvular heart disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) Diabetes with vascular component Systemic lupus erythematosus Hypertension if SBP is 160 or DBP (diastolic blood pressure) 100 mmHg Some reproductive system conditions or cancers Known or suspected pregnancy Undiagnosed genital bleeding or breast mass Breast, endometrial, or ovarian cancer (or any estrogen-dependent cancer) less than 21 days postpartum Absolute Contraindications Mnemonic: \"My CUPLETS\" My Migraines aura C CAD or CVA U Undiagnosed genital bleeding P Pregnant or suspect pregnancy L Liver tumor or active liver disease E Estrogen-dependent tumor T Thrombus or emboli 407S Smoker age 35 or older Relative Contraindications Migraine headaches Migraine older than age 35 years Migraines with focal neurological findings are an absolute contraindication due to increased risk of stroke Smoker younger than age 35 years Fracture or cast on lower extremities Adequately controlled hypertension Advantages of the Pill (After 5 or More Years of Use) Ovarian cancer and endometrial cancers (decreased by 40%-50%) Decreased incidence of: Dysmenorrhea and cramps (decrease in prostaglandins) Decreases symptoms of endometriosis (less pelvic pain) Acne and hirsutism (lower levels of androgenic hormones) Ovarian cysts (due to suppression of ovulation) Heavy and/or irregular periods (due to suppression of ovaries) New Prescriptions Oral contraceptives can be started anytime in the menstrual cycle (rule out pregnancy first). All patients should be instructed to use \"backup\" (condoms) in the first week during the first pill pack. \"Quick Start\": Start taking the pill on the day prescribed (give samples or prescription). Rule out pregnancy first. \"Sunday Start\": Take first pill on the first Sunday after the menstrual period starts. Will avoid having a period on a weekend. \"Day One Start\": Take the first pill during the first day of the menstrual period. Provides the best protection. Follow-up: Follow-up visit needed within 2 to 3 months to check BP, any side effects, and to answer patient's questions. Oral Contraceptive Pill Problems Unscheduled Bleeding (Spotting) Term used for menstrual bleeding that occurs outside of usual cycle. The first 3 weeks (21 days) of pills contain active hormones (estrogen/progesterone). During the fourth week (the last 7 days), the pills are hormone free (when the period occurs). Educate patient that she may have spotting/light bleeding during the first few weeks after starting birth control pills. Discourage patient from switching to another pill brand during the first 3 months 408339 because of spotting. Advise patient that most cases resolve spontaneously. Menstrual Cramps Menstrual cramps are treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which decrease menstrual cramp pain and bleeding by suppressing prostaglandins. Endometriosis is associated with heavy menstrual periods (menorrhagia) with severe cramping in younger women. Mefenamic acid (Ponstel): One capsule every 6 hours for pain as needed Naproxen (Aleve): One enteric-coated tablet every 6 to 8 hours as needed Ibuprofen (Advil) : One to two tablets every 4 to 5 hours as needed. Prescription-strength naproxen sodium (Anaprox, Naprosyn): One tablet BID as needed Missing Consecutive Days of Oral Contraceptive Pills Missed 1 Day Take two pills now and continue with same pill pack (\"doubling up\"). Missed 2 Consecutive Days Take two pills the next 2 days to catch up and finish the birth control pill pack (use condoms for the current pill cycle). Drug Interactions With Oral Contraceptives These drugs can decrease the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Advise patients to use an alternative form of birth control (condoms) when taking these drugs and for one pill cycle Pill Danger Signs ( Table 17.2 ) Thromboembolic events can happen in any organ of the body. These signs indicate a possible thromboembolic event. Advise patient to report these or to call 911 if symptoms of ACHES: A Abdominal pain C Chest pain H Headaches E Eye problems; change in vision S Severe leg pain Table 17.2 Oral Contraceptive Danger Signs Complaints Possible Cause Chest pain (an acute MI) Blood clot in a coronary artery Severe headache Stroke, TIA 409340 Weakness on one side of the body Ischemic stroke caused by a blood clot in the brain Visual changes in one eye Blood clot in the retinal artery of the affected eye Abdominal pain Ischemic pain of the mesenteric area caused by a blood clot Lower leg pain (DVT) Blood clot on a deep vein of the leg DVT, deep vein thrombosis; MI, myocardial infarction; TIA, transient ischemic attack. Considerations When Choosing an Oral Contraceptive Pill Typical use failure rate is 9%. Traditional oral contraceptive pills have 21 days of \"active\" pills and 7 days of placebo pills. The last 7 days are the \"hormone-free\" days. The menstrual period usually starts within 2 to 3 days after the last active pill was taken (from very low levels of estrogen/progesterone). Some brands of birth control pills (e.g., Loestrin FE) contain iron in the pills taken during the last 7 days of the pill cycle (instead of a placebo pill). The last 7 days (hormone-free) of the pill cycle are there to reinforce the habit of daily pill-taking. For the first pill cycle, advise patient to use \"backup\" (an alternative form of birth control). All the COCs, the patch, and the NuvaRing contain both estrogen (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) and progesterone (e.g., levonorgestrel, norethindrone, desogestrel, others). The contraceptive patch (e.g., Ortho Evra) results in higher levels of estrogen exposure compared to COCs (higher risk of blood clots, DVT). The estrogen in COCs can elevate blood pressure. Patients' BP should be checked within 4 to 8 weeks. Breastfeeding women can use the progestin-only pill (\"minipill\"; e.g., Micronor, Nor- QD). OTHER CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS Intrauterine Device (0.2%-0.8% Typical Use Failure Rate) The intrauterine device (IUD) is the second most commonly used method of contraception in the world (female sterilization is the first). Paragard is copper-bearing (effective up to 10 years) and Mirena contains the hormone levonorgestrel, which decreases vaginal bleeding. Mirena IUD is effective for up to 5 years and is slightly more effective than copper-bearing IUDs (Cu-IUDs). Typical failure rate of Cu-IUD is 0.5% to 0.8%. Contraindications Active PID or history of PID within the past year Suspected or confirmed pregnancy or has STD Uterine or cervical abnormality (e.g., bicornate uterus) Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding or uterine/cervical cancer History of ectopic pregnancy 410341 Increased Risk Endometrial and pelvic infections (first few months after insertion only) Perforation of the uterus Heavy or prolonged menstrual periods Education Educate patient to check for missing or shortened string periodically, especially after each menstrual period. If the patient or clinician does not feel the string, order a pelvic ultrasound. Depo-Provera (0.05% Typical Failure Rate) Each dose by injection lasts 3 months. Also known as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate ( DMPA ). Highly effective. Check for pregnancy before starting dose. Start within first 5 days of cycle (day 1-5) because females are less likely to ovulate at these times. Women on Depo-Provera for at least 1 year (or longer) have amenorrhea because of severe uterine atrophy from lack of estrogen. Do not recommend to women who want to become pregnant in 12 months. Causes delayed return of fertility. It takes up to 1 year for most women to start ovulating. Black Box Warning: Avoid long-term use (more than 2 years). Increases risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis that may not be fully reversible. Using Depo-Provera for more than 2 years is discouraged. History of Anorexia Nervosa Consider testing for osteopenia/osteoporosis (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA] scan). Avoid using Depo-Provera in this population because it will further increase their risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis. Recommend calcium with vitamin D and weight-bearing exercises for patients who are on this medicine. Diaphragm With Contraceptive Gel and Cervical Cap (12% Failure Rate) The diaphragm must be used with spermicidal gel. After intercourse, leave diaphragm inside vagina for at least 6 to 8 hours (can remain inside vagina up to 24 hours). Need additional spermicide application before every act of intercourse. Apply the spermicidal foam/gel inside the vagina without removing the diaphragm. The cervical cap (Prentif cap) can be worn up to 72 hours. Compared with the diaphragm, the Prentif cap may cause abnormal cervical cellular change (abnormal Pap). Increased Risk Urinary tract infections (UTIs) and toxic shock syndrome (rare) Condoms 411342 Male Condoms (18% Failure Rate) More effective than the female condom Female Condoms (21% Failure Rate) Do not use with any oil-based lubricants, creams, etc. Cervical Ring (9% Failure Rate) NuvaRing is a plastic cervical ring that contains etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol and is left inside the vagina for 3 weeks, then removed for 1 week (when woman has her period). Educate patient on how to apply and remove (the ring should fit snugly around cervix). Absolute and relative contraindications for combined estrogen-progesterone method of contraception are the same as oral contraceptives. Do not use NuvaRing if cigarette smoker age 35 years or older. Ortho Evra Transdermal Contraceptive Patch (9% Failure Rate) Higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE; releases higher levels of estrogen) compared to oral contraceptive pills. Absolute and relative contraindications for combined estrogen-progesterone method of contraception are the same as oral contraceptives. Etonogestrel Contraceptive Implant (0.05% Failure Rate) The contraceptive implant contains a long-acting form of progestin (etonogestrel). Initially, unscheduled bleeding is common, but when the endometrial lining atrophies, amenorrhea results. Ovulation may not occur for a few weeks to 12 months after removal. Thin plastic rods are inserted on the inner aspect of the upper arm subdermally (nondominant arm). If keloid scarring occurs, may have problem with removal. Norplant II (two rods) is effective up to 5 years. Implanon (now known as Nexplanon ) (one rod) is effective for up to 3 years. Emergency Contraception (\"Morning-After Pill\") Works best if taken within 72 hours after unprotected sexual intercourse or if 2 consecutive days of birth control pills are skipped. Rule out preexisting pregnancy first. Emergency contraception: This is 89% effective. Brands include Plan B, My Way, or Next Choice. A few birth control pills that contains levonorgestrel (i.e., Triphasil) may be used as morning-after pills but are more likely to cause nausea (because of the estrogen). Take first dose taken as soon as possible (up to 72 hours after). Take second dose in 12 hours. If patient vomits tablet within 1 hour (or less), may need to repeat dose. Over-the- counter (OTC) antiemetics (antihistamine drug and meclizine (Dramamine Less Drowsy). Advise patient that if she does not have a period in next 3 weeks, she should return for follow-up to rule out pregnancy. EXAM TIPS Low-dose birth control pills contain 20 to 25 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. Desogen, Ortho-TriCyclen, and Yaz/Yasmin are all indicated for treatment of acne. Know what to do if 2 consecutive days of the pill are missed (take two pills the next 2 days to finish cycle and use condoms until next cycle starts). Avoid using Depo-Provera in anorexic and/or bulimic patients (very high risk of osteoporosis). Women taking Seasonale will have only four periods per year. Mefenamic acid (Ponstel) is an NSAID that is very effective for menstrual pain. Know how to use Plan B (emergency contraception). Cu-IUD lasts 10 to 12 years. Mirena (progesterone IUD) lasts 5 years. Some questions will ask for the best birth control method for a case scenario. Remember the contraindications or adverse effects of each method (e.g., Depo- Provera). CLINICAL PEARLS Yaz or Yasmin contain estrogen and drospirenone. Has a higher risk of blood clots, stroke, heart attacks, and hyperkalemia. Do not recommend Depo-Provera for women who want to become pregnant in 12 to 18 months because it may cause delayed return of fertility. It can take up to 1 year for some women to start ovulating. Cu-IUD probably has the broadest indication for use as a contraceptive for women with medical conditions (diabetics, smoker for more than 35 years, on anticonvulsant or antiretroviral therapy, ovarian cancer, ischemic heart disease, liver tumors, etc.). DISEASE REVIEW Fibrocystic Breasts Monthly hormonal cycle induces breast tissue to become engorged and painful. Symptoms occur 2 weeks before the onset of menses (luteal phase) and are at their worst right before the menstrual cycle. Resolves after menses start. Commonly starts in women in their 30s. Classic Case 413Adult to middle-aged woman complains of the cyclic onset of bilateral breast tenderness and breast lumps that start from a few days (up to 2 weeks) before her period for many years. Once menstruation starts, the tenderness disappears and the size of breast lumps decreases. During breast examination, the breast lumps are tender and feel rubbery, and are mobile to touch. Denies dominant mass, skin changes, nipple discharge, or enlarged nodes. Objective Findings Multiple mobile and rubbery cystic masses on both breasts Both breasts have symmetrical findings Treatment Plan Stop caffeine intake. Take vitamin E and evening primrose capsules daily Wear bras with good support Referral needed if dominant mass, skin changes, fixed mass Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Hormonal abnormality marked by anovulation, infertility, excessive androgen production, and insulin resistance. These females are at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, endometrial hyperplasia, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. Classic Case Obese teen or young adult complains of excessive facial and body hair (hirsutism 70%), bad acne, and amenorrhea or infrequent periods (oligomenorrhea). Dark thick hair (terminal hair) is seen on the face, cheek, and beard areas. Treatment Plan Transvaginal ultrasound: Enlarged ovaries seen with multiple small follicles (sizes Serum testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and androstenedione are elevated. FSH levels are normal or low. Fasting blood glucose and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) are abnormal. Medications Use low-dose oral contraceptives to suppress ovaries. Spironolactone is used to decrease and control hirsutism. If patient does not want oral contraceptives, give medroxyprogesterone tablets (Provera) 5 to 10 mg daily for 10 to 14 days (repeat every 1-2 months to induce menses). Metformin (Glucophage) is used to induce ovulation (if desires pregnancy). Warn reproductive-age diabetic females (who do not want to become pregnant) to use birth control. Weight loss reduces androgen and insulin levels. Complications PCOS patients are at increased risk for: Coronary heart disease (CHD) Type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome 414344 Cancer of the breast and endometrium Central obesity Infertility Osteoporosis A gradual loss of bone density secondary to estrogen deficiency and other metabolic disorders. Most common in older women (White or Asian descent) who are thin and with small body frames, especially if positive family history. Treat postmenopausal women (or men aged 50 years or older) who have osteoporosis (T-score 2.5 or less) or history of hip or vertebral fracture. Other risk groups include: Patients on chronic steroids (severe asthma, autoimmune disorders, etc.) are at high risk for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis; rule out osteoporosis in older women (or men) on chronic steroids, especially if accompanied by other risk factors (lower testosterone, small frame, thin, White, or Asian) Patients who have Anorexia nervosa and bulimia Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole (Prilosec) Gastric bypass, celiac disease, hyperthyroidism, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and others Lifestyle Risk Factors Low calcium intake, vitamin D deficiency, inadequate physical activity Alcohol consumption (three or more drinks per day), high caffeine intake Smoking (active or passive) Bone Density Test Scores Use DXA to measure the bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip and spine; do baseline and repeat in 1 to 2 years (if on treatment regimen) to assess the efficacy of the medicine; if not on treatment, repeat DXA in 2 to 5 years Osteoporosis: T-scores of 2.5 or lower standard deviations (SD) at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip region Osteopenia: T-scores between 1.5 and 2.4 SD Treatment Plan Weight-bearing exercises most days of the week Swimming and biking are not considered a weight-bearing exercise (but good for severe arthritis) Weight-bearing exercises are walking, jogging, aerobic dance classes, most sports, yoga, tai chi Isometric exercises are not considered a weight-bearing type of exercise Calcium with vitamin D 1,200 mg/d, vitamin D 2 (50,000 IU once weekly), and vitamin D 3 (800 mg to 1,000 IU/d) Medications 415345 Bisphosphonates First-line drugs for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (women and men), and osteoporosis in men Potent esophageal irritant (advise patients to report sore throat, dysphagia, midsternal pain); cause inhibits bone resorption Fosamax (alendronate) 5 to 10 mg daily or 70 mg weekly Actonel (risedronate) 5 mg daily or 35 mg weekly (or 150-mg tablet once a month) Take immediately upon awakening in a.m. with full glass (6-8 ounces) of plain water (do not use mineral water) Take tablets sitting or standing and wait at least 30 minutes before lying down Do not crush, split, or chew tablets; swallow the tablets whole Never take these drugs with other medications, juice, coffee, antacids, vitamins Will cause severe esophagitis or esophageal perforation if lodged in the esophagus Alendronate (Fosamax) 10 mg once a day or 70 mg once a week Consider prophylaxis for high-risk postmenopausal women with osteopenia Repeat dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) after 2 years of therapy Contraindications: Inability to sit upright, esophageal motility disorders, history of PUD or history of GI bleeding Osteonecrosis of the jaw (mandible or maxilla) more likely if on intravenous or intramuscular bisphosphonates; complains of jaw heaviness, pain, swelling, and loose teeth Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) Class Evista (raloxifene) blocks estrogen receptors; a category X drug Approved for use after menopause. For postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who also need breast cancer (estrogen-receptor positive) prophylaxis Do not use to treat menopausal symptoms (aggravates hot flashes) Does not stimulate endometrium or breast tissue Black Box Warning : Increases risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism; increased risk of death from stroke (postmenopausal women with history of heart disease) These drugs reduce risk of breast cancer (if taken long term up to 5 years) SERMs are an option for patients who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to biphosphanates Used as adjunct treatment for estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers Tamoxifen (Nolvadex) Used for breast cancer that is hormone-receptor positive; can be taken up to 5 years Increased risk of DVT, endometrial cancer, strokes, and pulmonary emboli Common side effects: Causes hot flashes, white or brownish vaginal discharge, weight gain or loss Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) Analog Teriparatide (Forteo) injection is recombinant human parathyroid hormone for 416346 treatment of osteoporosis; it comes as a prefilled injector; there is a warning about this drug, as it increased the incidence of osteosarcoma in rats Other: Miacalcin and Calcitriol Calcitonin salmon, derived from salmon; weak antifracture efficacy compared with biphosphonates and PTH Calcitriol: Vitamin D analog; must be on a low-calcium diet; monitor patient for hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and renal insufficiency; may be effective in preventing glucocorticoid and posttransplant-related bone loss Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Average age of menopause for women in the United States is 51 years. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) showed that combined estrogen-progestin replacement therapy (ERT) increased the risk of stroke, heart disease, venous thromboembolism, breast cancer, and pulmonary embolism. The USPSTF does not recommend combined estrogen and progestin or unopposed estrogen for prevention of chronic conditions (heart disease, osteoporosis). But the advice does not apply to women who want hormone therapy for relief of menopausal symptoms. Experts recommend duration of therapy of less than 5 years because of increased risk of breast cancer. Many experts consider it safe for healthy women within 10 years of menopause (younger than 60 years) with no contraindications for estrogen. Women who have a uterus need both estrogen and progesterone (decreases risk of endometrial cancer); use unopposed estrogen for dyspareunia and vaginal/urethral atrophy. Estrogen risk of developing or exacerbating systemic lupus erythematosus (birth control pills are contraindicated in women with lupus). Ovarian Cancer Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer in women in the United States. It is seldom diagnosed during the early stages of the disease. Most often, an older woman complains of vague symptoms such as abdominal bloating and discomfort, low-back pain, pelvic pain, urinary frequency, and constipation (frequently blamed on benign conditions) for certain women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. By the time the cancer is diagnosed, it has almost always metastasized. Symptoms in patients with metastatic disease depend on area affected and may include bone pain, abdominal pain, headache, blurred vision, others. Some experts recommend risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) between ages 35 and 40 years (after childbearing complete) for certain women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. BSO has a significant effect in reducing ovarian cancer risk in this population. Although the USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for ovarian cancer in the general population (Grade D), high-risk women with suspected BRCA 1 / BRCA 2 mutations should be referred for genetic counseling. If ovarian cancer screening is done, a transvaginal ultrasound with serum cancer antigen (CA-125) is ordered. The screening starts at age 30 years (or 5 to 10 years before earliest age of first diagnosis of 417347 ovarian cancer in a family member). VULVOVAGINAL INFECTIONS ( TABLE 17.3 ) Table 17.3 Vaginal Disorders Type Signs/Symptoms Lab Results Bacterial vaginosis \"Fish-like\" vaginal odor; profuse milk-like discharge that coats the vaginal vault Clue cells no WBCs Not itchy/vulva not red; Scant no discharge Atrophic on Pap test Fewer rugae, vaginal color pale; dyspareunia (painful intercourse); may bleed slightly during speculum examination (if not on by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria in the vagina. Risk factors include sexual activity, new or multiple sex partners, and douching. Not an STD; therefore, sexual partner does not need treatment. Pregnant women with BV are at higher risk for intrauterine infections and premature labor. Classic Case Sexually active female complains of an unpleasant and fish-like vaginal odor that is worse after intercourse (if no condom is used). Vaginal discharge is copious and has milk-like consistency. Speculum examination reveals off-white to light-gray discharge coating the vaginal walls. There is no vulvar or vaginal redness or irritation (vaginal anaerobic bacteria do not cause inflammation). Labs Wet Smear Microscopy Findings: Clue cells and very few WBCs. bacteria (82%), a gram- 418348 rod-shaped bacteria. Clue cells: Made up of squamous epithelial cells with a large amount of bacteria coating the surface that obliterates the edges of the squamous epithelial cells ( Figure 17.3 ). Figure 17.3 Clue cell. This image can be found in color in the app. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2015). Whiff Test Apply one drop of KOH to a cotton swab that is soaked with vaginal discharge. Positive: A strong \"fishy\" odor is released. Vaginal pH Alkaline vaginal pH greater than 4.5. Normal vaginal pH is between 4.0 and 4.5 (acidic). Treatment Plan Prescribe metronidazole (Flagyl) BID \u00d7 7 days. Alternative: Metronidazole vaginal gel one applicator at bedtime for 5 days. Watch for disulfiram (Antabuse) effect if combined with alcohol (severe nausea, headache, etc.). Prescribe clindamycin (Cleocin) cream at HS \u00d7 7 days (oil based). Oil-based creams can weaken condoms. Sex partners: Treatment is not recommended by the CDC because BV is not an STD. Abstain from sexual intercourse until treatment is done. Candidal Vaginitis Overgrowth of Candida albicans yeast in the vulva/vagina. Considered normal vaginal flora, but can also be pathogenic. Diabetics, those who are HIV-positive, on antibiotics (i.e., amoxicillin), or have any type of immunosuppression are at higher risk. (The male penis can also be infected [balanitis].) Classic Case 419349 Adult female presents with complaints of white cheese-like (\"curd-like\") vaginal discharge accompanied by severe vulvovaginal pruritus, swelling, and redness (inflammatory reaction). May complain of external pruritus of the vulva and vagina. Labs: Wet Smear Microscopy Swipe cotton swab with vaginal discharge in the middle of a glass slide. Add a few drops of normal saline (to the discharge). Cover the sample with a cover slip and examine it under the microscope (set it at high power). Findings: Pseudohyphae and spores with a large number of WBCs are present. Treatment Plan Miconazole (Monistat), clotrimazole for days (over tablet \u00d7 1 dose, terconazole (Terazol-3) vaginal cream/suppository If patient is on an antibiotic such as amoxicillin, recommend daily yogurt or lactobacillus pills Trichomonal Vaginitis that infects genitourinary tissue (both males and females). Infection causes inflammation (pruritus, burning, and irritation) of vagina/urethra. Classic Case Adult female complains of very pruritic, reddened vulvovaginal area. May complain of dysuria. Copious grayish-green and bubbly vaginal discharge. Male partners may have dysuria and frequency (urethritis) or may be asymptomatic. Objective Findings \"Strawberry cervix\" from small points of bleeding on cervical surface (punctate hemorrhages) Swollen and reddened vulvar and vaginal area; vaginal pH greater than 5.0 Dysuria (burning) with urination Labs Microscopy (use low power): Mobile unicellular organisms with flagella (flagellates) and a large amount of WBCs Treatment Plan Metronidazole (Flagyl) 2 g PO \u00d7 1 dose (preferred) or 500 mg BID \u00d7 7 days Treat sexual partner because trichomoniasis is considered an STI; avoid sex until both partners complete treatment Atrophic Vaginitis 420Chronic lack of estrogen in estrogen-dependent tissue of urogenital tract; results in atrophic changes in the vulva and vagina of menopausal women. Estrogen is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe vaginal atrophy. Low-dosed topical estrogen therapy is preferred because of low systemic absorption. Classic Case Menopausal female complains of vaginal dryness, itching, and pain with sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). Complains of a great deal of discomfort with speculum examinations (i.e., Pap tests). Pap test result is \"abnormal\" secondary to atrophic changes. Objective Findings Atrophic labia with decreased rugae, vulva or vagina may have fissures Dry, pale pink color to vagina Treatment Plan If Pap is mildly abnormal (atrophic changes), consider temporary use of topical estrogen vaginal cream for a few weeks and repeat Pap test. Topical conjugated estrogen comes in several forms; as a cream, insert, or cervical ring. Apply topical estrogens intravaginally (Premarin, Extrace, Vagifem). Need progesterone supplementation (if intact uterus) if using long term to decrease risk of endometrial hyperplasia. EXAM TIPS Know female body changes in menopause. If palpable ovary (abnormal), order an intravaginal ultrasound. Know physical exam findings (hard irregular mass that is not mobile) and follow-up for breast cancer. Mefenamic acid (Ponstel) is an NSAID that is very effective for menstrual pain. Know how to take bisphosphonates (e.g., Fosamax, Actonel) and their contraindications. Know the bone density score for osteoporosis (T-score of >2.5 SD) and for osteopenia (T-score of 1.5 to 2.4 SD). There will be questions on all the types of vaginitis (BV, trichomonal, candidal, atrophic vaginitis). The questions range from diagnosis, workup and lab tests, to treatment. Become familiar with BV. \"Clue cells\" are squamous epithelial cells that have blurred edges due to the large number of bacteria on the cell's surface (see Figure 17.3 ). CLINICAL PEARLS Become familiar with the vaginal infections, their presentation, and treatment. Wet 421350 smear or microscopy is gold-standard diagnosis (bacterial vaginosis, candidal trichomonal vaginitis). Women who have persistent vaginal and urinary tract infections, despite hygiene measures, adequate hydration, and in the absence of sexual exposures from partner(s), should be screened for underlying glucose metabolism disorders and diabetes. 422351 18 Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) or Infections (STIs) Review DANGER SIGNALS HIV/AIDS The median time between initial HIV infection and AIDS is 10 years (CDC, 2015). AIDS is defined by an absolute CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm 3 along with certain opportunistic infections and malignancies. CD4 levels in healthy people range between 500 and 16,000 cells/mm 3 . Signs and symptoms that suggest AIDS are oral candidiasis (thrush), fever, weight loss, diarrhea, cough, shortness of breath, purple to bluish-red bumps on the skin (Kaposi's sarcoma), and certain jirovecii , formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii , is the infection that causes the most deaths in patients with HIV. Acute HIV Infection (Acute Retroviral Syndrome) Very infectious due to extremely high viral load (>100,000 copies/mL) in blood and genital secretions. The initial immune response may mimic mononucleosis (fever, headache, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, rash, joint ache, and myalgia). These symptoms are seen in 50% to 90% of persons within 2 to 4 few weeks after initial infection with the HIV virus. During this time, the HIV antibody tests may still be negative (window period). Most people (97%) develop antibodies within 3 months after exposure. If you strongly suspect acute HIV infection, order the HIV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which can detect infection 7 to 28 days after exposure. Disseminated Gonococcal Disease (Disseminated Gonorrhea) 423352 Sexually active adult from high-risk population complains of petechial or pustular skin lesions of hands/soles (acral lesions); swollen, red, and tender joints in one large joint (migratory asymmetrical arthritis) such as the knee. May be accompanied by signs of STD (i.e., cervicitis, urethritis). If pharyngitis, will have severe sore throat with green purulent throat exudate that does not respond to usual antibiotics used for strep throat. Occasionally complicated by perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome) and rarely endocarditis or meningitis. NORMAL FINDINGS Female normal findings covered in Chapter 17 . Male normal findings covered in Chapter 16 . STD Screening Recommended by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; 2015) Routine annual screening of all sexually active females aged 25 years or younger for Chlamydia trachomatis and gonorrhea If infected, retest for chlamydia and gonorrhea 3 months after treatment (to check for reinfection, not for test-of-cure) Annual testing for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea in persons with HIV infection Minors do not need parental consent if the clinic visit is related to testing or treating STDs and birth control; no state requires parental consent for STD care Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM) Annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea at sites of contact (urethra, rectum) regardless of condom use. Screen every 3 to 6 months if at increased risk. Annual screening recommended for pharyngeal gonorrhea (throat). Screen every 3 to 6 months if at increased risk. Annual testing recommended for HIV, syphilis, and for HBsAg. Retest more frequently if at risk. STD Risk Factors Younger ages (females aged 15-24 years); sex initiated at a younger age Multiple sexual partners, new sexual partner in past 60 days Inconsistent condom use, unmarried status History of previous STD infection, illicit drug use Genital ulceration (increases risk of HIV transmission) Use of alcohol or illicit drugs Adolescents 424353 DISEASE REVIEW Chlamydia trachomatis Most chlamydial infections are asymptomatic. The highest prevalence is among persons 25 years of age or younger. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial STD in the United States. It is an obligate intracellular bacterium (atypical bacterium). Annual screening of all sexually active women younger than 25 years of age is recommended, as is screening of older women at increased risk for infection (e.g., those who have a new sexual partner, more than one sexual partner, a sexual partner with concurrent partners, or a sexual partner with an STI [CDC, 2015]). Possible Sites of Infection Females : Cervicitis, endometritis, salpingitis (fallopian tubes), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Epididymitis, prostatitis Both genders : Urethritis, pharyngitis, proctitis Complications : scarring, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, Reiter's syndrome (males), Fitz-Hugh-Curtis (Both Gonorrhea and Chlamydia) Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are highly tests for both gonorrhea and chlamydia. Swab samples (vagina, cervix, urethra, rectum, pharynx) or urine specimen can be collected for both males and females. Vaginal swab specimens can be collected by a provider or self-collected in a clinical setting. Self-collected vaginal swab specimens are equivalent in sensitivity and specificity to those collected by a clinician using NAATs. Preferred diagnostic test for men is urine specimen for NAAT. Collect the first part of the urinary stream (15-20 mL) from the first void of the day. For samples from pharynx or rectum, swab using a NAAT test. Another option for gonorrhea is to order gonorrheal culture (Thayer-Martin or chocolate agar). Chlamydial cultures are not used in primary care (use test). Gram stain: Polymorphonuclear leukocytes with used for males with gonorrheal urethritis. Not commonly used in primary care. Treatment Plan Uncomplicated Infections Chlamydia (Cervicitis, Urethritis, Sexual Partners) No test-of-cure is necessary for azithromycin or doxycycline regimen Azithromycin 1 g PO in a single dose (directly observed treatment [DOT] preferred) or doxycycline 100 mg BID \u00d7 7 days Swallow with large amount of water; may cause esophagitis if tablet gets stuck in throat (difficulty and/or pain with swallowing, acute-onset heartburn, nausea/vomiting) Nausea, GI upset, photosensitivity (avoid sun or use sunscreen) 425354 Category D drug (stains growing tooth enamel) Sexual Partners Administer azithromycin 1 g PO in a single dose. Patient and partner abstain from sex for 7 days. Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT) is the practice of treating the sexual partner(s) of a patient diagnosed with an STD without the sexual partner being seen or evaluated by the health care provider. EPT is permissible (CDC, 2017) in 41 states, potentially allowable in seven states, and prohibited in two states (Kentucky, South Carolina). Use the following CDC website to check if EPT is legal in your state ( www.cdc.gov/std/ept/legal/default.htm ) Complicated Infections Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) 250 mg IM \u00d7 one dose plus doxycycline PO BID \u00d7 14 days with or without metronidazole (Flagyl) PO BID \u00d7 14 days Neisseria gonorrhoeae A bacterium that infects tracts, rectum, and pharynx. Unlike chlamydia, gonorrhea can become systemic or disseminated if left untreated. If positive for N. gonorrhoeae , cotreat for both (even if negative chlamydial tests) because of the high rate of coinfection. Do not use quinolones to treat gonorrhea due to high-level resistance. Laboratory Tests Discussed in chlamydia section in this chapter. Classic Case Sexually active female complains of purulent green-colored vaginal discharge. May walk using shuffling gait to avoid pelvic pain. Speculum examination reveals purulent discharge on the cervix, which may be friable (bleeds easily). Males will have penile discharge and dysuria and may report staining of underwear with green purulent discharge. History of new partner (<3 months) or multiple sexual partners. Inconsistent condom use. Signs and symptoms depend on the organ/site that becomes infected. Signs and Symptoms (by Site) Cervicitis (mucopurulent cervix, pain, mild bleeding after intercourse, dyspareunia) Urethritis (scant to copious purulent discharge, dysuria, frequency, urgency) Proctitis (pruritus, rectal pain, tenesmus, or feeling urge to defecate even if rectum is empty, avoidance of defecation due to pain) Pharyngitis (severe sore throat unresponsive to typical antibiotics, purulent green- discharge on the posterior pharynx) Bartholin's warm [or has purulent discharge] that is located on each side of the introitus or vestibule) Endometritis (menometrorrhagia, or heavy prolonged menstrual bleeding) 426355 Salpingitis (fallopian tubes) and PID (one-sided pelvic or lower abdominal pain, adnexal pain, dyspareunia or painful intercourse and/or cervical motion tenderness) Epididymitis and prostatitis (discussed in Chapter 16 ) Syphilis Screen for syphilis if HIV infection, MSM, presence of any genital ulcer (especially if painless chancre), previous STD, pregnancy, intravenous drug use, or high risk. Treponema pallidum (spirochete) infection becomes systemic if untreated. Classic Case Signs and symptoms are dependent on stage of infection. Primary Painless chancre (heals in 6-9 weeks if not treated) Chancre has clean base, well demarcated with indurated margins Secondary (More Than 2 Years) Condyloma lata (infectious white papules in moist areas that look like white warts) Maculopapular rash on palms and soles that is not pruritic (may be generalized) Latent Stage Asymptomatic but will have positive titers Tertiary (3-10 Years) Neurosyphilis, gumma (soft tissue tumors), aneurysms, valvular damage, and so on Labs Two types of syphilis serologic tests (treponemal and nontreponemal tests) are needed to diagnose syphilis. Step 1\u2014 Order screening test (nontreponemal tests): Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL). If reactive, RPR (or VDRL) and FTA-ABS (or other treponemal test) are reactive: This is diagnostic for syphilis. During treatment if initial test used is RPR, order sequential RPR to document treatment response. If initial test is VDRL, order sequential VDRL. Use the same laboratory to monitor. If RPR or VDRL shows a fourfold or higher (>1:4) decrease in titers, patient is responding to treatment. Treatment Plan 427Primary Syphilis (Chancre), Secondary Syphilis, or penicillin G (Bicillin L-A) 2.4 million units IM \u00d7 one dose Latent Syphilis (>1 Year), Latent Unknown Duration Syphilis Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM once per week \u00d7 3 weeks Penicillin allergy: Doxycycline, tetracycline, and for neurosyphilis, ceftriaxone; use these therapies with close clinical and laboratory follow-up; refer to specialist Follow-Up Recheck RPR or VDRL at 6 and 12 months after treatment (look for at least a fourfold decrease in the pretreatment and posttreatment titers). Treat sexual partner(s) from previous 90 days before patient's diagnosis even if their RPR or VDRL is negative. Test patient and partner(s) for HIV and other STDs. Refer to infectious disease specialist for suspected neurosyphilis, poor response to treatment, penicillin allergy, or if primary clinician not familiar with syphilis management. EXAM TIPS RPR or VDRL are the screening tests for syphilis. If positive RPR or VDRL (nontreponemal test), reactive FTA-ABS, infection, always co-treat for chlamydia. Gonorrhea treated with ceftriaxone IM 250 mg x one dose (for both uncomplicated/complicated cases) plus co-treat for chlamydia. Learn treatment of PID and proctitis. Do not confuse condyloma acuminata (genital warts) with condyloma lata (secondary syphilis). Know tertiary syphilis treatment Acute retroviral syndrome or primary HIV infection flu-like or mono-like infection is very infectious at this stage of HIV infection. Best if HIV is treated as early as possible. CLINICAL PEARLS False-positive RPR can be caused by pregnancy, Lyme disease, autoimmune diseases, chronic or acute disease. Recheck syphilitic chancre in 3 to 7 days after injection (should start healing). Nontreponemal titers (RPR or VDRL) usually decline after treatment, but in some persons, nontreponemal antibodies can persist for a long time (serofast reaction). Most patients with reactive nontreponemal tests will be reactive for the rest of their 428356 lives (low titers), but 15% to 25% revert to serologically CDC-RECOMMENDED STD TREATMENT REGIMENS ( TABLE 18.1 ) Uncomplicated Infections Cervix, Urethra, Rectum, and Pharynx First-Line Therapy Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) 250 one plus cotreat for chlamydia Azithromycin 1 g orally \u00d7 one dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally \u00d7 7 days Test-of-cure (i.e., repeat testing 3 to 4 weeks after treatment) is not needed (except pregnant women). If symptoms persist, obtain specimen for gonococcal culture and sensitivity. Management of Sexual Partners Treat male partners of women with PID if sexual contact during the 60 days preceding the patient's symptoms. Avoid sex until both partners finish treatment and no longer have symptoms. Complicated Gonococcal Infections PID, Acute Epididymitis, Acute Prostatitis, Acute Proctitis Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) 250 one dose plus cotreat for chlamydia Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID \u00d7 14 days with or without metronidazole (Flagyl) 500 mg PO BID \u00d7 14 days Table 18.1 Sexually Transmitted Diseases: Treatment Guidelines Diseases and Organism Uncomplicated Infections Complicated Infections Chlamydia Chlamydia trachomatis Azithromycin 1 g \u00d7 one dose Doxycycline 100 mg Pregnancy * or BID \u00d7 14 days Azithromycin 1 g \u00d7 one dose Doxycycline 100 mg days * Ceftriaxone 250 \u00d7one dose plus Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM \u00d7 one dose plus Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM \u00d7 one dose plus Azithromycin 1 g \u00d7 once Azithromycin 1 g \u00d7 one dose or Doxycycline 100 mg BID \u00d7 7 Doxycycline 100 mg BID G 2.4 mU IM \u00d7 one dose Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 mU IM weekly \u00d7 3 weeks Primary or secondary syphilis or early latent <1 year More than 1 year's duration or latent syphilis; refer Treat sexual partners Follow-up of cases is mandatory (any stage of disease) Retreat if clinical signs recur or sustained fourfold titers * Doxycycline is contraindicated in lactation/pregnancy (category D). BID, two times a day; IM, intramuscular; PID, pelvic inflammatory disease. Source: Adapted from the Centers for Disease Control (2017). Disseminated Gonococcal Infection Refer to emergency department or infectious disease specialist. Administer ceftriaxone (Rocephin) 1 g IM or IV every 24 hours. Risk Factors for PID History of PID: 25% recurrence Multiple partners Age 25 years or younger Labs Reproductive-aged females: Rule out pregnancy first Women can insert a swab inside the vagina for NAAT test (vaginal fluid) Both men and women can obtain urine specimen for NAAT by using initial urinary stream (first urine of the day) Gonorrhea (anaerobic cultures), such as the Thayer-Martin or chocolate agar, is an alternative to test rectum or pharynx infection Gram Stain Useful for gonorrhea only; look for gram-negative diplococci in clusters (HBsAg), herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) 430358 Partners should be tested and treated; no sex until both complete treatment UNUSUAL COMPLICATIONS Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome (Perihepatitis) Chlamydial and/or gonococcal infection of the liver capsule (not the liver itself). There is extensive scarring between the liver capsule and abdominal contents (e.g., colon). Scars look like \"violin strings\" (seen on laparoscopy). A complication of PID (10%) due to chlamydia and/or gonococcal infection. Classic Case Sexually active female with symptoms of PID complains of right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain and tenderness on palpation. The liver function tests are normal. Treated as a complicated gonorrheal/chlamydial infection (ceftriaxone [Rocephin] 250 mg IM plus doxycycline PO BID \u00d7 14 days). Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction Acute febrile reaction that can occur during the first 24 hours after treatment of syphilis and other spirochete infections (e.g., Lyme disease). Look for acute-onset fever, chills, headache, myalgias. An immune-mediated reaction that usually resolves spontaneously within 12 to 24 hours. Treatment is supportive. Reiter's Syndrome More common in males. An immune-mediated reaction secondary to infection with certain bacteria (e.g., chlamydia) that spontaneously resolves. Treatment is supportive (e.g., NSAIDs). Classic Case A male with current history of chlamydia genital infection (i.e., urethritis) complains of red and swollen joints that come and go (migratory arthritis in large joints such as knee) and ulcers on the skin of the glans penis. Mnemonic: \"I can't see (conjunctivitis), pee (urethritis), or climb up a tree (migratory arthritis in large joint such as the knee).\" EXAM TIPS Use ceftriaxone (Rocephin) 250 mg IM \u00d7 one dose for both uncomplicated and complicated gonorrheal infection. Recognize proctitis symptoms and treatment. Become familiar with the treatment regimens for chlamydia and gonorrhea. If gonorrheal test is positive, always cotreat for chlamydia even if the chlamydial test 431359 result is negative. Inverse is not true. If chlamydia, do not give prophylaxis against gonorrhea unless indicated. Azithromycin used for pregnant patients who have chlamydia. Test-of-cure needed 3 to 4 weeks after treatment. HSV-1 infection more common on oral mucosa and HSV-2 more common on the genitals. Learn presentation of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis or Jarisch-Herxheimer syndrome. If STD symptoms with new onset of swollen red knee on side (or another joint), may be caused by disseminated gonorrheal infection (DGI). CLINICAL PEARLS PID is a clinical diagnosis. Even if both gonorrheal and chlamydial tests are negative, treat a sexually active patient who has signs and symptoms of PID combined with a sexual history. Probably better to \"overtreat\" than to miss treating possible PID infections. A large study found that adnexal tenderness is the most sensitive physical exam finding for PID (compared with cervical motion tenderness, which may be negative). After treating a patient for PID, follow up within 72 hours and perform vaginal bimanual examination to check for improvement of adnexal tenderness and/or cervical motion tenderness. For STDs treated with azithromycin 1 g \u00d7 one dose (chlamydia), instruct patient and partner not to have sex for at least 7 days. HIV INFECTION HIV attacks the CD4 T-lymphocytes. In the United States and worldwide, HIV-1 is the most common strain. In West Africa, HIV-2 is more common. Currently, 36.7 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS. Almost 15% of HIV-infected persons in the United States are unaware of their HIV infection. Risk Factors Sexual intercourse with an HIV-infected person, or with gay or bisexual men Received blood products between 1975 to March 1985, history of illicit drug use History of other STDs, multiple partners, homeless status, prisoners in jails, and so on Diagnostic Tests: CDC Fourth-Generation Testing ( Table 18.2 ) Step 1: Order HIV-1/HIV-2 antibodies and P24 antigen (combination assay) with reflexes. \"Reflex\" means that if positive, the lab will automatically perform the follow- up test to confirm the results. Step 2: If positive, the lab will perform the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation 432360 immunoassay (to confirm the result of the initial combination assay). Detects if infection is from HIV-1, HIV-2, or both viruses If test result is indeterminate, order an HIV RNA test. HIV RNA PCR Detects HIV-1 RNA (actual viral presence). Order to test infant if HIV(+) mother, or if the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation test is indeterminate. Can detect HIV infection as early as 7 to 28 days after exposure. Opt-out HIV screening: Notify patient that HIV testing will be performed. If patient declines HIV testing, known as \"opt-out HIV testing.\" Viral Load Number of HIV RNA copies in 1 mL of plasma. Test measures actively replicating HIV virus; progression of disease and response to antiretroviral treatment. The best sign of treatment success is an undetectable viral load (<50 copies/ L). If suspect acute or early HIV infection, order combination antigen/antibody immunoassay with viral load test. CD4 T-Cell Counts (norm 500-1,500 cells/mL) Used to stage HIV infection and to determine response to ART. If CD4 count goes up (with decrease in viral load), it means that patient is responding to ART (immune system improved). Values vary throughout the day. Check at the same time of the day using the same laboratory each time you remeasure CD4. Prophylaxis for Opportunistic Infections (Primary Prevention) Pneumocystis jirovecii known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or PCP). CD4 lymphocyte count cells/mm 3 . First line: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim DS) one tablet daily. If develops a severe reaction to sulfas, the next step is dapsone 100 mg daily or atovaquone suspension. Alternatives: Use dapsone, atovaquone, or aerosolized check patient for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) anemia due to risk of hemolysis (10% American males have G6PD). Toxoplasma gondii Infections (Protozoa) CD4 count is 3 . First line: Administer trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim DS) one tablet daily. Infection causes brain abscesses (headaches, blurred vision, confusion, imbalance, others). 433361 Avoid cleaning cat litter boxes and eating undercooked meats. Monitoring Viral Load: Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) or Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) Best response if HIV infection is treated with ART in early stage. ART will suppress HIV virus level and increase CD4 counts. Check every 1 to 2 months until viral load is undetectable, then every 3 to 4 months. Lab Monitoring With Medications Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: Check urinalysis every 6 months (nephrotoxic). Zidovudine (ZDV): Check CBC with differential (bone marrow suppression). Recommended Vaccines HIV and AIDS patients can receive inactivated vaccines such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, annual influenza vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, Td/Tdap every 10 years, HPV (up until age 26 years), others as needed. Vaccines work best if CD4 counts exceed 200 copies/mm 3 . HIV Education Do not handle cat litter or eat uncooked or undercooked meat (risk of toxoplasmosis). Avoid bird stool since it contains histoplasmosis spores. Turtles, snakes, and other amphibians may be infected with salmonella. Use gloves when cleaning animal cages or when handling stool. Table 18.2 HIV Tests Types of HIV Tests Rationale HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody with p24 antigen with reflexes Also known as the combination assay (fourth generation). Screening test to diagnose HIV infection. If positive, lab will perform HIV- 1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay to confirm initial test. ELISA Older screening test (antibody test). If positive, next step is Western blot test (done automatically by lab if positive for ELISA). Western blot Older confirmatory test. If positive, next step is HIV RNA PCR test. Rapid HIV testing kits or point-of-care tests Also used for screening. Result available in <30 minutes (antibody test). Can be done at home. If positive, follow-up with blood testing. HIV PCR Tests for HIV virus directly. Used for infants of HIV-positive mothers. Diagnoses acute HIV infection (window stage). Use if indeterminate result on antibody-antigen testing. CD4 T-cell counts (normally >500 cells/mm 3 ) Check before starting ART, staging HIV infection, disease progression, and treatment response. If on ART, check at same time as viral load. Viral load (antigen) Monitor treatment response. If on ART, monitor every 1-2 months until nondetectable, then every 3-4 months. ART, antiretroviral ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 434362 Preventing HIV Transmission Use condom every single time you have sex. Genital ulcers increase risk for HIV. Do not share needles or syringes if you inject drugs. Do not share any toothbrushes, razors, or other items that may have blood on them. For mothers with HIV infection, do not breastfeed your baby. Limit your number of sexual partners. Occupationally Acquired HIV Infection Of all health care occupations, nurses have the highest rate of occupationally acquired HIV/AIDS. At highest risk if trauma with large-bore hollow needles that contain contaminated material from patients with high viral loads such as retroviral syndrome, symptomatic patients, or AIDS. Preexposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) PrEP has been shown to reduce HIV transmission by more than 90%. Daily oral PrEP is recommended as a prevention option for sexually active individuals at substantial risk of HIV such as: Anyone with ongoing sexual relationship with an HIV-infected partner. Gay, heterosexual, bisexual, or transgender men who do not use condoms and engage in high-risk sexual behaviors. Do not confuse with postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Check for HIV infection before starting medications and check for HIV every 3 months thereafter. Postexposure Prophylaxis: Health Care Workers Exposure to infectious fluid with portal of entry (percutaneous, mucous membrane, nonintact skin). Infectious and can transmit HIV, HBV, and HCV. Note that saliva, vomitus, urine, feces, sweat, tears, and respiratory secretions do not transmit HIV (unless visibly bloody). Baseline labs: HIV (rapid HIV test and HIV antibody/antigen immunoassay), HCV RNA, HBsAg, HBV surface antibody, etc. The best time to start PEP is as soon as possible. If you think you have been exposed to HIV at work, during sex, sharing needles, or through sexual assault, go to your health provider or ED right away. About 72 hours postexposure is the outer limit of effective PEP. Do not wait for lab results before starting PEP unless it is available within 1 to 2 hours. A minimum of three antiretroviral drugs are used. EXAM TIPS PCP prophylaxis when CD4 is less than 200 copies/mL. 435If a patient on ART has a CD4 count that increases (from CD4 200 to 400 copies/mL), it means that their immune system is getting better. Bactrim DS PO is first line, used first; if allergic to sulfa, use dapsone 100 mg PO daily. Bactrim DS is used for both prophylaxis or treatment of PCP. HIV-infected pregnant women: Start AZT as soon as possible. Hairy leukoplakia of tongue, recurrent candidiasis, thrush: Rule out HIV infection. Acute retroviral syndrome or primary HIV infection: Influenza-like or similar to mononucleosis infection, very infectious at this stage of HIV infection. Best if HIV treated as early as possible. CLINICAL PEARLS It can take from 3 to 12 weeks for HIV antibody tests to detect HIV infection. The HIV antibody/antigen test can detect infection in 2 to 6 weeks (may be positive within 2 weeks after infection). NAAT can detect HIV infection in 7 to 28 days. For job-related exposures, contact National Clinician's Postexposure Prophylaxis Hotline (Pipeline) toll free at (888) 448-4911 for advice (open 24/7). OTHER STDs Condyloma Acuminata (Genital Warts) External genital warts appear as soft flesh-colored pedunculated, flat, or papular growths. Human papillomavirus (HPV) high-risk oncogenic types are 16 and 18. Can occur at any age. Cervical HPV infection is usually asymptomatic. Infected cervix can appear \"normal.\" HPV vaccine (e.g., Gardasil): Give at age 11 to 12 years (both girls and boys). Only two doses are needed (6-12 months apart) for adolescents aged 9 to 14 years. Another HPV vaccine, Cervarix (girls only), pulled out of the U.S. market in late 2016. HPV vaccine is also recommended for gay men. Genital sites: Warts may appear on the vagina, external genitals, urethra, anus. Other sites gel or cream (antimitotic drug). Contraindicated in pregnancy. Apply to external genital warts twice a day for 3 consecutive days (max 0.5 mL/d). Hold treatment for 4 days, then repeat this cycle up to four times. Imiquimod (Aldara) 5% or Zyclara modifier) drug that stimulates the local production of interferon and 436363 other cytokines. Contraindicated in pregnancy. Apply a thin layer three times/wk at bedtime for up to 16 weeks. Do not cover with dressing. Leave cream on skin for 6 to 10 hours. Wash off skin with soap and water after. Side effects: May cause irritation, ulceration/erosions, hypopigmentation. Sinecatechins 10% ointment (Veregne). Sinecatechins is a botanical, derived from green tea polyphenols, used for external anogenital warts (not for vagina or anus). Apply 0.5-cm-size strand of ointment on each wart with a finger (use gloves), up to three times/d for up to 16 weeks. Wash off skin before sexual contact or before inserting tampon in vagina. Can weaken condoms and diaphragms. Provider-applied methods: treatment methods include Corry laser, electrocautery, bichloracetic or trichloroacetic acid (caustic acids), surgical excision is done in the clinic. Herpes Simplex: HSV-1 and HSV-2 Asymptomatic shedding (intact skin) also occurs intermittently and patient is still contagious. HSV-1 : Usually oral infection, sometimes genital HSV-2 : Causes most cases of recurrent genital herpes, can be oral Classic Case May have prodrome (i.e., itching, burning, and tingling) on site. Sudden onset of groups of small vesicles sitting on an erythematous base. Easily ruptures and is painful. Vesicle fluid and crust are contagious. Primary episode is more severe and can last from 2 to 4 weeks. Recurrent breakouts. Treatment Plan Diagnostic test : Herpes viral culture or RPR assay for HSV-1 or varicella), giant cells. First Episode (Primary Genital Herpes) Acyclovir (Zovirax) 400 mg three times/d for 7 to 10 days (or 200 mg five times/d for 7-10 days) Famciclovir (Favier) 1 g BID for 7 to 10 days Valacyclovir (Valtrex) TID for 7 to 10 days Episodic Treatment (Flare-Up) Best if treatment started within 1 day of lesion onset Famciclovir (favor) 125 mg BID for 5 days 437364 Zovirax BID or TID \u00d7 5 days or Valtrex BID \u00d7 5 days Suppressive Treatment Acyclovir (Zovirax) 400 mg PO BID or famciclovir (Favier) 250 mg PO BID Evaluation For all cases of genital ulcers: Always rule out syphilis and HSV (genital herpes) infection EXAM TIPS Know first-episode for herpes (Zovirax five times/d or Valtrex three times/d or favor BID for 7 to 10 days). Know flare-up treatment (Zovirax or Valtrex or Favier BID \u00d7 5 days). Imiquimod is an immune-modulator treatment for genital warts and patient can use at home. Treatments contraindicated in pregnancy are podofilox, podophylla, imiquimod. For pregnant women, mechanical methods are used to destroy genital warts (curio, laser, excision, etc.). HPV strains 16 and 18 are oncogenic/carcinogenic (memorize). Tzanck smear multinucleated (varicella, herpes simplex). Genital herpes treatment duration 7 to 10 days for treating primary genital herpes infection. For breakouts, duration is 5 days. 438365 19 Adolescents Review DANGER SIGNALS Acetaminophen Poisoning (Intentional Ingestion) Acetaminophen damages the liver, resulting in mild to severe fulminant liver failure. Acetaminophen also known as paracetamol and sold as Tylenol and others. Stage 1 (up to 24 hours after overdose): Patients are usually asymptomatic but may have nausea and vomiting and, with very large doses, lethargy, and malaise. Stage II (24-72 hours after overdose): Patients complain of right upper quadrant pain and have high LFTs, PT, and INR, with possible nephrotoxicity (elevated BUN, creatinine) and/or pancreatitis (serum amylase and lipase elevated). Most deaths from liver failure occur within 72 to 96 hours. With acute overdose, serum acetaminophen concentration should be measured as soon as possible but at least 4 hours must have passed since ingestion to obtain accurate blood level (if less than 4 hours, blood level is not accurate). Antidote is N-acetylcysteine given intravenously. Testicular Torsion (Acute Scrotum) Pubertal male awakens with abrupt onset of unilateral testicular pain that increases in severity. Pain may radiate to the lower abdomen and/or groin. Almost all patients (90%) also have nausea and vomiting. Ischemic changes result in severe scrotal edema, redness, induration, and testicular pain. Ipsilateral (same-side) cremasteric reflex is absent. Highest incidence is during puberty. UA is negative for WBCs. Doppler ultrasound is the initial diagnostic test. Testicle is not functional after 24 hours if not repaired. Refer to ED. This is a surgical emergency. Testicular Cancer 439366 Teenage to adult male complains of a testicular or scrotal mass that may be tender to touch or asymptomatic. Some patients may have testicular discomfort, but not pain. The patient reports a sensation of heaviness in the affected testicle. The affected testicle has a firm texture. More common in males from the age of 15 to 35 years. Cryptorchidism is a strong risk factor. Hodgkin's Lymphoma Patient presents with enlarged and painless cervical, axillary, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy associated with fever (Pel-Ebstein sign) and night sweats. May report having severe pain on or over malignant areas a few minutes after drinking alcohol. The most common cancers in teens aged 15 to 19 years are Hodgkin's lymphoma (16%) and germ cell tumors (16%) such as testicular and ovarian cancer. NORMAL FINDINGS Adolescence Defined as the onset of puberty until sexual maturity. Most Common Cause of Death Accidents (i.e., motor vehicle crashes) Puberty The period in life when secondary sexual characteristics start to develop because of hormonal stimulation. Girls' ovaries start producing estrogen and progesterone. Boys' testes start producing testosterone. All of these changes result in reproductive capability. Girls Precocious puberty if puberty starts before age 8 years Delayed puberty if no breast development (Tanner stage II) by age 12 years Growth Spurt Majority of somatic changes occur between the ages of 10 and 13 years. Majority of skeletal growth occurs before menses. Afterward, growth slows down. Girls start their growth spurts 1 year earlier than boys. Growth Timeline Breast development peak growth acceleration menarche. Most of a girl's height is gained before menarche. Skeletal growth in girls is considered complete within 2 years after menarche. Mittelschmerz 440367 Unilateral midcycle pelvic pain that is caused by an enlarged ovarian follicle (or ruptured follicle). Pain may last a few hours to a few days. May occur intermittently. Menarche Average age is about 12 years (12.34 years) in the United States (range age 8-15 years) The first few months after the onset of menarche, it is common to have irregular periods because of irregular ovulation (may skip a month or longer intervals, lighter bleeding) After Tanner stage II starts (breast bud stage), girls start menses within 1 to 2 years Delayed puberty if no secondary sexual characteristics appear by age 12 to 13 years Menstrual Cycle Average duration is 28 days; in younger teens, cycles range from 21 to 45 days; in adults, they can range from 21 to 35 days Average duration of menstrual bleeding is about 3 to 5 days (range 2-7 days) Day 1 of the menstrual cycle starts as spotting, then blood flow becomes heavier for 2 to 3 days, and then bleeding lightens until it stops The most fertile period in the cycle is about 3 days before and during ovulation (days 11-14) Dysmenorrhea Painful periods due to severe menstrual cramps caused by high levels of prostaglandins Treatment is use of heating pads and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) Boys Precocious puberty if starts before age 9 years Delayed puberty if no testicular/scrotal growth by age 14 years Growth Spurt Boys' growth spurts are 1 year later than girls' (ages 11-15 years) Spermarche Average age is 13.3 years TANNER STAGES ( TABLE 19.1 ) Boys Stage I: Prepuberty Stage II: Testes begin to III: Penis elongates; Penis thickens and increases in size; testes are larger and scrotal skin darker Stage V: Adult pattern 441368 Girls Stage I: Prepuberty Stage II: Breast bud (onset of thelarche, or breast development) Stage III: Breast tissue and areola are in one mound Stage IV: Areola/nipples separate and form a secondary mound Stage V: Adult pattern Pubic Hair (Both Genders) Stage I: Prepuberty Stage II: Sparse growth of straight hair that is easily counted Stage III: Hair is darker and starts to curl Stage IV: Hair is curly but not on medial thigh yet as in adult; hair is coarser Stage V: Adult pattern; hair spreads to medial thigh and lower abdomen IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE FOR ADOLESCENTS The schedule in Table 19.2 is for patients who did not complete immunization or were not immunized as infants. Table 19.2 Immunization Schedule (Age 7-18 Years) Vaccine Immunizations Tdap (Boostrix, Adacel) All 11- or 12-year-olds: Give Tdap as booster, then Td every 10 years for lifetime. HPV (Gardasil) All 11- or 12-year-olds: Give to girls and boys. Minimum age (HPV vaccines): 9 years old All 11- or 12-year-olds: Give first shot. Needs two doses, from 6 to 12 months apart. From age 15 to 26 years needs three doses. Meningococcal (ACWY-D [Menactra], All at age 11-12 years, with booster at age 16 years. Catch-up: age 13-18 years, give Menactra or Menveo. If first dose at age 13- 15 years, needs booster at age 16-18 years. But if first dose at age 16 years, no booster dose is needed. Clinical discretion: Young adults 16-23 years may be vaccinated with either Bexsero or Trumenba. * Influenza inactivated Vaccinate everyone from age 6 months and older. Hepatitis B (Recombivax HB) Catch-up: Give the third dose if not completed. Hepatitis A (HAVRIX, VAQTA) Recommended for children with certain health or lifestyle conditions placing them at risk. MMR Catch-up: Give the second dose if not completed. Varicella If no reliable history of chickenpox (verbal OK). Live virus is contraindicated. * Recommendations as per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2017). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Recommended Immunization Schedule for Children and Adolescents Aged 18 Years or Younger, United States, 2017 HPV, human papillomavirus; Tdap, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Source: Adapted from CDC (2017). This table is a simplified version and is designed for studying for the certification exams only. Do not use this table as a guideline for clinical practice. EXAM TIPS Meningococcal vaccine is now required for all , starting at age 11 to 12 years (not only for college freshmen living in dormitories). Antidote of acetaminophen poisoning is IV N-acetylcysteine. Recognize presentation of testicular torsion and testicular cancer. Hodgkin's lymphoma presents as enlarged lymph nodes with fever, night sweats, and pain (lymph nodes) after drinking alcohol. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): Government program to report clinically adverse events. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends HPV vaccine for females until age 26 years; for males until age 21 years (except males who have sex with males); and for gay, bisexual, or males who have sex with males until age 26 years. LABORATORY TESTS Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Children and adolescents normally have higher blood levels compared to adults due to growing bone. It is produced by the osteoblasts. LEGAL ISSUES 443Right to Consent and Confidentiality No parental (or guardian) consent is necessary for the following: Contraception Treatment for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) Diagnosis and management of pregnancy Emancipated Minor Criteria These minors may give full consent as an adult without parental involvement: Legally married Active duty in the armed forces Confidentiality Confidentiality can be broken in the following situations: Gunshot wounds and stab wounds, which must be reported to the police (regardless of victim's age) Child abuse (actual or suspected abuse), which must be reported to the authorities Suicidal ideation and/or attempt (discharge to parents/guardians or hospital) Homicidal ideation or intent (especially mental health providers) \"Mature Minor Rule\" A mature minor is an unemancipated minor (from 15 to 17 years of age) with the mental capacity (and intelligence) to understand the consequences of a decision (such as refusing a surgical procedure or medical treatment). The mature minor has the right to refuse or to request treatment (even if the parents disagree with this decision). There are statutory and/or common laws at the state level. Each state has its own laws and statutes. Example A 17-year-old male who is scheduled for a procedure calls the nurse practitioner (NP) and tells her that he does not want to have the procedure. After the NP speaks with the patient and listens to his rationale (the patient understands the consequences), she decides to call the hospital's patient liaison/advocate (or ombudsman) to speak with the patient first (instead of calling the parents first). HEALTH PROMOTION During a physical examination or wellness visit, assess teenager for high-risk behaviors. Intensive behavior counseling is recommended. The following are high-risk behaviors to screen for: Sexual activity: Use of condoms, birth control, intimate partner violence (i.e., rape), signs/symptoms of STDs Safety: Driver safety, seatbelt/helmet use, smoking, alcohol and drug use Social history: Family, peers, school performance, work 444370 Signs/symptoms of depression and antisocial behaviors (i.e., gangs) EXAM TIPS Puberty starts at Tanner stage II in girls (breast bud) or boys (testicular enlargement and scrotal rugation/color starts to become darker). Puberty ends at Tanner stage V (adult stage). Tanner stage III in boys is elongation of the penis (testes continues to grow). Only Tanner stages II to IV need to be memorized for the exam. There is no need to memorize pubic hair changes for either gender. Memorize only the breast changes (girls) and the genital changes (boys). There will be one question about Tanner staging (girl or boy). Adolescent health history is obtained from both parent and child initially, then the adolescent is interviewed alone without the parent. Memorize the criteria for an emancipated minor. Do not confuse the right to confidentiality with emancipated minor status. Recognize presentation of testicular torsion. DISEASE REVIEW Primary and Secondary Amenorrhea Primary amenorrhea: No menarche by the age of 15 years (with or without development of secondary sexual characteristics). Half of cases are caused by chromosomal disorders (50%) such as Turner syndrome. Puberty is delayed if there is no breast development by age 13 years, absence of pubic hair at age 14 years, and no menarche by age 15 years. Secondary amenorrhea: No menses for three cycles, or 6 months if previously had menses. Most common cause is pregnancy. Others are ovarian disorders, stress, anorexia, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Secondary Amenorrhea Associated With Exercise and Underweight Excessive exercise and/or sports participation have a higher incidence of amenorrhea (and infertility) due to relative caloric deficiency \"Female athlete triad\"; anorexia nervosa/restrictive eating, amenorrhea, (FSH) and (LH; rule out premature ovarian failure) If amenorrhea for more than 6 months, measure bone density 445371 Treatment Plan Educate about increasing caloric intake and decreasing exercise Prescribe calcium with vitamin D 1,200 to 1,500 mg daily and vitamin E 400 IU daily Complications Osteopenia/osteoporosis (stress fractures) Myocardial hair), telogen effluvium (hair loss), xerosis (dry skin), infertility Low body mass index (BMI), cachexia, anemia, respiratory failure Anorexia Nervosa Usual onset is during adolescence. Involves an irrational preoccupation with and intense fear of gaining weight. Two types: Patient engages in restriction (dieting, excessive exercise) or binge eating and purging. Some examples of purging are excessive use of laxatives, enemas, diuretics, vomiting. Clinical Findings Marked weight loss (BMI 18.5), low pulse (40 beats/min), vital signs unstable, hypotension Lanugo (increased lanugo especially in the face, back, and shoulders) Stress fractures (osteopenia or osteoporosis from estrogen depletion and low calcium intake) Swollen feet (low albumin), dizziness, abdominal bloating EXAM TIPS Recognize how anorexic patients present (i.e., lanugo, peripheral edema, amenorrhea, significant weight loss >10% of body weight). Increased risk of osteoporosis or osteopenia. For birth control, avoid Depo Provera and other progesterone-only contraceptives because they can cause bone loss. Low albumin level results in peripheral edema. Gynecomastia ( Figure 19.1 ) Excessive growth of breast tissue in males. Can involve one or both breasts. Physiological gynecomastia is benign and is more common during infancy and adolescence. Normal in up to 40% of pubertal boys (peaks at age 14). Most cases resolve spontaneously within 6 months to 2 years. Classic Case Pubertal to adolescent male is brought in by a parent who is concerned about gradual onset 446372 of enlarged breasts or asymmetrical breast tissue (one may be larger). Child is embarrassed and scared about breast changes. Affected breast may be tender to palpation. Objective Findings Round, rubbery, and mobile mound (disk-like) under the areola of both breasts. Skin has no dimpling, redness, or changes. If mass is irregular, fixed, or hard or rapid growth in breast size, or suspect secondary cause, refer to specialist. Figure 19.1 Gynecomastia (male aged 14 years). Treatment Plan Evaluate for Tanner stage (check testicular size, pubic hair, axillary hair, body odor). Check for drug use: both illicit and prescription (i.e., steroids, cimetidine, antipsychotics). Rule out serious etiology (testicular or adrenal tumors, brain tumor, hypogonadism, etc.). Recheck patient in 6 months to monitor for changes. Pseudogynecomastia Bilateral enlarged breast is due to fatty tissue (adipose tissue). Common in obese boys and men. Both breasts feel soft to touch and are not tender. No breast bud or disk-like breast tissue is palpable. Labs None. Diagnosed by clinical presentation. Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis ( Figure 19.2 ) 447373 Screening Test: Adam's Forward Bend Test Lateral curvature of the spine that may be accompanied by spinal rotation. More common in girls (80% of patients). Painless and asymptomatic. Scoliosis will most likely worsen (66% of cases) if it starts in the beginning of the growth spurt. Rapid worsening of curvature is indicative of secondary cause (Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, cerebral palsy, myelomeningocele, etc.) Classic Case Pubertal to young teen complains that one hip, shoulder, breast, or scapula is higher than the other. No complaints of pain. Adam's Forward Bend Test (or Forward Bend Test) Bend forward with both arms hanging free. Look for asymmetry of spine, scapula, thoracic, and lumbar curvature. Check height. Measure the Cobb angle (degree of spinal curvature). Full-spine x-rays are used to measure degree of curvature. Scoliosis Treatment Parameters Curves less than 20 degrees: Observe and monitor for changes in spinal curvature Figure 19.2 Scoliosis (female aged 18 years). Curves of 20 to 40 degrees: Bracing (i.e., Milwaukee brace) Curves greater than 40 degrees: Surgical correction with Harrington rod used on spine and other options Management 448Check Tanner stage (Tanner stages II-V). Order spinal x-ray (PA view) to measure Cobb angle. CLINICAL PEARL Refer all patients with scoliosis to a pediatric orthopedic specialist. Osgood-Schlatter Disease A common cause of knee pain in young athletes. Caused by overuse of the knee. Repetitive stress on the patellar tendon by the quadriceps muscle causes pain, tenderness, and swelling at the tendon's insertion site (the tibial tuberosity). Usually affects one knee, but can be bilateral. Most common during rapid growth spurts in teenage males who are physically active and/or play sports that stress the patellar tendon (i.e., basketball, soccer, running). Condition abates when growth stops. Classic Case A 14-year-old male athlete undergoing a rapid growth spurt complains of a tender bony mass over the anterior tubercle of one knee. The pain is worsened by some activities (squatting, kneeling, jumping, and climbing up stairs). The knee pain improves with rest and avoidance of aggravating activity. Reports the presence of bony mass on the anterior tibial tubercle that is slightly tender. Almost all cases resolve spontaneously within a few weeks to months. Rule out avulsion fracture (tibial tubercle) if acute onset of pain posttrauma (order lateral x-ray of knee). Treatment Plan Follow RICE: Rest affected knee. Use ice pack three times/day for 10 to 15 minutes. Avoiding aggravating activities or sport will typically reduce or resolve pain. Adolescent may continue to play based on degree of pain after sports participation. Play does not necessarily worsen the condition. Use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs for pain as needed. Quadriceps strengthening and quadriceps/hamstring stretching exercises aimed at stabilizing the knee joint may also be beneficial. Klinefelter Syndrome A condition in which males are born with an extra X chromosome (i.e., 47, XXY). Condition occurs approximately in one in 1,000 live births. It is one of the causes of primary hypogonadism (deficiency in testosterone). Testicles are small and firm with small penis. Tall stature, wider hips, reduced facial and body hair, and higher risk of osteoporosis (compared with normal males). Treatment includes testosterone replacement and fertility treatment. Turner's Syndrome ( Figure 19.3 ) 449374 Females with complete or partial absence of the second sex chromosome (45, X). Occurs in approximately one in 2,500 live-born females. Congenital lymphedema of hands and feet, webbed neck, high-arched palate, and short fourth metacarpal. Short stature (height usually below 50% percentile). Ovarian failure, cardiovascular and renal issues, ear malformations, and other health problems, as well as amenorrhea due to premature ovarian failure (infertility).

EXAM TIPS Scoliosis treatment needed for a 10-degree curve (observe for worsening). Screening test for scoliosis is the Adam's forward bend test. For Klinefelter syndrome, understand how patient looks. Delayed Puberty Absence of secondary sexual characteristics by the age of 13 years for girls (such as a breast bud) or at the age of 14 years for boys. The child remains in Tanner stage I (prepubertal). Primary amenorrhea : Menarche has not occurred by age 15 years. Labs Serum pregnancy test Check prolactin level. If prolactin level is elevated, next step is to order a CT scan of the sella turcica (location of pituitary gland inside the skull). For primary amenorrhea (no menses by age 15 years), rule out hypogonadism by checking hormone levels (i.e., estrogen, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], of uterus/vagina, imperforate hymen. X-ray of the hand is used for estimating \"bone age\": When the long-bone epiphyses (growth plates) are fused, skeletal growth is finished. 450 Refer to pediatric endocrinologist if no growth spurt, delayed puberty, others. EXAM TIPS Know the Osgood-Schlatter presentation. Understand gynecomastia versus pseudogynecomastia (know the difference). No parental consent is needed for health services related to sexual activity (STD testing, pregnancy tests, birth control prescriptions). If not related to sexual activity, then need parental consent (dysmenorrhea, headache, upper respiratory infection [URI]). Know the emancipated minor definition. Know the presentation of anorexia nervosa (lanugo, low albumin causes pedal edema, etc.). 451375 376 Gerontology Review IV 452377 20 Theory and Conceptual Models Applied to Gerontology Theories of aging include those used to explain physical or biological, psychosocial, and developmental changes in the later years. These many theoretical perspectives overlap and offer a framework for promoting health and providing care to older adults. BIOLOGICAL THEORIES OF AGING Biological aging is referred to as senescence . Cells do not die; instead they lose their ability to reproduce, a process termed replicative senescence . Three potential pathways for improving the health and well-being of older adults involve telomeres and telomerase, epigenetics, and cells ( Table 20.1 Table Pathways of Description and telomerase Telomeres are repeated sequences found as \"caps\" at the end of each chromosome and are essential for cell repair ( Figure 20.1 ). As telomeres lose capacity for self-preservation, they shorten until the cell eventually dies. Epigenetics The environment (stress, diet, lifestyle, physical activity, social interactions) can affect genes and turn them \"on\" or \"off.\" The epigenome changes and reacts to signals from the environment. Stem cells Stem cells and regenerative medicine relate to the use of infinitely dividing stem cells that can become specialized (organs). These cells are placed strategically where they can reproduce and restore body parts and functions. 453378 Figure 20.1 Telomere located at each end of the chromosome. This image can be found in color in the app. Free Radical Theory Cellular errors are the result of random damage from free radicals (molecules that contain unpaired ions and an extra electrical charge). Free radical changes mostly affect mitochondrial DNA. In youth, natural vitamins, hormones, and antioxidants neutralize free radicals. With age, production of free radicals increases and the body's ability to remove them decreases. Adding antioxidants to the diet to counteract the negative effects of free radicals is not definitively supported by research evidence. However, this theory has received strong support, and much corroborating evidence has accumulated over the past four decades. Cross-Linkage Theory Aging is the result of accumulated damage from errors involving cross-linked proteins. Cross-linking of new proteins causes advanced glycation end-products, affecting collagen in the lungs, arteries, and tendons. An example is stiffened joints and dry, sagging, less elastic skin. Unsaturated fats and metal ions (e.g., aluminum, zinc, magnesium) may exacerbate cross-linking. Wear-and-Tear Theory Cellular errors result from \"wearing out\" over time because of continued use. Internal and external stressors (e.g., pollutants and free radicals) aggravate cells. Neuroendocrine Control or Pacemaker Theory Aging is the programmed decline in functioning of nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. It is not that cells die but that they lose their ability to reproduce. Certain hormones (e.g., dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] and melatonin), as well as growth factors, estrogen, and testosterone, have been used in studies to prolong longevity and boost immune system response. Immunity Theory Negative, age-related changes in our innate and adaptive immune systems are known 454379 collectively as immunosenescence ( Table 20.2 ). With age, there is an increase in autoimmune diseases and systemic inflammation. Inflammation is associated with heart disease, type 2 diabetes, frailty, arthritis, physical disability, and with other chronic conditions. Table 20.2 Aging and the Immune System Type of Immunity Definition Innate immunity Innate immunity (skin, mucous membranes, stomach acid) is the first line of defense against invading organisms. With age, innate immune cells lose their ability to communicate and fight off infections. Current research is aimed at understanding the causes of inflammation and how to best manage it in order to stave off chronic conditions. Adaptive immunity The adaptive immune system includes the thymus, spleen, tonsils, bone marrow, circulatory, and lymphatic systems. These organs work together to produce, store, and activate cells that respond to invading organisms and disease. Cell-mediated immunity (T-cells, phagocytes, cytokines) is affected more by aging compared with humoral immunity (antibody- mediated response, B-cells). In older adults, T-cells are less effective than B-cells. Caloric Restriction (CR) Theory CR involves the intake of at least 30% fewer calories than normal. It is not yet known whether CR can extend the life span of humans. However, prolonged CR has been shown to increase the life span in several species (e.g, yeast, flies, worms, mice, rats, fish). CR delays the onset of normal age-related decline. It is hypothesized to decrease oxidative damage to cells. Agents that can mimic the effects of CR are resveratrol (grapes, wine) and metformin. Biological Theories of Aging: Promoting Healthy Aging Advise patients to avoid pollutants in their environment such as industrial emission, UV light, and second-hand smoke. Suggest stress reduction as appropriate to maintain or improve immune function. Encourage healthy diets and judicious use of herbs and dietary supplements as indicated by current research evidence. Promote specific preventive strategies such as immunization against common infectious organisms. Further minimize potential for infection by encouraging handwashing and avoiding those who are ill. DEVELOPMENTAL THEORIES OF AGING Developmental theories presuppose that aging is an ongoing and stepwise progression from 455380 birth to death. Although viewed as accurate descriptions, these theories are not empirically valid. Erik Erikson's Stages of Psychosocial Development There are eight stages in this theory. The first five stages occur from birth to age 18 years. The last three stages occur after age 18. Intimacy Versus Isolation Early adulthood is the time to develop intimate relationships. Individuals in this stage may be married. Friendships and relationships are enjoyed. Failure : Social isolation and lack of emotional commitment indicate failure. Generativity Versus Stagnation The task of middle age is to hold a productive job; individuals in this stage may have a family. May become involved with social causes. Failure : An inability to hold down a job or a refusal to work, self-centered behavior, and not contributing to society indicate failure. Ego Integrity Versus Despair During this stage, ranging from older adult to frail elderly, the focus is on satisfaction with life accomplishments (i.e., career, family, children). The individual wants to leave a \"legacy\" to the future generation. For example, a grandmother may sew a quilt for each of her grandchildren and give them as gifts. Failure : Individuals with many regrets about life who are at high risk for depression (despair) are considered to have failed this stage of development. Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs There are five stages in the original model. Basic physiological needs must first be met before one can progress to the highest stage (self-actualization). A pyramid/triangle is often used to depict this model. The basic needs are listed on the bottom (base), and the highest stage is at the apex of the triangle ( Table 20.3 ). Table 20.3 Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Stage Examples Self-actualization (highest level) Pursues hobbies, creativity, and spiritual needs. Attends church groups, spiritual retreats. Volunteers, is involved with social issues. Engages in personal-growth activities. Self-esteem Doing well in one's job, feeling competent, confident, and respected by others; seeks fame. Love and belonging Focus is on relationships, friends, and family. Marriage/significant other and sexual intimacy are primary considerations. 456Safety needs Focus is basic needs of shelter and clothing and need for public laws to protect citizens from crime to promote order and stability as with the military and police. Physiological/biological needs (lowest level) Individual focuses on eating, breathing, elimination, sleep, physical activity, and sexual activity. Developmental Theories of Aging: Promoting Healthy Aging Ensure that the basic needs of older adults are met so that higher levels of wellness can be achieved. Work with older adults to create environments in which meaningful relationships and activities can remain a part of their lives. Encourage older adults to be self-sufficient as a means to further enhance their self- esteem and self-efficacy. Allow older adults to talk about their legacies, reminisce, and find satisfaction in the lives they lived. EXAM TIPS One of the best clues for identifying a stage in Erikson's model is to look at the age group. The older adult stage appears often (generativity vs. despair). Learn to recognize \"real-life\" examples. The last stage in Maslow's model is self-actualization (see examples in Table 20.3 ). Of the two exams, the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) exam is more likely to contain nonclinical content. 457381 21 Body and Metabolic Changes in the Older Adult Skin and Hair With aging, the skin atrophies; the epidermis and dermis thin and there is less subdermal fat and less collagen (less elasticity). Skin is fragile and slower to heal. Oil production is lower and skin drier (xerosis) due to decreased sebaceous and sweat gland activity. There is a decrease in the skin's sensory ability and reduction in vitamin D synthesis. Fewer melanocytes lead to graying of hair. Seborrheic Keratoses Soft wart-like skin lesions that appear \"pasted on.\" Mostly seen on the back and trunk. Benign. Senile Purpura Bright purple-colored patches with well-demarcated edges. Located on the dorsum of the forearms and hands. Lesions eventually resolve over several weeks. Benign. Lentigines Also known as \"liver spots.\" Tan- to brown-colored macules on the dorsum of the hands and forearms caused by sun damage. More common in light-skinned individuals. Benign. Stasis Dermatitis Statis dermatitis affects primarily the lower legs and ankles secondary to chronic edema (from peripheral vascular disease [PVD]) Senile Actinic Keratosis (Solar Keratosis) Condition is secondary to sun exposure and has the potential for malignancy. It has the potential to be a precancerous lesion of squamous cell carcinoma. 458382 Nails Growth slows and nails become brittle, yellow, and thicker. Longitudinal ridges develop. Eyes Presbyopia is caused by loss of elasticity of the lenses, which makes it difficult to focus on close objects. Close vision is markedly affected. Onset is during early to mid-40s. Can be remedied with \"reading glasses\" or bifocal lenses. Cornea is less sensitive to touch. Arcus senilis, cataracts, and glaucoma are more common. Arcus Senilis (Corneal Arcus) Opaque grayish-to-white ring at the periphery of the cornea. Develops gradually and is not associated with visual changes. Caused by deposition of cholesterol and fat. In patients younger than 40 years, can be a sign of elevated cholesterol. Check fasting lipid profile. Cataracts Cloudiness and opacity of the lens of the eye(s) or its envelope (posterior capsular cataract). There are three types (nuclear, cortical, and posterior capsular). Color of the lens is white to gray. Cataracts cause gradual onset of decreased night vision, sensitivity to glare of car lights (driving at night), and hazy vision. The red reflex disappears. Test: Red reflex (reflection is opaque gray versus orange-red glow) Macular Degeneration Loss of central visual fields results in loss of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. May find drusen bodies. Use Amsler grid to evaluate central-vision changes. Ears Presbycusis (Sensorineural Hearing Loss) High-frequency hearing is lost first (e.g., a speaking voice is an example of high-frequency). Presbycusis starts at about age 50 years. There are degenerative changes of the ossicles, fewer auditory neurons, and atrophy of the hair cells resulting in sensorineural hearing loss. Heart Elongation and tortuosity (twisting) of the arteries occurs. Thickened intimal layer of arteries and arteriosclerosis result in increased systolic BP due to increased vascular resistance (isolated systolic hypertension). The mitral and aortic valves and may contain calcium deposits. Baroreceptors are less sensitive to changes in position. There is decreased sensitivity of the autonomic nervous system. BP response is blunted. Maximum heart rate decreases. There is higher risk of orthostatic hypotension. S4 heart sound is a normal finding in the elderly if not associated with heart disease. The left ventricle hypertrophies with aging (up to 10% increase in thickness). 459383 Lungs Total lung capacity remains relatively the same as we age. Forced vital capacity (FVC) decreases with age. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) decreases with age. Residual volume (air left in the lungs at the end of expiration) increases with age due to decrease in lung and chest wall compliance. The chest wall becomes stiffer and the diaphragm is flatter and less efficient. Mucociliary clearance (fewer cilia) and coughing are less efficient. The airways collapse sooner during expiration. Responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia decreases. Decreased breath sounds and crackles are commonly found in the lung bases of elderly patients without presence of disease. Instruct the patient to \"cough\" several times to inflate the lung bases (the benign crackles will disappear). There is increased anterior-posterior (AP) diameter related to normal body changes. Liver Liver size and mass decreases due to atrophy (20%-40%). Liver blood flow and perfusion decrease (up to 50% in some elders). Fat (lipofuscin) deposition in the liver is more common. The liver function test result (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase) is not significantly changed. Metabolic clearance of drugs is slowed by 20% to 40% because the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system is less efficient. The LDL and cholesterol levels increase with aging. Renal System Renal size and mass decrease by 25% to 30%. The steepest decline in renal mass occurs after the age of 50. Starting at the age of 40 years, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) starts to decrease. By age 70, up to 30% of renal function is lost. Renal clearance of drugs is less efficient. The serum creatinine is a less reliable indicator of renal function in the elderly due to the decrease in muscle mass, creatine production, and creatinine clearance. Serum creatinine can be in the normal range, even if renal function is markedly reduced. The risk of kidney damage from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is much higher. The renin-angiotensin levels are lower in the elderly. Genitourinary System The amount of urine that remains in the bladder after urination is completed (residual urine) increases with age. Normally, the bladder holds approximately 300 to 400 mL. In postmenopausal women, the urethra becomes thinner and shortens and the ability of the urinary sphincter to close tightly decreases (due to declining estrogen). Urinary incontinence is two to three times more common in women. According to the Cleveland Clinic, erectile dysfunction affects 40% of men aged 40 years and 70% of men aged 70 years. Musculoskeletal System 460384 Older adults can lose a total of 1 to 3 inches (2.5-2.7 cm) in height; this loss becomes more rapid after age 70. Compression fractures of vertebrae are a sign of osteoporosis (kyphosis) and contribute to loss of height. Deterioration of articular cartilage is common after age of 40. Stiffness in the morning that improves with activity is a common symptom of osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease [DJD]). Fat mass increases but muscle mass and muscle strength markedly decrease, with more muscle loss in the legs compared with the arms. Bone resorption is more rapid than bone deposition in women compared with men (4:1). Fractures heal more slowly because of decrease in the number of osteoblasts. Gastrointestinal System Receding gums and dry mouth are common. Decreased sensitivity of the taste buds results in decrease in appetite. There is decreased efficiency in absorbing some vitamins (i.e., folic acid, vitamin B 12 ) and minerals (e.g., calcium) by the small intestines. Delayed gastric emptying occurs. Higher risk of gastritis and GI damage from decreased production of prostaglandins. Diverticuli are common. Large bowel (colon) transit time is slower. Constipation is more common. Increased risk of colon cancer (age >50 years is strongest risk factor). Fecal incontinence common due to drug side effects, underlying disease, neurogenic disorders, or a combination of these factors. Fecal impaction may lead to a small amount of runny soft stool. Laxative abuse is more common. Endocrine System Minor atrophy of the pancreas occurs. Increased levels of insulin are seen along with mild peripheral insulin resistance. Changes or disorders of the circadian rhythm hormonal secretion (growth hormone, melatonin, and other hormones) can cause changes in sleep patterns. Sex Hormones Testes are active for the entire life cycle. Less dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and testosterone are produced. Estrogen and progesterone production decrease significantly in women due to ovarian failure (menopause). Higher serum testosterone concentration in some postmenopausal women may cause frontal balding on the head and excess hair growth on the mustache area and/or on the chin. Adipose tissue is able to synthesize very small amounts of estrogen. In the United States, up to 53% of those aged 65 to 74 years are sexually active (Stewart & Graham, 2013). Immune System Older adults are less likely to present with fever during infections. Typical body temperature is slightly lower. There is a decreased antibody response to vaccines. Immune system is less active and there is higher risk of infection. 461385 Cellular immunity is affected more by aging than humoral immunity. Cellular or cell- mediated immunity involves the activity of T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and the cytokines. Humoral immunity is associated with B-lymphocytes and antibody (immunoglobulins or IgG) production. Hematological System There are no changes in the RBC life span, the blood volume, or the total number of circulating leukocytes. There is a higher risk of thrombi and emboli due to increased platelet responsiveness. Increased risk of iron and folate-deficiency anemia due to decreased efficiency of the GI tract to absorb vitamin B 12 and folate. Neurological System Cranial nerve testing may show differences in ability to differentiate color, papillary response, and decreased corneal reflex. Gag reflex decreases. Deep tendon reflexes may be brisk or absent. Neurological testing may be impaired by medications, causing slower reaction times. Benign essential tremor is more common. Pharmacological Issues Drug clearance is affected by renal impairment, less efficient liver CYP450 enzyme system, slow gastric emptying, increased gastric pH, decreased serum albumin, and relatively higher ratio of fat:muscle tissue (extends fat-soluble drugs). Older adults have an increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines and anticholinergic drugs such as hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), antihistamines, and antipsychotics. The American Geriatrics Society has made a list of inappropriate medications for the elderly (Beers criteria; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearinghouse, & American Geriatrics Society, 2015). EXAM TIPS Seborrheic keratosis (benign) appears as a wart-like growth that look pasted on; found mostly on the back, color can range from tan, brown, to black. Presbycusis is a sensorineural type of hearing loss (inner ear). Hearing loss initially occurs in the high frequency range. Arcus senilis (corneal arcus) is a white or grey ring in the margin of the cornea or on the periphery of the iris (cholesterol deposits). S4 in elderly is not associated with heart disease symptoms and is considered normal. FEV1 and FVC decrease with age, but residual volume increases. Actinic keratosis is a precursor of squamous cell cancer. Memory tip: the letter \"C\" in actinic is a reminder for cancer. Do not confuse this with seborrheic keratosis, which is benign (common 462386 mistake). Most common cause of blindness in the United States is macular degeneration. In developing countries, cataracts are the most common cause of blindness. Cataracts increase sensitivity to glare of car lights (driving at night). Red reflex test on cataracts appear as grayish-to-white reflection (mature cataracts appear white). Cellular immunity is affected more by age than humoral immunity. Anticholinergic drugs cause constipation, urinary retention (especially men with BPH), blurred vision, dry mouth, and orthostatic hypotension. 463387 22 Health Screening and Health and Safety Promotion MINIMUM DATA SET 3.0 The goal of the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 is to \"increase the clinical relevance of items, improve the accuracy and validity of the tool, ... and increase the resident's voice by introducing more resident interview items\" (pp. 1-11). MDS is a mandatory state and federal requirement for all Medicare/Medicaid certified long-term care facilities (LTCFs). The MDS is a standardized primary screening and assessment tool of health status that forms the foundation of the comprehensive assessment for all residents in a Medicare and/or Medicaid-certified long-term facility, skilled nursing facility, and swing beds. Swing beds are hospital beds that can be used to provide either acute or SNF care. The MDS is one of the three components of the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI). The other two components include the Care Area Assessment (CAA) Process and the RAI Utilization Guidelines. The completed RAI yields information about the resident's functional status, strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. The MDS contains information about a nursing home patient's physical, mental, psychosocial, and functional status. The MDS was developed as a response to the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA). The latest version is the MDS 3.0, which was released in October 2010. The MDS manual defines a \"physician\" as an MD, doctor of osteopathy (DO), nurse practitioner (NP), physician assistant (PA), or clinical nurse specialist (CNS). The MDS forms must be started within 48 hours after a new resident's admission. MDS assessments are required on admission, quarterly, annually, at the time of any significant change or correction, and at discharge. The MDS data set results must be submitted electronically to Medicare or Medicaid through a secure broadband connection. 464388 All Medicare and Medicaid bills must be submitted electronically through a secure broadband connection. RESIDENT ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT (RAI) ITEMS Diagnosis and health/medical history : RNs perform intake and comprehensive history. Medications (including over-the-counter [OTCs] drugs): Obtain record/history of current prescriptions. RN will obtain admitting orders and the necessary prescriptions (patient's medications) from the attending \"physician.\" Brown bag review for polypharmacy (including herbs, alternative therapies): Ask patient or family to bring all of the resident's medications, vitamins, and other alternative medicines in a \"brown bag.\" Cognition: Use Mini-Cog, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), clock-drawing test. Look for signs of dementia, history of depression, bipolar disorder, and stroke. Behaviors: Use behavioral assessment tool. Assess whether combative, confused, demented, or if experiencing sundown phenomenon. Check for a history of wandering (aimless walking, leaving facility without permission). Communication: Is patient able to communicate, confused, aphasic, is there history of stroke? Hearing, speech, and vision: Check hearing, vision, prescription glasses, use of hearing aid, or peripheral neuropathy. Perform neurologic exam. Oral/nutritional evaluation (dietician and nurse): Check for missing teeth, dentures, oral ulcers from poor-fitting dentures, anorexia, dysphagia, weight loss, body mass index (BMI). Can the patient swallow solids or does food need to be pureed? Does he or she have the ability to feed self, is there need for specialized equipment? See \"Nutritional Assessment\" section. Activities: Interview patient and/or family about routine and favorite activities. Preferences for customary routine and activities: Obtain information regarding the resident's preferences for his or her daily routine. Advance directives: If patient has an advance directive obtain a copy (check about do not resuscitate (DNR) orders). If resident has dementia, ask patient's family whether one is on file. Elimination of bowel or bladder: Gather information about urinary and bowel continence, bowel patterns, and the use and response to bowel training/toileting programs. Skin conditions: Document the risk, presence, appearance, and change of pressure injuries, wounds/lesions, treatment related to skin injury or avoiding injury. Special treatments, procedures, or programs: Identify any special treatments, procedures, and programs that the resident received during specified time periods. Participation in goal setting: Record the participation of the resident, family, and/or significant others in the assessment, so as to understand the resident's overall goals. Restraints: Record frequency that the resident is restrained by any type of device at any time during the day and night. 465389 FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT Activities of Daily Living (ADL) ADL are self-care activities that are necessary for \"independent\" living depending on the person's environment (i.e., home, retirement community, assisted-living facility [ALF], nursing home). Examples Eating (self-feeding, preparing meals, grocery shopping) Personal hygiene (brushing teeth, bathing, dressing, grooming) Ambulation (walking, canes, wheelchairs) Bowel and bladder management Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) IADL are associated with the use of \"instruments\" or finance. Examples Shopping (groceries, clothing) Housework (vacuuming, sweeping) Using electronics (stoves, microwaves, telephones, television) Driving a car Katz Index of Independence in ADL A measure used to assess an older adult's independence. Contains six items. Each item is scored a \"1\" or \"0.\" The highest possible score is 6 points (independent) and the lowest is 0 points (patient very dependent). Independence (1 point): Ability to perform tasks with no supervision, direction, or personal assistance. Dependence (0 point): Needs supervision, direction, personal assistance, or total care. Activities Independence is defined as: Bathing : Able to bathe self completely or needs help in bathing only one body part (e.g., back, genitals) Dressing : Can get clothes from closet/drawer and put on clothes without help (except tying shoelaces) Toileting : Able to get on/off toilet, including pants/underwear, cleans genital area without help Transferring : Able to move in/out of bed or chair unassisted; mechanical transfer aids acceptable Continence : Has complete control (urination and defecation) Feeding : Can get food from plate into mouth; able to feed self (okay if another person prepares food) 466390 Falls Fall injuries include head injuries, pelvic injuries, lacerations, and others. About 90% of hip fractures are due to falls. White women are at highest risk for hip fractures compared with African Americans. Elderly are at higher risk for death from a fall. The majority of deaths (82%) from falls were in people aged 65 years or older. High risk of fall : History of two or more falls in preceding 12 months, difficulty walking or balancing Risk Factors Frailness and older age (more common after age 75 years); may have postural hypotension Adverse or side effects from certain medications; polypharmacy (four or more drugs) Dementia and cognitive impairment, neurologic deficits, chronic illness Poor eyesight, decreased hearing, decrease in night vision, balance problems Use of area rugs, poor fit of shoes/slippers, poor lighting Lives alone, history of previous falls Urinary tract infections (UTIs) Fall Assessment Assess for risk of falls (history of falls, gait and balance problems, vision problems, hypotension, postural hypotension, arrhythmias, osteoporosis, sedating medications, anticholinergic burden, beta-blockers Gait, balance, and mobility assessment (refer to physical therapy [PT] if necessary for in-depth assessment) Muscle strength (check handgrip strength, ability to support weight, transfer from chair to bed) Visual acuity: Check whether patient has glasses, cataracts, history of glaucoma Heart rate and rhythm: Arrythymias, obtain a 12-lead EKG, (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI) Postural hypotension : Check whether on medications that cause hypotension (antihypertensives) Feet and footwear: Assess feet, bunions, and foot pain. Check if patient is a diabetic. Elderly usually need wider shoes/slippers. Slip-on shoes with velcro straps are easier to use. Check if shoes are skid-resistant. Area rugs, uneven floors, low light, loose flooring Factors That Decrease Fall Risk Ensure proper lighting, especially in bathrooms and hallways. Use nightlights in bedroom, bathroom, and hallways. Make sure bedside lamp is within easy reach. Place grab bars by the toilet and by the tub/shower; raise level of toilet seat. Engage in regular weight-bearing exercises, leg strengthening exercises, gait training PRN. Tai chi programs have been found to promote balance and muscle strength. Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and an annual eye exam. Take all medications and vitamins in a \"brown bag\" to health provider to check. 467391 Have PT or occupational therapy (OT) for gait training. May need adaptive devices\u2014refer to PT or OT for further evaluation. Ensure that patient's food and fluid intake are adequate. Malnutrition markedly affects strength. Wear shoes that fit well (Velcro fasteners easier) with nonskid soles. Remove home hazards (electrical cords, boxes) that are in walking areas. Secure loose rugs with slip-resistant backing, tacks, double-faced tape. Discourage use of small area rugs in high-traffic areas. Adaptive Equipment Bathing and Toilet Safety Use elevated toilet seats, especially after hip fracture and hip replacement. Grab bars: Place on the bathroom wall(s) and on the side of the tub. Shower chairs: Needed for patients who cannot stand/walk or are too weak. Avoid area rugs. If patient wants a rug, avoid thick rugs. Choose a thin rug with rubber backing (nonslip). Walking Refer patient to PT for evaluation of gait and recommendations for adaptive equipment. PT will teach patients how to use a cane, walker, or other equipment. Other Equipment Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare (health insurance of U.S. Armed Forces), and most insurance health plans will pay up to 80% for some medically necessary durable medical equipment. Canes Check weight limits of the cane if the patient is obese. There are several types: regular, foldable, quad foot, etc. Instruct patient or medical assistant to periodically check the bottom of the cane to see whether rubber foot is thinning or is missing. To find the proper length, tell patient to let his or her arms fall on the side in a relaxed manner (elbow slightly bent). Measure from the wrist to the floor. Replace cane as needed. Walkers There are several types: foldable or nonfoldable, with or without casters. Some patients like to have bags/baskets attached to the front of the walker. If gait is unsteady or patient is falling, refer to PT for evaluation and recommendations. Wheelchairs There are many styles and uses; sized for adult and children. There are now wheelchairs designed for the obese. Scooters (electric wheelchairs) Scooters are expensive ($1,000 and up). They contain a motor in specialized chair with handlebars and brakes. Most can take up to 300 lbs of weight. Popular with very obese patients and patients with spinal cord injuries. 468392 How to Walk Safely Using a Cane Hold the cane using the normal arm. Take a step with the \"weaker\" leg and bring cane forward at the same time. Try to move the weaker leg and the cane together. Then step forward with the normal leg. When climbing stairs, lift the good leg first, then lift the weaker leg to the stair. Remember: \"Up with the good, down with the bad.\" Vision Blindness Legal blindness is defined as the best corrected visual field of 20/200 (or less) in the better eye. The ophthalmic nerve (retina) is cranial nerve II (CN II). The most common cause of legal blindness in persons aged 65 years or older in the United States is age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Other eye conditions that are more common in the elderly are giant cell arteritis, acute-closure glaucoma, and several types of hemianopsia associated with certain types of cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) or stroke. Vision Loss: Signs Prefers to use one eye (\"dominant\" eye) or squints Tilts head slightly or moves head to side when reading street signs Problems reading (near vision) After a stroke, may not eat/touch foods on the blind side (i.e., homonymous hemianopsia) Assess Medications: Adverse Effects on Vision Digoxin: Yellow to greenish color to vision Sildenafil (Viagra): Bluish tinge to vision, electronic magnifiers Computer magnifiers: Digital magnification of text and objects (special software or apps) Talking watches or alarm clocks Large-print watches, books, or telephones with large keys Vision training such as scanning training (compensates for missing visual field) Hearing Involves the brain, CN VIII, inner ear, middle ear, and external ear canal. Sensorineural Involves the inner ear (cochlear hair cells and vestibulocochlear nerve). Presbycusis (or age- 469related hearing loss) is a type of sensorineural hearing loss. It is the most common cause of hearing loss in the world. Look for gradual onset of progressive loss that is symmetric (both ears). If hearing loss occurs only in one ear, it is not due to presbycusis. High-frequency hearing loss occurs first (e.g., difficulty hearing human speech). Symptoms of Hearing Loss Family or friends complain that patient sets the volume of TV or radio \"too loud\" Problems hearing or understanding speech in noisy areas (e.g., restaurant) Complains of problems understanding or hearing conversation May look puzzled or asks person to repeat a question several times Difficulty hearing conversation during telephone calls Complains of tinnitus Assess Medications: Ototoxic Medications Aminoglycosides (gentamycin, vancomycin) Aspirin/salicylic acid High chronic doses of furosemide Chemotherapeutic drugs Hearing Evaluation Examine external ear and tympanic membrane. Remove cerumen if unable to view tympanic membrane (TM). Look at TM landmarks such as the \"cone of light,\" retraction, bulging of TM, erythema. Higher Risk of Hearing Loss History of chronic tinnitus Older age Ototoxic medications Chronic exposure to loud noises Comorbid conditions such as diabetes Gold Standard Diagnostic test is audiometry using soundproof booth performed by a professional audiologist. Screening Tests Weber Test Normal : Sound is heard in both ears. If sound heard only in one ear, abnormal (lateralization). Example : With ceruminosis, the sound will lateralize to the \"bad\" ear (patient will hear \"louder\" sound in the affected ear). Rinne Test Normal : Air conduction (AC) is greater than bone conduction (BC). Example : If BC greater than AC, rule out conductive hearing loss. Weber test will also show lateralization (sound louder on \"bad\" ear). 470393 Whisper Test Stand about 2 feet behind patient. Occlude one ear (press tragus toward ear). Whisper the alphabet or count numbers. Another option is to rub the patient's hair together in front of each ear. Tympanogram If fluid/pus inside middle ear (otitis media) or cerumen is present, the TM will have little to no mobility. The result will be abnormal (flat line, small peak, to no peak on printout result). NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) MyPlate System The USDA Food Pyramid has been replaced with the \"MyPlate\" system ( www.chooseMyPlate.gov ; Figure 22.1 ). Figure 22.1 USDA MyPlate System. Source: United States Department of Agriculture. Retrieved from https://www.choosemyplate.gov Recommendations Educate patients about the MyPlate system (free handouts at website). Drink eight glasses of water per day (if not contraindicated or in heart failure). Exercise at least 150 minutes per week (30 minutes/five times per week) if not contraindicated. For protein, consider eating seafood twice a week. Cold-water fish (salmon, sardines) are preferred because they contain omega-3 oils (vegan source is flaxseed oil). Reduce intake of solid fats and added sugars (SoFAS) because studies show that they 471394 comprise up to 35% of daily total caloric intake. Solid fats come from animal fats and lard (some fried foods, baked goods). Added sugars include corn syrup, sucrose (table sugar), fructose, and brown sugar. Calorie-free forms of (xylitol, mannitol), saccharin, aspartame, sucralose (Splenda), stevia, and amounts of sugar alcohols may cause bloating and flatulence. Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables that are of different colors (red, yellow, orange, green). Reduce sodium intake (table salt, prepared and pickled foods, chips, pickles). Limit sodium intake to less than 3 g/d ( Table 22.1 ). Table 22.1 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (Adapted for Age 50 or Older) Type of Food Servings Per Day Foods Vegetables 2-3\u00bd cups Leafy greens, cabbages, carrots, red peppers, etc. 1 cup cut-up vegetables = 2 cups of uncooked leafy vegetables Eat many different colors of vegetables and fruit Fruits 1\u00bd-2\u00bd cups Apples, prunes, plums, oranges, bananas, berries, dried fruits Grains 5-10 ounces Whole grains preferred; if celiac disease, use rice\u2014avoid wheat, rye, barley; kamut is a type of wheat (avoid with celiac disease) Proteins 5-7 ounces Chicken, fish, beef, lamb, others Vegetarian: 1 egg, \u00bc cup cooked beans or tofu, 1 tbsp. peanut butter, \u00bd ounce nuts/seeds Dairy 3 cups of low-fat milk 1 cup milk equals as much calcium as 1 cup yogurt Seafood Twice a week Sardines, small fish, salmon preferred 1 cup = 2 ounces cheese Oils 5-8 teaspoons Olive oil, canola oil, flax seed oil, nuts, avocado SoFAS Limit intake Lard, animal fats SoFAS, solid fats and added sugars. Source: Adapted from the National Institute of Aging (2016). Caloric Requirements Per Day in People Older Than 50 In general, women usually need fewer calories than men. Women: Not physically active (1,600 calories), somewhat active (1,800 calories), and active (2,000 to 2,200 calories) Men: Not physically active (2,000 calories), somewhat active (2,200 to 2,400 calories), and active (2,400 to 2,800 calories) Nutritional Issues in Older Adults 472395 Nutritional issues are common in older adults, especially in the frail elderly or the \"old- old.\" Perform a comprehensive dietary history, health history, and anthropomorphic measurements. Clinically significant weight loss is defined by the MDS criteria as weight loss of 5% of usual body weight (in 30 days) or weight loss equal to at least 10% of the usual body weight (in 6 months). Weight loss involves loss of muscle mass and body fat. A patient with edema and fluid retention may have \"normal weight\" even if he or she is malnourished. History Check past medical and health history such as celiac disease, colitis, diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and others. Check patient's preferred foods, appetite patterns, snacking, and fluid intake. Check for unintentional weight loss. Risk Factors of Malnutrition Decreased taste sensation Poor dentition (check for poor-fitting dentures, oral ulcers) Adverse effects of medications Depression and feelings of loneliness and isolation Dementia Nutritional Screening Tools Body fat and lean muscle mass estimation using bioelectrical impedance Measurement of upper arm circumference Food diary or estimated dietary intake (dementia), types of foods preferred, snacking There are several screening tools for malnutrition; refer patient to dietician Questionnaires Mini-Nutrition Assessment-Short Form Contains six questions; a global assessment that includes anthropomorphic measurements Simplified Nutrition Assessment Questionnaire Contains four items; has a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 84% Unintentional Weight Loss and Failure to Thrive in Elders Defined as unintentional weight loss of greater than 5% in the past 30 days or greater than 10% over the past 180 days (6 months). Assess dental health, gum disease, missing teeth, use of dentures, and oral ulcers. Rule out mental health issues such as major depression, anemia, and hypothyroidism. Laboratory Testing Prealbumin : Hepatic protein that is a sensitive test for malnutrition (not the same as albumin). High-risk patients can have the test done as often as once to twice a week. Albumin : Decreased levels are associated with higher mortality. CBC : Check for anemia (iron-deficiency anemia is most common anemia). Folate and vitamin B 12 levels : Assess for deficiency and macrocytic anemia. 473396 Vitamin D level : Many elderly are low in vitamin D and may need supplementation. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level: To rule out thyroid disease. Hypothyroidism is more common in elderly (especially females). Anthropomorphic Measurements Weight and Height for BMI Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) : Women whose WHR is greater than 0.8 are at increased risk and men with WHR greater than 1.0 are at increased risk (abdominal obesity) of heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. BMI : obese: BMI 40 or higher (National Institutes of Health, 2012) BMI between 25 and 27 has been found to result in less mortality in elderly than a BMI less than 25 Handgrip Strength An indicator of functional status. Weak handgrip is present with malnutrition. Patients with severe malnutrition have very weak handgrips. Nutrition Interventions for Community-Dwelling Older Adults Assess whether assistance is needed with grocery shopping, food preparation, and/or feeding self. Depression is common in older adults. Assess for major depression. People can enroll for food assistance (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP; formerly known as \"food stamps\"]) and Medicaid if eligible. Meals on Wheels programs deliver meals to eligible people two to three times per day. Nutrition Interventions for Long-Term Care Residents Correct the factors that are adversely affecting oral food intake if possible. Refer to dietician for evaluation and dietary recommendations. Dietician can calculate basal energy and caloric requirements and dietary requirements. Offer nutritional supplements and drinks. Encourage resident to eat high-calorie foods. Consider multivitamin supplementation or calcium with vitamin D 1,200 mg/d. Find out prescription and OTC medications (including herbal supplements) the resident is taking. Some medications cause anorexia. Anticholinergics cause voiding difficulties (benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH])and cognitive decline. Encourage resident to eat in the dining room with others (avoids isolation). Assess for depression and grieving. If depressed, consider prescribing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that increases appetite such as mirtazapine (Remeron). Remeron causes the most weight gain compared with other SSRIs. Check whether wearing dentures during meal times. Give the resident food choices and snacks. Ask about favorite foods and make them 474397 available for meals and/or snacks. Check fluid intake. Water is best. Drink most of it in the daytime to early evening because it can cause frequent voiding at night if taken too close to bedtime. Appetite Stimulants Not a first-line approach because of side effects. Some malnourished and underweight residents with anorexia who do not respond to usual measures can be given a trial of appetite stimulant. Megestrol acetate (Megace) : Synthetic progesterone-type drug that may cause weight gain in residents with anorexia (elderly, cancer-related). But has serious side effects and may not be that effective. Covered by Medicare Part D. Side effects : Water retention may exacerbate or cause heart failure, increase risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Monitor residents for edema and edema, bibasilar rales). Mirtazapine (Remeron) : SSRI that weight gain compared with other SSRIs. Specialized Diets Clear Liquids or Full Liquid Diets Use for only 2 to 3 days (if without supplementation). Mechanical Soft (Pureed) Diet Indicated for residents who have problems chewing or swallowing Soft Diet Indicated for residents who have problems with chewing and swallowing, GI irritation Foods: Milk (all types), Carnation Instant Breakfast, cream cheese, soft lean meats Avoid seeds, nuts, dried fruits, fried fish, hot dogs, and crunchy foods Low Residue (Low-Fiber Diet) Indicated for certain residents with GI disorders, after bowel surgery, or if GI tract irritated (diverticulitis) Foods: White rice, white pasta, soups, fruits and vegetables with low pulp or canned, eggs Avoid whole-wheat bread, whole-grain foods, dried fruits, popcorn, seeds, and nuts Renal Diet Indicated for chronic kidney disease, acute renal failure. Fluids are limited. Keep track of fluids (include Jello, popsicles, etc.). Low-protein diet may be recommended. Consult with renal dietitian. Limit foods high in potassium (avoid salt substitutes, citrus juices, potatoes, avocado, spinach, banana, apricots, sports drinks). Limit foods high in phosphorus (dairy, meat, cheese, fast foods, cola, canned fish). Limit total sodium intake to 400 mg per meal and 150 mg per snack. Hepatic Diet 475398 Indicated for liver disease, cirrhosis. Restrict protein intake (reduces ammonia blood levels). The liver is unable to make enough glycogen. Foods: Hepatic diet is high in carbohydrates (breads, grains, starchy foods), encourages moderate fat intake, and is low in protein. Vitamin supplementation (B-complex vitamins) needed. Avoid too many meats, seafoods, or too much salt. Avoid organ meats. Enteral Feeding Elderly patients with terminal dementia or failure to thrive who refuse to eat or are unable to chew and swallow adequately may become malnourished. If the patient has an intact and functioning GI tract, then tube feedings are an alternative. Initial options are either the orogastric tube or the nasogastric tube. Check for placement after first insertion by ordering a plain chest radiograph (chest x-ray). Should be checked for placement before each feeding by aspirating for stomach contents. Nasogastric tube placement complications include pneumothorax, perforations, empyema, bronchopleural fistula, and aspiration pneumonia. Nutrition Terms Anorexia : Loss of appetite that has many causes such as dementia, drug side effect, changes in taste and smell, and major depression. Cachexia : Multifactorial metabolic disorder that is associated with an illness or disease. Associated with increased risk of falls and morbidity. Check serum albumin (low). Sarcopenia : This is a loss of muscle mass, strength, and performance. Multiple causes such as low hormone levels (testosterone and estrogen), immobility, low levels of physical activity, low protein intake, and others. Individuals have higher risk of falls, hip fracture, functional decline, and morbidity. Satiety : Subjective feeling of \"fullness\" that follows a meal. If a patient complains of early satiety or dysphagia (especially if accompanied with weight loss), it is a worrisome finding. Rule out cancers of the colon or esophagus. Refer to GI specialist for colonoscopy. DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE Regular, balanced, and moderate exercise programs (average of 2.6 years) reduced the risk of major disability by 18% in the elderly. Medicare spending is highest for those with four or more chronic conditions. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Leading health indicators for older adults: EnhanceFitness Program (1-hour classes three times/week in 5-week sessions) 476399 Strength training (wrist and ankle weights), aerobics, stretching, and balance exercises Arthritis Foundation Exercise Program, National Institute on Aging Exercise Guide Eating more than five servings of fruits and vegetables daily Obesity Current smoker Hip fracture hospitalizations Disability Influenza vaccine in past year Mammogram within past 2 years Cholesterol check within past 5 years Table 22.2 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Clinical Preventive Services for Older Adults Topic USPSTF Recommendation Abdominal aorta aneurysm screening (men only) Ultrasound for men aged 65-75 years who have ever smoked (one-time screen only) Aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease Men Men aged 45-79 years if potential benefit (reduction of myocardial infarctions) outweighs the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding Women Women aged 55-79 years if potential benefit (reduction of ischemic strokes) outweighs the risk of GI bleeding Breast cancer screening Baseline at age 50 years, then every 2 years (biennial) until age 74 BRCA risk assessment Screen women for family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer with screening tools or if family history of BRCA1 or BRCA2 , refer for genetic counseling/testing. Colorectal cancer screening Start at age 50 years with baseline colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or high-sensitivity fecal occult blood test (FOBT).

Vitamin D supplementation recommended Source: Adapted from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2017). IMMUNIZATIONS ( TABLE 22.3 ) Influenza Vaccine Start giving the influenza injection at the end of October of each year (fall to winter season). It takes 2 weeks after the shot for a person to develop antibodies. As long as influenza viruses circulate, vaccination should continue to be offered, even in January or later. Most seasons, influenza activity peaks in January or later (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2017). Health care personnel (HCP) who work with patients older than 50 years should be vaccinated. Beginning in the 2016-2017 season, FluMist intranasal vaccine (live attenuated influenza virus [LAIV]) should not be used due to low effectiveness. FluMist intranasal vaccine only for healthy persons aged 2 to 49 years. If an egg allergy in person who experienced only hives, influenza vaccine is fine. If a severe egg allergy (angioedema, respiratory distress, etc.) or person who required epinephrine, influenza vaccine can be given by health care provider who can respond to an allergic response with proper equipment (e.g., epinephrine, oxygen, intubation). If a severe life-threatening allergic reaction to influenza vaccine or its components, then vaccine is contraindicated (lifetime). See the CDC website for updates ( www.cdc.gov (PCV 13) is recommended for adults age 65 years or older. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends giving Prevnar initially; then after more than 1 year, give Pneumovax. The two vaccines should not be coadministered. If patient already had the Pneumovax, wait at least 1 year before giving Prevnar. Prevnar is also recommended for infants, children, and adults aged 2 to 64 years with certain health conditions. If patient received PPSV23 (Pneumovax) before age 65 years, give booster within 5 years from dose. Example : If patient had Pneumovax at age 62 years, give booster in 5 years (67 years or older). PCV 13 (Prevnar): Note that about half of people become drowsy after the shot, some have redness at the injection site and mild fever (one in 20 had fever >102.2\u00b0F). 478Tetanus Vaccine (Td and Tdap) Booster needed every 10 years. Adults should receive one dose of Tdap regardless of time since last immunization (once in a lifetime). Tdap can replace one of the regular Td boosters. For contaminated wounds, give a booster if the last one was given 5 years or more before the incident. Herpes Zoster Vaccine Indicated for adults aged 60 years or older (even if positive history of shingles infection or does not recall having a chickenpox infection). The vaccine reduces risk of developing shingles by 51% and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) by 67%. Immunity from shingles lasts about 5 years. Approved for persons aged 50 years or older but the CDC does not recommend it for routine use for people aged 50 to 59 years. Contraindicated if history of severe allergic reaction to gelatin or neomycin, on high doses of steroids (oral or injectable), other drugs that affect the immune system (biologics), weakened immune system (HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, etc.), certain cancers (leukemia, lymphoma), or in pregnancy. Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine Adults born before 1957 are generally considered immune to measles and mumps. Table 22.3 Recommended Immunizations for Older Adults Vaccine Generic Name Recommendation Influenza vaccine Inactivated flu vaccines, quadrivalent and trivalent Start giving at the end of October annually; give intramuscularly Fluzone High-Dose vaccine (four times higher dose antigen) Give if age 65 years or older Tetanus vaccine Tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) or Td (tetanus- diphtheria) Substitute Tdap for one Td booster (once in a lifetime) Shingles vaccine Herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax) Age 60 years or older; give even if had shingles before or no history of varicella/chickenpox Pneumococcal vaccines PPV13 (Prevnar) and or older; give PPV13 first; then in 1 year, follow up with PPSV23 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2017). 479401 23 Common Disorders in Geriatrics DANGER SIGNALS Retinal Detachment New onset or sudden increase in number of floaters or specks on the visual field, flashes of light, and the sensation that a curtain is covering part of the visual field. Considered a medical emergency that can lead to blindness if it is not treated. Risk factors are extreme nearsightedness, history of cataract surgery, and family or personal history of retinal detachment. Treated with laser surgery or cryopexy (freezing). Temporal Arteritis (Giant Cell Arteritis) Temporal headache (one sided) with tenderness or induration over temporal artery; may be accompanied by sudden visual loss in one eye (amaurosis fugax). Scalp tenderness on affected side. Screening test is the sedimentation rate, which will be elevated. Considered a medical emergency (can cause blindness). Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma Older adult with acute onset of severe eye pain, severe headache, and nausea and vomiting. The eye(s) is(are) reddened with profuse tearing. Complains of blurred vision and halos around lights. Call 911. Do not delay treatment. Tonometry is done in the ED to quickly measure the intra-ocular pressure. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) Sudden onset of neurological dysfunction that worsens within hours. Also called a \"brain attack.\" Deficits can include changes such as blurred vision, slurred speech, one-sided upper and/or lower extremity weakness, hemianopsia, confusion. Signs and symptoms are 480402 dependent on location of infarct. In comparison, a transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary episode that generally lasts less than 24 hours. Actinic Keratosis (Precursor of Squamous Cell Carcinoma) Small rough pink to reddish lesions that do not heal. Located in sun-exposed areas such as the cheeks, nose, back of neck, arms, chest, and so on. More common in light-skinned individuals. Squamous cell precancerous skin lesions. Diagnostic method of choice is biopsy. Small number of lesions can be treated with cryotherapy. Larger numbers with wider distribution are treated with 5-fluorouracil cream. Fractures of the Hip Acute onset of limping, guarding, and/or inability or difficulty with bearing weight on the affected side. New onset of hip pain; may be referred to the knee or groin. Unequal leg length. Affected leg is abducted (turned away from the body). History of osteoporosis or osteopenia. Fractures of the hip are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Up to 20% of elderly with hip fractures die from complications (e.g., pneumonia). Colorectal Cancer Unexplained iron-deficiency anemia (23%), blood on rectum (37%), hematochezia, melena, abdominal pain (34%), and/or change in bowel habits. No symptoms during early stages, diagnosed due to screening. Presentation depends on location. Rectal cancer can present with tenesmus, rectal pain, and diminished-caliber stools (ribbon-like stools). About 20% of cases have distant metastases at time of presentation. Refer to a gastroenterologist. Severe Bacterial Infections Atypical presentation is common. Older adults/elderly with bacteremia or sepsis may be afebrile. About one third to one half of people with severe bacterial infections do not develop fever and/or chills. Some present with slightly lower than normal body temperature (<37\u00b0C [98.6\u00b0F]). The WBC can be normal. Atypical presentations also include a sudden decline in mental status (confusion, dementia), the new onset of urine/bowel incontinence, falling, worsening inability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), and/or loss of appetite. Serious infections include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, bacterial endocarditis, sepsis, and others. The most common infection in older adults (>65 years) is urinary tract infection (UTI). Elder Abuse Presence of bruising, skin tears, lacerations, and fractures that are poorly explained Presence of sexually transmitted disease, vaginal, and/or rectal bleeding, bruises on breasts are indicators of possible sexual abuse Malnutrition, poor hygiene, and pressure injuries 481403 Screen for abuse and financial exploitation Interview Elder Alone With These Three Questions Do you feel safe where you live? Who handles your checkbook and finances? Who prepares your meals? Top Three Leading Causes of Death (Older Than Age 65 Years) Heart disease (myocardial infarction [MI], heart failure, arrhythmias) Cancers (lung and colorectal) Chronic lower respiratory diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) CANCER IN OLDER ADULTS Aging and advancing age are the most common risk factors for cancer. Up to 60% of newly diagnosed malignancies occur in older adults (age 65 years or older). Cancers among older adults may be caused by gene-related DNA damage, familial genetics, decrease in immunity, decreased healing rates, environment, and hormonal influences. Cancer with highest mortality: Lung and bronchial cancer (both genders) Cancer with second highest mortality: Colorectal cancer Median Age of Diagnosis of Certain Cancers Breast cancer: 61 years old Prostate cancer: 68 years old Lung cancer: 70 years old Lung Cancer The cancer with the highest mortality (both genders). About one out of four cancer deaths are caused by lung cancer. Most patients with lung cancer are older adults. Fewer than 2% of people diagnosed with lung cancer are younger the age 45 years (American Cancer Society, 2016). Most common risk factor: Smoking (causes 90% of cases); other risk factors include radon exposure (10%), occupational exposures to carcinogens (9%-15%), and outdoor pollution (1%-2%) Most common type of lung cancer: Non-small cell lung (90%) carcinoma Screening: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends annual screening for lung cancer in adults (aged 55-80 years) who have a 30-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke (or have quit within past 15 years); screening test is low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) Discontinue screening: Patient stops smoking for 15 years or longer or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy (or the ability or willingness 482404 for curative lung surgery) Classic Case An older male smoker (or ex-smoker) presents with a new onset of cough that is productive of large amounts of thin mucoid phlegm (bronchorrhea). Some patients have blood-tinged phlegm. The patient complains of worsening shortness of breath or dyspnea. Some will report persistent and dull achy chest pain that does not go away. If the tumor is obstructing a bronchus, it can result in recurrent pneumonia of the same lobe. Some may have weight loss. Treatment Plan Order chest radiograph (nodules, lesions with irregular borders). The next imaging exam needed is a CT scan. Gold standard is a positive lung biopsy. Baseline labs include CBC, fecal occult blood test (FOBT), chemistry panel, and UA. Refer patient to a pulmonologist for bronchoscopy and tumor biopsy. Colorectal Cancer The second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States. About 20% of cases have distant metastases at time of presentation. It is staged using the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system (stages I to IV). Risk factors: Advancing age (most common), inflammatory bowel disease, or a family history of colorectal cancer, colonic polyps Lifestyle risk factors: Lack of regular physical activity, high-fat diet, low-fiber diet, obesity, etc. Screening: Start at age 50 years with baseline colonoscopy (repeat every 7 to 10 years; abnormal findings dictate more frequent rescreening), sigmoidoscopy (every 5 years), or a high-sensitivity FOBT (annually). A DNA-based screening fecal occult test (Cologuard) is now available in place of the screening colonoscopy, but it is only for average risk individuals with no prior history of abnormal colonoscopy findings and/or no family history of colon cancer. Classic Case An older adult who presents with a change in bowel habits with hematochezia or melena and/or abdominal pain, but may be asymptomatic, and presents with unexplained iron-deficiency anemia (23%). The patient may report anorexia and unintentional weight loss. Asymptomatic during early stages; diagnosed by screening. Presentation depends on location. Patients with rectal cancer can present with tenesmus, rectal pain, and diminished-caliber stools (ribbon-like stools). Treatment Plan Baseline labs include CBC, FOBT, chemistry panel, and UA. Check occult blood in stool (guaiac-based, stool DNA, others). Refer to gastroenterologist for colonoscopy and management. Multiple Myeloma 483405 Myeloma is a cancer of the bone marrow that affects the plasma cells of the immune system (production of monoclonal immunoglobulins). The racial background with the highest incidence are people of African descent (doubled or tripled compared with Whites). Multiple myeloma is a cancer found mostly in older adults. Classic Case Typical patient is an older to elderly adult who complains of bone pain with generalized weakness. The bone pain is usually located on the chest and/or the back and usually does not occur at night. The majority have anemia (73%). Treatment Plan Baseline labs include CBC, FOBT, chemistry panel, and UA Refer patient to a hematologist Pancreatic Cancer The most lethal cancer. The 5-year survival rate is 8.2%. More than 95% of cases arise from the exocrine portion of the pancreas. Most patients already have metastases by time of diagnosis. The most common presentation is weight loss (85%), anorexia, jaundice, weakness (asthenia), and abdominal pain. Treatment labs: AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, lipase, amylase Refer to a GI surgeon for Whipple procedure or other interventions, as determined EXAM TIPS Ribbon-like stool (low-caliber stool) in older adult with iron-deficiency anemia; rule out colon cancer Know signs and symptoms of retinal detachment Know signs and symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma Hip fracture signs and symptoms Actinic keratosis is precancer of squamous cell skin Check sedimentation rate with/without C-reactive protein (CRP; both elevated) Top cause of death is heart disease CLINICAL PEARLS Any patient with unexplained iron-deficiency anemia who is older, male, or postmenopausal should be referred for a colonoscopy (GI bleed, colon cancer). If the chemistry profile shows marked elevations in the serum calcium and/or alkaline phosphatase, it is usually indicative of cancerous metastasis of the bone. 484DISEASE REVIEW Atypical Presentations in the Elderly Atypical disease presentations are more common in this age group. The immune system becomes less robust as people age and is less likely to become stimulated by bacterial and viral infections. Vaccines may not be as effective in the elderly as in the young because of decreased immune response in the former (result is lower antibody production). Older adults and the elderly are more likely to be asymptomatic or to present with subtle symptoms. The elderly are less likely to have a high fever during an infection. Instead, they are more likely to suffer acute cognitive dysfunction such as confusion, agitation, and delirium. Cognitive dysfunction in the elderly may also result from use of multiple prescriptions to manage multiple comorbid conditions. Polypharmacy increases the chances of adverse drugs reactions and drug-drug interactions. For management of diseases not included in this chapter, see the other system review chapters in this book. For example, the management and treatment of pneumonia is covered in Chapter 8 . Bacterial Pneumonia Fever and chills may be missing or mild (oral temp >100 F or rectal >99.5 F). Coughing may not be a prominent symptom. The cough may be mild and produce little to no sputum (especially if the patient is dehydrated). May stop eating and drinking water and start losing weight. More likely to become confused and weak with loss of appetite. May become incontinent of bladder and bowel. Tachycardia usually present. Increases the risk of falls. The WBC count may be normal or mildly elevated. Streptococcal pneumonia causes the most deaths from pneumonia in the elderly. Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) The most common infection in elderly nursing home residents and in adults age 65 and older. Patients usually have no fever or can be asymptomatic. May become acutely confused or agitated. May become septic with mild symptoms. New onset of urinary incontinence. At higher risk of falls. Acute Abdomen Elderly patients may have more subtle symptoms such as the absence of abdominal guarding and other signs of acute abdomen. The abdominal pain may be milder. The WBC count may be only slightly elevated or it may be normal. Patient may have low-grade fever with anorexia and weakness. Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) May be asymptomatic. Symptoms may consist of new-onset fatigue, back pain and/or mild 485406 chest pain. Hypothyroidism Subtle and insidious symptoms such as sleepiness, severe constipation, weight gain, and dry skin. Hypothyroidism is very common in patients aged 60 years or older. Problems with memory. If severe, may mimic dementia. Slower movements. Appears apathetic. Urinary Incontinence Should not be considered a \"normal\" aspect of aging. Evaluate all cases. May be short term and temporary (e.g., UTI, high intake of tea or coffee) or chronic. Two to three times more common in women. Risk factors are obesity, pregnancy, vaginal delivery, menopause, age, and diabetes. Some foods and drinks worsen urinary incontinence because of their diuretic effect (tea, caffeine, alcohol, carbonated drinks, citrus fruits, spicy foods), and medications (diuretics, sedatives) may have a similar effect. Table 23.1 describes the types of urinary incontinence. Table 23.1 Types of Urinary Incontinence Type Description Stress incontinence Increased intra-abdominal pressure (laughing, sneezing, bending, lifting) causes involuntary leakage of small to medium volume of urine Highest incidence in middle-age women (peak at 45 to 49 years) Plan : Kegel exercises; decongestant (pseudoephedrine) if no contraindications Urge incontinence Sudden and strong urge to void immediately. Involuntary loss of urine can range from moderate to large volumes. Condition also known as \"overactive bladder\" Highest incidence in older women Plan : Trial of anticholinergics (oxybutynin/Ditropan) or tricyclic antidepressant (imipramine) Overflow incontinence Frequent dribbling of small amounts of urine from overly full bladder; due to blockage of flow (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH]) or underactive detrusor muscle (e.g. spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis) Highest incidence in older men Plan : BPH treatment (discussed in Chapter 16 ) Functional incontinence Problems with mobility (walking to the toilet) or inability to pull down pants in a timely manner Plan : Bedside commode, raised toilet seats with handles, physical therapy for strengthening and gait Mixed incontinence Symptoms that are a mixture of stress and urge incontinence 486407 Treatment Plan First-line treatment: Lifestyle modifications for all types (stress, urge, mixed). If obese, advise weight loss. Smoking cessation if smoker. Dietary: Avoid certain beverages (alcohol, coffee, tea, carbonated drinks). Avoid excessive fluid intake (>64 ounces) and decrease fluid intake before bedtime. Kegel exercises (pelvic floor exercises): All types of urinary incontinence, especially stress incontinence. Kegel exercises have been found to help with fecal incontinence. Use absorbent pads and absorbent underwear made for urinary incontinence. For moderate to advanced pelvic organ prolapse uterine prolapse, in urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse repair. Kegel Exercises Tell the patient to: Identify the muscles used to stop urinating (stop urinating midstream to confirm this). Do not tighten muscles of the abdomen, buttocks, thighs, and legs at the same time. Squeeze and hold these muscles and slowly count to five. Relax and release these same muscles to a slow count of five. Repeat this 10 times. Aim for at least three sets of 10 repetitions each day. Behavioral Bladder Training Bladder training to delay urination after feeling the urge to urinate. At first, have the patient try holding off urinating for 10 minutes each time. The goal is to lengthen the time between trips to the bathroom to every 2 to 4 hours. Double voiding helps to empty the bladder more completely to avoid overflow. Double voiding means urinating, then waiting a few minutes and voiding again. Medications for Urinary Incontinence Anticholinergics Oxybutynin (Ditropan) 2.5 to 5 mg PO release); other formulations: Extended release, transdermal patch (twice/week), transdermal gel Contraindications: Urinary retention, gastric retention, severe decreased at HS TCAs have anticholinergic and antimuscarinic effects, which helps to decrease bladder spasms and increases urethral resistance. Adverse effects: urinary retention, dry in glaucoma. Pseudephedrine helps stress incontinence by increasing the muscle tone of the bladder neck. It is an alpha receptor agonist and the bladder neck has numerous alpha receptors. Oral Decongestant Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) PO 30 to 60 mg BID 487408 Adverse effects: Hypertension, arrhythmias, insomnia, headache, tremor. Be careful with the elderly. Pelvic Organ Prolapse in Women Herniation of the bladder (cystocele), rectum (uterine or vagina (vaginal vault prolapse; Table 23.2 ). Caused by weakening of pelvic muscles and supporting ligaments. During early stage, pelvic organ prolapse is usually asymptomatic. Advise the patient to avoid heavy lifting or excessive straining, which can worsen condition, and to avoid chronic constipation because straining worsens pelvic organ prolapse. Evaluation During the gynecological exam (bimanual exam, speculum exam), instruct the patient to cough (cover mouth to increase intra-abdominal pressure) so that herniation becomes more visible and palpable. Table 23.2 Pelvic Organ Prolapse Organ Description Cystocele (bladder) Bulging of the anterior vaginal wall; early stage is usually asymptomatic in all types of pelvic organ prolapse. Symptoms: Stress incontinence (60%), frequency and (23%) : Refer for pessary placement ( Figure 23.1 ), surgical repair Rectocele (rectum) Bulging on the posterior vaginal wall; herniation ranges from mild to rectal prolapse Symptoms: Feeling of rectal fullness or pressure, sensation that rectum does not completely empty; rectal prolapse can cause fecal incontinence Plan : Kegel exercises; avoid straining during bowel movement; treat constipation; refer for pessary placement ( Figure 23.1 ), surgical repair Uterine prolapse Cervix descends midline (apical) into vagina; cervix feels firm with pale pink color and os visible; with third-degree full prolapse, a tubular sac-like protrusion is seen outside of the vagina Symptoms: Sensation of vaginal fullness, feeling that something is falling in the vagina, low-back pain Plan : Avoid heavy lifting and straining; refer for pessary placement ( Figure 23.1 ) or surgical repair by urologist specializing in pelvic organ prolapse Enterocele (small intestines) Small bowel slips into the area between the uterus and posterior wall of the vagina, bulging external vagina Symptoms: Pulling sensation inside pelvis, pelvic pressure or pain, low-back pain, dyspareunia 488409 Figure 23.1 Pessaries. Chronic Constipation There two types of constipation: idiopathic and functional constipation. Constipation is the most common GI complaint. Self-treatment is common with over-the-counter (OTC) fiber and laxatives. Constipation has many secondary causes such as prescription and OTC drugs, neurological disease (Parkinson's disease, dementia), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diabetes, hypothyroidism, and others. Lifestyle factors that contribute to constipation are immobility, low-fiber diet, dehydration, milk intake, and ignoring the urge to have bowel movement. Drugs that cause constipation are iron supplements, beta-blockers, opiates, and calcium-containing antacids. Classic Case Older adult complains of history of long-term constipation (years). Describes stool as dry and hard \"ball-like\" pieces or as large-volume stools that are difficult to pass. Reports of straining often to pass the stool. Accompanied by feelings of fullness and bloating. Some patients take laxatives daily (laxative abuse). Usually accompanied by hemorrhoids, which may become exacerbated (reports bright-red blood on toilet paper and blood streaks on stool surface). Treatment Plan Education and behavior modification (bowel retraining). Teach \"toilet\" hygiene such as going to the bathroom at the same time each day; advise not to ignore the urge to defecate. Dietary changes such as eating dried prunes and/or drinking prune juice. Increase intake of fruit and vegetables. 489410 Ingest bulk-forming fibers (25-35 g/d) once to twice a day. Do not take with medication (will absorb drugs). Take with full glass of water (can cause intestinal obstruction). Increase physical activity, especially walking. Increase fluid intake to eight to 10 glasses/day (if no contraindication). Consider laxative treatment ( Table 23.3 ). Avoid using laxatives daily (except for fiber supplements) and chronic treatment with laxatives. Table 23.3 List of Laxatives Type of Laxative Name Notes Bulk forming Psyllium (Metamucil) Wheat dextrin (Benefiber) Methylcellulose (Citrucel) vera juice Stimulates colon Draws fluid by osmosis to increase fluid retention in the colon Rectal use only Saline laxatives Magnesium attracts water into the intestinal lumen (small and large intestines) Side effects: Fluid Idiopathic chronic constipation, IBS Contraindications: History of mechanical obstruction Lubricants Mineral oil Lubricants are not absorbed Stool softeners Docusate sodium (Colace) Softens stool (does not stimulate colon) Stool becomes soft and slippery IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; PEG, polyethylene glycol. Bowel Retraining Program Choose time of the day patient prefers for bowel movements. Usually in mornings about 20 to 40 minutes after eating breakfast. Spend about 10 to 15 minutes on the toilet each day at the same time. Avoid straining. SCREENING FOR DEMENTIA AND COGNITIVE 490IMPAIRMENT The most common cause of dementia in elderly is Alzheimer disease (60%-80%). The second most common cause is vascular dementia (CVA). One of the most helpful methods of diagnosing dementia is by eliciting a thorough history of the changes in the patient's memory, behavior, function, and personality from family members and close contacts of the patient. Cognitive testing of the patient is important (cognitive performance scales). Ruling out secondary causes is done by ordering laboratory tests for syphilis, vitamin B 12 deficiency, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), CBC, heavy metals, others. Best brain imaging test is the MRI scan of the brain. Cognitive Performance Scales Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam Mini-Cog Test Addenbrookers Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) Beck Depression Inventory-II ADL Self-Performance Hierarchy Scale Index of Social Engagement Scale Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) A brief screening exam to assess for cognitive impairment. High sensitivity and specificity. Orientation Ask about year/season/date/day/month Where are we now? Name state (county, town/city, hospital, floor) Short-term memory Name three unrelated objects and instruct the patient to recite all three words Attention and calculation Serial 7s (ask the patient to count backward from 100 by sevens) Alternative: Instruct the patient to spell \"world\" backward Recall Say to the patient, \"Earlier I told you the names of three things. Can you tell me what they were?\" Show the patient two simple objects (i.e., pencil, coin). Instruct patient to name them. Instruct the patient to repeat the phrase \"No ifs, ands, or buts.\" Give the patient one blank piece of paper. Instruct patient to \"take the paper in your right hand, fold it in half, and put it on the floor.\" Write on the paper \"Close your eyes.\" Instruct the patient to read and do what it says. Writing a sentence Instruct the patient to make up and write a sentence about anything. Copying a design Use a questionnaire with a picture of two pentagons that intersect. 491411 The maximum score is 30 points: Score of 0 to 10 (severe), 10 to 20 (moderate), 20 to 25 (mild), 25 to 30 (questionable significance-mild deficits). \"Mini-Cog\" Test A 3-minute tool to screen for cognitive impairment in older adults in the primary care setting (Borson, Scanlan, Brush, Vitaliano, & Dokmak, 2000). High sensitivity and specificity. Step 1: Three-word recognition (one point for each word) Instruct the patient to repeat three words. There are six versions of words that can be used (two examples listed here): - Banana, sunrise, chair (version 1) - Leader, season, table (version 2) Step 2: Clock drawing (score as normal or abnormal) Instruct the patient to draw a clock by putting in the numbers first and then ask him or her to indicate a specific time by saying \"set the hands to 10 past 11\" or \"set the hands at 20 minutes after 8.\" Step 3: Three-word recall Ask the patient to recall the three words you stated in Step 1. Score range: 0 to 3; dementia if score 0 to 2 points; no dementia if score of 3 to 5 Delirium (Acute Confusional State) A reversible, temporary process. Duration is usually brief (hours to days). Acute and dramatic onset. Patient may be excitable, irritable, and combative, with short attention span, memory loss, and disorientation. Secondary to medical condition, drug, intoxication, adverse reaction to medicine. Etiology Prescription medications (opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, antipsychotics, polypharmacy) heroin, hallucinogens), plants (jimson weed, Salvia) Drug-drug interactions, adverse reactions, psychiatric illness Abrupt drug withdrawal (alcohol, benzodiazepines, drugs) Preexisting medical conditions, ICU patients with sensory overload Infections, sepsis (UTIs and pneumonia most common infections) Electrolyte imbalance, heart failure, renal failure Treatment Plan Remove and/or treat illness, infection, or metabolic derangement, and delirium will resolve \"Sundowning\" Phenomenon This condition occurs in both delirium and dementia Starting at dusk/sundown, the patient becomes very agitated, confused, and combative; symptoms resolve in the morning; seen more with dementia; recurs commonly 492412 Treatment Plan Avoid quiet and dark rooms Have well-lit room with a radio, TV, or clock Familiar surroundings are important. Do not move furniture or change decor Avoid drugs that affect cognition (antihistamines, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics) Dementia An irreversible brain disorder that involves loss of learned cognitive and physical/motor skills. The presentation and the signs and symptoms are determined by the etiology and location of the brain damage ( Table 23.4 ). Gradual and insidious onset except if caused by stroke or acute brain damage). Dementia affects executive skills adversely. Executive function is defined as self- regulation skills, attention, planning, multitasking, self-control, motivation, and decision- making skills. These higher level cognitive skills are regulated in the frontal lobes of the brain. Table 23.4 Types of Dementia Disease Brain Pathology Presentation Alzheimer's disease (#1 cause of dementia) Deposits of beta amyloid protein and neurofibrillary tangles on the frontal and temporal lobes Early signs are short-term memory loss such as difficulty remembering names and recent events, plus wandering, apathy, apraxia, aphasia, and agnosia Progression to impaired judgment, executive skills, confusion, and behavioral changes. Terminal stage is characterized by difficulty speaking, swallowing, and walking Vascular dementia (#2 cause of dementia) Ischemic damage due to atherosclerotic plaques, bleeding, and/or blood clots Symptoms of stroke with cognitive symptoms such as memory loss, impaired executive function, impaired judgment, and apathy; location of infarct determines symptoms Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) Alpha-synuclein protein (Lewy bodies) Causes sleep disturbance, visual hallucinations, executive function is impaired plus parkinsonism (muscle rigidity, tremors), with fluctuations in alertness and cognition Parkinson's disease Loss of dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia of the substantia nigra Causes rigidity, bradykinesia, difficulty initiating voluntary movements, pill- rolling tremor, masked facies, depression, plus features of DLB (sleep disturbance, visual hallucinations) Frontotemporal dementia (Pick's disease) Orbital and frontal areas of brain (orbitofrontal) Causes personality change, social withdrawal, loss of spontaneity, loss of motivation/desire to do task (abulia), impulsive, disinhibition; utilization behavior (i.e., uses and reuses same object 493413 as in using a spoon to eat, comb hair, waving it, etc.) occurs Mixed dementia Mixture of two or more types (e.g., Alzheimer's and vascular dementia) If Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, symptoms of both conditions are present Wernicke-Korsakoff dementia (or Wernicke's encephalopathy) Chronic thiamine (vitamin B 1 ) deficiency due to chronic alcohol abuse causes brain damage Causes confusion, disorientation, indifference, horizontal movement nystagmus (both eyes); thiamine IV in high doses can help, but if late diagnosis, permanent brain damage. If caught early, treatment with high-dose thiamine may reverse some symptoms. Most have permanent brain damage. Normal pressure hydrocephalus Increased amount of cerebrospinal fluid (but normal intracranial pressure) Causes difficulty walking (body bent forward, legs wide apart, slow). Impaired thinking, executive function impaired, reduced concentration, apathy, changes in personality Etiology Alzheimer's disease: Most common cause of dementia in the United States. Vascular (multi-infarct) dementia is the second most common type of dementia. DLB: Symptoms are sleep disorder/insomnia, visual hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations, and parkinsonism (rigidity, bradykinesia, resting tremor, postural instability). Very sensitive to adverse effects of neuroleptics. Deficiency in executive functioning is usually seen earlier with DLB compared with Alzheimer's disease. Memory loss shows up earlier with Alzheimer's disease. Dementia patients are very sensitive to adverse effects of neuroleptics. Parkinson's disease: Up to 40% of Parkinson's patients develop dementia. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is caused by excess cerebrospinal fluid. Symptoms may resemble Alzheimer's disease. Brain shunt surgery to decrease intracranial pressure (ICP) may help. Differential Diagnosis Rule out correctable causes such as vitamin B 12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, major depression, infection, adverse/drug interactions, heavy metal poisoning, neurosyphilis, and others. Parkinson's dementia and DLB may resemble each other. Remember that normal pressure hydrocephalus can cause dementia-like symptoms. Treatment Plan It is important to obtain a thorough health/medical/drug history. The patient should be accompanied by family during the interview. Family members (and friends) will report patient's signs and symptoms. Refer to neurologist for further assessment. The preferred imaging test for dementia signs/symptoms is an MRI of the brain. 494414 Alzheimer's Disease Rare before age 60 years. Accumulation of neurofibrillary plaques/tangles causes permanent damage to brain. Decrease in acetylcholine production. Average life expectancy of person age 65 years or older (when diagnosed) is 4 to 8 years. Seizures occur in 10% to 20% of patients with Aphasia (difficulty verbalizing) (difficulty with gross motor movements such as walking) Agnosia (inability to recognize familiar people or objects) Classic Case Mild (from 2 to 4 years): Problems coming up with the right word when talking. Getting lost on familiar routes. Problems managing personal finances and money. Forgets important dates. Repeats same questions. Poor judgment. Becomes withdrawn, anxious, and/or depressed. Easily upset. Personality changes. Moderate (from 2 to 10 years): Wanders and gets lost. Problems with speech and following instructions. Stops paying bills. May start a conversation and forget to complete sentences. Loses ability to read and write. Has problems recognizing familiar people (agnosia). Severe/Stage 3 (from 1 to 3 years): Needs total care. Unable to feed self. Incontinent of bowel and bladder. Stops walking. Uses wheelchair or bedridden. Incoherent or mute. Apathetic. Treatment Plan Most patients with Alzheimer's disease are taken care of at home by a family member or caregiver during the early stages of the disease. As disease progresses, many patients are placed in skilled nursing facilities, or assisted-living dementia units. In later stages of the disease, families may consider hospice care. Medications Mild to moderate (MMSE 10-26): Begin to advanced dementia (MMSE <17): Add memantine (10 mg BID) to cholinesterase inhibitor use memantine alone. Severe dementia (MMSE <10): Continue memantine or discontinue drug. Vitamin E 2,000 IU daily (not recommended for other forms of dementia) Improvement within 3 to 6 months. Stop if no longer effective. Adjunct Treatment Physical activity and exercise have been shown to decrease the risk of dementia. Ginkgo biloba: May help with memory (do not mix with aspirin or warfarin). Use omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B supplementation. Axona (caprylidene): Prescription triglyceride-rich medical food (consumed as a shake) 495415 that addresses diminished cerebral glucose metabolism by assisting the body in metabolizing ketone bodies as an alternative fuel source for the brain. Rehabilitation Cognitive rehabilitation: May help during early stages of dementia. Exercise programs: May slow functional decline. Occupational therapy: May improve performance of ADL. Driving and Early-Stage or Mild Dementia Evaluate for safety and monitor regularly. Ask family or close contacts about patient's driving ability, traffic accidents, getting lost, difficulty making decisions, etc. Complications Death is usually due to an overwhelming infection such as pneumonia and sepsis. Hip fractures are also a common cause of death (from complications). Parkinson's Disease Progressive neurodegenerative disease marked decrease of dopamine receptors. More common after 60 years of age. Depression is common (up to two thirds of all patients). The classic three symptoms are tremor (worse at rest), muscular rigidity, and bradykinesia. Parkinson's dementia is common (up to 40%). Classic Signs An elderly patient complains of a gradual onset of motor symptoms such as pill-rolling tremors of the hands, cogwheel rigidity with difficulty initiating voluntary movement. Walks with slow shuffling gait. Has poor balance and falls often (postural instability). Generalized muscular rigidity with masked facies. Mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. Excessive daytime sleepiness. Difficulty with executive function (making plans, decisions, tasks). May have signs and symptoms of dementia. Worsening of seborrheic dermatitis (white scales, erythema). Treatment Plan Consider treatment for significant bradykinesia or gait disturbance, moderate to severe hand tremors (dominant hand), depending on patient preference, and the degree that the tremors interfere with ADL, work, and social function. Medications First-line drug: Carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) TID (dopamine precursor) Start at low doses Sinemet 25/100 mg (half tab) PO BID to TID with meal or snack to avoid nausea. Titrate up slowly to control symptoms. Sudden withdrawal or dose reductions of levodopa or dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, ropinirole, etc.) may be associated (rarely) with akinetic crisis or parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome (fever, autonomic dysfunction, muscular 496rigidity, altered mental status). Adverse effects: Motor fluctuations (wearing-off phenomenon), dyskinesia, dystonia, dizziness, somnolence, nausea, Eventually will (treat with benztropine, amantadine, others). Dopamine as used in Parkinson's; dopamine agonists are non-ergot type, such as pramipexole (Mirapex) Do not abruptly discontinue dopamine agonists. Dopamine withdrawal syndrome (8%-19%) causes panic attacks, anxiety, craving drug. Adverse effects: Can cause impulse control disorders (compulsive gambling, sex, or shopping). MAO-B inhibitors: Selegiline (Eldepryl) or rasagiline (Azilect) like monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Adverse effects: May cause insomnia, jitteriness, hallucinations. Do not combine with or serotonin antagonist (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], triptans). restrictions type A influenza) and antiparkinson agent. Nonpharmacological: Exercise, physical therapy, speech therapy Surgery: Consider deep brain stimulation Complications Acute akinesia: Loss of voluntary movement; sudden exacerbation of Parkinson's disease Dementia (40%) Frequent falls may result in fractures of the face, hips, and so on Drug-related adverse effects such as tardive dyskinesia, dystonia, motor fluctuations Essential Tremor The most common type of action or postural tremor. Usually seen in the arms or the hands and may be progress to include the head. Exact etiology is unknown. Essential tremor can occur in children and adults. It is not curable, but the symptoms can be controlled by medication. In some patients with essential tremor, the tremors can worsen with anxiety. Medications can be taken PRN (anxiety) or daily. Treatment Plan Propranolol 60 to 320 mg per day. Long-acting propranolol (Inderal LA) is also effective but it provides the same response as \"regular\" propranolol Contraindications (Mysoline) 25 to 750 mg per day at bedtime Refer to neurologist for evaluation and treatment 497416 NEUROCOGNITIVE FINDINGS Abulia : Loss of motivation or desire to do tasks, indifference to social norms (e.g., urinates in public) Akathisia : Intense need to move due to severe feelings of restlessness Akinesia : Reduced voluntary muscle movement (e.g., Parkinson's disease) Amnesia : Memory loss; anterograde amnesia is memory loss of recent events (occurs during disease) and retrograde amnesia is memory loss of events in the past (before the onset of disease) Anomia : Problems recalling words or names Aphasia : Difficulty using (speech) and/or understanding language; can include difficulty with speaking, comprehension, and written language Apraxia : Difficulty with or inability to remember learned motor skill Astereognosis : Inability to recognize familiar objects placed in the palm (place a coin on palm with eyes closed and ask patient to identify object) Ataxia : Difficulty coordinating voluntary movement Broca's aphasia : Ability to speak is intact but ability to comprehend language is lost Confabulation : \"Lying\" or fabrication of events due to inability to remember the event Dyskinesia : Abnormal involuntary muscle rigidity Dystonia : Involuntary repetitive muscle movements resulting in abnormal movements and postures (continuous muscle spasms) EXAM TIPS A question will ask you to identify the MMSE \"activity\" that is being performed. When a person is asked to interpret a proverb (given by the nurse practitioner [NP]), it is a test of abstract thinking. Korsakoff-Wernicke dementia brain damage is caused by vitamin B 1 (thiamine). The MMSE is the most popular screening test for dementia, and the most commonly used test for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the United States. Vascular dementia is second most common cause of dementia. Recognize classic presentation of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Recognize the \"sundowning\" phenomenon. Selegiline (Eldepryl) is an drug without food interactions. It affects the serotonin system; any drug that alters serotonin will increase risk of serotonin syndrome. Drugs that alter serotonin are the SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs, and triptans. Allow at least 14 days (or longer) to pass before starting another drug that affects serotonin. Essential tremor is an \"action,\" or postural tremor (not a resting tremor). First-line treatment for essential tremor is beta-blockers (propranolol). 498417 Sample Question A nurse practitioner instructs a patient to copy a square (or spell \"world\" backward, subtract 7 from 100, etc.). Which of the following tests is being performed? A) MMPI (or Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory; for personality testing) B) CAGE (for alcohol abuse screening in primary care) C) MMSE D) Beck's Inventory (a depression screening tool) The correct answer is option C, the MMSE CLINICAL PEARLS Refer patients with suspected Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease to a neurologist for diagnostic evaluation and management. UTI is one of the most common causes of acute mental status changes in the elderly. Order a UA in all elderly patients with acute mental status changes or delirium. Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is associated with low serum vitamin B 12 levels due to levodopa. Check the vitamin B 12 level. Some clinicians postpone levodopa use in early-onset Parkinson's disease (younger than 60 years) because of higher incidence of levodopa-related dyskinesia. Cholinergic drugs can exacerbate or worsen Parkinson's disease symptoms. OTHER COMMON GERIATRIC CONDITIONS These diseases are covered under their respective organ systems. Acute diverticulitis ( Chapter 10 ) Anemia ( Chapter ( Chapter 8 ) COPD ( Chapter 8 ) Congestive heart failure ( Chapter 7 ) Diabetes type 2 ( Chapter Glaucoma PHARMACOLOGICAL ISSUES: OLDER ADULTS 499418 Drug clearance is affected by renal impairment, a less efficient liver cytochrome P450 system, malabsorption, and relatively higher fat:muscle tissue (extends half-life, fat-soluble drugs). Older adults have an increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines, hypnotics, TCAs, and antipsychotics. The American Geriatrics Society has made a list of inappropriate medications for the elderly (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearinghouse, & American Geriatrics Society, 2015; Table 23.5 ). Table 23.5 Potentially Inappropriate Medications for Older Adults (Beers List Criteria) * Drug Class Drugs to Avoid Antihistamines Diphenhydramine/Benadryl and others; newer generation has lower incidence (Claritin) box warning: Higher risk mortality in GI bleeding and PUD, especially aged >75 years or taking corticosteroids or anticoagulants Mineral oil (oral) Proton-pump inhibitors Aspiration pneumonia with mineral oil; long-term PPIs may increase risk of aspiration pneumonia Zolpidem (Ambien), eszopiclone (Lunesta) Adverse effects similar the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Updated Beers Criteria. 500419 24 Pressure Injuries, Wounds, Wound Treatment, and Advanced Practice Procedures The last few pages of this chapter cover clinical procedures, such as wound debridement, wound care, local anesthesia (digital block and infiltration), suturing, and skin biopsy, which may be performed (with adequate clinical training) by adult nurse practitioners (NPs), family NPs, gerontological NPs, and adult-gerontology NPs. Most NPs who work in the primary care area do not perform advanced procedures such as digital nerve blocks, suturing, or biopsy in their clinical practice. PRESSURE INJURIES (DECUBITI) A pressure injury (pressure sore, bed sore, decubitus ulcers) is formed when there is prolonged pressure over a localized area of skin and underlying tissue (usually over a bony prominence) or when there is prolonged pressure combined with shearing forces and friction. The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) changed the terminology from pressure ulcer to pressure injury in April 2016. Do not confuse pressure injuries (which were called pressure ulcers) with ulcers that are caused by arterial or venous insufficiency or by diabetes. Risk factors : Immobility, older age, skin too wet or too dry, smoking, urine or bowel incontinence, maceration, diabetic, peripheral vascular disease (PVD; lower extremity pressure injuries), malnutrition, spinal cord injuries, etc. Nutritional indicators : Low serum albumin, anemia, poor appetite/anorexia, underweight 501420 PREVENTION OF PRESSURE INJURIES Nutrition Assess nutritional status by checking albumin (low), CBC (anemia), hydration status, food and fluid intake, weight/body mass index (BMI), and diet. Supplement diet with high protein mixed with oral nutritional supplements or tube feedings, in addition to person's normal diet. If poor dietary intake, give vitamin and mineral supplements. Refer to dietician for consult about increasing dietary calories and snacks. Positioning Avoid 90-degree side-lying position (increases pressure). If on bed rest, limit head of bed elevation to 30 degrees unless during feeding/dietary considerations or medical contraindications. Turn patient every 2 hours in bed. Clean urine/feces as soon as possible and change clothes if soiled or wet. Keep skin clean and dry. Positioning: Change position to right side, back, left side (30-degree tilt on each side) every 2 hours. When supine, use heel protectors and position legs with slight flexion of the knee. Use transfer aids to reduce shearing and friction. Do not drag patient on the bed\u2014lift using folded sheet while repositioning patient to avoid shearing and rubbing. Do not turn patient onto body surface that is damaged or still red from previous episode of pressure loading or if skin does not blanch (risk pressure injury develops). Skin Care Skin that is frequently moist or is very dry places a person at higher risk for pressure injuries. For dry skin, use skin emollients (e.g., Eucerin cream, cocoa butter). Protect from excessive moisture by using heavy creams as a waterproof barrier (zinc creams, Desitin cream). If incontinent, change adult diaper when soiled. Do not use \"massage\" for pressure injury prevention. If the skin is inflamed, massage is contraindicated (may damage skin further). If patient is a smoker, give smoking-cessation education. Wounds take longer to heal in smokers. Pressure-Relieving Devices Avoid using doughnut-, cutout-, or ring-shaped chair cushions/devices, synthetic sheepskin (real sheepskin works), or shaped cushions. Use rolled towels, pillows, sheepskin, or wedge to help bedridden patient with position changes. Pressure-reducing mattress: Use higher specification foam mattresses (not standard type), alternating-pressure mattress, but not small-cell size (<10-cm) types. Use pressure-reducing air-loss seat cushions, chair cushions (gel, foams), natural sheepskin. Teach wheelchair patients to shift body weight every 15 to 20 minutes. Prophylactic Dressings Consider using a polyurethane foam dressing over bony prominences (heels, sacrum) over areas subjected to friction and shearing forces (National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel/European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel [NPUAP/EPUAP], 2014). Replace dressing if loose, too moist, or damaged. Look for signs of pressure injury with each dressing change (NPUAP/EPUAP, 2014). TOOLS FOR PREDICTING AND CLASSIFYING PRESSURE INJURIES Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sore Risk Used to predict pressure injury risk. Helpful in identifying risk factors so that interventions can be started early to help prevent or delay pressure injury development. The Braden Scale contains six categories. It measures the following factors: sensory perception, moisture (skin), activity, mobility, nutrition, friction, and shear. A Braden score of 19 to 23 is \"no risk,\" a score of 12 or less is considered \"high risk\" for development of bed sores, and a score of 9 or below is considered \"very high risk.\" Pressure Injury Classification System A classification system for grading and classifying pressure injuries only is available from the NPUAP/EPUAP ( Table 24.1 ). Do not use this system to classify tissue loss in other types of wounds (skin tears, tape burns, maceration, perineal dermatitis, excoriation) other than pressure injuries. Table 24.1 Pressure Injury Classification System Stage Description Stage I Intact skin. Nonblanchable local area of redness. If darker colored skin, difficult to assess or may not see blanching. Look for signs of ischemic damage such as a localized area that feels firmer and warmer (or cooler) than surrounding skin. Affected area is usually located on a bony prominence. Stage II (partial thickness) Partial-thickness loss of skin with exposed dermis. Wound bed is viable, pink or red, and moist. May present as an intact (or ruptured) serum-filled blister. There should be no eschar, slough, or granulation tissue. Stage III (full thickness) Full-thickness loss (epidermis and dermis). Deeper pressure injury; borders are obvious and firm. May see 503422 subcutaneous fat (but tendon, bone, and/or muscle not exposed). Can include undermining or tunneling. Pressure injuries located on ear, occiput, and malleolus are shallower. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. May have rolled wound edges (epibole). Stage IV Full-thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon, joint capsule, or muscle. Risk of osteomyelitis. Often includes undermining and tunneling. Slough or eschar may be present. Pressure injuries located on ear, occiput, and malleolus are shallower. Unstageable Full-thickness tissue damage. Presence of eschar or sloughing interferes with staging. Slough covers wound (yellow, tan, gray, green, or brown) and should be removed/debrided. Category cannot be staged until enough slough is removed so that the wound bed is visible. Stable heel eschar Dry and intact; adheres to heel without exudate. No signs of infection. Should not be removed. Suspected deep tissue injury Purple- or maroon-colored skin that feels very firm. Some with blood-filled blister. Can be preceded by tissue that feels painful, firm, boggy, warmer, or cooler. Some may have blistering. Darker skin, difficult to see color changes. Source: National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (2016). Pressure Ulcer Healing Chart (PUSH Tool Version 3.0) It is important to monitor and document the condition of the pressure injury daily. Use the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) tool to document the surface area, exudate, and the type of wound tissue of the pressure injury. The PUSH tool is an observational rating scale from the NPUAP. It is used to document the healing progress of the pressure injury. The PUSH score ranges from 1 to 17 points (healed = 0). When using the tool, always use the same type/brand of centimeter ruler and always measure the pressure injury the same way each time. Length \u00d7 Width Measure at greatest length and greatest width (side to side). Multiply (length \u00d7 width) to obtain the surface area in square centimeters (cm 2 ). Use disposable measuring tapes. Exudate Amount Estimate amount from none to light, moderate, or heavy. Tissue Type Describe the type of tissue that is on the wound bed. Use the following terms: Eschar (necrotic tissue) : Black, brown, or tan-colored tissue that adheres firmly to the wound bed or pressure injury edges. Texture is either firmer or softer than surrounding skin. 504 Slough : Yellow or white tissue that adheres to the pressure injury bed. Slough is tissue that is attached to the pressure injury bed and looks like strings or thick clumps or is mucinous. Granulation tissue : Look for pink or beefy red tissue with shiny, moist, granular appearance. Epithelial tissue : For superficial pressure injuries, appears like new pink or shiny tissue (skin) that grows in from the edges or as islands on the pressure injury surface. Closed/resurfaced : The wound is completely covered with epithelium (new skin). PRESSURE INJURY MANAGEMENT Stage-Specific Care Debridement Stage Not all pressure injuries require debridement. If slough or necrosis, requires debridement (see \"Debridement Procedure\" section). Consult Table 24.2 for types of wound dressings for pressure injuries. Hydrogels or hydrocolloid dressings : Can be used to protect stoma skin from maceration. Avoid using with high-exudate wounds. Can be used for many wound types. Wound types : Pressure injuries, burns, macerated skin, fistula, stoma, Aquagel Granulation Stage Foam dressing works well for most wound types. Works well with high-exudate wounds. Low adherence of foam dressing decreases wound trauma (dressing changes). Several types of foam are available (e.g., true foam, polyurethane, silicone foam). Some types have an adhesive border and some do not. Can be left in place for 3 to 4 days. Examples : 3M Tegaderm, Opsite, others Wounds : Leg ulcers, pressure injuries, skin graft donor sites, minor burns, diabetic ulcers, etc. Epithelialization Stage Hydrocolloid and low-adherence dressings are used during the epithelialization stage. Pressure Injury Dressings Most wounds heal faster in a moist environment (40% faster). Moisture facilitates migration of epidermal cells, which helps with the healing process (granulation; Table 24.2 ). Debridement Procedure Necrotic tissue impairs wound healing and increases the risk of infection. Debridement of wounds is the process of removing necrotic tissue. There are several methods. 505423 Sharp Debridement Gently lift necrotic tissue with forceps, then cut it gently with either scalpel or sharp scissors. Do not perform sharp debridement on thick heel eschars because of the risk of bone trauma (risk of osteomyelitis). Clean wound and apply dressing. Tools : Scalpel or scissors and forceps Table 24.2 Types of Wound Dressings for Pressure Injuries Dressing Type Action Wound Types Hydrogels or hydrocolloid(gels in tube, sheets, spray) Cleans and debrides wounds by liquefying necrotic tissue. Keeps wounds moist. Breathable films prevent bacteria from entering wound. Wounds with little to no exudate, dry wounds, and clean stage II pressure injuries. Avoid with high-exudate wounds. Can relieve pain for up to 6 hours. Facilitates autolytic debridement. Foams (polyurethane, silicone, or true foam) Soaks up excess exudate and has low adherence. For stage II to shallow stage III exudative injuries. Can be used as the secondary dressing or to protect skin areas from developing pressure injuries due to too much pressure or shearing forces. Alginates (sheets, rope) Forms gel on contact; is derived from brown seaweed. Soaks up exudate. Transforms into gel-like consistency. Facilitates autolytic debridement. Silver alginate Silver alginate has antimicrobial properties. Use for moderate to heavy exudate wounds. Cover with absorbent gauze and secure in place with secondary dressing. Silver-impregnated or honey dressings Used for infected and/or heavily colonized pressure injuries. Avoid prolonged use of silver- impregnated dressings (discontinue when infection is controlled). Enzymes (collagenase, fibrinolysin) Cleans and debrides wounds by liquefying tissue. Used for necrotic wounds. Semipermeable or semi-occlusive films (e.g., Tegaderm) Waterproof semitransparent film made from polyurethane. High- moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR). Protects wounds and keeps them moist. Use with nondraining wounds as primary or secondary dressing. Packing gauze Some types are impregnated with antimicrobials. Use for wounds with cavities. Use for tunneling wounds and deep wounds. Needs secondary dressing such as silicone foam dressing. Enzymatic Debridement Apply proteolytic enzyme to the pressure injury. Be careful with the amount; avoid placing too much because it can leak to the normal skin surrounding the pressure injury. Produces large amount of exudate. Topical proteolytic enzymes : Collagenase, sheet, alginate sheet, or semiocclusive transparent film. Works better in wounds with minimal to no discharge. Retains the enzymes produced by the wound. Enzymes break down the necrotic tissue. Jet Lavage Wound Debridement Water is used under pressure to clean and debride wound. A large syringe is connected to a short tube with a silicone needle tip. A \"jet\" of water is produced that is used to clean and debride the wound. Pressure Injury Complications The most common complication of pressure injuries is local infection. Chronic pressure injuries or wounds are always colonized by bacteria. But if the bacterial load is too high, the patient's wound will become infected. Common organisms are Proteus mirabilis , group D streptococci, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium organisms. Complications include osteomyelitis, cellulitis, sepsis, fistula formation, tunneling, malignant transformation (Marjolin ulcer), and severe scarring. Wound Culture Suspect possible infection if increase in exudate, purulent or darkening color of exudate, erythema, swelling, foul-smelling discharge, and increased pain. There are three methods for obtaining a wound culture: Punch biopsy (deep tissue), needle aspiration, or swab culture. Before obtaining the specimen, irrigate and clean the wound surface with normal saline (minimize surface contamination). Collect wound culture specimen before topical or systemic antibiotics are started. Infection can be localized or it can spread to surrounding skin (cellulitis), to the bone (osteomyelitis), and the body (sepsis). Treat if there is clinical evidence of an infection. Deep Tissue Specimen This is the gold standard for identifying infection and wound bioburden. Before obtaining specimen, debride and clean using normal saline solution. Follow the punch biopsy instructions near the end of this chapter. Can be painful. Needle Aspiration For wounds with exudate or abscessed. Use a large-gauge needle and aspirate fluid from wound or from abscess. Can be painful and may underestimate bacterial isolates. Swab Specimen Moisten the swab with normal saline solution. Swab a 1 cm 2 area of viable tissue (near the center) and apply enough pressure to produce exudate for 5 minutes (Levine's technique). Another way to obtain swab specimen is by using the Z-technique. Superficial Pressure Injury Infections 507425 Initial actions are better wound care and debridement of necrotic tissue and slough. Avoid using povidone-iodine (Betadine), hydrogen peroxide, or chlorhexidine on the pressure injury wound because they impede healing (toxic to fibroblasts). Initiate a trial of topical antibiotics for 2-week duration (combination antibiotic ointment or silver sulfadiazine 1% cream). Osteomyelitis Deeper pressure injuries (stages III and VI) are at higher risk for osteomyelitis. May complain of bone pain or may be asymptomatic. If suspect osteomyelitis, order a plain x-ray (radiograph). If abnormal (i.e., inflammation), refer to physician or order MRI (preferred) or CT scan. Other tests are blood cultures, ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP), WBC, bone biopsy for C&S. Hospitalization (intravenous antibiotics, bone debridement). If mild case, oral antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin \u00d7 6 weeks). Marjolin Ulcer Malignant transformation of a chronic wound or scar (rare). An aggressive form of squamous cell carcinoma. Obtain a tissue biopsy from the Marjolin ulcer and refer to a dermatologist. WOUNDS A wound is a disruption or damage to the skin. There are four phases involved in wound healing. Some of the factors that impair the wound healing process are older/mature age, poor nutrition, impaired immune system, impaired mobility, stress (affects immune system), diabetes, certain medicines (steroids impair clot formation), pressure loading, cigarette smoking, and secondary bacterial infection ( Table 24.3 ). Categories of Wound Healing Primary healing (primary closure) : Wound is closed within 24 hours by suturing or by application of tissue glue or butterfly strips (so that edges of wounds are well approximated). Causes the least amount of scarring. Secondary intention : Wound is left open with formation of granulation tissue and scarring. Wound heals from the bottom of the wound up. Wound edges are not well approximated. Causes more scarring than primary closure. Tertiary intention (delayed primary closure) : Wounds with heavy contamination or poor vascularity (crush injuries) are best left open to heal by secondary intention (granulation) and wound contraction. Then the wound edges are approximated in 3 to 4 days. Produces more scar tissue. Table 24.3 Phases of Wound Healing Phase Healing Event Hemostasis Constriction of local blood vessels, platelet aggregation, 508426 fibrin (clot) formation Inflammation Macrophages and lymphocytes presence of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and leukotrienes Proliferation Proliferation of basal and epithelial cells Angiogenesis Remodeling Remodeling of collagen, scar formation (cicatrix) High-Risk Wounds That May Warrant Referral Infected wounds (pus, wound is not healing; devitalized tissue, wound becomes hot and swollen) Closed-fist injuries; refer to emergency department (ED) or urgent care clinic Facial wounds with risk of cosmetic damage (e.g., large wound, bites, cartilage injury) Suspected foreign body or embedded object in wound that cannot be removed Injury of a joint capsule; if joint capsule penetrated, joint can become infected Electrical injuries Paint-gun or high-pressure wounds Chemical wounds (especially alkali-related damage) of the eyes or skin Suspected physical or child abuse Wounds with cosmetic concerns (cartilage wounds in the ears, nose); cartilage does not heal; refer to plastic surgeon or ED Infected Wounds Do not suture infected wounds (open longer than 24 hours). Wound will heal by secondary intention. Mild case of cellulitis Without abscess: Antibiotics such as cephalexin (Keflex) 250 mg every 6 hours or 500 mg BID, dicloxacillin (Dynapen) 500 mg every 6 hours \u00d7 10 days. If penicillin allergy, alternatives are azithromycin or clarithromycin (Biaxin). With BID, doxycycline Infection can spread (cellulitis, lymphangitis). For severe cellulitis hospitalize for systemic antibiotics. Closed-Fist Injuries and Bite Wounds Refer closed-fist injuries to the ED or urgent care center. X-ray of the hand to rule out foreign body (i.e., teeth) and fracture. Sometimes ultrasound is used to view foreign bodies that do not show up on x-rays. Test distal pulses, skin color, range of motion (ROM), tendon damage, nerve damage, fracture. Do not suture bite wounds or puncture wounds because of high risk of infection. Antibiotic prophylaxis needed for animal and human bite wounds. First line is amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Augmentin PO BID \u00d7 10 days). Tetanus vaccine if last dose was longer than 5 years prior. Use Tdap vaccine (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis; if never had T DAP ) in patients older than 7 years. 509427 Retained Foreign Bodies Higher risk of infection. If unable to remove, refer to ED. Plain x-ray is first-line imaging test. Ultrasound is used if suspected object or object does not show on x-rays (radiolucent). May not be visible on x-rays: Small glass splinters or particles Splinters, thorns, fish bones Plastics Minor Burns (Superficial and Partial Thickness) Wash area with water and mild soap. Using sterile tongue blade, apply thin layer of 1% silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene) to burned area. Cover burned area with nonstick gauze (e.g., Telfa). Secure with stretch-conforming gauze (e.g., Kerlix). Apply Silvadene once to twice a day until the burn is healed. After skin is healed, consider using Desitin daily for 1 to 2 weeks to protect area from sunlight. Do not expose recently healed burned skin to sunlight (causes hyperpigmentation). Note Silver sulfadiazine is contraindicated if patient has sulfa allergies. Do not apply it to the face (it will stain). If facial burns, use triple antibiotic or Bacitracin ointment. Wound Care During history, ask about mechanism of injury and other details about the incident. Check for allergy to iodine, rubber, latex, lidocaine. If patient has rubber or latex allergy, do not use latex gloves. Use silicone-based disposable gloves. Do not forget tetanus prophylaxis. If last dose was longer than 5 years ago, give T DAP booster. Irrigate wound with normal saline (do not mix with Betadine, hydrogen peroxide, Hibiclens) and/or wash area with mild soap and water. Remove dirt. Assess wound for neurovascular and tendon damage. Check distal pulses. Depending on injury, rule out foreign body. Specific treatment depends on the type of wound and patient characteristics. PRIMARY CARE PRACTICE: PROCEDURES Local Anesthesia There are two types of lidocaine 1% (plain or mixed with epinephrine). Do not use 510428 lidocaine with epinephrine on areas of body at high risk of ischemia (tip of nose, ears, fingertips, toes, penis). Drug : Lidocaine 1% (plain) onset of action is from 2 to 5 minutes. Duration of action is from 30 minutes to 2 hours. Advise patient he or she will feel a burning sensation at the start of the injection; this will disappear. Contraindications to local anesthesia : Do not use if infected injection site, allergy to anesthetic, or devascularized/ischemic tissue damage. Adverse complications : Complications, such as allergic reaction, infection, injecting solution directly into blood vessel, injury to nerves and tendons in the area, are possible. Example of anesthesia use : Wounds that need suturing, incisions (e.g., embedded splinter or paronychia), biopsy, and others. Digital Nerve Block (Fingers) Clean web space on each side of the involved finger with alcohol or Betadine swab and allow to dry. Draw up about 3 mL of plain lidocaine 1% from vial using a 5- to 10-mL syringe with an 18-gauge needle. Then change needle to smaller gauge (25- to 30-gauge, 1\u00bd inches). Place needle in perpendicular position above web space and insert into subcutaneous tissue space. Before injecting, aspirate first to check for placement. If there is no blood, slowly inject the lidocaine into the web space (volar aspect). Inject slowly and use small amounts. If blood is aspirated, withdraw needle slightly and reposition slightly (without removing the needle from the skin). Reposition needle slightly and continue to infiltrate drug into the web space on each side of the injured finger. Instruct patient that it may take 15 minutes for the anesthesia to become effective. Ask patient whether area is numb (test by using tip of needle to test sensation) before suturing. Infiltration Technique Apply Betadine on intact skin around wound. Slowly insert syringe (as directed previously) into subcutaneous layer only and aspirate for blood. Slowly infiltrate the edges of the wound, then withdraw slightly to move it to another area. The amount of lidocaine that is used varies based on the size of the wound and the location. Suturing General Rules Do not suture puncture wounds or human or animal bites. Do not suture heavily contaminated wounds. Lacerations that are more than 12 hours old are at higher risk for infection. Do not suture infected wounds. Do not suture wounds that have been open longer than 24 hours (high bacterial load). 511429 Types of Sutures and Needles Example: Skin laceration is an example of a wound that needs suturing. Use nonabsorbable synthetic suture (i.e., nylon, Prolene). Preferred suture size is from 3 to 0 to 5 to 0 (middle range). Preferred needle type to suture skin is a curved cutting needle. Suture size : The higher the number, the smaller the diameter (the same concept is used for needle size; size range is 0 to 10-0). The smallest diameter suture is 00 (about the size of human hair). It is used to repair small blood vessels. Preferred suture size is from 3 to 0 to 5 to 0 (middle range). Suture Placement Evert the edges of the wound by inserting needle at 90-degree angle (ensures that wound edges are well approximated). Use needle holder to hold needle. Use forceps to grab wound edges. Usually, simple sutures are used on skin lacerations. Each suture is individually tied, then cut (simple interrupted sutures). When cutting suture thread, do not cut too short. Leave a short tail (easier to remove). Nonabsorbable synthetic sutures are preferred for lacerations/wounds of the skin. If suturing scalp of a person with black hair, blue-colored suture thread is easier to visualize (for removal). Suture Removal Most sutures are removed within 7 to 10 days. Sutures on the face are removed within 5 days to minimize scarring. Stitches that are left beyond 10 days may develop scars that resemble a \"railroad track.\" Face: from 5 to 7 days Scalp: from 7 to 10 days Upper extremities: 7 to 10 days Lower extremities: 10 to 14 days Use forceps and lift suture from the skin. Cut it with scissors. Use forceps to grasp the knot and pull the suture gently out of the wound. Skin Biopsy Punch Biopsy Check for history of bleeding disorder and use of drugs that affect bleeding time (aspirin, warfarin). Patients with INR greater than 2.5 should not be biopsied. Check scar history (history of keloids or hypertrophic scarring). Refer to dermatologist for facial biopsies, biopsy of areas with cartilage, suspected melanoma, history of keloid/hypertrophic scarring, bleeding disorder, etc. Ask whether allergic to lidocaine or rubber/latex (use silicone gloves). Procedure \"Prep\" skin site with alcohol wipes and allow to dry. Using a tuberculin syringe, draw lidocaine 1% and epinephrine (do not use with 512430 epinephrine if area is on the nose, ears, fingertips, toes, penis). Inject slowly under the epidermis until a small bleb is formed. The color of the skin over the bleb area becomes paler due to the vasoconstricting effect of epinephrine. Check site for numbness by using the point of the syringe and testing sensation on the bleb area. The skin will become numb within 5 to 10 minutes (lasts about 45-60 minutes). Using a 3-mm skin punch, position instrument at 90 degrees (perpendicular to the skin). Twist the punch instrument gently in a \"drilling\" motion until it has pierced the epidermis (there should be about \u00bd inch of the blade visible on top of the skin). Remove from skin and lift plug gently with forceps (do not crush). Use a scalpel to cut the plug at the base. Immediately place it on the biopsy specimen container. Do not forget to label the specimen cup with the patient's name, location of the biopsy site, and the type of tissue obtained. Cover area with sterile 2 \u00d7 2 gauze with tape (if bleeding) or with adhesive bandage if minimal bleeding. Instruct patient to change bandage once a day. Instruct patient to keep the site dry. Instruct to avoid submerging site in water (avoid tub bath, swimming, hot tubs) until it is healed. Site will scab within a few days.

Focus is on alleviation of pain and improving quality of life. Emphasis is on palliative care (not curative care). Palliative Care Palliative care is what hospice care is all about. The main goal of palliative care is to help improve the patient's quality of life. Pain management is an important aspect of this health model. Home-Based Residential Care The majority of hospice care programs are home based. Patients reside and are cared for in their homes. Some hospice groups have specialized inpatient units that are in local hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, and skilled nursing facilities. Respite Care Provides a rest period for the primary caregiver. The patient is cared for by another caregiver for varying periods of time that can span several hours or days. Although agency availability and services differ from place to place, respite care can also be facilitated by moving the patient from his or her home to a hospice unit for a short period of time. Hospice Admission Criteria Physician must write an order for hospice care (also must sign the death certificate). Physician certifies that patient has a life expectancy of less than 6 months. 515434 Patient gives consent to be admitted to a hospice program. In addition, the patient agrees not to use life-sustaining equipment if a life-threatening event occurs during the hospice time period. Depending on the insurance benefits, patients who need physical, occupational, or speech therapy for palliative purposes are allowed to continue in hospice. Notes Patients enter hospice care voluntarily and may elect to stop the services at any time. If a terminal patient's family wants the patient admitted to hospice, but the patient is not willing, then the patient does not meet hospice admission criteria. If a patient lives longer than 6 months, hospice care can be extended through a recertification process as long as the physician deems that the patient remains terminally ill and has a life expectancy of 6 months or less. Examples of Terminal Conditions Metastatic cancers (e.g., lung cancer, colon cancer) End-stage lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) End-stage heart disease (e.g., congestive heart failure [CHF] class III or IV) End-stage liver disease HIV/AIDS with comorbidities and refusal/discontinuation of antiretrovirals End-stage renal disease with future discontinuation of dialysis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, coma End-stage dementia (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) Hospice Consultation Timing Many individuals are unaware of hospice benefit coverage, and the service is grossly underutilized. The average hospice length of stay is just 25 days and when questioned about hospice services, patients and family members often comment that \"I wish I had done it sooner.\" The availability of hospice may be best discussed earlier to afford better symptomatic care, pain relief, and emotional care and support. Clarifying misunderstandings about hospice is important because patients and family members may equate hospice with the cessation of all care, and that is not true. When a patient expresses readiness to accept a hospice-qualifying diagnosis and the circumstances (pain, debility, inability to care for self, inability of family to meet the patient's needs, emotional distress that impacts the patient's quality of life, etc.) suggest hospice, arranging for an evaluation is key. Hospice Team The hospice team consists of the attending physician, hospice physician, registered nurse, 516435 home health aides, social worker/grief counselor, and clergy. Registered nurse (primary case manager): Coordination of care; visits patient regularly (from daily to weekly). Home health aides: Assist patient with personal care, food shopping and preparation, driving patients to go shopping, appointments, others. Hospice physician: Concerned mainly with pain management and management of acute new complications such as a pressure injury or urinary retention requiring catheterization. In some instances, the hospice physician assumes all care management. Primary attending physician/clinician: Involved with continuation and follow-up of medications and preexisting health conditions. Social worker: Performs grief counseling and deals with emotional issues, respite care arrangements, coordinating equipment and needed supplies in conjunction with the registered nurse. Clergy/priest: Involvement depends on patient's religious affiliation and desire for consultation. Physical and occupational therapy may also be provided if needed for comfort and not for curative/restorative purposes. Other team members may also include pharmacists; volunteers; and alternative and complimentary therapy specialists such as music therapists, massage therapists, pet therapists, and aromatherapy practitioners (although these are not present on all hospice teams). Bereavement Care Both the patient and family members/significant others are offered bereavement care. A therapist specializing in hospice counseling will typically make an initial visit and then regularly offer to see the patient and the family members/significant others for counseling and support based on their preferences. After a patient's death, bereavement care benefits continue for up to 1 year. Specialized support services are also available to address the needs of children impacted by the loss. Reimbursement Considerations Medicare Hospice Benefits Medicare Part A covers hospice care for patients aged 65 years and older, disabled individuals, and those with end-stage renal disease. Must enroll in a Medicare-approved facility. Both the hospice and the patient's attending physician must certify that the patient has less than 6 months to live. In addition, the patient agrees that he or she cannot be on life-sustaining equipment for a condition that occurs during the hospice period. Other Reimbursement Methods Hospice care is also covered by Medicaid, long-term care insurance, and most private health insurance. Even if a patient is without health care coverage, it is important to consider hospice if the patient meets the criteria. Some hospice organizations have funding sources to provide care for uninsured individuals, and it is important to be aware of the hospice resources and available programs in the area in which you practice. 517436 FIVE STAGES OF GRIEF AND DYING According to Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross ( On Death and Dying [1969]), not all steps of grief and emotions on dying are experienced by all patients or in the same order. The emotions expressed in dying patients usually progress in the following stages: 1. Denial and isolation (\"It must be a mistake. I feel great and take good care of myself.\") 2. Anger (\"It's not fair. Why me?\") 3. Bargaining (\"I will do anything to stay alive and see my child graduate from high school.\") 4. Depression (\"Why bother quitting smoking? I'm going to die anyway.\") 5. Acceptance (\"I'm now at peace with dying and have my affairs in order.\") EXAM TIPS A terminally ill patient who is eligible for hospice admission but who is emotionally not ready for it and refuses hospice (even if family wants it) does not meet criteria for hospice admission. Hospice is covered under Medicare Part A even though the majority of hospice care takes place in patient's homes. Identify stages of dying/grieving according to the K\u00fcbler-Ross theory. CLINICAL PEARLS Discuss the availability of hospice services as soon as possible and appropriate after a terminal qualifying diagnosis has been made. Clearly differentiate between curative and palliative care, and emphasize that hospice care does not mean that all care for the patient stops. Discuss advanced directives with your patients, and encourage them to share copies for inclusion in their medical record. Become familiar with your local hospice providers, the services they offer, and the reimbursement/funding specifics available to your patients needing services. 518437 26 Gerontology and Long-Term Care ADVANCED PRACTICE IN GERONTOLOGY Nurses who specialize in working with the aged prefer the broad term of gerontology over geriatrics . American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) Adult- Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Age Groups Adolescents (12-17 years) Adults (18-64 years) Older adults (age 65 years and older) American Academy of Nurse Practitioners Certification Board (AANPCB) Adult-Gerontology Nurse Practitioner (AGNP) Age Groups Adolescents (onset of puberty) Adults (21-64 years) Elderly (65 years and older) Older adults: Age classification: Young-old (65-74 years) Middle-old (75-84 years) Oldest-old years and older) CARING FOR AN AGING POPULATION: 519438 DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL ISSUES Persons Older Than 65 Years Health care for elders accounts for one third of physician resources and one quarter of medication use in the United States. As more people live longer, it is expected that more people in their 50s and 60s will be faced with taking care of older parents aged 85 years or older with multiple chronic illnesses or disability. Demographic Information Older Adult Population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015) Aged 65 years or older: 46 million people Projected increase by 2030: 71.5 million (20% of population) Aged 85 years or older (the \"oldest-old\"): The most rapidly growing segment of the elderly age group Projected increase by 2030: 9.6 million (up to 19 million by 2050) Leading Causes of Death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2015; U.S. Census Bureau, 2015) 1. Heart disease 2. Cancer 3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 4. Unintentional injuries 5. Stroke Life Expectancy Average life span both genders: 78.8 years (CDC, 2015; U.S. Census Bureau, 2015) At age 65 years, the average American can expect to live another 19.3 years Average life expectancy: Women: 81.2 years Men: 76.3 years Elderly women outnumber elderly men. Elderly women are much more likely than men to live alone. Although most elderly men are married, most elderly women are not. By the age of 65, women are expected to live another 20.5 years (males will live another 18 years). By the age of 85 (or older), there are 49 men for every 100 women. Ageism \"Ageism\" is the belief in negative societal stereotypes about aging. Avoid the following actions when speaking with an older/elderly adult: Speaking in a loud voice (assumption of hearing loss) Speaking slowly (assumption of decreased mental capacity) Using terms such as \"sweetie\" or \"granny\" or \"old guy\" 520439 Need for Personal Assistance With increasing age, the need for personal assistance increases with everyday activities. Age 85 years or older: 50% Age 80 to 84 years: 31% Age 75 to 79 years: 20% Age 70 to 74 years: 11% Age 65 to 69 years: 9% GERONTOLOGICAL NURSING Timeline Highlights 1981: American Nurses Association (ANA) Division of Gerontological Nursing first published the scope of practice for the specialty (revised in 1987). 1987: Scope of practice of gerontological nursing revised. 1998: ANA offers certification for geriatric nurse practitioners (NPs) and gerontologic clinical nurse specialists. 2008: The new specialty called the \"adult-gerontologic\" nurse is introduced to replace \"gerontologic\" nursing programs by 2015, per the Consensus expert panel (40 organizations). First group to take the new certification exam was the December 2012 graduates from AGNP programs. According to the ANCC (2012), the model is designed \"to align the inter-relationships among licensure, accreditation, certification, and education to create a more uniform practice across the country.\" Gerontology Nurse Practitioner A specialty area in advanced practice nursing that focuses on the aged (healthy and ill). May function in a variety of settings such as in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), long-term care facilities (LTCFs), and hospices, as well as in homes, academia, and communities. The gerontological NP (GNP) and adult NP (APN) roles were combined into \"adult- gerontology\" by the National Consensus Model for APRN Regulation in 2008. Educational programs for the ANP and the GNP were completely phased out in 2015. NPs who are already certified in these two separate specialties will continue with their certifications (ANP or GNP). Certification can be renewed every 5 years by continuing education and clinical practice hours. Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner This is a new specialty of APRN that focuses on the population from adolescence until death. Practice settings include those mentioned earlier plus private clinics, public health facilities, urgent care facilities, internal medicine clinics, college health clinics, and others. The roles of the adult-gerontology primary care nurse practitioners (AGPCNPs) are many (nurse, health care provider, patient advocate, teacher, consultant, case manager). The new advanced practice nursing specialty is the result of the national Consensus 521440 Model for APRN Regulation: Licensure, Accreditation, Certification, and Education, which was finalized in 2008. The model was fully implemented in 2015. The AACN published the Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Competencies in March 2010. New Regulatory Model Advanced practice nurses have six population foci: Entire life span (family NP) Adult-gerontology Neonatal Pediatrics Women's health Psychiatric/mental health Educational Requirements A minimum of a master's degree level of education is mandatory. The AACN endorsed the Position Statement on the Practice Doctorate in Nursing, which called for moving the current level of preparation necessary for advanced nursing practice from the master's degree to the doctorate (doctor of nursing practice) by the year 2015. The master of science in nursing degree remains an option for educating advanced practice nurses as of 2017. Professional Specialties in Gerontology/Geriatrics Geriatrics : Broad term associated with the \"medical care\" of the aged; a specialty of medicine Gerontology : Broad term relating to health care of the aged; by definition, the study of aging and the problems of the elderly. This is the term preferred by nurses. Geropsychology : Branch of psychology that focuses on the psychology and mental health of the aged. Psychologists have either a doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree or a doctor of psychology (PsyD) degree. Social gerontology : Focus is on the social aspects of aging. Degree in social work, sociology, or other fields needed. Adult-gerontology primary care nurse practitioner (AGPCNP): See preceding section. Gerontology nurse practitioner (GNP): See preceding section. ORGANIZATIONS FOR AGING AND OLDER ADULTS * Administration on Aging (AoA) The AoA is the principal agency of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) designated to carry out the provisions of the Older Americans Act of 1965. The Act also empowers the federal government to distribute funds to the states for supportive 522441 services for individuals older than the age of 60. Its mission is \"to develop a comprehensive, coordinated, and cost-effective system of home and community-based services that helps elderly individuals maintain their health and independence in their homes and communities\" ( AoA.gov ). American Bar Association (ABA) Commission on Law and Aging A 15-member interdisciplinary organization that operates under the ABA. Its members are experts (social services, law, academics, advocates, health professionals, advocates) whose mission is \"to strengthen and secure the legal rights, dignity, autonomy, quality of life, and quality care of elders\" ( AoA.gov ). Adult Protective Services (APS) Administered by each state. Provides services to \"insure the safety and well-being of elders and adults with disabilities who are in danger of being mistreated or neglected\" ( AoA.gov ). APS caseworkers are usually the \"first responders\" in many states on reports of elder abuse, exploitation, and/or neglect. Alzheimer's Association A voluntary health organization whose mission is to \"eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research\" and to help enhance the lives of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA) A nongovernmental group that represents not-for-profit nursing homes, continuing care retirement communities, assisted-living facilities, and other health care facilities for the aged. AARP A nongovernmental organization of retired persons aged 50 years or older in the United States. Based in Washington, DC. One of the most powerful lobbying and advocacy groups for older persons. Offers services and discounts for members such as Medicare supplemental and Medigap health insurance, prescription drug discounts, travel/car discounts, life insurance discounts. Founded in 1958 by Ethel Percy Andrus, PhD. American Geriatrics Society (AGS) A nonprofit organization for health professionals (multidisciplinary) who are involved in the field of geriatrics. Its goal is to improve elderly people's quality of life, health, and 523independence. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) A federal agency responsible for the Medicare and Medicaid programs. John A. Hartford Foundation Institute for Geriatric Nursing A not-for-profit charitable foundation that funds educational programs and research grants that address older adult/elderly health care and health care delivery issues. National Center on Elder Abuse (NCEA) An organization under the AoA. Defines a \"vulnerable\" adult as \"a person who is being mistreated or is in danger of mistreatment and who, due to age and/or disability, is unable to protect himself or herself.\" It administers a telephone \"hotline\" for reporting elder abuse, neglect, or exploitation. A locator (by state) is available on the website. The Eldercare Locator phone number is 1-800-677-1116. National Council on Aging (NCOA) A membership organization of professionals whose goal is to help promote the \"dignity, self-determination, well-being, and contributions of older persons\" ( ncoa.org , 2011). Office of Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs Each state has an office of the state long-term care ombudsman. An ombudsman is a person assigned to protect the rights of an individual versus the health care system (e.g., LTCF, hospitals, etc.). If contacted, he or she will investigate complaints and negotiate for an individual. A local ombudsman is either a volunteer or an employed professional who works to enhance the quality of life of residents in long-term care facilities. ELDER ABUSE AND NEGLECT Interventions for Community-Living Adults Adult protective services caseworkers receive and investigate reports of elder abuse. Casework services include obtaining emergency housing, medical care, legal assistance, housing, law enforcement, and other supportive services. Mandatory Reporting There are differences among states regarding mandatory reporting of elder abuse. Each state has its own statute or law about the types of professions that must report abuse. In most states, certain professions are mandated reporters (e.g., social workers, mental health providers, professional nurses, school personnel, nursing home employees). Gunshot 524442 wounds, for example, must be reported to the local police. Sexual assault cases are referred to the ED for evaluation, treatment, and for gathering evidence of the assault. Avoid contaminating possible evidence (avoid washing clothing, sheets). In long-term care settings, document the facts regarding the incident, scene, and possible evidence on the resident's chart. Types of Elder Abuse There are several types of elder abuse: financial abuse, neglect, emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and use of excessive physical restraints. Caregivers who are under high stress are more likely to abuse elders in their care. Respite care is recommended for providers who are stressed. Financial Abuse Clues include withdrawals from an ATM, large withdrawals from a bank account, excessive credit card use, identity theft, checks/documents with signatures that do not match the elder's signature (or checks \"signed\" by an elder who is unable to write or is confused), a stranger who is a \"close friend\" and is managing the patient's finances and assets. Perpetrators may be family members, the person who is designated as the durable power of attorney, a financial conservator, or a construction contractor (home improvement scams). Neglect Neglect is also considered a form of abuse. Signs of neglect include poor hygiene (uncombed/matted hair, dirty, foul smelling), dehydration, or malnutrition. Emotional Abuse Frequent screaming or \"verbal assault,\" threats, intimidation against an elder. Physical Abuse/Assault Unexplained bruises/welts (or with as an outline such as a belt), burns, patches of hair missing from scalp, bites, injuries with incompatible explanations. Sexual Abuse/Assault Bloody or torn undergarments, purulent and/or blood-tinged vaginal discharge, onset of new sexually transmitted diseases. Restrictions Locking elderly persons inside their bedrooms, preventing them from seeing friends, isolating patients, using restraints to limit mobility, and excessive \"drugging\" with psychotropic medications. Issues Specific to Long-Term Care Setting Patient Rights The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 included major reforms and regulations to address abuses in nursing homes. A \"Patient Bill of Rights\" poster must be posted on the 525443 wall in a visible area in health care facilities (e.g., LTCFs, hospitals). The telephone number of the local ombudsman's office is also included in the poster. Patients have the right to: Dignity and privacy Self-determination Review their care plan Be informed when their treatment changes Voice grievances and to communicate freely without fear of reprisal Participate in resident groups and family groups Be free from mistreatment and abuse Restraints A \"resident has the right to be free from any physical or chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat a resident's medical symptoms\" (Medicare Long-Term Care User Manual). A resident who is of sound mind can legally refuse the use of physical restraints (or any type of medical treatment). Type Physical : Vests, belts, wrist restraints, mitts, and ankle restraints State laws and federal law (for Medicare- or Medicaid-certified LTCFs) prohibit the use of physical restraints unless medically necessary. Illegal use of a physical restraint is considered a type of physical assault. Chemical : Excessive and unnecessary use of psychotropic medications (e.g., haloperidol) Adverse Effects Examples of adverse effects from restraints are functional decline, contractures, pressure injuries, urinary incontinence, increased agitation, decreased mobility, decreased self-image, strangulation, and death. Prescribing Physical Restraints Staff should document the interventions done to ensure the patient's safety and the results. If it is determined that physical restraints are medically necessary, a prescription is written. The type of physical restraint device, indication, and directions are written on the prescription. Document the patient's response and condition (vital signs, behaviors) while on restraints. Check the patient's extremities for pulse and the skin for cyanosis regularly if on wrist and/or ankle restraints. Check the restraints for proper placement. The resident must be released at least every 2 hours (or repositioned if bedridden). Check whether patient needs to use the toilet. If incontinent, check incontinence briefs for soiling at least every 2 hours. RESIDENCES AND FACILITIES FOR OLDER ADULTS 526444 All health care facilities must be licensed and regulated by the state (e.g., Department of Health) where the facility is located. Because most accept Medicare and Medicaid, they must also be certified by the CMS and follow federal rules and regulations. Long-Term Care Facilities Also known as \"nursing homes.\" Emphasis is on 24-hour custodial care. Custodial care is nonmedical care of people with chronic illnesses or disability (e.g., helping people with bathing, grooming, or other activities of daily living [ADL], or shopping, finances, or other instrumental activities of daily living [IADL]). The majority of patients with moderate to severe dementia are taken care of in nursing homes. The typical nursing home resident is a female with multiple impairments in ADL (more than three ADL) who is 80 years of age or older. By the year 2020, 12 million Americans will need long-term care in nursing homes. Falls are the leading cause of injuries and death of older Americans (CDC, 2016). The most common cause of death from infection in nursing home residents is pneumonia. The other common causes of death are heart disease, pulmonary embolism, cachexia/malnutrition, and dehydration. Skilled Nursing Facilities Skilled nursing facilities provide transitional care (after hospital discharge), rehabilitation (physical and/or occupational therapy), and skilled nursing and medical care. Age group is not limited to older adults. Examples of patient groups are those who need chronic skilled nursing care such as those in a coma, with spinal cord injuries, or on chronic respiratory ventilators. Assisted-Living Facilities Facilities for older adults who may need minimal assistance with ADL and/or IADL. Usually provide nursing home aides to assist residents. Residents are alert (not for dementia patients). Group Homes Residents live with others in a residential type of setting. Usually privately owned. Age groups may vary. Green Houses These consist of homelike dwellings that accommodate from eight to 10 older adult residents. The Green House model was created by geriatric specialist Dr. William Thomas in 2004 and is an \"alternative to traditional long-term care facilities\" (Mauk, 2009). Independent Living Retirement Communities 527445 Also known as \"independent living\" or \"retirement communities.\" The residents are aged 55 years (and older) and require minimal to no help with daily activities. Housing ranges from freestanding homes to apartments and condominiums. The campus usually has health clubs, golf courses, planned activities, restaurants, and transportation. Requires a large entry fee ($40,000-$400,000) plus monthly fees. Continuing Care Retirement Communities Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) offer a spectrum of care in one setting. Resident packages range from completely independent (independent living) assisted-living facilities to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), which are all located in one community. For example, if an independent resident falls and fractures a hip, the resident can be moved (temporarily) to the SNF for skilled nursing care and rehabilitation. When the resident recovers, he or she can move back to the independent living campus. An advantage is that only one entrance fee is required (plus the monthly fees). Subsidized Senior Housing The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) subsidizes senior housing complexes for low-income seniors. There is a high demand for this program and waiting lists can extend for several years. Therefore, early planning is important. ADULT CARE SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY Adult Day Care Community-dwelling older adults who need constant supervision can be enrolled in adult day care. Home Health Care Care is delivered in a home setting. Higher skilled care given by RNs or licensed practical nurses (LPNs). ADL and IADL assistance is given by certified nursing assistants (CNAs). May be temporary or permanent (\"medical home\"). Respite Care (for Health Caregivers Only) Most older adults (70%) are taken care of in private homes (not in nursing homes) by family members. There is usually one primary caregiver (family member or friend). Respite care provides short-term \"relief\" or a break for the long-term primary health caregiver (usually a family member). Ranges from a few hours to a few days. An alternate caregiver (nurse or aide) is hired to care for the patient temporarily. PAYMENT METHODS 528446 Reimbursement Terms Accelerated death benefit : Type of life insurance policy benefit that allows an insured person to use some of the policy's death benefit prior to death. For example, it can be used to pay for long-term care. Assignment of benefits : Person with a long-term care insurance policy can assign his or her benefits to be paid directly to the providers of care (e.g., nursing home) instead of receiving the payment directly. Authorized representative or representative payee : Person (usually a lawyer) who is chosen by an older adult who has Social Security benefits to represent him or her in any business with the Social Security Administration. Benefit maximum : Refers to a limit on a covered benefit. A service or supply may be limited by dollar amount, duration, or number of visits. An example of a benefit maximum is that well-woman exams are typically limited to one per calendar year. Another example is that an insurance company may only allow a set amount of reimbursement for a surgery such as a hysterectomy. Benefit period : Medicare's hospitalization insurance has a limit (time period) of 60 consecutive days after discharge from a hospital or SNF before a new benefit period starts. There is a set number of benefit periods that a person can have. Certificate of need (CON) : Hospital (or \"builder\") must prove that there is a need for more hospital beds (or a new hospital, SNF) in the local area before it can receive a certificate of need and build a new hospital. Conservatorship : A legal term indicating that if a person is deemed by the court to be incapable of managing his or her property (due to dementia, in jail, chronic drug abuse, underage), the property can be managed by others (e.g., bank, lawyer). The conservator manages the finances and pays for the person's support and allowance. Co-pay (co-payment) : A flat fee that is paid on the spot for each doctor visit or when filling out a prescription. Deductible : Yearly amount that is required by an insurance carrier (Medicare, health insurance) that is the patient's responsibility. After the deductible is met, the insurer pays for future costs. Out-of-pocket expenses : Refers to costs that are not reimbursed by a health insurance provider. These include deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments for covered expenses plus all costs that are not covered by the insurance plan. Third-party administrator (TPA): Organization that processes health care claims without bearing any insurance risk. Forms of Payment Personal Resources and Assets Most people who enter nursing homes or other facilities begin by paying for their care out- of-pocket (cash, bank accounts, stocks, assets). When the patient runs out of money, he or she becomes eligible for Medicaid. Other Sources Veterans benefits (armed services) 529447 Long-term care insurance/policy (cheaper if bought at younger ages) Life insurance settlement (life insurance value is converted into cash) Reverse mortgages (value of home is converted into cash/mortgage) Government Programs Medicare Medicare is a federal health insurance program that is administered by the CMS. Medicare is a fee-for-service program. Payment is collected through monthly payroll deductions (Social Security taxes). Medicare does not pay for \"custodial care\" (e.g., nursing homes). Custodial care is nonskilled, nonmedical care that involves helping people perform ADL such as grooming, dressing, or using the bathroom. (Medicare Part B will pay for skilled nursing care in nursing homes that is medically necessary.) Additional discussion of Medicare appears in Chapter 30 . There are now four parts to Medicare. Medicare Part A Pays for inpatient health services. Automatic at age of 65 years, but if a person never paid Medicare taxes (e.g., housewife), then he or she is not eligible for Medicare. Best to enroll a few months before the 65th birthday. Medicare Part B Pays for outpatient care. Must pay a monthly premium. Must enroll during the \"open enrollment period.\" Pays for outpatient care such as doctor visits, laboratory tests, outpatient procedures, and medically necessary durable medical equipment (DME) such as wheelchairs and oxygen. DME must be \"prescribed\" (written prescription). Medicare Advantage Plans Also known as \"Medicare Advantage.\" Not a separate benefit, but it allows private insurance companies to provide Medicare benefits. Voluntary. Person must enroll. Allows person to receive health care services through a provider organization such as an HMO. This type of coverage will pay for both inpatient and outpatient health services and prescription drugs (has formulary or list of drugs that are covered). Formerly called \"Medicare + Choice.\" Medicare Part D Prescription drug coverage. Voluntary. Must enroll and pay monthly premiums. Person must enroll in an approved plan. Medicare Supplemental Insurance (\"Medigap\") Covers \"gaps\" in coverage (e.g., prescription drugs) of original Medicare Part B plan. Extra health insurance sold by private insurance companies or may be partially funded by employers or unions as a benefit. Must enroll and pay a monthly premium. Medicaid 530A federal and state program that pays for health care services for people, including children, with low incomes and limited assets. Will pay for nursing home care. The largest group supported by Medicaid is dependent children of low-income persons. Eligibility and coverage vary by state. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) The VHA is the United States' largest integrated health care system. Individuals who served in the military services (currently or who are retired) and other branches (National Guard, Reserves) may be eligible for VHA benefits. Legal Terms Living will : Lets a person state his or her wishes about his or her medical care in the event that he or she is in a persistent vegetative state or has a terminal condition. It goes into effect when the physician determines that the person has one of these conditions and can no longer make his or her own health care decisions. Power of attorney (or durable power of attorney) for health care : Legal document (advanced directive) that allows a person to name a competent adult to make decisions about his or her future medical care (including life-prolonging procedures) if he or she becomes incapacitated (physically and/or mentally). The designated person is called the \"health care proxy\" or \"health care surrogate.\" This goes into effect when the doctor has determined that the person is physically or mentally incapacitated. To make the document legal, it must be signed in the presence of two adult witnesses who must also sign the document (the designated surrogate cannot act as a witness). Power is only for health care decisions (not financial assets). Power of attorney (broad) : Legal document that designates a person (picked by the resident/patient) to act on the patient's behalf to make all decisions in the event that the patient is incapacitated (physical and/or mental). Involves all aspects of the resident's/patient's life (health care, finances, assets). INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMS: GERIATRIC SETTINGS Types of Clinical Teams Multidisciplinary Team Composed of members from different disciplines/specialties. The team meets regularly to discuss the residents' care plan. Each team member develops a treatment plan independently from each other. For example, the physical therapist writes a treatment plan that addresses the patient's exercise goals, and the dietician writes a goal of helping the patient to gain weight. Each member (depending on the specialty) conducts an individual assessment. A case manager whose role is to coordinate the patient's care and avoid duplication of services may be involved. Intradisciplinary Team Composed of team members who are from the same specialty or discipline area, but are at 531448 different levels of educational training. For example, a team composed of an NP, RN, and LPN. The term may be confused with multidisciplinary team . Geriatric Assessment Interdisciplinary Team Composed of several individuals from different disciplines/specialties who work together as a team. The team's goal is to maximize the resident's/patient's health care, continuity of care, and quality of life. A team can be made up of three or more members. Members of the team are those who are involved with the patient's care. Geriatric Team Members and Roles Geriatrician A physician (MD or doctor of osteopathy [DO]) who has a specialty in geriatrics. Specializes in the medical care of the aged. Physician, NP, Physician Assistant (PA) Physicians, NPs, and PAs are responsible for the health care of residents/patients. (In addition, a physician can function as the medical director of the facility.) PAs are under the supervision of a physician. Contact physician, NP, or PA for the following: Admitting new patients (for admission orders) Prescription (or refills) of medication, including over-the-counter (OTC) drugs Prescription for laboratory testing or imaging studies Prescriptions (e.g., medications, physical restraint devices, oxygen, medical equipment) Prescriptions and referral for rehabilitation (physical therapy [PT], occupational therapy [OT], speech therapy) Referrals and consults with physician specialists (e.g., endocrinologist for diabetic patient), hospice Hospitalization/discharge or transfer of the resident/patient Registered Nurse May function as the director of nursing, a supervisor, or as a staff nurse. RNs can supervise and delegate to other RNs, LPNs, and medical assistants. Contact RN for the following: Patient admissions, transfers, and discharge; telephone orders; documentation Medication issues, patient assessment, signs/symptoms of health problems, to contact physician Behavioral issues, incidents (patient falls, etc.) Must file incident report; assesses patient's injury and notifies nursing supervisor Director of Nursing Responsible for entire nursing staff (including medical assistants and nurse's aides). Can hire and fire nursing staff. Contact director of nursing (DON) or assistant DON, and/or nurse supervisor if problems with understaffing, nursing personnel conflicts, or conflict with medical staff. 532449 Licensed Practical Nurses Educated through vocational education schools or in community colleges. LPNs are directed and supervised by RNs. LPNs with special training may administer intravenous solutions with RN supervision (states may differ). Medical Assistant or Nurse's Aide Most are certified and have the designation of CMA (certified medical assistant) or CNA (certified nurse's aide). Educated through vocational education programs. CNAs in LTCFs typically care for many patients. Responsible for basic patient care such as assisting patient with oral intake and walking, toileting, bathing, brushing teeth, and assisting patient with transfers (e.g., from bed to chair). Medical assistants usually are charged with repositioning or turning bedridden patients every 2 hours. Common activities include recording vital signs, oral and food intake, and intake and output. Registered Dietician Contact to evaluate new patients, for consultations, dietary assessment. Physical Therapist Physical therapist will evaluate person's ability to walk and other gross motor skills. He or she will make recommendations on type of rehabilitation, frequency, and duration. Occupational Therapist Focus is more on hands/fine motor-related disabilities. Occupational therapist will evaluate patient and make recommendations. For example, stroke patients can be trained to feed themselves. Therapist may make recommendations on type of assistive equipment (nonslip pad for dishes, forks/spoons with special handles). Speech Therapist Focus is on teaching and training patients with speech problems. Nursing Home Activity Director Organizes activities (arts and crafts, music, reading, bingo night, parties) to engage residents and encourage socialization. Priest Contact local priest if Catholic patient requests the \"last rites\" (prayer of the sick). Minister/Pastor Other Christians may request a minister for prayers. Social Worker Has a master's in social work (MSW) degree. Functions as mental health therapist or caseworker. Casework involves knowledge of local and federal assistance, social programs, local community resources, legal resources, financial resources such as Medicaid/Medicare, and others. Social worker assists low-income patients by helping them find local social agencies. 533450 Psychologist May specialize in gerontology (geropsychology). Psychologist cannot prescribe medications. May function as a consultant or a mental health therapist. Psychiatrist or Gerontologic NP or AGNP or Psychiatric NP May specialize in gerontology or mental health. This clinician typically writes prescriptions and refills psychotropic medications. Neurologist Refers patient for dementia evaluation and testing, seizures, and other neurological disease. Pharmacist Responsible for filling prescriptions and refills; may be consulted about potential drug interactions. The pharmacist may notify the prescriber of potential problems with the prescribed medications. Geriatric Interdisciplinary Team Training Program The Geriatric Interdisciplinary Team Training (GITT) program was developed with the John A. Hartford Foundation. Its goal is to provide training and educational materials for geriatric interdisciplinary team training. The Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing * has a web-based course that includes the GITT implementation manual, curriculum guide, and case studies/videos that portray simulated team meetings. Live GITT training programs are also available. Phases of Team Formation (GITT Program) Forming : Creation of a group. Conflict is not discussed at this stage. Norming : Appointment of a leader. Establish common goals and ground rules. Conflicts may become evident, but are not addressed yet. Confronting or storming : Conflicts can no longer be avoided. Increased conflicts over leadership. Performing : Productivity and problem solving are emphasized. Meeting attendance is regular/consistent. Leaving : Team may break up. Individuals or some members may withdraw. Ineffective Team Behaviors Interrupting another team member while speaking Starting a meeting late, lack of an agenda Sarcasm and lack of respect Lack of effective leadership, unresolved team conflict Lack of clarity about members' roles on the team Use of beepers, cell phones, snacking during the meeting Long breaks for \"coffee and donuts\" (delay and extend meeting times) Recommendations to Minimize Ineffective Behavior Practice good leadership skills: Leader facilitates meeting, refocuses group (as necessary), 534uses collaborative language. Team members are clear about their roles and responsibilities. Conflicts between members are addressed directly. Team members respect each other. Members avoid interrupting while others are speaking. Follow-up meetings are scheduled as necessary. __________ * For a full list of organizations for the elderly, go to www.aoa.gov . * Hartford Institute of Geriatric Nursing, New York University Rory Myers College of Nursing. 535451 27 Culture and Spiritually Related Health Beliefs CULTURE AND NURSING Culturally competent care improves patient satisfaction and patient safety (e.g., by reducing medication-related errors). To provide culturally competent care, the advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) must develop knowledge, skills, and positive attitudes about diverse cultures and work individually and within the health care system to promote care that is respectful of all cultures. If a cultural practice has an adverse effect on a patient's health, then the nurse practitioner (NP) needs to explain to the patient in a sensitive manner the reason for not following the practice. Example : A female patient tells the NP that her shaman/ curandero \"told me not to take my medicine, but to drink herbal tea instead\" or \"he told me not to drink water for 2 days.\" The NP respectfully explains to the patient why the practice is harmful to her health. Leininger's Theory of Cultural Care Diversity and Universality Madeleine Leininger is recognized as the founder of transcultural nursing and credited with the construct of \"culturally congruent care.\" This theory defines culture as \"the specific pattern of behavior that distinguishes any society from others and gives meaning to human expressions of care\" (Leininger, 2014). Leininger's Sunrise model is likely the most frequently used to frame culturally competent nursing care and research. The Sunrise model recognizes that care is influenced by many cultural features (i.e., technology, religiosity or spirituality, kinship and social structures, cultural values and beliefs and practices, legal and political systems, economics, and education), all of which shape one's worldview. 536452 CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL AWARENESS This is defined as \"being knowledgeable about one's own thoughts, feelings, and sensations, as well as the ability to reflect on how these can affect one's interactions with other\" (Giger et al., 2007). The following cultural and religious descriptions are generalizations and oversimplifications based on traditional requirements of certain cultures and religion. Consult with the patient and family to understand their unique interpretations and practices. African Americans African Americans often use religious coping\u2014typically Christian (e.g., prayer, gospel music, Bible reading, engagement with faith community). Christian pastors and preachers are held in high esteem. Church congregations and religion may be important sources of emotional and tangible support. Some patients may feel that their illness is caused by lack of faith or by sin. Many families have a female head of household (matriarchal). Latinos/Hispanics Latino families have a strong matriarchal element, and the mother is an important source of strength and solace in times of illness. People from various Latino cultures may consult folk healers. \"Susto\" is a cultural illness ( susto means \"fright\"). Mal ojo (or mal de ojo ), the \"evil eye,\" is a folk illness (usually of a baby/child). It is caused by an adult who stares with envy at the child. (This is similar to the belief in an \"evil eye\" among some Muslim and Mediterranean cultures.) The hex can be broken if the person staring at the child touches the child. Another way to break the hex is to pass an egg over the child (with prayers) and then place the egg under the bed overnight. In general, Hispanic families enjoy public affection. Extended family are treated like immediate family. Multigenerational households are common. Native Americans There are 562 federally recognized Indian Nations (also known as tribes, villages, bands, pueblos, rancherias, or communities) and Alaskan Native tribes in the United States (National Congress of American Indians, n.d.). These many and varied groups have differing cultural practices and beliefs, but most traditionally view illness as \"punishment\" by the spirits for wrongful actions. Healing is done by \"shamans\" using prayers, dance, fasting, smudging, and sometimes ingesting hallucinogenic plants (peyote). Smudging is the ritualistic burning of an herb (with prayer) to help cleanse a person or place. Some groups use medicine pouches, tied to the patient by a string, to help cure the illness. Note American Indian and Alaska Native people have lower health status when compared with other Americans. Their life expectancy is 4.4 years less than the 537453 U.S. all-races population. Male life expectancy is 73.7 years, female is 78.1 years (Indian Health Service, 2017). Native Americans die at higher rates than other Americans from chronic liver disease/cirrhosis, diabetes, accidents, assault/homicide, self-harm/suicide, and chronic lower respiratory disease. About 16% of persons (all ages) are considered in fair or poor health. The leading cause of death is heart disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017). Among men and women aged 18 years or older, about 20% are smokers. Native American women have the highest rates of rape and assault in the United States. They are 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual assault and rape compared with other ethnic groups in the United States (Gilpin, 2016). The Indian Health Service, a federal agency, is charged with delivery of health care to this population. Asians East Asians (Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Korean, Japanese) highly value college education and have high regard (respect) for doctors. Listening quietly without questioning is considered a sign of respect. Some think that asking questions (or disagreeing) with the treatment plan shows lack of respect. Kinship ties are very important. Several generations may live in the same household. Elderly are held in high esteem and their opinion is highly respected. Some Asian cultures have a form of \"ancestor veneration\" practices. In China, the male child is expected to take care of parents when they age. Vietnamese May stop taking prescription medicine when symptoms resolve or may think that only one visit is needed to \"cure\" an illness Often save large quantities of leftover prescription drugs May fear blood tests and surgery because of a belief that blood loss worsens illness May believe that Western medicine will put the body out of balance Buddhists Majority come from Asia (Cambodia, Thailand, Bhutan, Japan, Laos, Vietnam, Taiwan, Tibet, etc.) Main deity is Buddha; they believe that physical suffering is an inevitable part of life and believe in karma (\"good deeds\" create happiness and \"bad deeds\" create pain in the future) and the cycle of rebirth (reincarnation); some dying Buddhists may experience anxiety about being reborn into a lower form or less desirable life May be vegetarian May practice regular meditation; Buddhists value clarity of mind and may refuse narcotics or medications that alter consciousness Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Practitioners believe life energy (chi or qi) imbalance or blockage is the cause of disease. 538454 Yin is the female and yang is the male. Believe acupuncture and cupping correct energy imbalance. Cupping will create large round reddened marks or bruises on back (after 24 hours). Coining is when a coin is rubbed vigorously on skin to create welts. Both of these practices may produce lesions that may be misinterpreted as signs of abuse. The NP should question how a child received such lesions before reporting the lesions as abuse. Sikhs Baptized Sikhs (Khalsa) and some others will obey a code of conduct that stipulates one wears five symbols of Sikh identity: uncut hair, a sword, shorts, hair comb, and iron wrist ring. These symbols should not be removed unless negotiated with the patient. Sikhs will not consume meat, alcohol, or stimulants. Adult male Sikhs may wear a large turban-like head covering (usually white color). Most come from southern or Southeast Asia, India, Canada, United Kingdom, and the United States. Hindus Spiritual purity is of prime importance and manifested in removing shoes indoors, sprinkling water around a plate of food to symbolize purification, regular bathing, and cleaning mouth and teeth prior to eating. Food may be selected to enhance inner purity (e.g., no meat [especially beef or pork]). May wear a talisman that should not be cut or removed. Countries with highest percentage of Hindus are Nepal, India, and Mauritius. Muslims In traditional Muslim families, Sharia law (Islamic law) is followed. Modesty is paramount; garments of adolescent females and women should cover arms, legs, and head. A hijab is a head scarf (hides hair, ears, neck) and the burqa or abaya is the full veil/robe that covers the body. The left hand is reserved for bodily functions (considered unclean). Shake the patient's hand by using your right hand. Clinicians of same gender preferred. Some male patients may be uncomfortable receiving health care from a female health provider. An unmarried woman needs her father's permission to see a clinician, and a married woman needs her husband's permission. In addition, women are not allowed to be alone or to visit with men who are not family members. If a woman is seen by a male health provider, her husband or another male family member must be present in the room. The female patient may refuse to undress (examine with the gown on). The Qur'an (Koran) forbids drinking alcohol, eating pork, or eating meat not slaughtered in the \"halal\" manner. The holy month of Ramadan is observed by 30 days of fasting. It is forbidden to eat or drink fluids/water during the daytime, but one can eat or drink from sunset to before sunrise. If possible, schedule oral medications after sunset. Those who are sick may be exempted (pregnant women, physically or mentally ill people). Children are not expected to fast until puberty. Sample Test Question 539455 A 22-year-old Muslim woman is seen for a complaint of recurrent abdominal pain. A female NP gives the patient a paper gown with instructions for disrobing and leaves the room. When the NP returns, the patient is still clothed and refuses to undress. The NP's best action is to: A) Ask the patient whether she prefers to be seen by a male physician B) Tell the patient what to expect and perform a modified physical exam C) Instruct the patient to go to the closest ED for an abdominal sonogram D) Lecture the patient about the importance of performing an abdominal exam without clothing The correct answer is option B. It is an example of cultural awareness by the NP. Jews Orthodox Jews, such as Hasidic Jews, prefer clinicians of the same gender. Male Hasidic Jews may refuse to shake a female clinician's hand. Shabbat (Sabbath) is observed from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday as a holy day that forbids any form of work. Some believe that electricity is a form of work and may stop using light switches or any electronic equipment during Shabbat (may have to turn on the light switch for the patient). Some observant Jews do not drive or use cell phones or other personal electronics at this time. If possible, avoid accessing unnecessary health services on the Sabbath and avoid scheduling follow-up visits or tests on the Sabbath. Jews may keep kosher dietary laws (kashrut; e.g., not mixing meat and dairy products within specified time frame, eating only meaty foods certified as kosher). Families may have two separate kitchens at home: kosher and nonkosher. Each kitchen has its own utensils, pots, and plates (not allowed to mix because the kosher items will become contaminated). Jehovah's Witnesses Jehovah's Witnesses refuse to donate blood, store blood, or accept own blood (autologous transfusion) but accept nonblood plasma expanders and blood components without RBCs (albumin, cryoprecipitate, clotting factors, immunoglobulins). If a blood transfusion is needed to save the life of a child, parents may refuse (may require a court order). Believers do not celebrate civil holidays, birthdays, Christmas, Easter, and others. Health care providers should encourage believers to carry an advanced directive or medical release form that states their convictions; such a card is available from the church. In urban locations, a hospital liaison from the church may be available to support believers with decision making. Seventh-Day Adventists Believers are often vegetarian and abstain from tobacco, alcohol, and caffeinated beverages. Adventists believe the human body is a temple of God that deserves care (healthy lifestyle). They observe Sabbath (sundown Friday to sundown Saturday) as a holy day for rest from work/school and spiritual nurturing. If possible, avoid accessing unnecessary health services on the Sabbath. 540456 Amish/Mennonites (Old Order) Believers do not participate in Medicare or Social Security, or go to war. The individual's community pays for health care (no health insurance). Use of folk practitioners and folk/alternative medicine is common. If surgery or an expensive test is needed, permission from church elders is required. Believers may speak German dialect. They avoid modern technology, such as telephones and electricity, and use horses and buggies for transportation. Large families, traditional roles for women, and agricultural work are characteristic. Amish prefer giving birth (using midwives) and dying at home. These closed communities have higher rates of some genetic diseases such as maple syrup urine disease, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, a type of dwarfism (Ellis-van Creed syndrome), and cystic fibrosis, as well as certain metabolic disorders. Church of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) Mormon churches provide a strong social support network for the ill. The local ward bishop, elders, missionaries, home or visiting teachers, and/or lay people provide spiritual and temporal support. Patients may wear \"temple garments\" under hospital gown or clothing as a symbol of covenant they made in the temple. Treat such undergarments with respect. Other Cultural Groups Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) People Avoid assumptions regarding sexual orientation or gender identity. Facilitate disclosure while remaining respectful of an individual's \"coming out\" process. Recognize and support the patient's family of choice and use gender-neutral language on forms and during history taking (e.g., \"Have you had sex with a male, female, both, or neither?\"). Military Veterans Conditions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury, are prevalent among U.S. veterans. Military personnel are accustomed to self-protect when exposed to certain sounds or experiences (e.g., hide under bed when helicopter is overhead). They are socialized to be stoic about pain or suffering and nonquestioning of authority figures. FACTORS THAT AFFECT HEALTH CARE Health Literacy According to Healthy People 2020 , health literacy is the \"degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions\" (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, n.d.). It affects the person's ability to learn about how to access health care, complete forms, respond to questions, implement recommended treatments, and so forth. It depends on communication and language, existing knowledge about health, 541culture, and numerical ability and skills, as well as the demands of the situation and system within which the individual presents. Language Barriers Even one misunderstood or misspoken word can affect a patient's decision making or implementation of a treatment. Strategies for communication between patients and health care providers who speak different languages include language access services (virtual, telephonic, or in-person interpreters) and handheld documents at point of service that present clinicians with patient information. Untrained staff and family members should not be used for interpretative services. Individualistic and Collectivistic Societies Cultures are often categorized as individualistic or collectivistic . Individualist societies value the individual above the family, organization, or group. In contrast, collectivist societies consider the rights, needs, and wishes of the family or group over those of individuals. Ways these cultural differences may be observed during clinical encounters are presented in Table 27.1 . Table 27.1 Cultural Differences in Health Care Individualistic Society Behaviors: United States, Europe, and Australia Collectivistic Society Behaviors: Asia, Africa, and South America Clinicians expected to tell patient the truth Clinicians not expected to tell patient truth; instead share with family Respect for patient autonomy; patient makes health-related decisions Family shares (and may ultimately make) health-related decisions; consultation with family is pivotal; decisions will likely conform to family wishes Needs of younger generations of a family may take precedence over those of elders (e.g., elders are institutionalized in skilled nursing facilities) Familial piety, or honoring elders by providing the best care possible; against sending elders to long-term care facilities (nursing homes) Differing Interpretations of Illness Medical anthropologist and psychiatrist Arthur Kleinman proposed that the culture-infused \"illness narrative\" is essential for any healing clinician to understand. In other words, things associated with the disease, not the disease itself, are important. Kleinman offered these questions for assessment: What do you think has caused your illness? (Etiology) Why do you think it started when it did? (Onset of symptoms) What do you think your illness does to you? How does it work? (Pathophysiology) How severe is your illness? Will it last a short or long time? (Course of illness) What kind of treatment do you think you need? What results do you hope for? (Treatment) What are the biggest problems your illness has caused you? 542457 458 What do you fear most about your illness? Noncompliance and other problems are usually explained by a discrepancy between the patient's and professional's interpretation of the illness. When the explanatory models for the illness do not align, the clinician must seek to understand and negotiate them as a \"therapeutic ally\" with the patient. EXAM TIPS Muslim woman who refuse to wear a gown can be examined through her clothing (modified or partial physical exam). See the example question. Jehovah's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions (including autologous) but some may accept blood components without RBCs (cryoprecipitate, immunoglobins, etc.). Prolonged direct eye contact with males or strangers is considered rude by some cultures (Asians, female Muslim). Ramadan is a Muslim holiday that lasts for 30 days. Both fluids and food are forbidden from sunrise to sunset. Orthodox Jewish patients may refuse to touch anything powered by electricity (e.g., light switch, call light, electronic pumps, cell phones) from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday (Sabbath). Do not schedule visits during the Sabbath. If you call at this time, observant patients will not answer the phone. CLINICAL PEARLS Each person interprets and implements his or her cultural and religious beliefs and practices uniquely; therefore, the clinician should make no assumptions and assess as needed. Religious practices often influence behavior around birthing, marriage, child- rearing, illness, death, burial, and mourning. 543459 28 Nursing Research Review SOURCES OF DATA Primary Sources (Preferred) In research, primary sources are preferred. They are the original research from which the data came. Primary sources are factual and not subjected to interpretation by others. Secondary Sources Secondary sources are created when the original data (primary data) are interpreted or analyzed by another person (not the original researcher). These are \"second-hand\" accounts. ETHICAL ISSUES IN NURSING RESEARCH Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) An important duty of the IRB is to ensure the rights, safety, and welfare of human research subjects who are participating in research studies in their institution, hospital, or clinic. According to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, IRBs have the authority to approve or reject research proposals that are submitted to their institution or hospital. If an IRB member has a conflict of interest, \"they must absent themselves from deliberation and abstain from voting\" (FDA, 2014). IRB Committee Members The members of the IRB committee are formally designated to review and monitor research that involves human subjects at their institution. The IRB members are individuals who are affiliated with the institution. Therefore physicians, clinicians, or retail pharmacists who are not affiliated with the institution are generally not included in an IRB committee 544460 (unless they are hired as consultants). In addition, experienced staff members, not recent graduates, are preferred. The size of the IRB and the number of members depend on the type of institution. Vulnerable Populations Almost all types of biomedical and behavioral research in the United States require informed consent. Groups considered \"vulnerable populations\" require additional paperwork and consent requirements. The following groups have special protections and have additional informed consent requirements: Infants and children younger than 18 years of age Pregnant women, fetuses Prisoners Persons with mental disabilities Persons who are economically disadvantaged Belmont Report A report that outlines the important ethical principles that should be followed when performing research involving human subjects. The Belmont Report was issued by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (1979). Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment The Tuskegee experiment was an infamous study of 600 African American sharecroppers (1932-1972) in Alabama. The men were all tested for syphilis infection, and those who had positive results were never informed or treated. Because of this study, laws were passed that protect human subjects' rights and mandate informed consent. Informed Consent of Human Subjects Research subjects must be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the research study at any time without adverse consequences or penalty. There are additional requirements for minors and vulnerable subjects. Describe the study. Inform the subject of what he or she is expected to do (e.g., questionnaires, labs). Describe the risk or the discomforts of participating in the study in the present and the future (if applicable). Describe the benefits of participating in the study in the present and the future (if applicable). Discuss the alternatives to the study. Allow enough time for the subject to ask questions. Discuss whether there is any compensation or reward for participation. Discuss how confidentiality and data will be secured to protect the subject's identity. Give the number and/or email address of the contact for the study so that the subject 545461 can contact that person if he or she has any concerns or problems with the study. Minors Any persons who are younger than 18 years of age. Emancipated Minor Criteria Legal court document declaring that the minor is an \"emancipated minor\" Active duty in the U.S. military Legally binding marriage (or divorced from a legally binding marriage) Consent Versus Assent Consent may only be given by individuals who are aged 18 years or older. A minor (who is not emancipated) as young as the age of 7 years up to age 17 years can give assent to participate in a research study but cannot give consent legally. The child should be assured that he or she can withdraw from the study after discussing it with his or her parents. The parent or legal guardian must first consent to the minor's participation in the study. In addition, the researcher needs parental permission to speak with the minor in order to obtain assent (the child signs a separate assent form). RESEARCH-RELATED TERMS Statistical Terms : Also known as the significance level or the \" p- value.\" It is usually set as either p <.05 or p <.01. A significance level of p <.05 means that there is a 5% probability that study results are due to chance. A significance level of p <.01 means that there is only a 1% probability that the study results are due to chance. Therefore, a of p <.01 is \"better\" than an of p <.05. Control group : These are subjects in an experiment who do not receive treatment. N: This letter indicates the total size of the sample. n: This letter indicates the number of subjects in the group. Significance level: Also known as the \" \" or a \"p -value.\" The p -value is usually set at either p <.05 or p <.01. See additional explanation under \" .\" Research Terms Variables Any attribute or characteristic that varies and is measurable. Independent variable: Variable that is being manipulated and is used to influence the dependent variable. In experimental studies, the researcher has control over the independent variable. Dependent variable: This is the result of the manipulation of the independent variable. 546462 Example: Manipulation by researcher (independent variable) allows a response to manipulation that can be observed and measured (dependent variable). Hypothesis An idea (or supposition) that can be tested and refuted. When conducting research, an examiner tests a hypothesis (or several hypotheses). He or she can either accept or refute the hypothesis. Null hypothesis: Null hypothesis (H 0 ): This is the opposite of the hypothesis being studied. Example: If the hypothesis is \"corn plants grow faster when expose to sunlight; the null hypotheses is \"corn plants will not grow faster when exposed to sunlight.\" If the research data meets the set p value ( p <.01), the results are considered significant (not due to random chance) and the null hypothesis can be rejected. But if the null hypotheses cannot be rejected, it means that there is no relationship between the variables and the results are due to chance. Normal Curve A bell-shaped curve Measures of Distribution Mean Also known as the average. Calculated by adding all of the scores together and dividing it by the total number. Example: 5, 5, 5, 10, 10 (35 \u00f7 5 = 7, average is \"7\") Median The number that is in the middle when values are arranged from lowest to highest (chronological order) Example: 1, 3, 4, 5 , 7, 10, 14 (median value is \"5\") Mode The most common value or frequently occurring value in a set of scores Example: 3, 5, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10 (mode is \"7\") Range The difference between the largest and smallest values in a distribution Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 (15 - 2= 13, range is \"13\") RESEARCH DESIGNS Types of Studies Prospective Studies done in the present (to the future). Longitudinal studies are a type of prospective 547463 study. Data are obtained in the present, and then periodically measured in the future. Retrospective Studies done on events that have already occurred (e.g., chart reviews, recall of events). Another name for this study design is \"ex post facto.\" Longitudinal Long-term studies that follow the same group of subjects (or cohort) over many years to observe, measure, and compare the same variables over time. These are observational studies (there is no manipulation or intervention). For example, the Framingham Heart Study has tracked the same research subjects (N = 5,029) from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The goal is to study the development and identify the risk factors that are associated with the development of cerebrovascular disease. Cohort Cohorts are simply groups of individuals that share some common characteristic such as gender, age, job, ethnicity, and so on. Cohort studies are useful for studying the causative factors or risk factors of a disease(s). For example, the Nurses Health Study is a longitudinal cohort study that examined the effects of oral contraceptive use in nurses over the long term. It has been expanded to study the effect of lifestyle choices on health. Cross-Sectional A cross-sectional study compares differences and similarities between two or more groups of people or phenomena and collects data at one point in time. Case Study An in-depth investigation of a single person, group, or phenomena. Descriptive Versus Experimental Studies ( Table 28.1 ) Descriptive In these studies researchers observe and collect pertinent information but do not manipulate or change the environment. Also known as observational studies . Correlational A type of observational study in which the relationship (interrelationships) between at least two variables is evaluated. There are three types of correlations: Positive correlation : Two variables change together in the same direction. For example, when variable A increases, then variable B also increases. Negative correlation : An increase in one variable results in a decrease in the other. For example, when variable A increases, this causes variable B to decrease. No correlation : The variables are not related. For example, a change in variable A does not affect variable B. Experimental An important criterion is the use of random sampling and random assignment of research 548subjects. There is at least one control group and one (or more) intervention or treatment group (manipulation). Causality can be determined (If A + B occur, this will cause C). Quasi-Experimental The design is similar to an experimental study except there is no randomization of the research subjects. Instead, recruitment of subjects is by convenience sample. Deductive Versus Inductive Reasoning Deductive Reasoning Involves going from more general to more specific findings. Also known as \"top-down\" logic. In research, this means starting with a theory (generalization) and then narrowing it down by formulating specific hypotheses (deduction). Quantitative studies use deductive reasoning. Inductive Reasoning The opposite of deductive reasoning. Also known as \"bottom-up\" logic. Involves going from specific findings to generalizations. One starts with specific observations and from these, one may detect a pattern that helps to formulate tentative hypotheses, which may help to generate new theory. Qualitative studies use inductive reasoning. Table 28.1 Qualitative Versus Quantitative Studies Qualitative Quantitative Data Involves words, narratives, subjective opinions Numerical and measurable data Number of subjects Few individuals May involve large numbers of individuals, databases Subject recruitment Small number of subjects, not randomized Randomization possible if experimental design Data gathering In-depth interviews focus groups, observations; audio or video are recorded, data is transcribed Questionnaires, instruments, measurements, surveys Logic Inductive reasoning, specific data can be generalized Deductive reasoning Design May change and evolve to adapt to situation or to subjects Systematic, design is known before research starts Statistical testing Interpretation of common themes and patterns; uses limited statistics such as chi-square Pearson correlation, paired t -test, simple/multiple regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), etc. Notes Researcher is a participant and also an observer (degree of participation varies) Researcher is an objective observer, declares bias (funding sources) EXAM TIPS 549464 Primary data are the preferred source in research (original study that produced the data). Experimental studies use randomization with subject selection. Correlational studies search for relationships between a minimum of two variables. Deductive logic is used with quantitative studies, and inductive logic is used in qualitative studies . Understand the difference between a dependent and an independent variable. Know which groups are considered vulnerable populations. Know the definition of an IRB. The IRB's most important role is to protect the rights of the human subjects enrolled in a study. Know the definition of assent. Assent refers to minors because they legally cannot give consent (unless an emancipated minor). Know the definition of N (total number of subjects) versus n (subgroup). A normal curve is the \"bell curve.\" 550465 29 Evidence-Based Medicine Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is \"the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients\" ( www.cochrane.org ). It is also known as evidence-based practice. There will be several questions on the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) exam that will test your ability to sort and rate articles by the level of evidence. HIERARCHY OF RESEARCH EVIDENCE ( FIGURE 29.1 ) 551466 Figure 29.1 Ranking of research evidence. This image can be found in color in the app. Meta-Analysis This is a statistical method that combines data from multiple studies (systematic review), resulting in higher statistical power and a single conclusion. This method is considered the gold standard for gathering research evidence for EBM. Systematic Review A type of literature review that identifies, selects, and analyzes multiple research articles concerning a health condition, disease, or other health-related practice. Follows specific methodology to identify all the relevant studies on a specific topic. Studies to be included must meet explicit criteria. Studies are ranked from grade A (best evidence) to grade D (poor evidence). After a systematic review is done, the acceptable studies are pooled together and statistical testing of the data (meta-analysis) is performed. Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) Subjects are randomly assigned to either the control group or the treatment group(s). The intervention may be a drug, procedure, or device. Some RCTs use a double-blind design (the intervention is hidden from the patient, clinician, and/or researchers). RCTs are experimental studies. Experimental Study In a nutshell, an experiment involves random subject selection, one placebo or control group, and one or more intervention group(s). An RCT is a type of experimental study. 552467 Cohort Study Cohort studies are a type of research that is used to investigate risk factors for diseases, risk factors for death, and other conditions. The research subjects are observed for a long period. There is no intervention done (not an experiment). The goal is to identify risk factors and associations (not causation) of a disease(s). For example, the Nurses' Health Study is a large cohort study of female RNs aged 30 to 63 years who reside in the state of Massachusetts. A cohort study can be a type of prospective study (present to future). Case Report A detailed report of one patient with a disease or an unusual condition that includes demographics, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, response to treatment, and so forth. Case Series A series of case reports that involves a series of individuals who are given similar treatment. Opinions and Editorials Opinions and editorials can be biased and may not be based on solid evidence. They are the weakest form of evidence. RESEARCH DATABASES Cochrane Reviews The gold standard database and resource for EBM. These are systematic reviews (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews). The organization does not accept commercial or conflicted funding. Also known as the Cochrane Collaboration ( www.cochrane.org ). MEDLINE The U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) premier database contains more than 23 million journal articles in the life sciences with a concentration in biomedicine. These articles are from 5,600 current biomedical journals from the United States and more than 80 foreign countries. PubMed This component of MEDLINE contains over 27 million citations of biomedical, medical, and other life science literature and abstracts. Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) 553The world's largest source of full-text nursing and allied health journals (>1,300 journals). CINAHL Complete provides indexing of more than 4,000 journals. GRADES OF RESEARCH EVIDENCE Research evidence receives a letter grade: A (best evidence), B, C, and D (poor evidence). Well-designed controlled experimental trials (double-blind RCTs) are considered to be grade A (or level 1) evidence. HOW TO SOLVE EBM QUESTIONS (DRAG-AND- DROP FORMAT) 1. What is the \"drag-and-drop\" format in the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) exam? This is one of the new-format questions. On the left side are three research articles/studies (white boxes are shown here, but they will be yellow on the exam). On the right side are three boxes numbered \"1, 2, 3\" (black here, but blue on the exam). You must rate the three articles in terms of evidence from best (1), moderate (2), and worst (3). 2. What is the best way to answer this type of question? The easiest way to answer this type of question is to memorize and understand the highest level of evidence (meta-analysis, systematic review, RCT) and the type of studies that has the lowest level of evidence (opinions, editorials). The leftover study belongs in the middle black box (#2). The first sentence of each article usually gives a clue about the study design. Notice that in option A it is a \"meta-analysis,\" in option B it is a \"specialty society opinion,\" and option C it is an \"experimental study.\" I teach the following method to my review-course students. These are the steps to follow: 1. Identify the article with the strongest level of evidence (#1 ranking). Look for key words such as \"meta-analysis,\" \"RCTs,\" and the Cochrane, MEDLINE, and/or CINAHL databases. 2. Next, look for the research study that has the weakest evidence (#3 ranking). It has key words such as \"expert opinion,\" \"opinion,\" or \"editorial.\" 3. You are left with one article, which you drag to the middle (#2 ranking). Example A A) A meta-analysis using the Cochrane database found 30 RCTs on ginkgo biloba use in patients with early dementia 1. B) Specialty society editorial in a journal regarding the effectiveness of ginkgo 2. 554468 biloba supplementation in dementia C) In an experimental study of 500 patients with early dementia, one group was given placebo, and the other group was given ginkgo biloba daily for 10 months 3. Correct Answer With Key Words: Article A is ranked 1 (key words: meta-analysis, Cochrane database, RCTs ), Article C is ranked 2 (key words: experimental study ), and Article B is ranked 3 (key word: editorial ) Example B A) A case report of a 45-year-old woman with Munchausen syndrome by proxy 1. B) A systematic review of Munchausen syndrome by proxy using MEDLINE and CINAHL found 15 studies 2. B) An opinion paper written by a psychiatrist who is considered an expert of Munchausen syndrome by proxy that includes treatment recommendations 3. Correct Answer With Key Words: Article B is ranked 1(key words: systematic review, MEDLINE, CINAHL ), Article A is ranked 2 (key words: case report ), and Article C is ranked 3 (key words: opinion paper ) STATISTICAL TERMS (EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE) Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) ARR is a measure of the difference between two different treatments in terms of their ability to reduce a particular outcome (i.e., myocardial infarction [MI], stroke). Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) RRR is a measure of how much risk is reduced in the experimental group compared with the control group. Number Needed to Treat (NNT) This is the number of patients you have to treat to avoid one bad outcome (i.e., MI, stroke). For example, an NNT of seven means that it is necessary to treat seven patients to avoid one bad outcome. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) This is the probability that a person with a positive screening test result has the disease. 555469 Negative Predictive Value (NPV) This is the probability that a person with a negative test result does not have the disease. EPIDEMIOLOGY TERMS Active Immunity Refers to immunity to a disease developed either through vaccination or by infection. Passive Immunity Refers to immunity to a disease after receiving antibodies (immunoglobins) from another host. For example, colostrum from breastfeeding gives the neonate antibodies from the mother. Herd Immunity Refers to resistance to a disease in a large number of people in the population, which is usually due to immunization programs. Health This refers to a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. Horizontal Transmission Transmission of an infecting agent from one individual to another. For example, horizontal transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases or infections occurs through sexual intercourse. Vertical Transmission Transmission of an infecting agent from mother to infant. Congenital infections from mother to infant can be passed through vertical transmission. Also, an HIV-positive mother who breastfeeds her infant can infect her infant with HIV through vertical transmission. Endemic This refers to a baseline level of a particular disease in a population. Epidemic Refers to the rapid increase of a disease in a population that involves a large number of people. 556470 Pandemic This is an epidemic that occurs over a very large area (several countries or continents). It involves a large proportion of the global population. Morbidity This refers to an illness or any departure from physical and/or mental health. Mortality Death. Infant Mortality Refers to infant deaths per 100,000 live births. The leading cause of death in an infant's first year of life is congenital malformations (including chromosomal abnormalities). Sensitivity Refers to the ability of a screening test to correctly identify a person with the disease. Specificity Refers to the ability of a screening test to correctly identify a person without the disease. EXAM TIPS Memorize the definition of sensitivity and specificity. Learn how to solve EBM \"drag-and-drop\" format questions (three to four questions). As of fall 2017, only the ANCC exam has this format, although it is possible that the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners Certification Board (AANPCB) may use the question format in future exams. Learn the difference among endemic, epidemic, and pandemic. 557471 30 Ethical Guidelines, Advanced Practice Law, and Reimbursement ETHICAL CONCEPTS Beneficence The obligation to help the patient\u2014to remove harm, prevent harm, and promote good (\"do no harm\"). Acting in the patient's best interest. Compassionate patient care. The core principle in patient advocacy. Examples: Health promotion: Encouraging a patient to stop smoking and enroll in smoking- cessation programs or educating a patient with a new prescription about how to take the medication Personal beneficence: Calling the surgeon to get a prescription for stronger pain medications (a narcotic) for a postsurgical patient who complains of severe pain Nonmaleficence The obligation to avoid harm. Protecting a patient from harm. Example: A middle-aged woman with osteoporosis wants to be treated with bisphosphonates. The nurse practitioner (NP) advises that the patient is not a good candidate for these drugs because of her past medical history of GI bleeding and severe peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Utilitarianism The obligation to act in a way that is useful to or benefits the majority. The outcome of the action is what matters with utilitarianism. It also means to use a resource (e.g., tax money) for the benefit of most. It may resemble justice (see next definition), but it is not the same concept. 558472 Example: The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) are only for pregnant women and children, not other adults and elderly men. The reason may be that it would cost society more if women (and their fetuses), infants, and children were harmed by inadequate food intake (affects the brain growth, etc.). Justice The quality of being fair and acting with a lack of bias. The fair and equitable distribution of societal resources. Example: A homeless alcoholic man without health insurance presents to the ED with abdominal pain. The patient is triaged and treated in the same manner as the other patients who have health insurance. (Although low-income individuals do not pay some types of taxes to the government, they still have equal access to public services that are supported by taxes.) Dignity The quality or state of being worthy of ethical and respectful treatment. Respect for human dignity is an important aspect of medical ethics. A person's religious, personal, and cultural beliefs can influence greatly what a person considers \"dignified\" treatment. Examples: Hospital gowns should be secured correctly so that when patients get up to walk, their backs are not visible. Foley catheter urine bags should not be visible to visitors, and patients should not be embarrassed. Urine bags should be moved to the opposite bed rail so that they not visible to outsiders. Fidelity The obligation to maintain trust in relationships. Dedication and loyalty to one's patients. Keeping one's promise. Example: A woman with terminal breast cancer does not want the NP to reveal her poor prognosis to her mother. If the NP keeps the prognosis in confidence from the patient's mother, she is exercising the concept of fidelity. Confidentiality The obligation to protect the patient's identity, personal information, test results, medical records, conversations, and other health information. This \"right\" is also protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA; which restricts release of patient information). Psychiatric and mental health medical records are protected information and require separate consent. Example : The HIPAA Privacy Rule protects most \"individually identifiable health information\" in any format (oral, paper, electronic). It is known as \"protected health information\" (PHI). The PHI includes demographic information (name, address, date of 559473 birth, Social Security number) as well as the individual's past, present, or future physical/mental health and provision of care. Autonomy The obligation to ensure that mentally competent adult patients have the right to make their own health decisions and express treatment preferences. If the patient is mentally incapacitated (dementia, coma), the designated surrogate's choices are respected. See later discussion on advance health care directives A mentally competent patient can decline or refuse treatment even if his or her adult children disagree. Example: An alert elderly woman who has breast cancer decides to have a lumpectomy after discussing the treatment options with her oncologist. The woman's daughter tells the NP that she does not want her mother to have a mastectomy because she thinks her mother is too old. The NP has a duty to respect the patient's decision. This case is also a good example of the NP acting as a patient advocate. Accountability The obligation to take responsibility for one's own choices and actions, and their consequences, rather than blaming others for mistakes. Example : An NP has an adult male patient with acute bronchitis who complains of acute onset of chest pain. He is diagnosed with pleurisy. The patient goes to the ED and is diagnosed with an acute MI. The NP made an error in diagnosis; she is held accountable for her decision and actions in a court of law. Notes Paternalism describes situations in which one person interferes with or overrules the autonomy of another. In health care, it occurs when a provider makes decisions for a patient because he or she \"believes\" that it is in the patient's best interest. The opinion (or desire) of the patient is minimized or ignored. The patient is \"powerless.\" Example: A 92-year-old man does not want to be on a ventilator if he \"codes.\" The son disagrees and quietly tells the NP and physician that he wants his father to be aggressively treated with life support, if necessary. Veracity The obligation to present information honestly and truthfully. In order for patients to make an informed and rational decision about their health care, pertinent information (including \"bad\" news) should not be withheld or omitted. Example: The mammogram result of a 64-year-old female patient is highly indicative of breast cancer. The patient's son does not want his mother to know about the results. The NP has a duty to discuss the mammogram results with the patient and to refer her to a breast surgeon. 560474 EXAM TIP Become familiar with some of the ethical concepts (e.g., beneficence, veracity, nonmaleficence, justice) and how they are applied (look at the examples). The American Nurses Association (ANA) Code of Ethics for Nurses The new ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements (2015) contains \"the goals, values and ethical precepts that direct the profession of nursing.\" According to the ANA, the Code \"is nonnegotiable.\" Each nurse \"has an obligation to uphold and adhere to the code of ethics.\" For example, under Provision 4.4, \"Nurses may not delegate responsibilities such as assessment and evaluation; they may delegate selected interventions according to state nurse practice acts\" (ANA, 2015). LEGAL TERMS Ombudsman A person who acts as an intermediary (or as a liaison) between the patient and an organization (long-term care facilities or nursing homes, hospitals, governmental agencies, courts). The ombudsman investigates and mediates the complaint from both sides and attempts to reach a fair conclusion. Guardian Ad Litem An individual who is assigned by a court (and has the legal authority) to act in the best interest of the ward. The ward is usually a person who is a child, or someone who is frail or vulnerable. Advance Health Care Directives Living Will A document that contains the patient's instructions and preferences regarding health care if the patient becomes seriously ill or is dying. It contains the patient's preferences (or not) for aggressive life-support measures. Health care providers should have a copy of the document in the patient's chart. Health Care Power of Attorney A document that indicates that if a patient becomes incapacitated (physical and/or mental) in the future, his or her preferences for medical care (including life-prolonging procedures) are listed. Also known as an \"advance directive for medical decisions,\" \"health care proxy,\" \"durable medical of care surrogate.\" The patient designates a 561475 person (family member or a close friend) who has the legal authority to make future health care decisions for the patient in the event that the patient becomes mentally incompetent or incapacitated (i.e., comatose). It goes into effect when the patient's doctor has determined that he or she is physically or mentally unable to communicate in a willful manner. The patient designates a person (family, close friend) to be his or her health care surrogate (or health care proxy). To be legal, the advance directive must be signed in the presence of two adult witnesses who must also sign the document (the designated surrogate cannot act as a witness). Power is only for health care decisions (not financial assets). Power of Attorney A document whereby the patient designates a person (the \"agent\") who has the legal authority to make all decisions for the incapacitated patient. The document should be signed and notarized. Also known as the \"durable power of attorney.\" This role is broader and encompasses not only health care decisions but also other areas of the patient's life, such as those relating to financial affairs. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Also known as the \"HIPAA Privacy Rule\" (or Public Law 104-191). The law was passed by the U.S. Congress and enacted in August 1996. The law provides protections for \"the use and disclosure of individuals' health information\"\u2014called \"protected health information\" by organizations subject to the Privacy Rule, which are called \"covered entities.\" Covered Entities All health care providers, health insurance companies, health care plans, and third-party administrators (TPAs) who electronically transmit health information must follow the HIPAA regulations. What Is a TPA? A TPA is the organization that does the processing of claims and administrative work for another company (health insurer, health plan, retirement plan). HIPAA Requirements (Not Inclusive) Health providers are required to provide each patient with a copy of their office's HIPAA policy (patient to sign the form). The HIPAA form must be reviewed and signed annually by the patient. Patients have the right to review their medical files. A mental health provider has the right to refuse patients' requests to view their psychiatric and mental health records. When patients request to review their medical records, the health provider has up to 30 days to comply. Patients are allowed (under HIPAA) to correct errors in their medical records. Providers must keep identifying information (name, date of birth, address, Social Security number) and any diagnosis/disease or health concerns private except under 562476 certain conditions (see list that follows). When Patient Consent Is Not Required To contact the health plan/insurance company that is paying for the medical care To contact a third party or business associate (e.g., accounting, legal, administrative) that the insurance company or doctor's office hires to assist in payment of their services (e.g., medical billing services) To perform certain health care operations (medical services review, sale of health care plan, audits) To contact a collection agency concerning unpaid bills To report abuse/neglect or domestic violence To consult with other health care providers HIPAA Case Scenarios ( Table 30.1 ) Examples If a staff member (who is not involved in the patient's care) calls the attending NP and wants to discuss a patient's progress, the NP cannot release information to the staff member. How to communicate results of lab tests or procedures? Ask the patient how he or she would like this to be handled. If the patient advises the health care provider to \"leave it on my voice mail\" and gives a phone number, then it is not a HIPAA violation to do so rather than relaying this information directly to the patient. Unless the patient has directed the clinician to leave the results on the voicemail, the clinican cannot assume that the voicemail is private and restricted to that individual (Buppert, 2012). Table 30.1 HIPAA on Patient Care Situation Description Considerations Putting patient charts on door box Place the chart so that the front of the chart is facing the door (so that patient name is hidden). Nonstaff members are in the hallways. Having sign-in sheets on front desk This is allowed if it does not list patient's diagnosis. Attendance list can show names, dates, and time. Calling a patient in the waiting room to go inside the clinic exam room Use only first name. If more than one person with same first name, use the first letter of last name. If you have two patients named \"Ann\" (e.g., Ann Lee and Ann Smith), use Ann L. and Ann S. Leaving messages on voicemail When calling, first provide your name and contact information. Be concise. Limit to 60 seconds. Maximum of three calls per week. When a patient lists a phone number as a contact, it constitutes express consent for telephone calls to be made, subject to certain HIPAA restrictions. Information that can be given may includes appointment reminders, notifications about prescriptions, and preoperative and postoperative instructions. Text messages should be restricted to 160 characters. There is a maximum of one text message per day. Having a colleague who works in same clinic or hospital call, If staff member is not part of the health care team, no patient HIPAA also does not allow such a person to access a friend's or 563477 wanting information about a patient's progress information can be released to that person. family member's records without permission. Having a family member call, wanting information about a patient's progress Put on hold and tell patient about the call. If patient gives permission, you can speak with the family member. If patient does not consent, then advise the family member about the patient's decision. Do not release patient information. Having inappropriate access to health information on the computer Viewing the records of your relatives, friends, or coworkers information is a HIPAA violation. Do not allow someone to use your computer password or leave a computer terminal with the patient's information displayed on the screen (log out first). Using personal devices (smartphones, laptops, tablets) Ideally, it is best to avoid using personal devices at work. Requirements: secure wifi with passwords, regular encrypted backups, antivirus software, policies, etc. If you want to use a personal device, discuss it with your manager and/or consult information technology. Best practice is to use the facility or clinic's devices. Discussing a patient's drugs and other instructions with a health aide who is with the patient Discussing information is allowable. If patient has the capacity to make health care decisions, discussing such information is allowable. Discussing patient's treatment in front of a patient's friend who is visiting. Discussing treatment with the patients' friend is allowable if the patient gives consent or requests that the friend come inside the treatment room. Discussing patient information with others is allowable if patient agrees to it. HIPAA, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Source: HIPAA Journal. FCC Confirms Rules Regarding HIPAA and Patient Telephone Calls (2015). HIPAA, Psychotherapy, and Mental Health Records Psychotherapy records made by a mental health professional are treated differently under HIPAA. They should be separated from the patient's other medical records. A separate consent form is needed to release psychotherapy records. The exceptions are mandatory reporting of abuse and \"duty to warn\" when the patient threatens serious and imminent harm to others. \"In situations where the patient is given an opportunity and does not object, HIPAA allows the provider to share or discuss the patient's mental health information with family members or other persons involved in the patient's care or payment for care\" (HHS, 2017). Minors The health records of a minor (by law, an individual younger than 18 years of age) can be released to parents or legal guardians without the minor's consent. If authorization is needed to release a minor's medical record, the parent or legal guardian must sign for it (except for emancipated minors). Emancipated minors can sign their own legal documents. EXAM TIPS 564Become familiar with how HIPAA is applied in real life. Study the HIPAA case scenarios. Regarding leaving laboratory results on voicemail, it is a HIPAA violation unless the patient has given specific consent such as \"you can leave the lab results on my voicemail at this phone number.\" If not, then call with your name and contact information. A TPA is the organization that does the processing of claims and administrative work for another company (health insurer, health plan, retirement plan). MALPRACTICE INSURANCE The two types of malpractice insurance are claims-based and occurrence-based insurance. Claims-Based Policy This type of malpractice insurance will cover claims only if the incident occurred when the NP paid the premium and only if the NP is still enrolled with the same insurance company at the time the claim is filed in court. The claim will not be covered (in the future) if he or she does not have the same malpractice insurance company as when the lawsuit was filed. Buying \"tail coverage\" can help address this issue. Tail coverage insurance will cover the NP for malpractice claims that may be filed against him or her in the future. When an NP with claims-based malpractice insurance retires or changes jobs, it is advisable to buy tail coverage insurance. Example : An NP who has been retired for 2 years has a claim filed against her for an incident that occurred while she was employed and insured. The NP discontinued her claims-based malpractice insurance when she retired. In this case, the claim will not be covered. But if she bought tail coverage, then it would be covered. Occurrence-Based Policy This type of malpractice policy is not affected by job changes or retirement. If a claim is filed against the NP in the future, it is covered if he or she had an occurrence-based policy at the time the incident occurred. Example: An NP who has been retired for 2 years has a claim filed against her for an incident that occurred while she was employed and insured. Because she carried an occurrence-based policy, the claim will be covered. MALPRACTICE LAWSUITS Plaintiff: The patient or whoever is acting on behalf of the patient (e.g., the patient's representative) who files the lawsuit claiming injury and/or damage by another party Defendant: The party who responds to the lawsuit filed by another party who claims an injury and/or damage (e.g., NP, hospital) 565478 Elements of a Case The plaintiff must prove that all of the following occurred: A duty is owed (a legal duty exists). The duty was breached (e.g., not following standard of care, etc.). The breach caused an injury (proximate cause). Damage occurred. Phases of a Medical Malpractice Trial A lawsuit is filed in the appropriate court. The \"discovery\" phase (requesting of medical records, depositions, expert opinions, etc.) occurs. Plaintiff has the \"burden of proof.\" Court trial phase (or settle out of court or arbitration) occurs. The judgment is given. Either the case is dismissed or damages are awarded (physical harm, emotional/mental harm, etc.). Expert Witnesses Ideally, the NP who will testify as an expert witness should be someone who practices in the same specialty and geographical area as the NP defendant. For example, an NP who practices in Los Angeles, California, may not be the best choice as an expert witness for an NP who is being sued and who is practicing in Miami, Florida. REIMBURSEMENT Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (HR 3299) The first law allowing NPs to be reimbursed directly by Medicare. Prior to this Act, only certified pediatric and family NPs were allowed to be primary providers as long as they practiced in designated \"rural\" areas. Balanced Budget Act of 1997 Together with the Primary Care Health Practitioner Incentive Act, this law broadened Medicare coverage of NP and clinical nurse specialist's services. HIPAA (1996) required health providers to have a National Provider Identifier (NPI) number to bill Medicare and Medicaid. NPs can be reimbursed directly by Medicare Part B, Medicaid, Tricare, and some health insurance plans. Medicare will reimburse NPs at 85% of the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. NPI Number The NPI is a unique 10-digit identification number assigned to health care providers (or to 566479 any entity that bills Medicare/Medicaid). It is issued by the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES). All providers who provide services and bill Medicare must have an NPI. Individual health care providers may obtain only one NPI for themselves. To become a Medicare-approved provider, one must first obtain an NPI number online. An individual provider's NPI identifier lasts for his or her lifetime. The identifier does not change regardless of state, group affiliations, or state. Medicare requires the NPI number for financial transactions. Electronic claims submission is required by Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare uses electronic fund transfer (EFT) to reimburse providers. Medical Coding and Billing Every time an NP bills Medicare, Medicaid, or a health insurance plan, he or she must submit a claim (electronic or paper form). The claim form, or the \"superbill,\" must contain both the International Classification of Diseases , 10 th edition ( ICD-10 ; World Health Organization [WHO], 2016) code(s) or the diagnosis and the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code(s). If a bill is missing the CPT code (or ICD-10 code), then the clinic or hospital will not get paid for the NP's services. If the NP's signature is on the superbill, it is his or her responsibility to make sure that the correct diagnosis ( ICD-10 ) and CPT codes are being used. The services rendered must show medical necessity and the appropriateness of diagnostic and/or therapeutic services that were done. What Is the ICD-10 Code The ICD-10 code is the label used to indicate the patient's diagnosis as determined by the International Classification of Diseases , 10th edition (WHO, 2016). Each disease is assigned a specific ICD-10 code. What Is an ICD-10 \"Z-Code\" (Z00-Z99)? ICD-10 uses Z-codes to indicate the reason for the visit or patient encounter. If a procedure is performed, a corresponding CPT code must accompany each Z-code (to justify the procedure, tests, encounter, etc.). What Is CPT? The CPT is a list of standard alphanumeric identifying codes used to identify procedures (e.g., suturing, incision and drainage) and other medical services. It is maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA). What Are Evaluation and Management Service (E&M) Codes? E&M codes are used to bill for patient visits, and are part of the CPT. If a bill is missing an E&M code, the health care provider will not be reimbursed for the time he or she spent with the patient. E&M codes are based on the history, examination, and medical decision making (complexity) that take place. The provider must document that these three components have been met (or exceeded). The complexity and time spent with the patient are assigned codes by the CPT system. For example, a \"problem-focused\" visit requires documentation of chief complaint with a brief history of present illness (HPI), but it does not require a review of systems (ROS) or a past, family, and/or social history. 567480 \"Incident to\" Billing \"Incident to\" billing is a way to bill Medicare for outpatient services rendered by a nonphysician health provider (NP, physician assistant [PA]) and receive the 100% physician fee. The location of the services can be at the physician's office, a separate or satellite office, an institution, or in the patient's home. During the initial visit, the physician must evaluate the patient (and write a care plan). Follow-up visits by the NP can be billed as \"incident to\" so long as the same health problems are being addressed. The physician's NPI number is used to bill for the service. The \"incident to\" billing is reimbursed at 100% of the physician rate. But if the same patient is seen for a new problem by the NP (or PA), then the visit is billed under the NP's or PA's NPI number (85% of physician fee). HEALTH INSURANCE The Affordable Care Act (ACA; 2010) This national health insurance legislation, officially known the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and unofficially nicknamed Obamacare, was enacted in March 2010 with the goal of expanding health insurance for the millions of Americans who were then uninsured. Signed by President Obama in March 2010 (and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012), the ACA expanded health coverage through various provisions (e.g., allowing adult children younger than age 26 to be insured under their parents' health care insurance). This comprehensive reform of U.S. health insurance law prohibits an insurance company from rejecting people with preexisting health conditions. There is also a penalty for employers (and individuals) who choose not to participate in the national health plan. Although increased numbers of American gained insurance as a result of the law's passage, many millions more still lack coverage. Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) Also known as \"COBRA coverage.\" Provides for the continuation of preexisting group health insurance (from the employer) for individuals who lose their coverage (between jobs, quit job, or are fired) for a fixed period of time. Managed Care Both HMOs and PPOs are classified as \"managed health care plans.\" Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) Patients are assigned a primary care provider (PCP), who is the \"gatekeeper.\" The patient has a set \"copay\" per visit, and the participating physician/health provider is paid a set fee (per patient) monthly. The physician receives a monthly check from the HMO. Specialist/consultant: The PCP must first approve the referral. The patient is limited to 568481 seeing the physicians/specialists who are enrolled in the HMO's network. \"Out-of-network physicians\" or not referred by the PCP: The visit may not be covered or it will be reimbursed at a lower rate. Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) The patient can visit any provider in the network without a referral. Not assigned a PCP (as in an HMO). The patient can choose his or her own PCP. No referral is needed to see a specialist who is part of the PPO panel. PPOs are usually more expensive than HMOs. MEDICARE AND MEDICAID Both the Medicare and Medicaid programs are under the aegis of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The CMS is one of the agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Medicare Part A (Inpatient Hospitalization) \"Automatic\" at age 65 if the person paid the premiums (automatically deducted from paycheck by the employer). If the person never paid the premiums (e.g., full-time housewife), the person is not eligible for Medicare coverage. Also covers persons with end- stage renal diseases at any age. Certain religious groups (e.g., Amish Mennonites) do not participate in Medicare. Medicare Part A will pay for the following \"medically necessary\" services: Inpatient hospitalization (including inpatient psychiatric hospitalization Hospice care Home health care Skilled nursing facility care Medicare Part A will not pay for custodial care (nursing homes, retirement homes). Medicare Part B (Outpatient Insurance) Medicare Part B is a voluntary program with monthly premiums. One must enroll during the \"general enrollment period\" (happens once a year). Medicare Part B will pay for the following \"medically necessary\" services: Outpatient visits (including walk-in clinics, urgent care clinics, ED visits) Laboratory and other types of tests (EKG, x-rays, CT scans) Durable medical equipment \"Second opinions\" with another physician (surgery) Kidney dialysis, organ transplants, and many others Medicare Part B does not pay for: Most eyeglasses and eye exams (except following cataract surgery that implants an intraocular lens) Hearing aids Most dentures and dental care 569 Cosmetic plastic surgery (unless it is medically necessary) Over-the-counter drugs and most prescription drugs Medicare Part B does pay for some health prevention services: Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening Influenza shots once a year and Pneumovax and Prevnar 13 (each once in a lifetime) Screening mammogram (once every 12 months for women age 40+) Hepatitis B vaccine series for individuals at medium or high risk Hepatitis C screening if high risk Screening colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy (aged 50 years or older) every 10 years if low risk Routine Pap smears (once every 2 years, or once every 12 months for women at high risk) Prostate cancer screening (digital rectal exam [DRE] and prostate specific antigen [PSA] once a year after age 50) Bone density testing allowed once every 24 months if at risk for osteoporosis, taking prednisone, bisphosphonate therapy to monitor progress HIV screening; sexually transmitted disease/infection screenings covered once every 12 months. Physical exams (once a year) Smoking-cessation counseling and treatment Alcohol misuse screening and counseling Diabetes screening (twice yearly if at risk) Cardiovascular disease screening Medicare Advantage (\"Medicare Part C\") Medicare Advantage Plans cover both inpatient care (Part A) and outpatient care (Part B), and some plans cover some prescription drugs. They are administered by private health insurance companies approved by Medicare. Medicare Part D Also known as the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Only individuals who are enrolled (or eligible) for Medicare Part A and/or Part B are eligible. One type of Part D coverage is called the Medicare Advantage plan (MA). All prescription drug plans have a list of preferred drugs (the formulary). If a nonformulary drug is used, it may not be covered and the patient has to pay for it \"out- of-pocket.\" Medicaid Authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act. A federal and state matching program. Provides health insurance coverage for low-income individuals and their families who meet the federal poverty-level criteria. Covers children, pregnant women, adults, seniors, and 570482 individuals with disabilities (i.e., blindness). Pays for health both care and prescription drugs. Currently, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health services in the United States. It covers care offered by substance use disorder and family planning services (including contraception) as well as by maternal and infant health programs. Children's Health Insurance Programs The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) covers uninsured children (infancy to adolescents) and pregnant women. THE NURSE PRACTITIONER ROLE History Loretta C. Ford, PhD, RN, FAAN, and Henry K. Silver, MD, started the first nurse practitioner (NP) program at the University of Colorado in 1965. Initially, it was a certificate program and later became a master's program in the 1970s. The first NPs were pediatric NPs who practiced in poor rural areas where there were no physicians (because of a severe shortage of primary care physicians). Regulation of Nurse Practitioners Educational Requirements An NP must meet the minimal educational requirements that are mandated by the nurse practice act of the state where he or she plans to practice. State Nurse Practice Act The nurse practice act is enacted into law by the state legislature. Therefore the NP's legal right to practice is derived from the state legislature. Each state has its own nurse practice act that contains regulations that dictate the educational requirements, responsibilities, and the scope of practice for NPs and for other nurses (e.g., RNs, licensed practical nurses, midwives, etc.) who practice in the state. NP practice is not regulated by the federal government, the AMA, or the DHHS. State Board of Nursing The state board of nursing (SBON) is responsible for enforcing the state's nurse practice act. The SBON is a formal governmental agency that has the statutory authority to regulate nursing practice. The SBON has the legal authority to license, monitor, and discipline nurses. The SBON is also authorized to revoke a nurse's license (after formal hearings). Title Protection Professional designations such as RN or NP, advanced registered nurse practitioner [ARNP], and advanced practice registered nurse [APRN]) are protected by law. It is illegal 571483 for any person to use these titles without a valid license. Title protection is mandated by the state nurse practice act. Title protection protects the public from unlicensed \"nurses.\" Licensure and Certification Licensure is a legal requirement to practice as an NP. It is obtained through a governmental entity, the SBON. The NP must meet the minimal educational and clinical requirements in order to become licensed. Certification is generally a \"voluntary\" process and is done through a nongovernmental entity such as a professional nursing association or specialty organization. The majority of states in the United States now mandate board certification (or certification) as a condition to obtain licensure. Standards of Professional Nursing Practice Standards are authoritative statements of the duties that all registered nurses, regardless of role, population, or specialty are expected to perform (Bickford, Marion, & Gazaway, 2015). According to the ANA, it includes both the Standards of Practice and the Standards of Professional Performance. They are developed by professional societies (e.g., ANA) as well as specialty organizations. For example, the American Association of Nurse Practitioners publishes Standards of Practice for Nurse Practitioners. Collaborative Practice Agreements A written agreement between a physician and NP outlining the NP's role and responsibility to the clinical practice. A copy of the collaborative practice agreement must be kept at the NP's practice setting and mailed to the state board of nursing. Most states require an annual review of the agreement that contains signatures of the individuals involved and dates. The state practice environment differs for each specific state. Some states allow full practice under the exclusive authority of the SBON. Some states allow reduced practice, and some have restricted practice. In these states, the NP must be under the supervision or delegation of an outside health discipline such as the Board of Medicine. Agreements With Physicians and Dentists NPs can sign collaborative practice agreements with physicians (MDs), osteopaths (doctors of osteopathy [DOs]), and dentists/dental surgeons (doctors of dental medicine [DDMs]/doctors of dental surgery [DDSs]). Chiropractors (DCs) and naturopaths (NDs) are not considered physicians under nurse practice acts. In most states, physicians are the only practitioners who can legally sign the death certificate. Prescription Privileges The majority of states require NPs to have a written practice protocol with a supervising physician in order to prescribe drugs. The protocol usually contains the list of drugs (by name, by class, or by condition) that the NP is allowed to prescribe. As of January 1, 2017, all states now allow NPs to prescribe certain controlled drugs but with limitations. E-Prescribing (Electronic Prescriptions) A method of sending prescriptions electronically directly to the pharmacy 572484 Preferred method of prescribing by Medicare and Medicaid Prescription Pads The NP's prescription pad should contain the following: NP's name, designation, and license number Clinic's name, address, and phone number; if the practice has several clinics, the other clinics where the NP practices should also be listed on the pad To reduce fraud, it is best if the Drug Enforcement Agent (DEA) number is not listed (only for controlled substance prescriptions) The Four Generations of Nurses This may be the first time that four generations of nurses are working side by side. Each generation behaves differently. Table 30.2 describes each generation. Table 30.2 Generation Types Generation Description Silent Generation Born from 1925 to 1945. Disciplined and loyal. Traditional work ethic. More action oriented. The youngest nurses from this generation are now in their 70s and most have retired. Baby boomers Born from 1946 to 1964. Hard workers. Like to achieve. More susceptible to burnout and stress-related illness. Generation X (Gen Xers) Born from 1965 to 1980. Question authority, expect immediate results. Loyalty to peers more than company. Generation Y (Millennials) Born from 1981 to 2000. Multitaskers who seek learning and career development, but also value free time to socialize. Source: Frandsen (2014). LEADERSHIP STYLES Situational Leadership Leader is flexible and can adjust his or her leadership style to fit the changing needs of an organization. Can establish rapport easily and bring out the best in people. The result is that staff members are engaged with the goals of the organization and are more productive. Situational leadership theory was developed by Ken Blanchard and Paul Hersey. Transformational Leadership Leader has the ability to communicate vision to staff members. May have a charismatic personality and good communication skills. Staff members usually have higher job satisfaction with this type of leader. Inspires the staff. May miss the smaller details. 573485 Laissez-Faire Leadership Leader engages in minimal supervision and direction of staff members. Prefers \"hands off\" approach. May not like to make decisions. This style of leadership works well if workers are experienced, like autonomy, and are self-directed. New or unexperienced staff may feel anxious with this type of authority due to minimal supervision and feedback. Authoritarian Leadership (Autocratic) Leader likes control and structure and prefers to give directions. May have many rules. Makes decisions without (or minimal) staff input. Motivated, independent, and self- directed staff may be unhappy in this type of environment. Democratic Leadership Leader may like to have more frequent staff meetings because he or she values staff members' input and feedback. Team shares in decision-making process, which may be slow due to desire to include all of staff in process. Leader values relationships and staff opinions. Servant Leadership Leader likes to work along with staff on the unit. May assume many roles. Develops relationships with staff members and treats staff as individuals, which results in high job satisfaction for staff. But this type of leader may not like to make decisions and may be slow in making decisions. EXAM TIPS Be able to define standards of practice . NPs derive their \"right to practice\" from their state legislature. Understand the difference between occurrence-based versus claims-based malpractice insurance. The NPI contains 10 numbers/digits. The ICD-10 contains the diagnostic codes. The CPT code is used to bill for outpatient office procedures and services. Both the ICD-10 and CPT code are required for each bill. COBRA is a law that allows a person to continue group health insurance coverage provided by his or her employer for a specified period even if he or she quits the job (the person has to pay the insurance premiums). Become familiar with situational leadership style and other leadership styles. RESEARCH-BASED CLINICAL CARE 574Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) Also known as \"evidence-based practice.\" EBM is the result of the use and integration of solid clinical evidence (finding the best evidence) into clinical care. Research evidence (results from experiments and studies) is critically evaluated for its validity, impact (size of effect), and applicability. (For more details, see the separate chapter on evidence-based medicine and epidemiology in this book.) Treatment Guidelines Guideline contents are based on the systematic review of available clinical evidence. Guidelines are written by national expert panels (e.g., JNC 8) and/or specialty organizations (e.g., Infectious Disease Society of America, American Academy of Pediatrics). The \"National Guideline Clearinghouse\" contains a huge database of treatment guidelines ( www.guideline.gov ). CASE AND RISK MANAGEMENT Case Managers Health care case managers are usually experienced RNs who act as coordinators for the outpatient management of patients with certain diagnoses (usually chronic, resource- intensive diseases). The process is called \"case management.\" Case management is mainly done by telephone. Examples: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart failure, diabetes Quality-Improvement Programs Quality improvement involves monitoring, identifying problems, measuring outcomes, and establishing new parameters for improved performance. The goal of these programs is to improve the quality of care, decrease complications, decrease hospitalizations, lower patient mortality, decrease system errors, and increase patient satisfaction. Patient outcomes are important indicators of a health system's quality. Example: A \"problem\" is identified (diabetic complications such as peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy, etc.). Then outcome measures are identified (e.g., hemoglobin A1C <6.5%, etc.). Be familiar about what a good outcome is for a disease (for diabetics, a good outcome is A1C <6.5%) and what a poor outcome is (A1C >8%). Risk Management in Health Care Risk management in an important aspect of quality-improvement/quality-assurance programs in the health care setting. It is a systematic organizational process for identifying risky practices to minimize adverse patient outcomes and corporate liability. High-risk areas that are usually checked by risk managers are medication errors, hospital-acquired infections, patient identification problems, and falls. Risk management promotes safe and 575486 effective patient care practices. Accreditation Accreditation is a voluntary process through which a nongovernmental association evaluates and certifies that an organization (e.g., hospital, clinic, nursing program) has met the requirements and excels in its class. For example, the American Nurses Credentialing Center and the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission are accreditation organizations. The Joint Commission (TJC) An independent, not-for-profit organization that accredits health care organizations (hospitals, nursing homes, home care, laboratories) via inspection and evaluation of their facilities (charged a fee). Achieving TJC certification means that a facility has met or surpassed the organization's strict requirements. \"The ultimate purpose of TJC's accreditation process is to enhance quality of care and patient safety\" (The Joint Commission, 2017). Sentinel Event (SE) Reporting An SE is a patient safety event (not primarily related to the natural course of the patient's illness or condition) that results in any of the following: death, permanent harm, and/or severe temporary harm with \"intervention required to sustain life\" (The Joint Commission, 2017). When an SE occurs, the health care organization is expected to conduct a root cause analysis, make improvements to reduce risk, and monitor effectiveness of the improvements. Accredited organizations are strongly encouraged but are not required to report SEs to the TJC. Examples: The presence of SEs adversely affects reimbursement for long-term care facilities (LTCFs) by Medicare and Medicaid. SEs are monitored by TJC quality-assurance and risk management teams (The Joint Commission, 2017). Incidence of retained foreign objects (sponges) after surgery Health care worker fatigue and patient safety Patient injury/deaths from using certain medications (anticoagulants, opioids, etc.) Suicide while receiving care in a staffed around-the-clock facility or within 72 hours of discharge Pressure injuries (types III and VI) Root Cause Analysis (RCA) A process used in health care to identify the contributing factors that result in an error. \"RCA is a structured facilitated team process to identify root causes of an event that resulted in an undesired outcome and develop corrective actions\" (The Joint Commission, 2017). The TJC has mandated the use of RCA to analyze SEs. The gathered data are analyzed for the root causes (usually a combination of human, environmental, and system factors). The goal is to identify the system breakdowns that resulted in an inadvertent mistake and to propose at least one corrective action to reduce or eliminate each root cause. The focus is on the system and not on blaming individuals. A small team usually carries out the investigations. 576487 Example: Adverse event occurs (e.g., injuries). The \"root cause\" that contributed must be identified (worker stress, time limitations, patient load, low staff morale, absence of certain skills, others). These factors are analyzed and a plan is proposed to remedy/prevent the problem (e.g., more staff, staff education, etc.). Outcomes Analysis Analysis and tracking of patient outcomes using outcome measures (i.e., surveys, questionnaires). THEORETICAL CONCEPTS Health Belief Model (HBM) A model that attempts to explain and to predict why people engage in health behavior(s). According to the HBM, a person is more likely to engage in healthier behavior if he or she feels threatened by the condition (high perceived susceptibility), believes that it is serious (high perceived seriousness), and believes that he or she can overcome the barriers (low perceived barriers), will benefit (high perceived benefits), and can successfully perform the action (high self-efficacy). Modifying factors include demographics (age, gender race), social class, and others (Rosenstock, Stretcher, & Becker, 1988). Example: Who is more likely to perform healthier behavior\u2014a 50-year-old smoker who recently had a myocardial infarction (MI), or 16-year-old girl who is obese? In this case, it is probably the 50-year-old smoker who is more likely to quit smoking due to the seriousness of an MI and his older age, rather than the teenager who has to lose weight. Family Systems Theory (Murray Bowen, MD) All parts of a system are interrelated and dependent on each other. If one part of the system is damaged or dysfunctional, the rest of the system is also affected. Family members are interdependent on each other ( thebowencenter.org ). If one family member becomes dysfunctional, it will affect the whole family. Another family member may compensate and take over some of the duties or the role of the dysfunctional family member. If one member becomes highly stressed, another family member(s) will \"absorb\" the stress and may become depressed and anxious. Example: A mother who is married with three children is an alcoholic. The oldest child, a 12-year-old girl, will most likely take over some of her mother's tasks such as cooking for the family or helping her father take care of the younger siblings. She may become angry and distressed and feel overwhelmed. Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change) The Transtheoretical Model is also called the Stages of Change Model. It was developed by Prochaska and DiClemente to conceptualize the process of intentional behavioral change. It, posits that people go through five stages when changing from unhealthy behavior, such as addiction (smoking), to healthier behavior (cessation of smoking). Also known as the 577488 transtheoretical model. 1. Precontemplation (not ready, in denial of the adverse effects of smoking) 2. Contemplation (accepts problem, thinks of \"pros vs. cons\" of smoking) 3. Preparation (has a plan of action, picks \"quit\" date, buys nicotine gum) 4. Action (actions such as quitting smoking, changes lifestyle) 5. Maintenance (not smoking, working out in gym, avoiding relapse) Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) A health care delivery model that is also known as the \"primary care medical home.\" It is another way to deliver patient-centered primary care. In PCMH, the patient and family are considered important members of the health care team. Most of the patient's health care needs are taken care of in the home setting. Other team members may include physicians, advanced practice nurses, PAs, nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists, social workers, educators, and care coordinators (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, n.d.). Delivery of health care is coordinated to ensure smooth transitions between home and the hospital, home health agency, and community services. The patient and/or family has 24/7 access to a member of the health care team by phone, video chat, or email. HUMAN GENETIC SYMBOLS New to the exam are questions about genetic symbols. The symbol for a healthy male is an empty square and for a diseased/affected male, it is a filled square. The symbol for a healthy female is an empty circle and for a diseased/affected female, it is a filled circle. A diagonal dash across a symbol means that the person is dead. Gender Symbol Description Healthy male Empty square Diseased male Filled square Healthy female Empty circle Diseased female Filled circle Death Diagonal dash across a symbol EXAM TIPS The \"patient-centered medical home\" is a method of primary health care delivery. Health care providers and therapists (physical, occupational, speech) deliver care in the patient's home, with the family. These patients have chronic long-term illness. To communicate, technology is used such as phone, video chat, or by email. Recognize Murray Bowen's Family Systems Theory. Stages of Change Model: learn how to identify a stage. Use common sense in answering questions on quality improvement and risk 578management. Keep in mind the goals of these processes: to improve quality of care, decrease complications, decrease hospitalizations, lower patient mortality, decrease system errors, and increase patient satisfaction. Look for the answer that fits these goals. Learn the human genetic symbol for a diseased (or affected) male and female. 579489 490 Practice Questions and Answers VII 580491 31 Practice Questions TO SEE THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION, TAP ON THE QUESTION NUMBER 1.

D) Encourage sexual abstinence and condom use Healthy People 2020 has four overarching goals: (1) attain high-quality longer lives free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death; (2) achieve health equity and eliminate disparities, and improve health for all groups; (3) create social and physical environments that promote good health for all; and (4) promote quality of life, healthy development and healthy behaviors across life stages. Sexual abstinence is only one specific area of sexual health promotion. 1282TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 23. B) Creatinine The estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a sensitive test used to measure and monitor kidney function and evaluate chronic kidney disease (CKD). GFR can be estimated from serum creatinine. The estimated GFR calculation uses serum creatinine along with age and values assigned for gender and race. The National Kidney Foundation has determined different stages of CKD based on the value of estimated GFR. 1283TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 24. A) Chronic intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause the disorder Signs and symptoms of gastritis are nausea/vomiting, upset stomach, loss of appetite, and burning/aching or gnawing pain located in the epigastric area. Nonselective NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, others) have adverse effects on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, kidneys, central nervous system, and cardiovascular effects, and decrease platelet aggregation (aspirin). Chronic use of nonselective NSAIDs disrupts of prostaglandins, which COX-2. The GI mucosa uses COX-1 to produce mucosal protective factors. Blocking COX-1 decreases these protective factors and increases risk of gastritis, ulcers, and GI bleeding. Selective NSAIDs, such as celecoxib (Celebrex), do less damage to the GI tract because they block only COX-2, which is responsible for pain and inflammation. 1284TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 25. D) Apraxia Apraxia is characterized by loss of the ability to execute or carry out learned purposeful movements despite the desire and the physical ability to perform the movements. Apraxia is not a sign or symptom of depression; it is a disorder of motor planning caused by damage to specific areas of the cerebrum. Common signs of depression include anhedonia (loss of interest in activities that the patient finds pleasurable), unintentional weight loss or gain, fatigue, change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, and recurrent thoughts of suicide. 1285TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 26. B) Tanner stage III In Tanner stage III in males, the testicular volume increases, the scrotum enlarges, and the penis begins to lengthen. Tanner stages are: Tanner I: Prepubertal small penis. Tanner II: The penis length remains unchanged. Tanner III: Penis begins to lengthen. Tanner IV: Penis increases in length and circumference. Tanner V: Scrotum and penis are mature size. 1286615 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 27. D) Start exercising vigorously as soon as possible so that the circulation in the affected lower extremity improves Although ambulation as tolerated is encouraged for patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), aggressive exercise immediately after hospital discharge is discouraged because of the theoretical risk of another episode of acute pulmonary emboli. Also, the risk of blood clots increases markedly if the international normalized ratio (INR) decreases below the therapeutic level (INR <2). 1287TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 28. A) Laryngeal cancer Human papillomavirus (HPV) exposure is a risk factor in laryngeal cancer. HPV DNA transforms the moist membranes of epithelial cells (cervix, anus, mouth, and throat). The juvenile type is related to vertical transmission and the adult type to orogenital contact. HPV subtype 16 accounts for the majority of oral tumors, oropharynx cancers, and laryngeal cases. 1288TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 29. C) Osteoarthritis Signs of osteoarthritis (OA) include stiffness of joints, especially in the morning and after sitting for long periods. Visible signs of OA are an element in the diagnosis. (Rheumatoid arthritis and gout often rely more heavily on lab tests.) Heberden's nodes (bony overgrowths) are classic signs of OA. They are located at the distal interphalangeal joints. They are felt as hard, nontender nodules usually 2 to 3 cm in diameter but sometimes encompassing the entire joint. Enlargement of the middle joint of a finger is called a Bouchard's node . 1289TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 30. B) Instability of the knee The drawer test is used to identify mediolateral or anteroposterior plane instability of the knee. The test is performed on the unaffected and affected knee for comparison. The anterior drawer test evaluates the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). To perform the test, the patient lies supine and the knee is placed at 90-degree flexion. Grasp the posterior aspect of the tibia over the upper calf muscle; then, with a steady force, try to push the lower leg forward and backward. Anterior or posterior movement of the knee is positive. With the leg extended, stabilize the femur with one hand and the ankle with the other. Try to abduct and adduct the knee. There should be no medial or lateral movement. 1290TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 31.

B) Lichen sclerosus Lichen sclerosus is more common in older women. It is a long-term chronic condition that causes thin, white patches of skin usually in the genital area in women. The lesions appear as small white spots early in the disease and grow into bigger patches. Itching is very common; however, other symptoms include discomfort, bleeding from skin tears, and blisters. A skin biopsy allows for differentiation from other dermatological conditions. 1294TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 35. B) Closure of the semilunar valves A heart valve normally allows blood to flow in only one direction. A heart valve opens or closes incumbent upon differential blood pressure on each side. A form of heart disease occurs when a valve malfunctions and allows some blood to flow in the wrong direction. The S2 sound results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal. 1295TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 36. A) On deep inspiration by the patient, palpate firmly in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen below the costovertebral angle Murphy's sign is tested during an abdominal examination for biliary disorders. As the patient breathes in, the abdominal contents are pushed downward as the diaphragm moves down and the lungs expand. As the patient stops/hold the breath, the gallbladder comes in contact with the examiner's fingers and may elicit pain. To be considered positive, the same maneuver must not elicit pain when performed on the left side. A negative Murphy's test in the elderly is not useful for ruling out cholecystitis if history and other tests suggest the diagnosis. 1296TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 37. B) Acetaminophen (Tylenol) Acetaminophen is an analgesic that is not a anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The other response choices\u2014 ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin\u2014are all NSAIDs. Administering these drugs, which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, to a patient in the third trimester may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Experts recommend that from week 30 of gestation until delivery, NSAIDs should be avoided. 1297TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 38. A) Middle-aged to older women Hashimoto's disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis, or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) is an autoimmune disease. An enlarged thyroid is most often the first sign of the disease. Hashimoto's disease is about seven times more common in women than in men. It can occur in teens and young women, but is more common in middle age. 1298TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 39. C) Severe vaginal atrophic changes As women reach menopause, changes that may occur include hot flashes, irregular menstrual periods, and cyclic mood swings. Vaginal changes, such as dryness and thinning, may also begin to occur. Vaginal atrophy (atrophic vaginitis) is the thinning and inflammation of the vaginal walls due to a decline in estrogen. Vaginal atrophy occurs most often after menopause and worsens as women become older. 1299TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 40. B) Arteriovenous (AV) nicking, left ventricular hypertrophy, and stroke AV nicking copper are signs of hypertensive retinopathy. Left ventricular hypertrophy increases incidence of heart failure, and ventricular arrhythmias. Stroke damages the brain.

A) Urine for culture and sensitivity The urine for culture and sensitivity would be the first test to order. All presenting symptoms are consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs are unusual in adult males and this patient should be treated for a complicated UTI\u2014empiric treatment with a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin, BID for 7 to 14 days. The patient should be referred to a urologist for evaluation of causative factors. 1301617 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 42. B) They have an adverse effect on the kidneys and can elevate blood pressure All nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in doses that are adequate to reduce inflammation and pain can increase blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive patients. NSAIDs may also reduce the effect of all antihypertensive drugs except calcium channel blockers. The prohypertensive effect is dose dependent and probably involves cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the kidneys, which reduces sodium excretion and increases intravascular volume. 1302TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 43. B) Bupropion (Zyban) Bupropion (Zyban) is utilized to reduce craving for tobacco and to decrease withdrawal symptoms. The mechanism is not entirely known. Bupropion's ability to help stop smoking is not related to its antidepressant action. Patients can still smoke while on bupropion. But if a patient is using nicotine gum or nicotine patches for smoking cessation, he or she must stop smoking when starting treatment because the combination can cause a nicotine overdose. 1303TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 44. B) Tick Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, which is carried by infected ticks. Risk factors include recent hiking or exposure to ticks in areas known to be infested. Bacteria can also infect people who crush ticks they have removed from pets. Symptoms develop around 2 to 14 days after tick bite: chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and rash. 1304TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 45. D) For facial skin or skin folds, use only low-potency topical steroids Skin on the face and skin folds are thinner than skin elsewhere on the body. Use only low- potency topical steroids in these areas. Avoid potent or fluorinated topical steroids, which can cause adverse effects such as acne, telangiectasia, skin atrophy, and hypopigmentation. Thicker skin can tolerate more potent steroids. Contact with cold objects does not affect eczema. Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a long-term chronic skin disorder that is associated with atopy. Skin changes may include itchy skin, dry skin all over the body or bumpy skin on the back of the arms and front of the thighs, and areas of the skin raw from scratching. Leather-like thickening of the skin is called lichenification . It can occur after long-term irritation and scratching. 1305TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 46.

B) Prevent anencephaly Folic acid (B vitamin) supplementation has been shown to decrease the incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs), including spina bifida and anencephaly. Folic acid supplementation should begin preconception and continue during pregnancy. Folic acid prevents some NTDs by correcting abnormal homocysteine metabolism. Women need to take 0.4 mg/day during their childbearing years. There is an increased incidence of NTDs in diabetics, who require a higher dose to be therapeutic. 1313TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 54. A) Acute pyelonephritis Acute pyelonephritis does not involve any vascular change; however, chronic pyelonephritis (reflux nephropathy) is a factor for secondary hypertension. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal glands that results in a release of too much epinephrine and norepinephrine, hormones that control heart rate, metabolism, and blood pressure. Renovascular stenosis is a narrowing of one or both arteries leading to the kidneys. It can cause severe hypertension and irreversible kidney damage. Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital heart defect of the aorta; it is a narrowing of the aorta that causes the heart to work harder to get blood to flow through the narrow aortic passageway to other organs, which, in turn, causes an increase in blood pressure. 1314TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 55. B) Chlamydia trachomatis Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (or perihepatitis) is a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). It is more common with chlamydial PID, but it can also occur with gonorrheal PID infection. It is caused by inflammation of the liver capsule, which leads to scarring. Signs and symptoms include sharp pain on the right upper quadrant (pleuritic-like) with PID symptoms. Like PID, it is treated with antibiotics. 1315TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 56.

B) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease that includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The most common risk factor for COPD is long-term cigarette smoking (80%-90%). Another cause is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and chronic fume exposure. COPD is now the third leading cause of death in the United States. The three cardinal symptoms of COPD are dyspnea, chronic cough, and sputum production. The lungs are hyperinflated, which changes the shape of the chest and diaphragm, making the mechanics of breathing more difficult. Excess mucus and obstructed airflow from progressive thickening and stiffening of the airways diminish breath sounds. COPD creates a high hematocrit percentage due to chronic hypoxemia. 1358TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 99. B) It is a precancerous lesion and should be followed up with her dermatologist Actinic keratoses are usually found on the face, scalp, back of hands, chest, or other sun-exposed areas.

B) Order a mammogram and refer the patient to a breast surgeon A scaly, reddened rash on the breast that does not resolve after a few weeks of medical treatment may indicate breast cancer. She should have a mammogram performed and see a breast surgeon for evaluation and treatment. Paget's disease of the breast is a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple and, usually, the areola. It may be misdiagnosed at first because its early symptoms are similar to those caused by some benign skin conditions. Most patients with Paget's disease of the breast also have one or more tumors inside the same breast, either ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer. 1397TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 138. D) A 22-year-old woman recently diagnosed with asthma The young person with asthma is not considered at high risk for tuberculosis (TB). Risk factors for TB include a weakened immune system (e.g., diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cancer, advanced age, malnutrition, biologic agents). Health care workers who come in contact with people with illness are at increased risk, as are those living or working in a residential care facility (e.g., prison, nursing home) or any site with overcrowding or poor ventilation, such as refugee camps, shelters, and such. 1398TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 139. C) This is a normal finding in some young athletes The S2 heart sound is physiologically split in about 90% of people. The second heart sound is produced by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. The sound produced by the closure of the aortic valve is termed A2 and the sound produced by the closure of the pulmonic valve is termed P2 . The A2 sound is normally much louder than the P2 due to higher pressures in the left side of the heart; thus A2 radiates to all cardiac listening posts (loudest at the right upper sternal border) and P2 is usually only heard at the left upper sternal border. 1399630 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 140. D) Four risk factors The risk factors for coronary artery disease for this patient are (1) 65-year-old male, (2) overweight (body mass index [BMI] of 30), (3) hypertension, and (4) total cholesterol 230 g/dL. 1400TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 141. C) Mitral regurgitation Mitral regurgitation is best heard at the apical area, and manifests as a high-pitched, blowing pansystolic murmur. It occurs when the mitral valve does not close properly. It is the abnormal leaking of blood from the left ventricle, through the mitral valve, and into the left atrium. When the ventricle contracts, there is backflow (regurgitation) of blood into the left atrium. Mitral regurgitation is the most common form of valvular heart disease. Murmurs are graded (classified) depending on how loud they sound with a stethoscope. The scale is 1 to 6 on loudness. A grade 2/6 is a grade 2 on the 6-point scale. 1401TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 142. B) Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Infection in humans most often involves the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or lungs. Cutaneous anthrax occurs when anthrax spores touch a cut or scrape on the skin. It is the most common type of anthrax infection. The main risk is contact with animal hides or hair, bone products, and wool, or with infected animals. Symptoms of cutaneous anthrax start 1 to 7 days after exposure: An itchy sore develops that is similar to an insect bite. This sore may blister and form a black ulcer (sore). The sore is usually painless, but it is often surrounded by swelling. A scab often forms, and then dries and falls off within 2 weeks. Complete healing can take longer. Most people with anthrax are treated with antibiotics. Several antibiotics are effective, including penicillin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin. 1402TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 143. B) Raynaud's disease Raynaud's disease involves an interruption in the blood flow to fingers and toes (sometimes nose and ears), due to spasms in the blood vessels. During a Raynaud's attack, the affected area typically turns white, and, as oxygen fails to reach the extremities, they can turn blue, tingle, or throb painfully, and the affected area may swell. Symptoms may resolve quickly or last for hours. Raynaud's disease is more common in women, is not curable, and it is associated with increased risk of other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, but treatment can decrease symptoms. The preferred drug is a calcium channel blocker such as nifedipine (Norvasc) or amlodipine (Procardia). 1403TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 144.

A) The patient can see at 20 feet what a person with normal vision can see at 30 feet The Snellen fractions, 20/20, 20/30, and so forth, are measures of sharpness (acuity) of sight. They relate to the ability to identify small letters with high contrast at a specified distance. When checking visual acuity, one eye is covered at a time and the vision of each eye is recorded separately, as well as both eyes together. In the Snellen fraction 20/20, the first number represents the test distance, 20 feet. The second number represents the distance at which the average eye can see the letters on a certain line of the eye chart. So 20/20 means that the eye being tested can read a certain size letter when it is 20 feet away. If a person sees 20/30, at 20 feet from the chart that person can read letters that a person with 20/20 vision could read from 30 feet away. 1406TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 147. B) Dawn phenomenon The Dawn phenomenon is the end result of a combination of natural body changes that occur during the sleep cycle. Between 3 a.m. and 8 a.m. the body starts to increase the amounts of counter regulatory hormones, including growth hormone, cortisol, and catecholamines. These hormones work against insulin's action to decrease the blood glucose level. 1407TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 148. A) HCV RNA The anti-HCV test detects the presence of antibodies to the hepatitis C virus, indicating exposure to HCV. The anti-HCV test cannot distinguish between someone with active or previous HCV infection (reported as positive or negative). The HCV RNA test is qualitative and used to distinguish between a current or past infection. It is reported as \"negative\" or \"not detected.\" It may also be ordered after treatment is complete to see whether the virus has been eliminated. 1408TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 149.

The most common bacterial cause of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is Chlamydia trachomatis, but it may by Ureaplasma vaginalis, adenovirus; rarely a Trichomonas vaginalis (parasite) may cause NGU. It can also be caused by a mechanical injury such as a catheter or cystoscopy. 1412632 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 153. A) Yogurt and sardines Postmenopausal women are advised to increase their dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D to help protect their bones from osteopenia and osteoporosis. Good sources of calcium include low-fat dairy products (yogurt), dark leafy vegetables, canned salmon or sardines with bones, soy products, and calcium-fortified cereals and orange juice. Just 3 ounces of canned sardines, including bones, drained of oil, provides 324 mg of calcium. 1413TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 154. A) The high vitamin K levels will decrease the INR Green leafy vegetables have high levels of vitamin K, which can bind with the blood-clotting cascade and decrease the bleeding time. Vitamin K and warfarin sodium (Coumadin) have opposing effects. Vitamin K helps to decrease bleeding time; Coumadin helps to increase bleeding time. Leafy green vegetables high in vitamin K would normally decrease the bleeding time. In a patient who is taking Coumadin, the high vitamin K would interfere with the desired effect of the Coumadin (which would be to prolong or increase clotting time) and, in fact, would have the opposite effect, which would be to shorten or decrease the clotting time. 1414TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 155. B) Order a liver function profile and CK level Fluvastatin (Lescol) is in the \"statin\" drug class. It is prescribed to help lower LDL and triglycerides, and raise HDL. Statin side effects are associated with muscle pain, tenderness, and weakness. Statins may lead to a more serious condition called rhabdomyolysis . They may also cause liver problems with side effects such as jaundice in the sclera or skin, dark urine, abdominal pain, and persistent nausea/vomiting. In such cases, statins must be discontinued; ordering of the liver function profile is indicated. 1415TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 156. D) Stop taking the medicine until the laboratory results are available This patient's symptoms suggest liver involvement; have the patient stop the statin until the lab results are back, then the patient and the clinician can make informed decisions. 1416TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 157. A) T-score of less than 2.50. Several methods are available to measure bone density, but currently the most widely used technique is dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The T-score is the number of standard deviations below the average for a young adult at peak bone density. Instead of the T-score, the Z-score is used to score bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women and in young men. Normal bone: T-score greater than 1, osteopenia: T-score between 1 and 2.5, osteoporosis: T-score less than 2.5, and established (severe) osteoporosis includes the presence of a nontraumatic fracture. 1417TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 158. A) Trigeminal neuralgia Trigeminal neuralgia is a nerve disorder that causes a stabbing or electric-shock-like pain in parts of the face. Symptoms are very painful, sharp electric-like spasms that usually last a few seconds or minutes, but can become constant. Pain is usually only on one side of the face, often around the eye, cheek, and lower part of the face. Pain may be triggered by touch or sounds. Painful attacks of trigeminal neuralgia can be triggered by common, everyday activities. 1418633 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 159. D) Atypical bacterial infections The potassium hydroxide (KOH) prep test is performed to evaluate for tinea or candida (yeast) infection of the skin. In vaginal discharge, the yeast organism is outside the skin cells, so KOH is not needed to visualize it. But for skin cells, yeast is not visible unless the skin cell walls are destroyed by KOH. The test involves placing a sample of skin on a glass slide, with one to two drops of KOH (causes lysis of skin cells) and a coverslip on top. If done correctly, you can visualize the budding spores and pseudohyphae. The KOH test may be used to diagnose fungal infections, such as thrush, tinea versicolor, ringworm, and bacterial vaginosis (positive whiff test). 1419TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 160.

D) Ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a lifelong autoimmune disease and form of arthritis that causes inflammation, pain, and stiffness mainly in the spinal joints. In the early stages of AS, the pain and stiffness often start in the lower back, but over time it may move up the spine and into the neck. Most people with AS experience episodes of acute pain\u2014known as flares \u2014followed by periods when symptoms temporarily subside. There are no specific lab tests to identify ankylosing spondylitis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is increased by the inflammation. 1427634 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 168. B) Schedule the patient for uterine ultrasound and endometrial biopsy Postmenopausal bleeding should always be investigated because it could be a sign of endometrial carcinoma. Although endometrial carcinoma is the most serious cause of postmenopausal bleeding, an atrophic endometrium with dyssynchronous shedding is the most common cause. A less common cause is cervical or endometrial polyps. A uterine ultrasound is ordered to evaluate the lining of the endometrium and rule out polyps. A uterine biopsy is ordered to sample for pathology. 1428TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 169. A) Anticholinergics Anticholinergic drugs are another group of bronchodilators that are different from the beta-agonists. Although the beta-agonists affect the bronchioles (small airways), anticholinergics affect the muscles around the bronchi (large airways). When the lungs are irritated, these bands of muscle can tighten, making the bronchi narrower. Anticholinergics work by stopping the muscles from tightening. 1429TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 170. A) High fever occurs in up to 80% of the patients This statement is false. One of the most common reactions to tetanus vaccine is arm soreness, which usually manifests within 24 to 48 hours. There are two forms of the tetanus vaccine for people 7 years of age and older. The Td vaccine contains tetanus and diphtheria. The Tdap contains tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends one Tdap booster in a lifetime, which can be substituted when the Td vaccine is due. The DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus- acellular pertussis) and DT (diphtheria-tetanus) forms of the tetanus vaccine are not given after the age of 7 years. 1430TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 171. A) An eye exam with an ophthalmologist Patients with type 2 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist shortly after the diagnosis of diabetes. Subsequent examinations for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients should be repeated annually by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Examinations will be required more frequently if retinopathy is progressing. 1431TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 172. D) She needs to be evaluated by a dermatologist This patient needs to be referred to a dermatologist. Any nonhealing ulcers require further evaluation. For example, squamous cell cancer (primarily found on sun-exposed areas such as the rim of the ear, face, scalp, lips, and mouth) often begins as a small, sandpaper-like growth called actinic keratoses . It then develops into a crusted or scaly patch with a red, inflamed base. It can also present as a growing tumor, a nonhealing ulcer, or just a crust. Any nonhealing ulcers warrant further evaluation. 1432TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 173. B) Albuterol only as needed asthma \"quick relief\" or \"rescue\" medications, whereas long-acting bronchodilators are used every day to control asthma in conjunction with an inhaled steroid.

(AeroBid) is a corticosteroid. 1433635 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 174. A) Rheumatoid arthritis and degenerative joint disease Enlargement of the proximal interphalangeal joint (middle joint) of a finger is called a Bouchard's node and it is found in both rheumatoid arthritis and degenerative joint disease (or osteoarthritis). Heberden's nodes (bony overgrowths) are classic signs of osteoarthritis. They are located at the distal interphalangeal joints. They are felt as hard, nontender nodules usually 2 to 3 cm in diameter, but sometimes encompass the entire joint. 1434TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 175. C) Macrocytic and normochromic cells Anemias resulting from vitamin B 12 or folate deficiency are sometimes referred to as macrocytic or megaloblastic anemia because red blood cells are larger than normal. A diagnosis of pernicious anemia first requires demonstration of megaloblastic anemia with a complete blood count (CBC) with differential that evaluates the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), as well the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Pernicious anemia is identified with a high MCV (macrocytic) and a normal MCHC (normochromic) anemia. 1435TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 176. B) Rosacea The symptoms of rosacea affect primarily those of Caucasian or other ethnic groups with lighter-toned skin. Facial skin redness (erythema) is caused by hundreds of tiny dilated blood vessels near the surface of the facial skin that become inflamed or dilated due to many rosacea triggers. The symptoms of rosacea begin with facial skin redness and develop to more frequent flushing of the face, particularly the nose and cheeks. 1436TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 177. D) Iron-deficiency anemia Koilonychia is a symptom of iron-deficiency anemia. Other symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include tiredness, lethargy, shortness of breath, palpitations; less common symptoms include a smooth tongue (atrophic glossitis), altered sense of taste, pica (desire to eat nonfood items), and spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia). 1437TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 178.

Stroke is a very rare complication of MVP. 1444TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 185. D) Scabies Scabies is a parasitic disease (infestation) of the skin caused by the human itch mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The rash is generally characterized as red, raised excoriated papules. The scabies mite is generally transmitted from one person to another by direct contact with the skin of the infested person and can also be acquired by wearing an infested person's clothing (fomites), such as sweaters, coats, or scarves. Following the incubation period, the infested person will complain of pruritus (itching), which intensifies at bedtime under the warmth of the blankets. Common sites of infection are the webs of fingers, wrists, flexors of the arms, the axillae, lower abdomen, genitalia, buttocks, and feet. 1445TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 186. B) Aortic stenosis One of the most frequent systolic to aortic stenosis is typically ejection murmur, heard best over the \"aortic area\" or right second intercostal space, with radiation into the right neck. It has a harsh quality and may be associated with a palpably slow rise of the carotid upstroke. Additional heart sounds, such as an S4, may be heard secondary to hypertrophy of the left ventricle, which is caused by the greatly increased work required to pump blood through the stenotic valve. 1446TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 187. A) Hordeolum Hordeolum is a common, painful, acute bacterial infection of the hair follicle on the eyelid. It is a focal infection (usually staphylococcal) involving either the glands of Zeis (external hordeola or styes) or, less frequently, the meibomian glands (internal hordeola). Histologically, hordeola represent focal collections of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and necrotic debris (i.e., abscesses). Pinguecula is a thickening of the bulbar conjunctiva, located on the inner and outer margins of the cornea. Pterygium is a thickening of the conjunctiva located on the nasal or temporal cornea. Pinguecula and pterygium are both caused by the UV light of long-term sun exposure. Sunglasses with UV protection are recommended to prevent damage to the conjunctiva. Ptosis is the drooping of the upper eyelid. 1447637 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 188. C) Propranolol (Inderal) Propranolol (Inderal) is a beta-blocker. recommend propranolol, timolol, amitriptyline, divalproex, sodium for migraine prevention . The goal of preventive therapy is to improve patients' quality of life by reducing migraine frequency, severity, and duration, and by increasing the responsiveness of acute migraines to treatment. A full therapeutic trial may take 2 to 6 months. Ibuprofen (Motrin), naproxen sodium (Anaprox), and sumatriptan (Imitrex) are all medications used to treat symptoms of migraine headache. 1448TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 189. B) Cluster headache Cluster headaches' cardinal symptoms are an excruciating, unilateral, orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal pain. The attack ranges from 15 minutes to 3 hours or more. Autonomic symptoms include ptosis (drooping eyelid), and rhinorrhea in the nostril on the affected side of the face. Migraine headaches with aura include visual changes, such as blind spots or flashing lights that appear before the onset of the headache. Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) is a unilateral headache from compression or inflammation of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V). 1449TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 190. C) Clarithromycin (Biaxin) Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic chemically related to erythromycin and azithromycin. It is effective against a wide variety of bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus in combination with omeprazole (Prilosec) in treating Helicobacter pylori bacteria, which cause stomach ulcers. Side effects are usually mild and transient and commonly include nausea, diarrhea, abnormal taste, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and headache. 1450TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 191. B) 42-year-old obese woman taking prednisone 10 mg daily for severe asthma for 2 years A few of the risk factors for osteoporosis are female gender, increasing age, Caucasian or Asian ethnicity, sedentary lifestyle, and long-term use of corticosteroids such as prednisone and cortisone (interferes with bone-building). The 42-year-old is at higher risk related to her gender and long-term use of steroids. If her obesity is related to a sedentary lifestyle instead of participation in weight-bearing exercise, she would have another risk factor. 1451TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 192. D) Gluten Celiac disease, known as sprue , is an autoimmune disease that damages the small intestine and interferes with the absorption of nutrients. People with celiac disease cannot tolerate a protein called gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, and barley. If they eat foods or use products containing gluten, their immune system responds by damaging the lining of the small intestine. This damage to the small intestine decreases the absorption of all nutrients\u2014resulting in an overall poor nutritional status. If not treated, a person with celiac disease can develop more severe nutritional deficiencies, such as osteoporosis (because of poor calcium absorption), iron-deficiency anemia, or multiple other vitamin and mineral deficiencies. 1452638 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 193. D) Microaneurysms Patients with diabetes often develop ophthalmic complications, such as corneal abnormalities, glaucoma, neovascularization (and microaneurysms), and cataracts. The most common and potentially most blinding of these is diabetic retinopathy. In the initial stages of diabetic retinopathy, patients are generally asymptomatic, but in more advanced stages of the disease patients may experience floaters, as well as distorting and/or blurred vision. Microaneurysms are the earliest clinical sign of diabetic retinopathy. 1453TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 194.

D) International health-promotion programs Healthy People 2020 has four overarching goals: (1) attain high-quality, longer lives free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death; (2) achieve health equity and eliminate disparities; (3) create social and physical environments that promote good health for all; (4) promote quality of life and development of healthy behaviors across life spans. 1462639 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 203. A) Bouchard's nodes Bony nodules at the proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands are called Bouchard's nodes . Heberden's nodes are nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints. Tophi deposits are seen with gout, in which high levels of uric acid in the blood occur and cause nodules in the joint that can eventually destroy the bone. Osteoarthritic nodules develop in the joints of the hands. 1463TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 204. A) Diabetes mellitus Disease mortality rates are lower overall for Hispanics than for non-Hispanics, and considerably lower for the two major killers, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Diabetes, however, claims more lives among the Hispanic population. Diabetes is a primary health concern for Hispanics. This has been particularly documented among studies involving Mexican Americans, among whom the risk of type 2 diabetes is two to three times higher than for non-Hispanic Whites. 1464TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 205. D) Initiate a prescription of nicotinic acid (niacin, Niaspan) Niacin can raise HDL cholesterol by 15% to 35%. This makes niacin the most effective drug available for raising HDL cholesterol. Niacin also decreases LDL and triglyceride levels. 1465TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 206. D) Macrocytic and normocytic red blood cells Vitamin B 12 deficiency adversely affects myelin, leading to neuropathy. The most common cause of B 12 deficiency anemia is pernicious anemia. Anemia resulting from vitamin B 12 or folate deficiency is referred to as macrocytic or megaloblastic anemia because the red blood cells (RBCs) are larger than normal. Deficiency in folate and B 12 does not affect the color of RBCs (normochromic). The RBCs have large cytoplasm because folate and B 12 are necessary for normal DNA synthesis and cytoplasmic maturation. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) measures the size of the RBCs. An MCV greater than 100 is seen in macrocytic anemias (folate or B 12 deficiency anemia). The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is a measure of color, but number values are not used on the exam. Instead, color is described as normochromic or hypochromic. 1466TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 207. C) Elevated Headache is the most common chief complaint and presents in more than two thirds of patients with temporal arteritis. The headache tends to be new or different in character than previous headaches and is typically sudden in onset, localizing to the temporal region. Any new headache in patients older than 50 years warrants a consideration of temporal arteritis. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 50 mm/hr is suspect. The normal ESR for males is 0 to 15 mm/hr, and for females is 0 to 20 mm/hr. The ESR can be slightly more elevated in the elderly. 1467TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 208. B) Rheumatoid arthritis When rheumatoid arthritis is active, symptoms can include fatigue, loss of energy, depression, low-grade fever, muscle and joint aches, and stiffness. Muscle and joint stiffness are usually most notable in the morning and after periods of inactivity. During flares, joints frequently become red, swollen, painful, and tender. This occurs because the lining of the tissue of the joint (synovium) becomes inflamed, resulting in the production of excessive joint fluid (synovitis). 1468640 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 209. D) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia. Initially, individuals experience problems with muscular coordination; personality changes, including impaired memory, judgment, and thinking; and impaired vision. People with the disease also may experience insomnia, depression, or unusual sensations. CJD does not cause a fever or other flu- like symptoms. As the illness progresses, mental impairment becomes severe. Individuals often develop involuntary muscle jerks called myoclonus , and they may go blind. They eventually lose the ability to move and speak and enter a coma. Pneumonia and other infections often occur in these individuals and can lead to death. 1469TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 210. C) Indomethacin (Indocin) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as indomethacin (Indocin), have been used for the treatment of acute gout. Colchicine may be added to the NSAIDs if relief is not obtained. Maintenance therapy consists of allopurinol and/or probenecid. Allopurinol is used to prevent gout attacks, not to treat them once they occur. It may take several months or longer before the full benefit of allopurinol is felt. Allopurinol may increase the number of gout attacks during the first few months that it is taken, although it will eventually prevent attacks. 1470TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 211. B) Isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis is not recommended for persons aged 30 years or older because of higher risk of hepatic injury The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Thoracic Society Joint Guidelines for the Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection state that baseline laboratory testing is not routinely indicated, even for persons aged older than 35 years, but may be considered for patients who are taking other hepatotoxic medications or have chronic medical conditions. Baseline measurements of bilirubin and aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT), along with monthly liver function test monitoring, are recommended for patients with preexisting liver disease, patients at risk for chronic liver disease, patients with HIV infection, pregnant or postpartum women, and regular users of alcohol. 1471TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 212. A) Combination HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody immunoassay with p24 antigen The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the fourth generation combination HIV-1 and HIV-2 with p24 antigen immunoassay for screening asymptomatic individuals or those with chronic HIV infection. The p24 antigen is produced even before antibodies develop. If suspect acute HIV infection (mono-like symptoms), add HIV RNA test. Previously, the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) was used as the screening test and the Western blot was the confirmatory test. The ELISA and Western blot only tested for the HIV antibody. The CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 years be tested for HIV at least once as part of routine health care. If risk factors present, test for HIV annually. For sexually active gay and bisexual men, the CDC recommends more frequent testing, perhaps every 3 to 6 months (CDC, 2017). 1472TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 213.

It typically radiates to the carotid arteries and apex. 1481TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 222. D) Both hepatitis B and hepatitis C Of the primary hepatitis viruses, only B and C are associated with hepatocellular cancer. Chronic hepatitis B and C infection often results in cirrhosis of the liver, which increases the risk of liver cancer. 1482TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 223. C) CN VII Bell's palsy is a form of facial paralysis resulting from a dysfunction of cranial nerve VII (the facial nerve). It results in the inability to control facial muscles on the affected side. 1483642 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 224. C) Hepatitis B vaccination and hepatitis B immune globulin Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a marker of infectivity . If positive, it indicates either an acute or a chronic hepatitis B infection. Antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) is a marker of immunity . Antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) is a marker of acute, chronic, or resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection; it may be used in prevaccination testing to determine previous exposure to HBV . The hepatitis B panel results for the individual in this question (negative HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti- HBs) indicates the partner is susceptible (not immune), has not been infected, and is still at risk of future infection\u2014and thus needs vaccine. Interpretation of the hepatitis C anti-HCV screening test that is negative indicates that the patient is not infected. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin contains antibodies that provide \"instant\" immunity against hepatitis B, but its action lasts for several days only. It is not a vaccine. It is given to infants and others who are at high risk of becoming infected and are not immune. The hepatitis B vaccine stimulates the body to make its own antibodies, which are permanent. A total of three doses are needed to gain full immunity against hepatitis B. 1484TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 225. D) Pregnancy Mild normocytic anemia is associated with chronic autoimmune or inflammatory disorders and chronic infection. The exact mechanism is unknown. Pregnancy does not cause normocytic anemia, but it may cause several other types of anemia: iron-deficiency anemia (microcytic anemia, which can develop in some women who have very low ferritin levels), folate-deficiency anemia (macrocytic anemia), and vitamin B 12 deficiency (also a macrocytic anemia). 1485TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 226. D) Molluscum contagiosum Genital ulcers may occur with syphilis, genital herpes, and chancroid. Molluscum contagiosum is a viral skin infection. In adults, molluscum contagiosum appears on the face, neck, armpits, arms, and hands. Other common places include the genitals, abdomen, and inner thigh. Lesions often begin as small, firm, dome-shaped growths; have a surface that feels smooth, waxy, or pearly; are flesh-colored or pink; have a dimple in the center (may be filled with a thick, white substance that is cheesy or waxy); and are painless but itch. Scratching or picking can spread the virus. 1486TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 227. C) Microcytic anemia Anemias can be classified according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) into microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias. A microcytic anemia is defined by an MCV of less than 80 fL. The differential diagnosis of a microcytic anemia includes iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), thalassemias; anemia of chronic disease (ACD); and sideroblastic anemias, including lead poisoning. Lead causes anemia by mimicking healthful minerals such as calcium, iron, and zinc. It is absorbed by the bones, where it interferes with the production of red blood cells. This absorption can also interfere with calcium absorption that is needed to keep the bones healthy. 1487TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 228. B) Pelvis Hemorrhagic (hypovolemic) shock is due to acute blood or body fluid loss. Hypovolemic shock can occur from a fractured pelvis secondary to internal bleeding from a fractured bone fragment that lacerates an artery or vein. The amount of blood loss after trauma is often difficult to determine; consequently, hemorrhage after blunt trauma is often underestimated. A femoral closed fracture, for example, may lose 1 to 2 liters of blood, a pelvic fracture can lose more than 2 liters of blood, whereas a simple rib fracture can lose up to 125 mL. The abdominal cavity can accommodate a large amount of blood without distension occurring; initially the blood does not irritate the peritoneum, making the diagnosis of hemoperitoneum difficult to establish. 1488TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 229. B) Gout Gout is characterized by recurrent attacks of acute inflammatory arthritis\u2014a red, tender, hot, swollen joint. The metatarsal-phalangeal joint at the base of the big toe (podagra) is the most common location, but it can also affect other joints, such as the ankle or the knee. Pain occurs due to the accumulation of uric acid and salts in the joint. 1489TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 230. C) Grade 4 A fine vibration, felt by an examiner's hand on a patient's body over the site of an aneurysm or on the precordium, results from turmoil in the flow of blood and indicates the presence of an organic murmur of grade 4 or greater intensity. A thrill can also be felt over the carotids if a bruit is present and over an arteriovenous fistula in the patient undergoing hemodialysis. 1490643 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 231. D) The patient's spouse has a right to override the attorney's decisions A power of attorney is a legal document that allows the appointment of another person to act as an agent to manage health, property, finances, and other affairs. The person granting the power to act is called the principal . The person who receives authorization to act on another's behalf is called the attorney-in-fact or agent . There are different types of powers of attorney. A \"durable\" power of attorney stays valid even if the grantor becomes unable to handle his or her own affairs (incapacitated). If the grantor does not specify that the power of attorney is durable, it will automatically end if the grantor later becomes incapacitated. A general power of attorney gives the person chosen the power to manage the grantor's assets and financial affairs while the grantor is alive. A limited power of attorney allows the principal to give only specific powers to the agent. 1491TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 232. B) Chronic hypertension Left ventricular hypertrophy develops in response to some factor, such as high blood pressure, that requires the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the walls of the chamber grow thicker, lose elasticity, and eventually may fail to pump with as much force as a healthy heart. High blood pressure, a blood pressure reading greater than 140/90 mmHg, is the greatest risk factor. 1492TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 233. C) Chronic coughing A patient experiencing respiratory distress from an asthmatic exacerbation presents with tachypnea (>20 breaths/min), tachycardia or bradycardia, cyanosis, and anxiety. The patient appears exhausted, fatigued, and diaphoretic and uses accessory muscles to help with breathing. Physical exam reveals cyanosis and \"quiet\" lungs with no wheezing or breath sounds audible. A \"chronic\" cough is not a symptom of an acute exacerbation but is commonly present in people with asthma Although cough usually accompanies dyspnea and wheezing, it may present in isolation as a precursor of typical asthmatic symptoms, or it may remain the predominant or sole symptom of asthma. Cough-variant asthma is a type of asthma in which the main symptom is a dry, nonproductive cough. 1493TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 234. D) The board of nursing Advanced practice registered nursing (APRN) practice is typically defined by the state nurse practice act and governed by the state board of nursing, but other laws and regulations may affect practice, and other boards may play a role. For instance, in some states nurse-midwives are regulated by a board of midwifery or public health. In other states, both the board of medicine and the board of nursing regulate nursing practice. 1494TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 235. A) Premedicate 10 to 15 minutes before starting exercise Exercise-induced asthma is best controlled by using the Proventil inhaler (bronchodilator) approximately 10 to 15 minutes before exercise, to prevent vasospasm of the bronchioles and shortness of breath with exercise. The effects of these bronchodilators usually last approximately 4 hours. They also work quickly to open up the bronchioles if an acute attack/shortness of breath occurs. 1495TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 236. A) Apical and radial pulses at the same time, then subtracting the difference between the two The pulse deficit is the difference between the apical pulse and the radial pulse.

Then subtract the radial from the apical. 1496644 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 237. D) Metronidazole (Flagyl) Preferred treatment for bacterial vaginosis is metronidazole (Flagyl), either orally or vaginally. An alternative clindamycin 2% cream vaginally (oil-based, can weaken latex condoms/diaphragms up to 5 days after use). Treatment for the partner is not recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2015), as there is no decrease in recurrences with partner treatment and no effect on cure rates. 1497TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 238. B) Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam The Lachman test is performed on the knee; a positive result is indicative of anterior cruciate ligament damage or rupture. The Romberg test is for assessment of the cerebellum. The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), also known as Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam , is performed to assess for cognitive impairment and dementia. It is also used to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment at a specific time and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time, thus making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment. Requiring about 10 minutes to complete, the MMSE samples several cognitive functions, including arithmetic, memory, and orientation. 1498TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 239. B) Treatment of acne Many states authorize minors to consent to contraceptive services (including pregnancy testing) and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases without parental consent. With the exception of abortion, lawmakers have generally resisted attempts to impose a parental consent or notification requirement on minors' access to reproductive health care and other sensitive services. But seeing a patient for acne treatment requires parental consent. 1499TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 240. B) Serum creatinine and estimated GFR (glomerular filtration rate) One of the best tests for assessing renal function is the estimated GFR, which requires the creatinine value so that it can be calculated using a mathematical formula (Cockcroft-Gault equation, others). Native Americans/Alaska Natives have the highest rate of diabetes of any group in the United States. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are used to evaluate liver function. Electrolytes are not used to evaluate renal function. 1500TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 241. A) Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor Hypertension is an important risk factor for the development and worsening of many complications of diabetes, including diabetic eye disease and kidney disease. Most people with diabetes develop high blood pressure during their lives. ACE inhibitors have been shown not only to be useful drugs to treat high blood pressure, but also to prevent or delay the progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes. 1501TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 242. C) Moderate persistent asthma The Global Initiative for Asthma has four clinical classifications of severity: intermittent (normal FEV1 between exacerbations, and severe persistent (FEV1 <60%). Daily symptoms with more than one nighttime episode of symptoms per week, 60% to 80% FEV1, and greater need for shortacting beta-2 agonist for symptom control are classified as moderate persistent severity in patients older than 12 years of age. 1502645 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 243. D) Psoriasis The Auspitz sign is simply bleeding that occurs after psoriasis scales have been removed. It occurs because the capillaries run very close to the surface of the skin under a psoriasis lesion, and removing the scale essentially pulls the tops off the capillaries, causing bleeding. Auspitz sign is also found in other scaling disorders such as actinic keratoses. 1503TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 244. C) Anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies These are the two types of antibodies that are positive in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody is also known as antimicrosomal antibody . Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States. The serum TSH and free T4 test are tests for hypothyroidism, but they are not specific for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease. 1504TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 245. C) Acute glaucoma The optic disc is the anatomical location of the eye's \"blind spot,\" the area where the optic nerve and blood vessels enter the retina. The optic disc can be flat or it can have a certain amount of normal cupping. But glaucoma, which is due to an increase in intraocular pressure, produces additional pathological cupping of the disc. The pink rim of the disc contains nerve fibers. The white cup is a pit with no nerve fibers. As glaucoma advances, the cup enlarges until it occupies most of the disc area. 1505TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 246. A) It is a slow or sudden painless loss of central vision Atrophic macular degeneration (AMD) occurs when the macula\u2014the central portion of the retina that is important for reading and color vision\u2014becomes damaged. This portion contains the fovea, with the largest number of cones in the eye, responsible for color vision and visual acuity. AMD is a single disease, but it can take two different forms: dry and wet. The atrophic or dry form of macular degeneration is the most common. There is a gradual withering of the visual cells and the blood vessels of the choroid (the vascular layer of tissue behind the retina). Usually the atrophic form results in only moderate loss of central vision. Although there is no medical or surgical treatment for the dry form of macular degeneration, eyesight may be helped somewhat by low-vision aids. These devices include magnifying lenses, brighter light for reading, or an electronic magnifier using a TV screen. 1506TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 247. C) Acute sinusitis The classic symptoms of acute sinusitis in adults usually follow a cold that does not improve, or one that worsens after 5 to 7 days of symptoms. Symptoms include bad breath or loss of smell; cough, often worse at night; fatigue and generally not feeling well; fever; headache (pressure-like pain, pain behind the eyes, toothache, or facial tenderness); nasal congestion and discharge; and sore throat and postnasal drip. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis are the same as those of acute sinusitis, but tend to be milder and last longer than 12 weeks. 1507TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 248. C) A thyroid storm Thyroid storm is a life-threatening condition that develops in cases of untreated thyrotoxicosis (hyperthyroidism). This is an emergency condition. If suspected, call 911 or another emergency number. A thyroid storm is usually brought on by stress such as trauma or an infection. Symptoms are severe and include agitation, change in alertness (consciousness), confusion, diarrhea, fever, tachycardia, restlessness, shaking, and sweating. 1508646 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 249. B) Fluorescein stain Corneal abrasions result from cutting, scratching, or abrading the thin, protective, clear coat of the exposed anterior portion of the ocular epithelium. These injuries cause pain, tearing, photophobia, foreign-body sensation, and a gritty feeling. Symptoms can be worsened by exposure to light, blinking, and rubbing the injured surface against the inside of the eyelid. The diagnosis of corneal abrasion can be confirmed by visualizing the cornea under cobalt-blue filtered light after the application of fluorescein, which will cause the abrasion to appear green. If examination is limited by pain, instillation of a topical anesthetic (e.g., proparacaine [Ophthetic], tetracaine [Pontocaine]) may be needed. During the examination, it is important to assess for and remove any foreign bodies, some of which may leave a rust residue. 1509TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 250. B) Inability to swallow Bell's palsy (acute idiopathic facial nerve palsy) is caused by inflammation of cranial nerve VII (facial nerve). CN VII does not innervate the throat, so swallowing is not affected. Signs and symptoms of Bell's palsy come on suddenly and may include rapid onset of mild weakness to total paralysis on one side of the face occurring within hours to days, making it difficult to smile or close the eye on the affected side. Other symptoms are facial droop and difficulty making facial expressions, pain around the jaw or in or behind the ear on the affected side, increased sensitivity to sound on the affected side, headache, a decrease in ability to taste, and changes in the amount of tears and saliva produced. In rare cases, Bell's palsy can affect the nerves on both sides of the face. Early treatment with oral glucocorticoids (prednisone) is recommended. If herpes simplex 1 infection is suspected, use combined therapy with valacyclovir (Valtrex) and prednisone for 1 week. 1510TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 251. A) Bacterial pneumonia Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung especially affecting the alveoli. It is associated with fever, chest symptoms, and consolidation on a chest x-ray. Infectious agents include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Consolidation is not present in the lungs with bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or atypical pneumonia. 1511TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 252. B) Vesicular breath sounds There are two normal breath sounds. Breath sounds heard over the tracheobronchial tree are called bronchial breathing and breath sounds heard over the lung tissue are called vesicular breathing . Vesicular breath sounds are heard best over the base of the lungs. Vesicular sounds are soft and/or blowing, heard throughout inspiration, and fade away with expiration. Bronchial sounds are heard over the bronchi, the largest tubes in the anterior chest. Sounds are loud and high pitched. Tracheal breath sounds are heard over the trachea. These sound harsh and similar to air being blown through a pipe. 1512TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 253. A) <140/90 mmHg The Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) blood pressure goal for adults and older adults 60 years of age or older who have diabetes (with or without chronic kidney disease) is blood pressure less than 140/90. In addition, all patients with hypertension should have lifestyle intervention (i.e., weight loss, smoking cessation, healthy diet), which should be continued throughout treatment. 1513TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 254. A) Nedocromil sodium (Tilade) Nedocromil sodium (Tilade) is a mast cell stabilizer. Mast cell stabilizers can be used to treat mild to moderate inflammation in the bronchial tubes and other allergy symptoms. These medications can also be used to prevent asthma symptoms during exercise and can be given before exposure to an allergen when it cannot be avoided. It may take several weeks before the full effects are felt. 1514647 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 255. A) A patch of leukoplakia Leukoplakia mainly affects the mucous membranes of the mouth. It is thought to be caused by irritation. Leukoplakia are patches on the tongue, in the mouth, or on the inside of the cheek that occur in response to long-term irritation, including smoking, holding chewing tobacco or snuff in the mouth for a long period, or other tobacco use, especially pipes (smoker's keratosis). Leukoplakia on the tongue is also an early sign of HIV. 1515TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 256. B) The nurse practitioner may be exempted from the lawsuit if documentation is thorough and can be verified Medical malpractice extends to every health care profession, including nurse practitioners (NPs). As NPs assume an expanded role in the health care industry, related legal issues increase. 1516TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 257. B) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) The best screening test for both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism is TSH level. A normal TSH rules out primary hypothyroidism in asymptomatic patients. Abnormal TSH should be followed by determination of thyroid hormone levels. Overt hypothyroidism is defined as a clinical syndrome of hypothyroidism associated with elevated TSH and decreased serum levels of T4 or T3. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as a condition without typical symptoms of hypothyroidism, elevated TSH (>5 U/mL), and normal circulating thyroid hormone. Overt thyrotoxicosis is defined as the syndrome of hyperthyroidism associated with suppressed TSH and elevated serum levels T4 or T3. Subclinical thyrotoxicosis is devoid of symptoms, but TSH is suppressed, although there are normal circulating levels of thyroid hormone. 1517TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 258. B) Brudzinski's maneuver A stiff neck or nuchal rigidity is a sign of meningitis and intracranial hemorrhage. Brudzinski's sign may also be present when neck stiffness is assessed. Flexion of the hips and knees when flexing the neck is a positive Brudzinski's sign for meningeal irritation. 1518TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 259. A) Women aged 50 years or older Women have a greater risk of developing thyroid disease than men. Being age 50 or older increases the risk of thyroid disease for both men and women. Screening for thyroid disease is therefore recommended for women 50 years of age and older. 1519TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 260. B) Order a spot urine for microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio The American Diabetes Association (ADA) now prefers a spot urine for microalbumin and creatinine ratio (ACR) test instead of a urine albumin test. Use the first morning void sample. The ACR has high predictive value for albuminuria and early kidney disease in patients with prediabetes, diabetes, and hypertension (McCulloch & Bakris, 2016). Because the patient has type 2 diabetes, both an annual urinalysis and an annual ACR test are recommended. Regarding the urinalysis result, a few epithelial cells is within normal limits. 1520648 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 261. D) Varicocele Palpation of varicose veins, described as a \"bag of worms,\" in the scrotum is a classic symptom of a varicocele, an abnormal tortuosity and dilation of the veins of the pampiniform plexus. It is most common on the left testicle and it can be asymptomatic or cause a dull aching sensation upon standing. It occurs in boys and young men and is associated with reduced fertility. The condition is often visible only when the patient is standing. Testicular torsion is an emergent condition in which the testicle becomes twisted, interrupting the blood supply to the testis; to avoid damage, the condition must be corrected within 6 hours. 1521TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 262. D) Decreased anxiety and depression are common symptoms of abuse in the elderly In an abusive situation, the patient may experience increased anxiety, may not want the nurse practitioner to see his or her unclothed body, may not speak in front of the abuser, and may exhibit depression and despair. A new onset of a sexually transmitted disease (STD) may indicate signs of sexual abuse. These patients commonly delay treatment for acute and chronic conditions. 1522TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 263. A) Closure of the atrioventricular valves A heart valve normally allows blood to flow in only one direction. A heart valve opens or closes incumbent upon differential blood pressure on each side. A form of heart disease occurs when a valve malfunctions and allows some blood to flow in the wrong direction. The S1 heart sound is caused by turbulence caused by the closure of mitral and tricuspid valves at the start of systole. 1523TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 264. D) Melanoma People with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) develop a syndrome of dementia that has the same characteristics as Alzheimer's disease occurring in individuals without Down syndrome. The only difference is that Alzheimer's disease occurs much earlier in people with Down syndrome; patients with Down syndrome begin to have symptoms in their late 40s or early 50s. Children with Down syndrome who participate in certain sports activities must be carefully examined for an unstable neck and heart disease prior to participation to prevent injury. In the United States, atlantoaxial instability with or without subluxation has been reported in as many as 10% to 30% of individuals with Down syndrome. Children with Down syndrome are at a much higher risk for congenital heart disease. Types of defects include atrioventricular septal defects (most common), ventricular of Fallot. 1524TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 265. D) Elevated creatinine level Infectious mononucleosis is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Symptoms consist of lymphadenopathy, fever, hepatosplenomegaly, malaise, and abdominal discomfort in adolescents and young adults. Host immune response to the viral infection includes CD8+ T lymphocytes with suppressor and cytotoxic functions, the characteristic atypical lymphocytes found in the peripheral blood. EBV antibodies may be ordered when symptoms suggest mononucleosis, but a mono test is negative. A positive test for IgM antibodies is most likely a current, or a very recent, EBV infection. With a positive IgG concentration, it is highly likely that the patient recently had an EBV infection. EBV infection does not infect the kidneys; therefore, the serum creatinine is not affected. But EBV can infect the brain/nerves, bone marrow, liver, and other organs. It is also associated with certain cancers. 1525TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 266. A) Document the nurse's behavior and file an incident report Because the co- worker is only suspected of narcotics addiction, the documentation of the date/behaviors observed will be needed for further evaluation, which may include reporting to the board of nursing and placement in the impaired nurse program. 1526649 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 267. B) Mitral stenosis The low-frequency rumbling murmur of mitral stenosis is and progresses with severity from a short decrescendo murmur to a longer crescendo murmur. It is best heard at the fifth intercostal space, 8 to 9 cm from the midsternal line, slightly medial to the midclavicular line, and does not radiate. Because it is low pitched, it is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope. Aortic regurgitation is a high-pitched diastolic murmur, heard at the second ICS to the right of the sternum. Mitral regurgitation is a pansystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla, and is loud and high pitched when auscultated. 1527TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 268. D) A 37-year-old male biker with a concussion due to a fall who is slightly agitated and does not appear to understand instructions given by the medical assistant checking his vital signs The biker who had the concussion is the emergent situation due to his agitation and his inability to follow directions, which could mean he has some type of brain trauma. A concussion is a traumatic brain injury (TBI) that may result in a bad headache, altered levels of alertness, or unconsciousness. The following are emergency symptoms for which immediate medical care should be sought: changes in alertness and consciousness, seizures, muscle weakness on one or both sides, persistent confusion, repeated vomiting, unequal pupils, unusual eye movements, problems with walking, or coma. The patient on aspirin who has a laceration can be treated with pressure to stop the bleeding until help arrives. The elderly man with abdominal pain has apparently normal vital signs. Tachycardia is common in patients with fever. 1528TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 269. B) Decreased mobility of the tympanic membrane as measured by tympanogram Acute suppurative otitis media is an acute infection affecting the mucosal lining of the middle ear and the mastoid air system. Suppurative stage: The tympanic membrane bulges and spontaneously through a small perforation in the pars tensa. Ear discharge is usually present. Diagnosis is usually made simply by looking at the eardrum through an otoscope. The eardrum will appear red and swollen, and may appear either abnormally drawn inward or bulging outward. Using the tympanogram with the otoscope allows a puff of air to be blown lightly into the ear. Normally, this should cause movement of the eardrum. In an infection, or when there is fluid behind the eardrum, this movement may be decreased or absent. 1529TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 270. C) Status asthmaticus Status asthmaticus is a medical emergency in which asthma symptoms are refractory to initial bronchodilator therapy in the emergency department. Typically, patients present a few days after the onset of a viral respiratory illness, following exposure to a potent allergen or irritant, or after exercise in a cold environment. Frequently, patients have underused or have been underprescribed anti-inflammatory therapy. Normally, the pulsus paradoxus (i.e., the difference in systolic blood pressure between inspiration and expiration) does not exceed 15 mmHg. In patients with severe asthma, a pulsus paradoxus of greater than 25 mmHg usually indicates severe airway obstruction. 1530TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 271. C) Her son can participate in some sports after he has been checked for cervical instability Atlantoaxial instability (AAI) denotes increased mobility at the articulation of the first and second cervical vertebrae (atlantoaxial joint). The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a position statement in 1984 on AAI and Down syndrome (DS): All children with DS who wish to participate in sports should have cervical spine x-rays. Repeated x-rays are not indicated for children with DS who have had a previously normal neck x-ray.

A) Erythema migrans Erythema migrans is the rash characteristic of Lyme disease, which appears usually 7 to 10 days after a tick bite. Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochete. The rash appears either as a single expanding red patch or a central spot surrounded by clear skin that is in turn ringed by an expanded red rash (bull's eye). The choice of antibiotic depends on bacterial sensitivity. Doxycycline 100 mg BID for 14 to 21 days is the recommended treatment for adults. 1532TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 273. A) Cimetidine (Tagamet), digoxin (Lanoxin), diphenhydramine (Benadryl) Drugs to avoid in the elderly population appear on the Beers Criteria Medication list. The American Geriatrics Society updates the Beers list based on evidence-based recommendations. Cimetidine, digoxin, and diphenhydramine have many adverse effects. Elderly patients taking cimetidine are at risk for neuropsychiatric changes, which may be temporarily reversed by physostigmine. Older patients are also more likely to develop toxicity, and diagnosis of digoxin toxicity can be difficult in this group. Benadryl can worsen glaucoma, a consideration for elderly individuals. Thick oral secretions are also a side effect, making the medication unsafe for the elderly with lung disease. It can also cause high blood pressure, a common ailment associated with aging. 1533TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 274.

The procedure to test CN V includes inspection for muscle atrophy and tremor, palpation of jaw muscles for tone and strength when the patient clenches teeth, testing of superficial pain and touch sensation in each branch, and testing of temperature sensation if there are unexpected findings to pain or touch. A wisp of cotton is used to test the corneal reflex. 1535TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 276. A) Lateralization to one ear The Weber test is a quick screening test for hearing. It can detect unilateral conductive hearing loss (middle ear hearing loss) and unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (inner ear hearing loss). In the Weber test, a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead, above the upper lip, under the nose, over the teeth, or on top of the head equidistant from the patient's ears on top of thin skin in contact with the bone. In a normal patient, the Weber tuning fork sound is heard equally loud in both ears, with no one ear hearing the sound louder than the other (lateralization). In a patient with hearing loss (otitis media, cerumenosis), the Weber tuning fork sound is heard louder in one ear (lateralization) versus the other (the \"bad\" ear). 1536TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 277. D) Cheilosis Cheilosis or angular cheilosis (perleche) is an acute or chronic inflammation of the labial mucosa and adjacent skin due to excessive moisture and/or salivation.

Lifestyle measures are weight-bearing exercises and adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. 1538TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 279. D) These fractures always require surgical intervention to stabilize the joint Common signs and symptoms of a fracture of the navicular area include pain, swelling, and tenderness over the thumb side of the wrist, and \"crunchiness\" and pain with gripping motions. Immediately following the injury, the fracture may not be found on x-ray, leading to misdiagnosis as a sprain. This fracture may be more accurately diagnosed with a bone scan if it does not appear on an x-ray. However, fracture is usually visible if the x-ray is repeated in 2 weeks. Treatment depends largely on the severity and shape of the fracture line. Fractures that are not displaced (those where the break line is small) are immobilized (casting). Nondisplaced fractures that do not heal after 3 to 4 months often require surgical intervention, and the use of other modalities, such as electrical stimulation. 1539TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 280.

It appears red with clear blisters, blanches with pressure, has a moist texture, and is painful to sensation. A second- degree burn takes 2 to 3 weeks to heal. First- and second-degree burns are appropriately treated by a nurse practitioner. Third-degree burns should be referred to a physician. Examples of third-degree burns include electrical burns, severe burns on the face, and burns involving cartilage, such as the ear and nose. 1561TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 302. B) Second intercostal space, left sternal border The S2 heart sound is physiologically split in about 90% of people. The second heart sound is produced by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. The sound produced by the closure of the aortic valve is termed A2 and the sound produced by the closure of the pulmonic valve is termed P2 . The A2 sound is normally much louder than the P2 due to higher pressures in the left side of the heart; thus, A2 radiates to all cardiac listening posts (loudest at the right upper sternal border) and P2 is usually only heard at the left upper sternal border. 1562TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 303. A) <150/90 mmHg For the general population (no diabetes or chronic kidney disease) the recommended systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal at age 60 years or older goes up by 10 mmHg to blood pressure less than 150/90.

B) Her son's physical development is delayed and should be evaluated by a pediatric endocrinologist Puberty may be delayed for several years and still occur normally, in which case it is considered constitutional delay, a variation of healthy physical development. Delay of puberty may also occur due to malnutrition, many forms of systemic disease, or to defects of the reproductive system (hypogonadism) or the body's responsiveness to sex hormones. Hypogonadism occurs when the sex glands produce little or no hormones. In men, these glands (gonads) are the testes. A 16-year-old male without secondary sexual characteristics should be referred to an endocrinologist. If there is no testicular development by 14 years of age, an endocrinology consult is warranted. 1565TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 306.

Systemic treatment ranges from oral steroids and retinoids to biologic agents, methotrexate, and cyclosporine. Topical tar is in the psoralen drug class. 1569TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 310. D) Color vision There are two types of photoreceptors in the human retina: rods and cones. Cones are active at higher light levels (photopic vision), and are capable of color vision and night vision, as well as high spatial acuity. The central fovea is populated exclusively by cones. There are three types of cones referred to as short- wavelength sensitive cones, middle-wavelength sensitive cones , and long-wavelength sensitive cones \u2014S-cones, M-cones, and L-cones for short. Rods are responsible for vision at low light levels (scotopic vision). They do not mediate color vision, and have a low spatial acuity. 1570TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 311. B) The typical lesions are bullae Herpes zoster (shingles) occurs secondary to reactivation of the varicella-zoster (VZV) virus. This infection can be more severe in immunocompromised patients due to their inability to fight infection. Shingles rash starts as small blisters on a red base, with new blisters continuing to form for 3 to 5 days. The rash is painful, and commonly appears in clusters, following one dermatome on one side of the body. When the trigeminal nerve is involved, there is an increased risk of corneal blindness. 1571TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 312.

A) Vigorous massage of the prostate A prostate massage should never be done in a patient with suspected acute prostatitis, as this may induce sepsis. Acute prostatitis is associated with chills, fever, pain in the lower back and genital area, urinary frequency and urgency (often at night), burning or painful urination, body aches, and a demonstrable infection of the urinary tract, as evidenced by white blood cells and bacteria in the urine. Acute prostatitis is considered a medical emergency. It should be distinguished from other forms of prostatitis such as chronic bacterial prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS). 1574TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 315. A) Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men and the second leading cause of cancer-specific deaths in U.S. males. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that the PSA blood test no longer be offered to men for early detection of prostate cancer. This federal agency concluded that the benefits of early detection of prostate cancer are outweighed by the risks of both diagnosis and treatment. However, the American Urological Association recommends regular PSA screening for all men older than 40 years of age. 1575TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 316. A) Temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis) Temporal arteritis (TA) is inflammation and damage to blood vessels that supply the head area, particularly the large or medium arteries that branch from the neck and supply the temporal area. Headache is the most common chief complaint and presents in over two thirds of patients with temporal arteritis. The headache tends to be new or different in character than previous headaches and is typically sudden in onset, localizing to the temporal region. Vision difficulties that occur with TA include blurred, double, or reduced vision. Blindness may occur in one or both eyes. Any new headache in patients older than 50 years warrants a consideration of TA. The patient should be instructed to stop smoking. 1576TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 317. D) Chlamydia trachomatis Although Chlamydia may seem like an obvious candidate to cause systemic infections, because it can ascend to the uterus and affect a variety of sites, including the eyes and the rectum, the specific type of Chlamydia that causes genital infections is not generally thought to cause systemic infections. The predominant infections are urethritis, cervicitis, and proctitis, but chlamydial infection can spread locally to the Bartholin glands, endosalpinges, or epididymis. Up to 40% of untreated cases of chlamydial cervicitis will ascend into the upper genital tract, where considerable tubal damage can occur with very few symptoms. 1577TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 318. B) CN VIII The acoustic nerve, cranial nerve VIII is being evaluated when the Rinne test is performed. The Rinne test is performed by placing the base of a vibrating tuning fork against the patient's mastoid bone to evaluate bone conduction.

B) Oral tetracycline One antibiotic often prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe acne is tetracycline. The medication is not recommended for acne that is not moderate or severe. It helps control acne by curbing the growth of bacteria and reducing inflammation, which results in fewer pimples and less redness. Because of its poor side effect profile and teratogenicity, isotretinoin (Accutane) must by prescribed by a physician who is a registered member of the manufacturer's System to Manage Accutane-Related Teratogenicity program and have parental/guardian consent if the patient is under age 18. 1580657 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 321. C) Atrophy of the sebaceous glands Sebaceous glands produce less oil as one ages. Men experience a minimal decrease, usually after the age of 80. Women gradually produce less oil beginning after menopause. This can make it harder to keep the skin moist, resulting in dryness and itchiness, but it does not lead to thinner skin. Thinner skin is the result of decreased collagen and loss of subcutaneous fat. 1581TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 322. D) It reviews information via a nongovernmental agency The state board of nursing (SBON) is a regulatory agency created by the state government and is devoted to monitoring nurses' personal and professional behaviors.

A) Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Health care providers in every state in the United States are required by law to tell their state board of health about anyone diagnosed with gonorrhea. Symptoms of gonorrhea usually appear 2 to 5 days after infection; however, in men, symptoms may take up to a month to appear. Early symptoms include dysuria, increased urinary frequency/urgency, white/yellow/green penile discharge, red or edematous urethra, and tender/swollen testicles. If the infection spreads systemically, fever, rash, and arthritis-like symptoms may occur. 1585TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 326. C) Macrolides The Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults state that if a patient is previously healthy with no risk factors for drug-resistant Staphylococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) infection treatment, the use of a macrolide antibiotic (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin) for CAP is preferred. 1586TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 327. D) Neovascularization and microaneurysms The severity of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) can be graded as mild, moderate, severe, or very severe. In mild disease, microaneurysms are present with hemorrhage or hard exudates (lipid transudates). In moderate NPDR, these findings are associated with cotton-wool spots (focal infarcts of the retinal nerve fiber layer or areas of axoplasmic stasis) or intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (either retinal vessels or intraretinal neovascularization). 1587TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 328. B) This is a normal finding due to the skeletal growth spurt in this age group The rapid bone growth during growth spurts and adolescence elevates the alkaline phosphatase level. Alkaline phosphatase levels are higher in children and adolescents due to physiologic osteoblastic activity. Most of the serum alkaline phosphatase in the body comes mainly from the liver and bones. 1588658 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 329. B) Irrigate with normal saline and apply Silvadene cream BID Silvadene (silver sulfadiazine) is the initial cream used for suspected partial and full- thickness burns (second and third degree). It contains silver sulfadiazine in micronized form, which has broad microbial activity. It is bactericidal against many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as being effective against yeasts. Silvadene is a sulfa drug and should not be used on someone who has a sulfa allergy. It should be used on external areas only. 1589TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 330.

A) The patient becomes very agitated, confused, and aggressive after sunset and throughout the night with resolution of symptoms in the morning \"Sundowning\" is a psychological phenomenon associated with increased confusion and restlessness in patients with some forms of dementia, most common in Alzheimer's disease, but also mixed dementia. The term sundowning was coined due to the timing of the patient's confusion. Sundowning seems to occur more frequently during the middle stages of Alzheimer's disease and mixed dementia. Symptoms include increased general confusion as natural light begins to fade and shadows increase. Agitation and mood swings\u2014yelling and becoming upset with the caregiver \u2014are not uncommon, along with fatigue, tremors, increase in restlessness. Restlessness can lead to pacing or wandering. 1593TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 334. D) Acute abdomen Suspected ruptured appendix or a pelvic abscess irritates the lateral iliopsoas muscle. The patient should be in the supine position; place your hand over the lower thigh for testing. To perform the iliopsoas muscle test, ask the patient to raise the leg, flexing at the hip, while you push downward against the leg. An alternate technique is to have the patient lie on the left side and ask the patient to raise the right leg from the hip while you press downward against it. The iliopsoas muscle test is positive if the patient experiences lower quadrant pain. 1594TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 335.

They are tested by inspecting the eyelids for drooping, and inspecting pupil size for equality and their direct and consensual response to light and accommodation. 1595659 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 336. A) Hemoglobin electrophoresis Review the complete blood count and reticulocyte count for clues to the diagnosis or complicating diseases. Hemoglobin electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing are the most commonly used tests for the diagnosis of sickle hemoglobinopathies. Although the definitive diagnosis of thalassemia syndromes requires direct DNA-based techniques, hemoglobin electrophoresis is a useful ancillary test to differentiate thalassemias from the sickle hemoglobinopathies and to help differentiate among the thalassemias. 1596TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 337. C) Overweight patients Metformin (Glucophage) often causes weight loss. Metformin may rarely cause a serious, life-threatening condition called lactic acidosis . Patients with dehydration, renal disease, and alcoholism (especially binge drinking) increase their risk for developing lactic acidosis. 1597TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 338. C) Bacterial pneumonia The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia is other important bacteria that cause pneumonia. Typically, pneumonia comes on very quickly; the patient has high fever/chills, productive cough with yellow or brown sputum, shortness of breath, and may have chest pain with breathing/coughing. The gold standard for diagnosing bacterial pneumonia is the chest x-ray, which shows infiltrates and/or lobar consolidation Older people can have confusion or a change in their mental abilities. In patients with bacterial pneumonia, it is important to determine whether bacteria are present in the urine in order to identify appropriate antibiotics to treat the bacteria. 1598TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 339. B) Azithromycin ER (Zmax) This is the first antipneumonia antibiotic approved for single-dose delivery. 1599TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 340. B) Beta-blockers Beta-blockers require a gradual reduction in dose. Suddenly stopping a beta-blocker can sometimes cause problems such as palpitations, a rise in blood pressure, or a recurrence of angina pains. 1600TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 341. C) Osteoporosis Kyphosis is a curving of the spine that causes a bowing or rounding of the back, which leads to a hunchback (dowager hump) or slouching posture. Adult kyphosis can be caused by degenerative diseases of the spine such as disk disease or arthritis, fractures caused by osteoporosis/osteoporotic compression fracture, injury/trauma, and slippage of one vertebra forward on another (spondylolisthesis). 1601TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 342. C) Thayer-Martin culture Thayer-Martin Selective Agar is an enriched medium for the selective isolation of Neisseria species. N. gonorrhoeae is a gram- negative bacteria that can infect the genitourinary and reproductive tracts, throat, eyes (infants), and rectum. Thayer-Martin culture is recommended for screening to diagnose gonorrheal pharyngitis or proctitis. 1602660 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 343. D) Loretta Ford Loretta Ford, PhD, RN, FAAN, is considered the founder of the nurse practitioner (NP) movement, and has received many awards for her work. Ford has graduate degrees in nursing, a doctorate from the University of Colorado, and was certified as a public health nurse. In the early 1960s, she and pediatrician Henry K. Silver were colleagues at the University of Colorado. With a regional shortage of family care physicians and pediatricians hampering health care delivery to rural and underserved areas, they saw that innovation was needed to solve the problem. Using a small grant from the university, in 1965 they created a demonstration project focusing on extending the nurse's role in the community. They published their findings and developed an educational curriculum for NPs. Other schools followed and started their own NP programs. 1603TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 344. A) Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and hypertension Terazosin (Hytrin) is a treatment option for men with BPH and hypertension. Symptoms of BPH include difficulty urinating (hesitation, dribbling, weak stream, and incomplete bladder emptying), painful urination, and urinary frequency and urgency. Terazosin is in a class of medications called alpha-blockers . It relieves the symptoms of BPH by relaxing the muscles of the bladder and prostate. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body. 1604TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 345. C) Migraine headaches Papilledema is swelling of the optic disc that is secondary to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). It can be caused by a brain or encephalitis, hematoma, idiopathic hydrocephalus. The symptoms suggestive of increased ICP are new onset of headache that is worse in the morning or worsens when the person lays down. Other symptoms are binocular horizontal diploplia, nausea, and vomiting. A pulsatile machinery-like sound in the ear (due to venous sinus obstruction) may be present. 1605TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 346. A) Document the patient's behavior in his record and the action taken by the nurse Patients have the right to refuse their medications. Bipolar disorder tends to worsen if it is not treated. Explain that there is a good chance that manic and depressive episodes will become more frequent and severe over time. If a patient is noncompliant, the patient behavior and the actions taken by the nurse both must be documented. 1606TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 347. B) This is a benign finding The S2 heart sound is physiologically split in about 90% of people. The second heart sound is produced by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. The sound produced by the closure of the aortic valve is termed A2 , and the sound produced by the closure of the pulmonic valve is termed P2 . The A2 sound is normally much louder than the P2 due to higher pressures in the left side of the heart; thus, A2 radiates to all cardiac listening posts (loudest at the right upper sternal border) and P2 is usually only heard at the left upper sternal border. 1607TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 348. A) Informed consent The most important goal of informed consent is that the patient has an opportunity to be an informed participant in his or her own health care decisions. It is generally accepted that complete informed consent includes a discussion of the following elements: the nature of the decision/procedure; reasonable alternatives to the proposed intervention; the relevant risks, benefits, and uncertainties related to each alternative; assessment of patient understanding; and the acceptance of the intervention by the patient. 1608TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 349. A) Reduce intake of potassium because of its cardiac effects Lifestyle modifications for hypertension (HTN) include losing weight (especially waistline); regular exercise; DASH diet\u2014lots of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy; and limited saturated fat. Potassium can lessen the effects of sodium on HTN. Calcium helps to produce the heartbeat, and magnesium regulates it. Reduce sodium; limit to 2,300 mg/day. Limit ethanol (ETOH). 1609661 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 350. C) Tertiary prevention Art therapy is an example of tertiary prevention. Primary prevention involves methods to avoid occurrence of disease, including health screening and promotion. Secondary prevention involves diagnosis and treatment of existing disease in early stages before it causes significant morbidity. Tertiary prevention involves methods to reduce the negative impact of an existing disease by restoring function and reducing disease-related complications. 1610TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 351. B) Antibiotics Experts recommend that antibiotics not be used for acute bronchitis. Antibiotics reduce coughing slightly, but most people who have bronchitis improve without antibiotics. In people who also have symptoms of a common cold but have no signs of pneumonia, antibiotics generally are not effective. 1611TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 352. A) ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) Because the patient has type 2 diabetes, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an ARB should be prescribed, as these agents help protect the kidneys. Under JNC 8, you can prescribe two drugs as the initial therapy. There are many types of combination antihypertensive medications, including a thiazide with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, or a calcium channel blocker with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. Beta-blockers are not considered first line unless there is an indication (e.g., postmyocardial infarction). 1612TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 353. D) CAGE test The CAGE assessment is: C\u2014Have you ever tried to Cut back on your use? A\u2014Have you ever been Annoyed/Angered when questioned about your use? G\u2014Have you ever felt Guilty about your use? E\u2014Have you ever had an Eye- opener to get started in the morning? 1613TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 354 . B) Initiate a prescription of metformin (Glucophage) 500 mg PO daily In this case, the patient has two episodes of high fasting blood glucose (FBG; 140 mg/dL and 168 mg/dL), high A1C (8.5%), and high random blood glucose (210 mg/dL), which meets the criteria for diabetes. There are four criteria for diagnosing diabetes (American Diabetes Association, 2016): FBG 126 mg/dL, 2-hour postprandial glucose (PG) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), A1C 6.5%, and random PG 200 mg/dL in individuals with symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. This patient has type 2 diabetes. The first-line drug treatment is metformin (Glucophage). A common side effect of metformin is gastrointestinal distress such as diarrhea and flatulence. To help minimize this adverse effect, start at the lowest dose and titrate up based on the A1C value. The A1C is checked every 3 months when initiating treatment. Target A1C is less than 7%. Lifestyle therapy should always accompany drug treatment. 1614TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 355. D) Patients who exercise vigorously in the afternoon may have hypoglycemic episodes in the evening or at night if they do not eat a snack or meal after the activity This is a true statement. Another way for type 1 diabetics to avoid hypoglycemia caused by vigorous physical activity is to decrease their insulin dose and/or to eat a snack before the activity and/or after the activity. 1615662 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 356. A) Blue dot sign All prepubertal and young adult males with acute scrotal pain should be considered to have testicular torsion until proven otherwise. The finding of an ipsilateral absent cremasteric reflex is one of the signs of testicular torsion. But the clinical finding of the blue dot sign (i.e., tender nodule with blue discoloration on the upper pole of the testis) along with a normal testicle and intact cremasteric reflex points to a nonemergent cause, such as the of a testicular appendage (appendix testes). If testicular torsion is suspected, refer to the emergency department or call 911. Treatment involves rapid restoration of blood flow to the affected testis. The optimal time frame for treatment is less than 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. 1616TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 357. A) Left heart failure Heart failure (HF) signs and symptoms arise from congested organs and hypoperfused tissues. Left-sided (systolic) HF is the most common cause of HF. The ventricle loses some ability to contract and lacks the power to pump the oxygenated blood out. Side effects include dyspnea, fatigue, chronic cough or wheezing, rapid or irregular heart rate, lack of appetite/nausea, mental confusion, edema, and rapid weight gain. 1617TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 358. D) Hypertension Hypertension is not associated with an increase in mortality with pneumonia. But patients with multiple lobar involvement, infants, the elderly, those with chronic illnesses (including cirrhosis of the liver, congestive heart failure), individuals without a functioning spleen, and those who have other diseases that result in a weakened immune system experience complications. Patients with immune disorders or various types of cancer, transplant patients, and AIDS patients also experience complications. An alcohol-impaired pulmonary immune system is no defense against pneumonia-producing bacteria. 1618TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 359. A) Streptococcus pneumoniae Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the sixth most common cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of death from infectious diseases. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and poses a major economic burden to the health care system. S. pneumoniae is the leading cause of CAP. 1619TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 360. B) Initiate a prescription of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg PO daily The Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)-recommended pharmacologic treatment for Black adult hypertensive patients (without chronic kidney disease or diabetes) is a thiazide-type diuretic or calcium channel blocker (CCB), used alone or in combination. For White adults, the JNC 8 recommends a thiazide-type diuretic or and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or a CCB, used alone or in combination. Do not combine an ACE inhibitor with an ARB. Although unusual, a serious adverse effect from these two drug classes is angioedema. Beta-blockers should be avoided in patients with chronic lung disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), because they can cause bronchoconstriction. 1620TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 361. A) Severe ulceration of the stomach or duodenum Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a type of tumor (gastrinoma) that is usually located in the head of the pancreas and/or the upper small intestine. It causes increased production of the hormone gastrin, which stimulates excessive hydrochloric acid production. The result is multiple gastric and/or duodenal ulcers, intestinal bleeding, or intestinal perforation. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the first choice for medical treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. PPIs reduce acid production by the stomach, and promote healing of ulcers in the stomach and small intestine. About one half to two thirds of single gastrinomas are malignant tumors, which can metastasize and cause death. Surgical removal of the tumor, chemotherapy, and radiation are used, depending on the stage of the cancer. 1621663 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 362. C) Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) is a fluoroquinolone class antibiotic and is an FDA pregnancy category C. Most medications used in pregnancy are category B drugs. The pregnancy category of a pharmaceutical agent is an assessment of the risk of fetal injury if it is used as directed by the mother during pregnancy. Category A = adequate well-controlled studies failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester and no evidence of risk in the later trimesters. Category B = animal studies have shown an adverse effect, but adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in any trimester. Category C = animal studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, and potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. Category D = there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. Category X = studies in animals for humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities; the risks involved clearly outweigh the potential benefits. 1622TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 363. B) Psoriasis Nail abnormalities are problems with the texture, color, shape, or thickness of the fingernails or toenails. Psoriasis may cause pitting, splitting of the nail plate from the nailbed, and chronic destruction of the nail plate (nail dystrophy). 1623TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 364. C) It is best heard at the apex during S1 Mitral regurgitation results from prolapse [MVP], rheumatic heart disease, Most patients are initially asymptomatic. The best ausculatory area is the apex or mitral area of the chest. Mitral regurgitation is a systolic (S1) murmur. It may be associated with a midsystolic click if the patient has concurrent MVP. The click is so characteristic of MVP that even without a subsequent murmur, its presence alone is enough for the diagnosis. Immediately after the click, a brief crescendo-decrescendo murmur is heard, usually at the apex. The best imaging test for identifying mitral regurgitation is transthoracic echocardiography. 1624TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 365. B) Acute appendicitis Symptoms of an acute abdomen, such as appendicitis, include extreme tenderness and involuntary guarding at McBurney's point. McBurney's point is the name given to the point over the right side of the abdomen that is one third of the distance (approximately 2 inches) from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. This point roughly corresponds to the most common location of the base of the appendix where it is attached to the cecum. (During pregnancy the location of the appendix changes as the uterus grows.) 1625TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 366. C) Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa is an uncommon cause of community- acquired pneumonia. It is more common in patients with cystic fibrosis and hospitalized patients. In mild cases, it can be treated with ciprofloxacin (Cipro) or levofloxacin (Levaquin), which are fluoroquinolones. P. aeruginosa is resistant to several antibiotics and it can be tricky to treat. Many patients need hospitalization. 1626664 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 367. C) Adrenal glands The adrenal glands are not considered target organs of hypertension. The body structures most vulnerable to high blood pressure include the blood vessels (including eyes), heart, brain, and kidneys (target organs). Over time, the effects of hypertension can include a heart attack, kidney damage/failure, congestive heart failure, and damage to the retina. Hypertensive retinopathy findings are silver wire and copper wire arterioles and arteriovenous (AV) nicking. 1627TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 368. B) Call 911 Heavy chest pressure in the substernal area, radiating to the jaw; diaphoresis; low blood pressure; and bradycardia are signs of cardiac distress. This patient is exhibiting classic symptoms of a myocardial infarction and needs immediate treatment. Call 911 immediately and transfer the patient to the emergency department. 1628TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 369. C) H2 receptor blockers For uncomplicated cases of peptic ulcer disease that are Helicobacter pylori negative, the first-line agents are the (Tagamet). If these are not effective, the next step would be to try a proton-pump inhibitor. 1629TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 370. D) Furosemide (Lasix) No interactions have been erythromycin and Lasix. The cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system plays a significant role in drug metabolism, particularly with regard to drug interactions. Erythromycin has been shown to potentiate the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin. Erythromycins inhibit the metabolism of theophylline, increasing the risk for theophylline toxicity. Modification of the antibiotic erythromycin with the CYP450 system also detoxifies such diverse drugs as codeine, diazepam (Valium), paclitaxel (Taxol), and several anti-HIV drugs. This will slow down the detoxification of drugs, which may cause them to have stronger effects than expected. 1630TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 371. D) G6PD-deficiency anemia Pneumococcal vaccine is not indicated for glucose- 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficiency anemia. There are two types for adults: PPSV23 (Pneumovax23) and PCV13 (Prevnar13). Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for individuals beginning at age 65 years, but the two types should not be given together. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends administering Prevnar 13 first, then waiting at least 1 year (12 months) and giving the Pneumovax 23. The immunogenic response is better using this method. Prevnar 13 is recommended for all infants and children younger than 2 years of age, all adults aged 65 years or older, and people (2 to 64 years old) with certain medical conditions that increase risk of pneumococcal disease, such as functional or anatomic asplenia (sickle cell), HIV infection, chronic renal failure, leukemia, heart failure, cyanotic congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), diabetes, and others. 1631665 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 372. B) Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia This abnormal heart rate is also known as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia ( PSVT ). The heart rate can increase from 60 to 100 beats/min (in adults) to 130 to 230 beats/min. Episodes are sporadic and occur without warning. Patients with PSVT often present with the complaints of palpitations, described as a rapid heart rate often felt in the throat, and may be associated with lightheadedness, weakness, shortness of breath, and angina. PSVT is diagnosed by EKG. Vagal maneuvers slow the heart rate by stimulating the vagus nerve. The Valsalva maneuver (tighten stomach muscles and exhale forcefully with nose pinched and closed mouth) should be the first vagal maneuver tried. Carotid sinus massage, carried out by firmly pressing the bulb at the top of one of the carotid arteries in the neck, is effective but is often not recommended due to risks of stroke in those with plaque in the carotid arteries. Most supraventricular tachycardias have a narrow QRS complex on EKG, but supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant (abnormal appearing) conduction can produce a wide-complex tachycardia that may mimic ventricular tachycardia. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable, call 911. Refer the patient to a cardiologist for management. 1632TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 373. A) Oral metronidazole (Flagyl) A single dose of metronidazole is effective treatment in most cases of Trichomonas infections. The strawberry cervix is considered to be selectively associated with trichomonas. The etiology is the parasitic protozoan flagellate, T. vaginalis. Symptoms include a foul-smelling vaginal discharge (often fishy); burning and soreness of the vulva, perineum, and thighs; dyspareunia and dysuria. Wet prep microscopic examination should reveal highly motile cells, slightly larger than leukocytes and smaller than epithelial cells. 1633TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 374. C) Mitral regurgitation Mitral regurgitation does not cause secondary hypertension. One of the principal causes of secondary hypertension is related to adrenal gland tumors such as Cushing's syndrome, primary aldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), and pheochromocytoma. Renovascular hypertension is a type of secondary hypertension caused by narrowing (stenosis) of one or both arteries leading to the kidneys. Renovascular hypertension can cause severe hypertension and irreversible kidney damage. Sleep apnea causes part of the nervous system to be overactive and to release certain chemicals that increase blood pressure. 1634TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 375. B) She should avoid alcoholic drinks 1 day before, during therapy, and a few days after therapy The patient should avoid alcoholic drinks during and for at least 3 days after therapy with metronidazole (Flagyl). Flagyl and alcohol together cause severe nausea and vomiting, flushing, fast heartbeat (tachycardia), and shortness of breath. The reaction has been described as being similar to the effects of Antabuse. 1635TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 376. C) Chewing breath mints The mint flavoring in breath mints and chewing gum triggers acid reflux. Acid-reflux diets usually list peppermint, spearmint, and other mints as foods to avoid. Foods that also aggravate acid reflux include chocolate, fatty or fried foods, whole milk, oils, creamed foods or soup, and many fast foods. Citrus fruit and juices and coffee and other caffeinated drinks may also irritate an esophagus inflamed by acid reflux. Among obese patients in a weight-loss program, about two thirds of those with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) reported complete symptom resolution by the end of the intervention. Alcohol relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter, allowing the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus. It also increases the production of stomach acid. 1636666 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 377. D) Repeat the Gen-Probe test for Chlamydia trachomatis to ensure that the previous test was not a false-negative result Treatment for both gonorrhea and chlamydia is recommended for the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), regardless of whether the chlamydia test (or gonorrhea test) was negative. Repeating the Gen-Probe test (or another nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT]) for chlamydia is not recommended. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a clinical diagnosis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2014) states that an internal vaginal swab specimen is equivalent to a cervical specimen when using the newer NAATs. Self-collected vaginal swabs are equivalent in sensitivity/specificity to those collected by a clinician. Treatment should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made, because prevention of long-term sequelae is dependent on early administration of appropriate antibiotics. All regimens used to treat PID should also be effective against N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis because negative endocervical screening for these organisms does not rule out upper reproductive tract infection. 1637TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 378. C) Tanner stage IV The breast bud stage is Tanner stage II. In Tanner stage IV, the areola and papilla form a secondary mound. Tanner stages for breast development are: I, prepuberty; II, breast bud; III, breast and areola one mound; IV, breast and areola secondary mound; and V, adult pattern. 1638TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 379. A) Depo-Provera injections The synthetic hormonal substance in Depo-Provera (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or DMPA) is the best choice of the four options listed. The patient is a smoker aged 36 years and should not be prescribed any estrogen product (e.g., oral contraceptives, estrogen patches). With her history of chlamydial cervicitis, she is not a candidate for an intrauterine device, which would increase risk for pelvic inflammatory disease. 1639TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 380. A) Clarithromycin (Biaxin) Clarithromycin may block the breakdown of theophylline by the liver. If this happens, blood levels of theophylline could increase and this could cause an increase in side effects, including stomach irritation, loss of appetite, nervousness, and irritability. More serious or potentially dangerous side effects include seizures, rapid heartbeat, decrease in blood pressure, and an abnormal heart rhythm. However, theophylline may cause clarithromycin to be removed from the body at a faster rate than normal. If this happens, then potentially less clarithromycin would be available for the body to use and blood levels could become too low, making it less effective at fighting infection. 1640TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 381. D) Ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease Carotid stenosis puts the patient at risk for stroke and coronary artery disease. A bruit is a murmur heard over the carotid artery in the neck, suggesting arterial narrowing and atherosclerosis. It may increase risk of cerebrovascular disease. Bruits at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery are best heard high up under the angle of the jaw. At this level the common carotid artery bifurcates and gives rise to its internal branch. If one hears a bruit only in the base of the neck, or along the course of the common carotid artery, it is referred to as diffuse . Diffuse bruits are not a very specific indicator of internal carotid artery disease. Bruits heard only at the bifurcation are more specific for internal carotid artery origin stenosis. 1641TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 382. A) Send a urine specimen for culture and sensitivity to the laboratory and treat the patient for a urinary tract infection (UTI) The patient has symptoms of a UTI. The urinalysis shows 3+ leukocytes and nitrites. Because the patient is diabetic (A1C 8.5%), a 3-day treatment regimen should not be used. UTIs in diabetic patients are considered \"complicated\" UTIs (requiring longer duration of treatment), which should be treated with agents such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) PO BID for 7 days. 1642667 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 383. A) Basal cell carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer diagnosed in the United States each year. More than one out of every three new cancers are skin cancers, and the vast majority are BCCs. BCCs are abnormal, uncontrolled growths or lesions that arise in the skin's basal cells, which line the deepest layer of the epidermis. Initially appearing as a dome-shaped waxy lesion with telangiectasia, it enlarges with raised and telangiectasia and the center may ulcerate. BCCs can also look like open sores, red patches, pink growths, or scars. Usually caused by a combination of cumulative UV exposure and intense, occasional UV exposure, BCC can be highly disfiguring if allowed to grow, but almost never metastasize beyond the original tumor site. 1643TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 384. B) Cardiac effects Because people have varying degrees of hypothyroidism and other thyroid problems, levothyroxine (Synthroid) is not a \"one-size-fits-all\" medication. Instead, the dosage must be individualized. Exercise caution when administering this drug to patients with cardiovascular disorders and to the elderly in whom there is an increased risk of occult cardiac disease. 1644TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 385. D) Antihistamines Avoid use of antihistamines in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) because they can thicken mucus, making it even more difficult to cough up secretions. The drug classes used to treat (short-acting, long-acting), anticholinergics (short-acting, long-acting), are combination drugs (albuterol with anticholinergic, steroid with formoterol, and others). 1645TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 386. C) Preventive therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (previously known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, or PCP) can be life threatening in patients with AIDS with a low CD4 count. It is the most common cause of death of these patients in the United States. Once a patient's CD4 count declines significantly, prophylaxis for opportunistic infections is initiated and continues indefinitely. The first-choice preventive regimen is trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole one double-strength tablet PO daily. 1646TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 387. A) Acute appendicitis Suspected ruptured appendix or a pelvic abscess irritates the lateral iliopsoas and obturator muscles. The patient should be in the supine position for testing. To perform the iliopsoas muscle test, ask the patient to raise the leg, flexing at the hip, while you push downward against the leg. The obturator muscle test is performed with the right leg flexed at the hip and the knee at 90 degrees; the examiner rotates the leg laterally and medially. These muscle tests are positive if the patient experiences pain. 1647TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 388. D) Testes Spermatogenesis takes place within several structures of the male reproductive system. The initial stages occur within the testes and progress to the epididymis, where the developing gametes mature and are stored until ejaculation. New sperm take from 2 to 3 months to fully mature. 1648TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 389. D) Nedocromil sodium (Tilade) Nedocromil sodium (Tilade) is a mast cell stabilizer that is used to treat asthma, especially in children. 1649TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 390. A) Acoustic nerve damage Labyrinthitis is also known as vestibular neuritis . It is due to viral or postviral inflammation that affects the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve (CN VIII; acoustic nerve). It is usually a self-limited disorder. The other symptoms listed are common with labyrinthitis; made worse with moving the head, sitting up, rolling over, or looking upward. Treatment is corticosteroids (methylprednisone), antivirals (Dramamine). 1650668 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 391.

D) Premature menopause Potential benefits of premature menopause include a 30% to 50% lower risk of breast cancer among women who undergo menopause before age 50 and a decreased risk of ovarian cancer for women who undergo bilateral oophorectomy. 1652TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 393. C) Saw palmetto is always effective in reducing symptoms Many herbs have been tried for treating an enlarged prostate. Saw palmetto has been used by millions of men to ease benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) symptoms and is often recommended as an alternative to medication. Some studies have shown that it helps with symptoms, but there is evidence that this popular herb is no better than a placebo in relieving the signs and symptoms of BPH. Further studies are needed. 1653TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 394. C) 5.7% to 6.4% The recommended range for a hemoglobin A1C is 4.0% to 5.9%. Prediabetes is 5.7% to 6.4%, and higher values indicate diabetes. 1654TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 395. B) Tanner stage II Tanner stage I is considered prepubescence. Tanner stage II is considered the onset of puberty. 1655TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 396.

Some drugs can decrease the efficacy of oral contraceptives pills and increase risk of pregnancy. Drugs affecting contraceptive efficacy include anticonvulsants TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 397. C) Azithromycin 1 g orally or Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days Drug therapy is based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; 2015) sexually transmitted diseases (STD) guidelines for treatment. 1657TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 398. B) Thrombosis related to an IV needle Thrombosis related to either a known trauma or IV needle does not represent a contraindication for use of oral contraceptives. 1658TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 399. A) Fruits, leafy greens, and nuts The best sources of both potassium and magnesium are fruits (bananas, cantaloupe, papaya, kiwi), leafy greens (spinach, kale, chard), and nuts (cashews, almonds, walnuts, peanuts). 1659TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 400. D) Acute epididymitis Acute epididymitis in men younger than age 35 years is most likely caused by a sexually transmitted disease (STD; e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea). In older men, it is more likely due to Escherichia coli . Physical examination shows a red, tender, and sometimes swollen lump on the affected side of the scrotum. Tenderness is usually in a small area of the testicle where the epididymis (connects the testicle with the vas deferens) is attached. If an STD is suspected, give ceftriaxone 250 mg IM in a single dose, plus doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 10 days. If caused by enteric bacteria ( E. coli , other), treatment is levofloxacin or ofloxacin for 10 days. 1660669 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 401. C) The newer low-dose birth control pills do not require backup during the first 2 weeks of use All forms of oral contraceptive pills require a second backup method of contraception during the first 2 weeks of use. It is possible to have \"breakthrough\" ovulation in the first week when taking birth control pills for the first time; therefore, a second backup (condoms) is recommended. 1661TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 402. B) Luteinizing hormone (LH) LH originates in the anterior pituitary gland. In women, an acute rise in LH triggers ovulation and development of the corpus luteum. 1662TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 403. C) Cholesteatoma An abnormal skin growth in the middle ear behind the eardrum is called cholesteatoma . Repeated infections and/or a tear or pulling inward of the eardrum can allow skin into the middle ear. Cholesteatomas often develop as cysts or pouches that shed layers of old skin, which build up inside the middle ear. Over time, the cholesteatoma can increase in size and destroy the surrounding delicate bones of the middle ear, leading to hearing loss that surgery can often improve. Permanent hearing loss, dizziness, and facial muscle paralysis are rare, but can result from continued cholesteatoma growth. 1663TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 404. D) Advocacy Patient advocacy may encompass, but is not limited to, patients' rights advocacy. Patient advocacy is not merely the defense of infringements of patient rights. Advocacy for nursing stems from a philosophy of nursing in which nursing practice is the support of an individual to promote his or her own well- being, as understood by that individual. 1664TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 405. D) Lung cancer The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines note that lung cancer screening is appropriate to consider for those high- risk patients who are potential candidates for definite treatment. Category 1 high-risk factors include: age 55 to 74 years and more than 30 pack-year history of smoking and smoking cessation less than 15 years. Category 2B high-risk factors include: age older than 50 years and more than 20 pack-year history of smoking and one additional risk factor (other than second-hand smoke). 1665TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 406. D) Slow onset of symptoms Acute prostatitis symptoms include fever, chills, tenderness of scrotum on affected side, and abrupt onset of symptoms. 1666TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 407. B) Chlamydia trachomatis The most common bacterial cause of nongonococcal urethritis is Chlamydia trachomatis , but THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 408. D) Smoking Smoking (and age older than 35 years) is a relative contraindication for oral contraceptives. Undiagnosed uterine bleeding, hepatoma, and previous/present history of thromboembolism are all absolute contraindications. 1668TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 409. A) Injury to the meniscus of the right knee Individuals who experience a meniscus tear usually experience pain and swelling as their primary symptoms. Another common complaint is joint locking, or the inability to completely straighten the joint. This is due to a piece of the torn cartilage physically impinging the joint mechanism of the knee. The best imaging test for meniscus injury is the MRI. 1669670 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 410. A) Refer him to an orthopedic specialist Treatment of an injury to the meniscus varies depending on the extent and location of the meniscus tear. If the tear is minor and the pain and other symptoms resolve quickly, muscle-strengthening exercises may be all that is needed to recover fully. In this case, a patient is usually referred to physical therapy. A large meniscus tear that causes symptoms or mechanical problems with the function of the knee joint may require arthroscopic surgery for repair. 1670TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 411. A) Refer the patient to a urologist after treatment Urinary tract infections are relatively rare in young men with normal urinary tracts. Urethritis can mimic a UTI; rule out gonorrhea and chlamydia. A urine culture before initiating antibiotics and a test of cure is recommended for this group. Therefore, they should be referred to a urologist for evaluation and treatment. Additional tests that should be conducted may include intravenous pyelography, renal ultrasound, CT scan, or cystoscopy. 1671TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 412. A) Transfusion of blood is prohibited even in cases of emergency The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society (the governing body of the Jehovah's Witnesses) recommends that its members should not accept whole blood or its primary components in any form. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Bible commands them \"not to eat blood,\" and they regard accepting transfusions as equivalent to eating blood. In 2000, a ruling stated that they can accept \"minor\" components of blood, but they cannot accept a \"major\" blood component. In the 1980s, organ transplants became acceptable. Patients who identify as Jehovah's Witness should be asked about their preferences regarding blood transfusion before surgical procedures. 1672TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 413. D) Protocol agreements help protect nurse practitioners from certain types of lawsuits Protocols should be developed because the nurse practitioner (NP) has the ability to examine, diagnose, and establish treatment plans for patients; friction may develop among the various health care professionals. Should these professionals become codefendants in professional liability litigation, an adversarial situation may result. In some jurisdictions, physicians may carry lower limits of professional liability coverage than an NP. In such cases, the NP may become the focus of the defendant's claim in order to reach additional liability insurance coverage. 1673TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 414. D) Endometrial biopsy An endometrial biopsy is warranted for postmenopausal bleeding (PMB). PMB refers to any uterine bleeding in a menopausal woman (other than the expected cyclic bleeding that occurs in women taking sequential postmenopausal hormone therapy). The most common causes are atrophic endometrium, endometrial proliferation or hyperplasia, and endometrial or cervical cancer. Other causes include atrophic vaginitis, trauma, endometrial polyps, friction ulcers of the cervix associated with prolapse of the uterus, and blood dyscrasias. 1674TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 415. B) Patient is coherent Most patients with delirium have associated cognitive deficits such as altered perception (including hallucinations, illusions, and delusions); memory loss (especially distorted memories, approximate answers, and misidentification of people or places); language deficits (especially writing); disorientation; difficulty with calculations, abstraction, insight, and judgment; and mood disorders, which can include fear, elation, anxiety, or depression. Some patients have relatively preserved orientation, language, and other cognitive functions, but they simply cannot maintain focus on a conversation. 1675671 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 416. B) Swimming Swimming spares the joints due to reduced load from buoyancy of water. The American College of Rheumatology states that exercise is beneficial for everyone, including those with rheumatoid arthritis., It currently recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week. Exercise plans should be individualized. Safe forms of aerobic exercise, such as walking, aerobic dance, and aquatic exercise, help arthritis patients to control weight, and improve sleep, mood, and overall health. 1676TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 417. D) Mood disorders Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that work on the central nervous system, acting selectively on gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA-A). Benzodiazepines are similar in pharmacologic action but have different potencies, and some benzodiazepines work better in treatment of particular conditions. Benzodiazepines are used as sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, and muscle relaxants. They are not prescribed for mood disorders. 1677TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 418. C) Patients with hypertension Hypertension does not increase the risk of TB infection. Diabetes and homelessness are associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB). Option B describes a healthy nurse with a recent seroconversion (latent TB infection). Latent TB infection can become reactivated in the future if the person's immune system is compromised. The CDC recommends latent TB treatment (if no contraindications) for HIV-infected persons, fibrotic changes on chest x-ray consistent with old TB, immunocompromised, injection drug users, close contacts of a person with infectious TB disease, and others. LTBI treatment regimens include isoniazid PO daily for 9 months (preferred) or for 6 months. 1678TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 419. D) 13-year-old being treated for a sexually transmitted disease As soon as an individual turns 18, she or he legally becomes an adult and is automatically emancipated from parental custody and control. Likewise, when a minor marries or joins the armed forces (with parental consent and permission from the court), she or he becomes emancipated from her or his parents. In many states, a pregnant minor is considered an emancipated minor for the purposes of providing informed consent for her own treatment and the treatment of the fetus during the pregnancy and childbirth. For this principle to apply, however, the minor pregnant mother cannot have a cognitive disability that prevents her from giving informed consent for or refusing treatment. 1679TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 420. B) Anorexia nervosa Although many of the medical complications of anorexia nervosa are reversed by weight restoration, osteoporosis is a very serious one, which may persist even after successful treatment of the eating disorder. 1680TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 421 . C) There is an increase in renal function Physiological changes in the elderly include increase in the fat-to-lean body ratio, decrease in the ability of the liver to metabolize drugs, loss of hearing for sounds in the high-frequency range, and a decrease in renal function. 1681TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 422. D) Increased facial movements The primary Parkinson's disease symptoms include tremors, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability. These may be mild at first, but will gradually become more intense and debilitating. Facial movement decreases, resulting in generalized rigidity with masked facies. 1682TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 423. A) CN I Cranial nerve I is the olfactory nerve. When testing the ability to identify familiar aromatic odors, one naris is tested at a time with the patient's eyes closed. The patient should be able to perceive an odor on each side, usually identifying it. The sense of smell may diminish with age. 1683672 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 424. A) Corneal ulceration Due to the paralysis caused by the seventh cranial nerve damage, the eyelid on the affected side may not close voluntarily. This leads to dryness, which can further result in ulceration. 1684TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 425. B) Multiple brain infarcts Multiple brain infarcts are the least likely cause of delirium. Delirium is most likely caused by a combination of factors that make the brain vulnerable and factors that trigger a malfunction in brain activity. It is often caused by a disease process outside the brain, such as poor nutrition or dehydration, aging, multiple medical problems, infection (urinary tract infection, pneumonia) or drug effects, particularly anticholinergic or other central nervous system depressants (benzodiazepines and opioids) and alcohol or drug use/withdrawal. 1685TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 426. D) Increase in abstract thinking ability Most patients with delirium have associated cognitive deficits such as altered perception; memory loss; language deficits (especially writing); disorientation; and difficulty with calculations, abstract thinking, insight, and judgment. 1686TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 427. C) Captopril (Capoten) Captopril (Capoten) is an angiotensin-converting (ACE) inhibitor. The interaction between ACE inhibitors and theophylline is related to an increase in potassium. They are not known to increase or decrease theophylline levels. 1687TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 428. D) Bartholin's gland abscess Bartholin's duct cysts and gland abscesses are common problems in women of reproductive age. Bartholin's glands are located bilaterally at the posterior introitus and drain through ducts that empty into the vestibule at approximately the 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions. These normally pea- sized glands are palpable only if the duct becomes cystic or a gland abscess develops. Obstruction of the distal Bartholin's duct may result in the retention of secretions, with resultant dilation of the duct and formation of a cyst. The cyst may become infected, and an abscess may develop in the gland. A Bartholin's duct cyst does not necessarily have to be present before a gland abscess can develop. 1688TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 429. A) The nurse practitioner can examine and prescribe birth control pills to minors because there is no legal requirement for parental consent in cases concerning sexual activity and pregnancy At the federal level, the focal point of debate over minors' access to confidential services has been the Title X family planning program. Since its inception in 1970, services supported by Title X have been available to anyone who needs them without regard to age. As a result, Title X- supported clinics provide contraceptive services and other reproductive health care to minors on a confidential basis, although they encourage minors to involve their parents in their decision to seek services. 1689TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 430. C) Her partner does not need treatment The usual medical regimen for treatment is the antibiotic metronidazole (500 mg twice a day, once every 12 hours) for 7 days, and one dose of azithromycin. A one-time 2-g dose is no longer recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) because of low efficacy. Extended-release metronidazole is an alternative recommendation. In contrast to some other infectious diseases affecting the female genitals, bacterial vaginosis is not a sexually transmitted disease for which the partner needs treatment. 1690673 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 431. B) CN X Cranial nerve X is the vagus nerve. To evaluate the nasopharyngeal sensation, tell the patient you will be testing the gag reflex. Touch the posterior wall of the patient's pharynx with an applicator as you observe for upward movement of the palate and contraction of the pharyngeal muscles. The uvula should remain in the midline, and no drooping or absence of an arch on either side of the soft palate should be noted. 1691TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 432. C) Acute pericarditis The patient most likely has acute pericarditis. A pericardial friction rub is the hallmark of acute pericarditis, which can result from an acute infection. Pericardial rub occurs when two inflamed layers of the pericardium slide over each other, causing a scratching, grating, or crunching sound that ranges from faint to loud. It is best heard between the apex and along the lower left sternal border during deep inspiration. This also causes sharp precordial or retrosternal pain that usually radiates to the left shoulder, neck, and back. The pain worsens when the patient breathes deeply, coughs, or lies flat. It abates when the patient sits up and leans forward. 1692TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 433. B) Rest and elevation of the knee with intermittent application of cold packs \u00d7 15 minutes four times a day for the next 48 hours The patient should be managed using RICE. Rest for the first 24 to 48 hours after the injury with gradual increase in activity. Ice for the first 48 hours: Apply ice 20 minutes at a time for 3 to 4 hours. (The ice pack can be a bag of frozen vegetables.) Compression : Use an elastic wrap bandage as indicated. Elevate : Try to get sprains higher than the heart if possible and elevate at night by using pillows under the leg/arm. 1693TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 434. D) Severe vomiting Vomiting is not a symptom associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a disorder that leads to abdominal pain and cramping, changes in bowel movements, and other symptoms. The main symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain, fullness, gas, and bloating that have been present for at least 3 days a month for the past 3 months. People with IBS may switch between constipation and diarrhea, or mostly have one or the other. 1694TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 435. D) Weight Weight is not used in the determination of the estimated/expected peak expiratory flow (peak flow). Age, height, and gender are used to calculate expected peak flow to help quantify asthma exacerbation severity. 1695TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 436. C) Pelvic ultrasound and serum quantitative pregnancy test The most critical step in beginning the workup is to have a high clinical suspicion for ectopic pregnancy (e.g., in any woman of childbearing age). Bedside pelvic sonography is the imaging test of choice to investigate early pregnancy. Patients with indeterminate ultrasonography findings (empty uterus, gestational sac less than 8 mm without a yolk sac) should have a beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) level drawn and should be followed up closely with gynecology to monitor serial beta-hCG levels and ultrasonography. 1696TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 437. A) Tubal ectopic pregnancy and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Her positive physical findings of left adnexal tenderness and discharge suggest an ectopic pregnancy rather than pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Amenorrhea should be treated as a pregnancy until proven otherwise. 1697TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 438. B) Amenorrhea Depo-Provera (contraceptive injection) is a progesterone hormone that causes cessation of periods. One common side effect seen in women who have been taking Depo-Provera for more than 5 years is amenorrhea. As women continue using Depo-Provera, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. By month 12, amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women. 1698674 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 439. D) Sodium restriction to decrease water retention Migraine is a type of headache characterized by constriction of vessels in the brain, followed by painful dilation and inflammation of the same blood vessels. Scientists do not cite any direct correlation between sodium levels and migraine headaches, but the amount of salt one consumes may be a factor in some types of headache pain. Salty foods can act as a migraine trigger in some people. Others might experience nonmigraine headaches when sodium levels are too high or too low. 1699TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 440. D) Reproductive-age women Finasteride (Proscar) can be absorbed through the skin, and women or children should not be permitted to handle Proscar tablets. Proscar prevents the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body. DHT is involved in the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Proscar has been given a pregnancy category X classification based on its risks to an unborn fetus. Women should not handle crushed or broken Proscar tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant. DHT is important for male genital development; if Proscar is taken during pregnancy, it may cause abnormalities to the external genitals of a male fetus. 1700TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 441. C) It does not matter, as evidence regarding the efficacy of vitamin C in ameliorating the symptoms of the common cold is lacking This patient is taking 1,000 mg of vitamin C. Vitamin C was first touted as effective against the common cold in the 1970s. But despite its widespread use, experts say there is very little proof that vitamin C actually has any effect on the common cold. Studies have suggested a possible link between people with higher intakes of vitamin C from food or supplements and lower blood pressure. But the evidence of this effect from clinical trials has been mixed. Previous short-term studies in humans and guinea pigs have shown that vitamin C might protect against osteoarthritis of the knees. In contrast, a new study shows that prolonged use of vitamin C supplements may aggravate osteoarthritis. 1701TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 442. B) Delirium tremens secondary to acute withdrawal of alcohol Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that involves sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes. Symptoms most often occur within 72 hours after the last drink. However, they may occur up to 7 to 10 days after the last drink. It is especially common in those who drink 4 to 5 pints of wine or 7 to 8 pints of beer (or 1 pint of \"hard\" alcohol) every day for several months. Delirium tremens also commonly affects people who have had alcoholism for more than 10 years. 1702TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 443. A) Hyperthyroidism Symptoms of hyperthyroidism are nervousness, irritability, increased perspiration, racing heart, hand tremors, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, thinning of the skin, fine brittle hair, and muscular weakness\u2014especially in the upper arms and thighs. More frequent bowel movements may occur, but diarrhea is uncommon. Weight loss, sometimes significant, may occur despite a good appetite; vomiting may occur; and, for women, menstrual flow may lighten and menstrual periods may occur less often. 1703675 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 444. B) Angiotensin reuptake blockers Hypertension is a comorbidity of type 2 diabetes, and lowering blood pressure has been shown to reduce cardiovascular (CV) and renal disease progression in this population. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have demonstrated reduction in CV mortality and myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure in patients with diabetes. Evidence suggests that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have similar CV protective effects, particularly in patients who are postmyocardial infarction and in those with heart failure, and ARBs' renoprotective effects have reduced proteinuria in patients with or without diabetes. 1704TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 445. D) Stroking the inner thigh of a male patient and watching the testicle on the ipsilateral side rise up toward the body The cremasteric reflex is elicited by stroking the inner thigh (proximal to distal) with a blunt instrument such as a handle of the reflex hammer. The testicle and scrotum should rise on the stroked side. 1705TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 446. A) Contact dermatitis Contact dermatitis is a condition in which the skin becomes red, sore, or inflamed after direct contact with a substance. There are two kinds of contact dermatitis: irritant and allergic. 1706TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 447. D) Intrauterine device An intrauterine device (IUD) is not a risk factor for urinary tract infections (UTIs). In addition to causing increased urine glucose, diabetes may increase the risk of UTIs through mechanisms that include impaired immune cell delivery, inefficient white blood cells, and inhibition of bladder contractions that allow urine to remain stagnant in the bladder. Diaphragms are associated with an increased risk of UTIs. Urinating before inserting the diaphragm and also after intercourse may reduce this risk. Hormonal and mechanical changes increase the risk of urinary stasis and vesicoureteral reflux. These changes, along with an already short urethra (approximately 3-4 cm in females) and difficulty with hygiene due to a distended pregnant belly, increase the frequency of UTIs in pregnant women. Indeed, UTIs are among the most common bacterial infections during pregnancy. 1707TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 448. B) Left supraclavicular area Virchow's node (or signal node) is a lymph node in the left supraclavicular fossa (the area above the left clavicle). It takes its supply from lymph vessels in the abdominal cavity. The finding of an enlarged, hard node (also referred to as Troisier's sign ) has long been regarded as strongly indicative of the presence of cancer in the abdomen, specifically gastric cancer, that has spread through the lymph vessels. 1708TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 449. A) Tinea cruris Tinea cruris (jock itch) is a common skin infection that is caused by a type of fungus called tinea . The fungus thrives in warm, moist areas of the body and, as a result, infection can affect the genitals, inner thighs, and buttocks. Infections occur more frequently in the summer or in warm, wet climates. Tinea cruris appears as a red, itchy rash that is often ring shaped. Tinea corporis involves the body, tinea capitis involves the head, and tinea pedis involves the feet. 1709TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 450. B) Middle-aged men The most prominent feature of cluster headache is severe pain that is almost always on only one side of the head, accompanied by tearing, rhinorrhea, ptosis (drooping of upper eyelid), and miosis (constriction of the pupil). Cluster headaches occur periodically; spontaneous remissions interrupt active periods of pain. The cause of the condition is currently unknown. It affects approximately 0.1% of the population, and men are more commonly affected than women. The headaches typically start before age 30. 1710TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 451. A) 2 to 3 years Menarche typically occurs within 2 to 3 years after thelarche (breast budding; Tanner stage II). The areola widens, darkens slightly, and elevates from the rest of the breast as a small mound. The mound (nipple) may be visible, and lying under the areola is a bud of breast tissue (breast bud) that is palpable (noticeable to the touch). 1711676 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 452. D) A 16-year-old who wants to be treated for dysmenorrhea Dysmenorrhea that requires more than over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and nonprescription therapies may involve more invasive testing and would probably require parental consent, especially if the evaluation and treatments involve billing to insurance. 1712TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 453. B) Microalbuminuria As of 2011, the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria (ATP III), the American Heart Association criteria, and the recent harmonized international criteria for the definition of the metabolic syndrome included blood pressure, waist circumference (>40 inches men; >35 inches women), fasting women). is not one of the criteria for diagnosing metabolic syndrome. 1713TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 454. A) Sinusitis and hydrocele Transillumination is used for evaluation of the frontal and maxillary sinusitis as well as for a hydrocele. Because light is able to pass through the delicate skin covering the hollow sinus cavities, a light source held against the upper cheek will produce a red dot on the palate if the sinuses are normal (filled with air rather than obstructed). The transillumination test is used to differentiate a hydrocele from hernia\u2014an illuminated scrotum will show the testicle in the center surrounded by water in the hydrocele. 1714TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 455. D) Cough that produces large amounts of sputum Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have increased mucus production because of overabundant mucus-producing glands in their airways compared with healthy people. This results in a chronic cough. A cough is the body's defense mechanism developed in an attempt to clear the airways. A common problem for people with COPD is thick sputum, making sputum difficult to cough up and out. 1715TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 456. B) Apply hydrocortisone cream 1% BID to the rash until it is healed Hydrocortisone 1% cream or ointment is over the counter and will help to decrease inflammation and pruritis. Using a potent topical corticosteriod such as halcinonide (Halog) 1% for 4 to 6 weeks is not recommended in this case. The rash will usually heal within 2 weeks. When a potent topical steriod is used for prolonged periods, it can cause adverse effects such as skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and hypopigmentation. Clotrimazole is an antifungal. Washing twice a day initially can help with removing the poison ivy oil, but it is not done to decrease risk of secondary bacterial infection. 1716TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 457. C) A decrease in the systolic blood pressure of >10 mmHg on inspiration Pulsus paradoxus is a marked decrease in pulse amplitude during quiet inspiration or a decrease in the systolic pressure greater than 10 mmHg, a typical finding in cardiac tamponade. Heart sounds may be heard over the precordium when the radial pulse is not felt. 1717TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 458. C) Testicular torsion Testicular torsion is a twisting of the spermatic cord, which cuts off the blood supply to the testicle and surrounding structures within the scrotum. Signs and symptoms of testicular torsion include sudden onset of unilateral scrotal pain, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Acute epididymitis causes fever, chills, nausea, and unilateral pain and is most commonly seen in sexually active men. Unilateral scrotal pain does not occur with acute gastroenteritis. Acute orchitis is often based on having a recent mumps infection (parotitis) with testicular edema. 1718677 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 459. B) Refer him to the emergency department as soon as possible Immediate referral to the emergency department is required to prevent irreversible ischemia. Success of treatment is usually 100% if treated within the first 6 hours and 0% if treated after 24 hours. The diagnosis of testicular torsion is often made clinically, but if it is in doubt, an ultrasound is helpful in evaluating the condition. Emergency diagnosis and treatment are usually required within 4 to 6 hours to prevent necrosis. 1719TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 460. C) The usual clinical strategy is watchful waiting for curves of 10 degrees or less The treatment prescribed for scoliosis, kyphosis, or lordosis varies with the individual patient. Severity and location of the curve, age, potential for further growth, and general health of the patient must all be taken into account. A mild curvature (up to 20 degrees) generally warrants only periodic observation to evaluate for signs of further progression. Bracing is the usual treatment for children and adolescents with curves of 25 to 40 degrees, and in other special circumstances. 1720TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 461 . C) Serum folate and B 12 level The patient has macrocytic anemia (MCV 102). The differential diagnoses are B 12 deficiency and folate deficiency anemia. Initial test is the serum folate and B 12 level. Other tests for macrocytic/megaloblastic anemias are the peripheral smear, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine level. If B 12 deficiency, order anti-parietal antibodies to check for pernicious anemia. 1721TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 462. D) Vesicular breath sounds in the lower lobe There are two normal breath sounds. Breath sounds heard over the tracheobronchial tree is called bronchial breathing and breath sounds heard over the lower lobes of lung tissue is called vesicular breathing . 1722TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 463. A) S3 and S4 and low-pitched tones The bell is most useful for picking up low- pitched sounds; for example, S3, S4, and mitral stenosis. The diaphragm is most useful S1, pericardial friction rubs. 1723TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 464. A) KOH (potassium hydroxide) smear whiff test Generally, wet preps use one to two slides to evaluate Candida. Under the microscope, observe for presence and number of white blood cells (WBCs), trichomonads, candidal hyphae, or clue cells. Yeast or hyphae also may be seen on the wet prep. The KOH prep is made by adding a drop of KOH solution to a drop of saline suspension of the vaginal discharge. The KOH lyses epithelial cells in 5 to 15 minutes and allows easier visualization of candidal hyphae. 1724TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 465. C) Tanner stage III Tanner stage III: The testicular volume increases, the scrotum enlarges, and the penis begins to lengthen. Tanner I: Prepubertal small penis. Tanner II: The testicles/scrotum starts to enlarge, but penis length remains unchanged. Tanner III: Penis begins to lengthen. Tanner IV: Penis increases in length and circumference. Tanner V: Adult scrotum and penis. 1725TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 466. B) The pulmonic area The S2 heart sound is physiologically split in about 90% of people. The second heart sound is produced by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. The sound produced by the closure of the aortic valve is termed A2 , and the sound produced by the closure of the pulmonic valve is termed P2 . The A2 sound is normally much louder than the P2 due to higher pressures in the left side of the heart; thus, A2 radiates to all cardiac listening posts (loudest at the right upper sternal border) and P2 is usually only heard at the left upper sternal border. 1726678 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 467. C) Candida albicans Balanitis is swelling (inflammation) of the foreskin and head of the penis. Balanitis is usually caused by poor hygiene in uncircumcised men. Other possible causes include Candida (fungal infection) and bacterial infection, harsh soaps, and uncontrolled diabetes. Symptoms include redness of the foreskin or penis, other rashes on the head of the penis, foul-smelling discharge, and pain. 1727TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 468. A) Iron-deficiency anemia Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia. 1728TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 469. C) She can take any of the pills in the sulfonylurea class The patient can take sulfonylureas. The sulfonamide component in the typical sulfa antibiotics is of a slightly different molecular structure than that in sulfonylureas. Although cross- reactivity is technically possible, current literature does not consider this likely, and sulfonylureas are typically well tolerated in patients with a sulfa allergy. 1729TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 470. C) Prostaglandins The etiology of primary dysmenorrhea is not precisely understood, but most symptoms can be explained by the action of uterine prostaglandins, particularly PGF2-alpha. During endometrial sloughing, the disintegrating alpha stimulates myometrial contractions, ischemia, and sensitization of nerve endings. The clinical evidence for this theory is quite strong. 1730TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 471. B) Take two pills today, then two pills tomorrow, and have your partner use condoms for the rest of the pill cycle In the case of two missed pills in the first 2 weeks of the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) packet, the patient should take two pills at the regular time for 2 days, and use backup contraception for the remainder of the cycle. If two or more pills are missed in the third week, the patient should take two pills daily until all OCPs are taken; restart the pill cycle with one pill daily within 7 days; and use a backup contraceptive until OCPs are restarted with a new pack and the first 7 days of that packet have been taken. 1731TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 472. D) A 30-year-old White woman who smokes The 30-year-old White woman who smokes has the lowest risk for diabetes among the four patients. Risk for diabetes mellitus includes people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and/or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), people older than age 45, people with a family history of diabetes, people who are overweight, people who do not exercise regularly, people with low HDL cholesterol or high triglycerides or high blood pressure, certain racial and ethnic groups (e.g., non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanic/Latino Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians and Alaska Natives), and women who had gestational diabetes or who have had a baby weighing 9 lbs or more at birth. 1732TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 473. A) Medical treatment for any work-related injury is covered under an employer's workers' comp insurance State law governs workers' compensation system; therefore the injuries covered by workers' compensation differ from state to state. Generally, though, an injury that arises \"out of the course of employment\" will be covered under your state's workers' compensation system. This means that injuries that happened while you were performing your job duties, or diseases or illnesses that arise from conditions at your job, will likely amount to a workers' compensation claim. 1733679 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 474. C) The patient needs hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin This patient is susceptible and has been infected (HBsAg is positive). He needs the hepatitis B vaccine and the hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) as soon as possible. The second hepatitis B dose should be given in 30 days and the third dose is due 5 months after the second dose (total of three doses needed). 1734TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 475. A) Left axilla Mitral regurgitation is best heard at the apex with radiation into the left axilla. It is a systolic murmur and because of its location (fifth intercostal space by the midclavicular line or mitral area), it is close to the left axilla. 1735TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 476. C) Retin-A 0.25% cream Use Retin-A 0.25%. Guidelines for care of acne vulgaris management note that the effectiveness of topical retinoids in the treatment of acne is well documented. These agents act to reduce obstruction within the follicle and therefore are useful in the management of both comedonal and inflammatory acne. Systemic antibiotics are a standard of care in the management of moderate and severe acne. 1736TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 477. D) Cerebellum The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is associated with conscious thought, movement, and sensation. Balance is initially evaluated by the Romberg test. Ask the patient (eyes open then closed) to stand, feet together and arms at the sides. Loss of balance, a positive Romberg sign, indicates cerebellar ataxia or vestibular dysfunction. If the patient staggers or loses balance with the Romberg test, postpone other tests of cerebellar function requiring balance. 1737TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 478. A) Influenza Not all vaccinations are safe to get during pregnancy. However, the flu vaccine can be given before, during, and after pregnancy. The other vaccines are live viruses and are contraindicated during pregnancy. 1738TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 479. A) Heart disease, infertility, uterine cancer, diabetes, and endometrial cancer Chronic anovulation results in high levels of estrogen and androgens in the body. The risk of heart attack is four to seven times higher in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) than women of the same age without PCOS. Women with PCOS are at greater risk of having high blood pressure and have high levels of low- density lipoprotein (LDL) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Lack of ovulation is usually the reason for fertility problems in women with PCOS. More than 50% of women with PCOS have diabetes or prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance) before the age of 40. Women with PCOS are also at risk for endometrial cancer. Irregular menstrual periods and the lack of ovulation cause women to produce the hormone estrogen, but not progesterone. Without progesterone, the endometrium becomes thick, which can cause heavy or irregular bleeding. Over time, this can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. 1739TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 480. B) Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) There are three red blood cell indices: mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). The MCV shows the size of the red blood cells. The MCH value is the amount of hemoglobin in an average red blood cell. The MCHC measures the concentration of hemoglobin in an average red blood cell. These numbers help in the diagnosis of different types of anemia. Red cell distribution width (RDW) can also be measured, which shows whether the cells are all the same or different sizes or shapes. 1740TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 481. A) Barrett's esophagus Barrett's esophagus is most often diagnosed in people who have long-term gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\u2014a chronic regurgitation of acid from the stomach into the lower esophagus. Only a small percentage of people with GERD will develop Barrett's esophagus. 1741680 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 482. A) Amitriptyline a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome that occurs after reactivation of varicella-zoster virus infection with damage to sensory ganglia in nerve roots. Burning pain typically precedes the rash by several days and can persist for several months after the rash resolves. With postherpetic neuralgia, a complication of herpes zoster, pain may persist well after resolution of the rash and can be highly debilitating. Tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsants, often given in low dosages, may help to control neuropathic pain. 1742TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 483. C) Cold nodule Nodules that produce excess thyroid hormone\u2014called hot nodules \u2014show up on the thyroid scan because they take up more of the isotope than normal thyroid tissue does. Cold nodules are nonfunctioning and appear as defects or holes in the scan. Hot nodules are almost always noncancerous, but a few cold nodules are cancerous. The disadvantage of a thyroid scan is that it cannot distinguish between benign and malignant cold nodules. 1743TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 484. D) Median nerve Compression of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel produces characteristic symptoms\u2014burning; tingling; numbness over the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers. The Phalen maneuver is a diagnostic test for carpal tunnel syndrome. It is performed by pushing the back of the hands together for 1 minute. Eliciting carpal tunnel symptoms indicates a positive result for the test. 1744TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 485. A) Glucosamine Glucosamine is a sugar naturally produced by the body. It is one of the building blocks of cartilage. Cartilage covers and protects the ends of the bones, allowing bones to move smoothly against each other. Glucosamine comes in two forms\u2014glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride. 1745TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 486. D) Lithium salts Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) affect the serotonin system of the brain. They should not be combined with other drugs that affect and increase serotonin in the brain such as triptans or serotonin receptor (e.g., venlafaxine, others). After discontinuation of an MAOI, a minimum of 2 weeks is recommended before starting another drug that affects serotonin. This will help to avoid serotonin syndrome. Because of potentially lethal dietary and drug interactions, MAOIs have historically been reserved as a last line of treatment and are used only if other classes of antidepressants, such as SSRIs, have failed. 1746TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 487. C) Cauda equina syndrome Acute cauda equina syndrome is a surgical emergency. It requires decompression surgery of the spine to prevent permanent nerve damage of the affected nerve roots. The cauda equina contains 18 nerve roots. MRI is the best imaging test for evaluating this condition. The most common cause of compression is a herniated nucleus pulposus. Most herniations occur either at L4- L5 or L5-S1. The spinal nerves can also become infected (e.g., in tuberculosis, herpes, cytomegalovirus infections). Symptoms include low-back pain, sciatica (unilateral or bilateral), saddle pattern paresthesias, bladder and/or bowel incontinence, and lower extremity motor and sensory abnormalities. Sciatic pain is typically described as sharp or searing, rather than dull. Some patients experience a \"pins-and-needles\" sensation, numbness or weakness, or a prickling sensation down the leg. 1747681 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 488. C) Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa is the major pathogen in the lung with cystic fibrosis (CF). Prevalence is high and, once acquired, chronic infection will almost always ensue. P. aeruginosa settles into the thick mucus trapped in the airways. Once it sets up house in the respiratory tract, P. aeruginosa is hard to get rid of. Respiratory failure caused by the infection is often the ultimate cause of death in many people with CF. 1748TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 489. C) Renal function is mildly increased This is a false statement. There is a decrease in renal function as we age. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) starts to decrease in the fourth decade of life. The kidney also atrophies and shrinks slow with age. 1749TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 490. B) Clarithromycin (Biaxin) Clarithromycin (Biaxin) is a macrolide antibiotic and is in FDA pregnancy category C. All of the other antibiotics listed are pregnancy category B. The pregnancy category of a pharmaceutical agent is an assessment of the risk of fetal injury due to the pharmaceutical agent if it is used as directed by the mother during pregnancy. Category A = Adequate, well-controlled studies failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester and no evidence of risk in the later trimesters. Category B = animal studies have shown an adverse effect, but adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in any trimester. Category C = animal studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, and potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. Category D = there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. Category X = studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities, so the risks involved clearly outweigh the potential benefits. 1750TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 491. A) Plan radiographs of the right knee, ankle, and foot Plain radiographs, or x- rays, are the first exam ordered for suspected or obvious bony fractures. Severe pain on weight bearing and bruising of the right ankle is highly suggestive of a fracture. An MRI scan is not an initial test because it is very expensive. MRIs are preferred for joints and soft tissue. 1751TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 492. D) Tetanus vaccine and systemic antibiotics A break in the skin with a compound fracture is an indication for a tetanus vaccine (if last dose was more than 5 years ago) and systemic antibiotics. 1752TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 493. D) Mediterranean Lupus is more common among women of African American, Asian, and Hispanic racial backgrounds compared with those of Mediterranean background (Italians, Greeks, etc.). 1753TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 494. D) Malar rash A malar rash is the butterfly-shaped rash on the middle of the face that is caused by a type of photosensitivity reaction. It is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The other answer options are also found with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and others. 1754682 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 495 . C) (BC > AC) A normal result in the Rinne is air conduction (AC) greater than bone conduction (BC). When there is a conductive hearing loss (ceruminosis, otitis media), the result will be BC greater than AC. The reason is that the sound waves are blocked (e.g., cerumen, fluid in middle ear). Therefore, the patient can hear the sound louder through bone conduction. 1755TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 496. B) Plantar fasciitis The plantar fascia is the flat ligament that connects the heel bone to the toes. It supports the arch of the foot. Most people with plantar fasciitis have pain when they take their first steps after they get out of bed or sit for a long time. Stiffness and pain occur after taking a few steps, but the feet may hurt more as the day goes on. It may hurt the most when climbing stairs or after standing for a long time. 1756TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 497. A) Propranolol (Inderal) Propranolol (Inderal) is approved for management of essential tremor. It helps control the symptoms. Essential tremors are permanent and cannot be cured. Before prescribing, order an EKG. Do not prescribe beta-blockers if a patient has second- or third-degree heart block or chronic lung disease. 1757TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 498. B) The quasi-experimental design uses convenience sampling instead of random sampling to recruit subjects The quasi-experimental design uses an intervention (it is not an observational study or a survey). It has many similarities with an experimental study except that the human subjects are recruited by convenience and not at random (as in an experimental study). 1758TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 499. B) Advise the mother to use a nit comb after spraying the daughter's hair with white distilled vinegar, wait for 15 minutes, and then rinse the hair According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nits that are more than \u00bc inch from the scalp are usually not viable. The daughter also does not have an itchy scalp. One method of removal is to soak the patient's head with distilled vinegar (and then rinse), which will break down the protein of the nit casings, making it easy to comb them out of the hair. 1759TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 500. C) A filled-in square A filled-in square is a diseased or affected male and a filled- in circle is a diseased or affected female. An empty square is a healthy male and an empty circle is a healthy female. 1760TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 501. D) Reduction of the FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) with increase in the TLC (total lung capacity) and RV (residual volume) Findings characteristic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during pulmonary function testing are the reduction of the FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) and reduction of the FVC (forced vital capacity). There is an increase in the TLC (total lung capacity) and RV (residual volume). The lungs of patients with emphysema have lost their recoil (decreases FEV1). The lungs are always full of air that is hard to \"squeeze out\" of the lungs (increases residual volume and total lung capacity). To summarize COPD = reduction in the FEV1 and FVC with increases in the RV and TLC. 1761683 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 502. B) Start the patient on levothyroxine (Synthroid) 0.25 mcg PO daily The patient is symptomatic (weight gain, lack of energy, and irregular periods) with low free T4. Even though the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level decreased slightly, the free T4 remains low. An elevated TSH and low free T4 are indicative of hypothyroidism. The next step is to start her on levothyroxine (Synthroid) 0.25 mcg daily and recheck the TSH in 6 weeks. The goal is to normalize the TSH (between 1.0 to 3.5) and to ameliorate the patient's symptoms (increased energy, feels better, etc.). Armour thyroid (desiccated thyroid) is a natural supplement composed of dried (desiccated) pork thyroid glands. It is used in alternative medicine as an alternative to synthetic levothyroxine/T4 (Synthroid). 1762TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 503. A) Prostate feels firm and uniformly enlarged The prostate should feel firm and will be uniformly enlarged. A boggy and warm prostate with tenderness is suggestive of acute prostatitis. Hard nodules and indurated areas are highly suggestive of prostate cancer. 1763TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 504. C) Blood glucose Checking the blood glucose is indicated for patients with syncopal and near-syncopal episodes. The nurse practitioner should also obtain a thorough history of the incident. Possible causes of syncope are cardiac arrhythmia, vasovagal, hypoglycemia, orthostatic hypotension, seizure, accidental fall, and others. 1764TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 505. D) Affected testicle is swollen and feels cold to touch The affected testicle will be swollen, but it will feel very warm to the touch. A cold testicle is abnormal and is indicative of gangrene (after 24 hours). 1765TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 506. B) Collaborative A collaborative relationship exists when a health caregiver refers a patient to others (physicians, specialists, physical therapy, etc.) to help with patient treatment and management. Consult reports and progress reports are sent to the primary caregiver to report the patient's progress. Consultative relationships are informal, such as talking to a colleague about a patient's treatment. 1766TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 507. B) Acute bacterial endocarditis Bacterial endocarditis is also known as infective endocarditis ( IC ). It is a serious bacterial infection of the heart valves and the endocardial surface. The most common bacteria are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Subcutaneous red painful nodules on the finger pads are called Osler's nodes . Subungual splinter hemorrhages on the nailbeds are caused by microemboli. Janeway's lesions are caused by bleeding under the skin (usually located on the palms and the soles) and are painless red papules and macules. Other findings are conjunctival hemorrhages, petechiae, cardiac friction rubs, arrhythmias, murmurs, and others. Three blood cultures obtained at separate sites 1 hour apart are used to identify the causative organism. Some of the risk factors are damaged or prosthetic valves, history of rheumatic fever, and injection drug use. 1767TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 508. C) Inner ear Sensorineural hearing loss (i.e., presbycusis) involves damage to both the hair cells in the cochlea (sensory portion) and cranial nerve VIII (neural). 1768TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 509. B) Tdap, MCV4, and the HPV vaccines Vaccine questions usually are not this complicated, but there are several lessons that can be learned with this question. The 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for individuals 13 to 18 years of age are the Tdap catch-up (if not received at age 11-12 years), human papillomavirus (HPV) catch-up (if not received at age 11-12 years), and the MCV4 or meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Menactra). Thereafter, the Td form of the vaccine is indicated every 10 years. The DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus- acellular pertussis) and DT (diphtheria-tetanus) forms of the tetanus vaccine are not given after the age of 7 years. 1769684 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 510. A) Report the patient's grandson for elder abuse to the state protective health services Speaking with the grandson and warning him about elder abuse and being reported to authorities may result in harm to the patient and/or refusal to return to the clinic in the future for follow-up of the patient. Advising the patient to call his son as soon as possible is vague (for what?) and may benefit the patient, but it is not the best option in this case. 1770TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 511. C) Elderly Elderly who are mentally competent are not considered a vulnerable population group. 1771TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 512. A) Order an MRI scan of the spine as soon as possible The patient has new- onset numbness of the perineal area (saddle anesthesia), the sciatica is worsening, and the deep tendon reflexes of the lower extremity are decreased on the affected side. Rule out cauda equine syndrome and order an MRI (preferred test). The MRI can detect nerve root compression, herniated disk, cancer, and spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal). In addition, the patient needs to follow up with a neurologist as soon as possible. 1772TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 513. B) The patient has a mild case of acute diverticulitis and can be treated with antibiotics in the outpatient setting with close follow-up The patient has a mild case of acute diverticulitis and can be treated as an outpatient with antibiotics and a clear fluid diet for 2 to 3 days. It is very important to use care in patient selection and close follow-up (within 48 hours) are very important. Instruct patients to go to the hospital if symptoms get worse, if fever increases, if unable to tolerate PO treatment, and if pain worsens. Order a complete blood count (to check for leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and possible shift to the left), chemistry profile, and urinalysis (to rule out renal causes). 1773TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 514. A) Isoflavones Soy isoflavones (phytoestrogens) mimic the action of estrogen in the body. They are derived from soybeans and soybean products (soy milk, tofu). Supplementation with isoflavones may help some women with menopausal hot flashes. 1774TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 515. C) Peripheral neuropathy Bupropion increases the risk of seizures. Contraindications are seizures, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia. Avoid with any condition that increases seizures, such as after abrupt withdrawal of alcohol or sedatives, and with certain head injuries. For peripheral neuropathy, treatment options are an SNRI (duloxetine/Cymbalta), tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, topical capsaicin cream, and others. 1775TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 516. B) N The correct symbol used to indicate total number of subjects in a study (total population) is N. For example, a research study has a total number of subjects or total population of 100 (N = 100). The small letter n is used to indicate a subpopulation. For example, a study with a total population of N = 100 that is divided into two groups of 50 subjects (n = 50). 1776TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 517. B) 27% This patient's burns have a total body surface area (TBSA) of 27% and he should be referred to the emergency department as soon as possible.

A) Orthostatic hypotension and sedation (Zyprexa), quetiapine (Seroquel), and risperidone (Risperdal). It is also a common side effect of the older antipsychotics like haloperidol (Haldol). Antipsychotics do not cause severe anxiety and hyperphagia (increased appetite). They lower anxiety and cause sedation, sleepiness, anorexia, and hypotension and increase the risk of sudden death in frail elders. 1778685 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 519. B) Metronidazole (Flagyl) 500 mg PO TID \u00d7 10 days First-line treatment for a mild case of Clostridium difficile colitis is metronidazole (Flagyl) 500 mg PO TID for 10 days. Discontinuation of the offending antibiotic (if possible) or switching to another antibiotic class is recommended. The role of probiotic supplementation is controversial. Complications are pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, and fulminant colitis. 1779TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 520. A) Azithromycin (Zithromax) If the patient has a severe penicillin allergy, there is a 10% chance of cross-reactivity to cephalosporins (especially first generation). Because the patient is a child, the levofloxacin is contraindicated. Nausea is a common adverse reaction to erythromycin (it is not an allergic reaction). The best option is to use azithromycin because of its minimal gastrointestinal adverse effects. Azithromycin has fewer drug interactions compared with other macrolides. 1780TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 521. A) Thiazide diuretics decrease calcium excretion by the kidneys and stimulate osteoclast production This positive side effect of thiazides results in a decrease in calcium bone loss and an increase in the bone mineral density. 1781TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 522. D) It is a condition, characteristic, or factor that is being measured A variable is a condition, characteristic, or the factor that is being measured. An independent variable is the one being manipulated that is not affected by the others. A dependent variable is the result or the outcome from the manipulation of the independent variable. 1782TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 523. A) Take one pill every 1 to 2 hours until relief is obtained or adverse gastrointestinal effects occur, such as abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhea Colchicine acts as an anti-inflammatory and helps to suppress gouty attacks. It is usually taken as one tablet (0.6 mg) every 1 to 2 hours until relief is obtained (or adverse gastrointestinal [GI] effects occur, such as abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhea). The patient should be prescribed only 10 tablets at a time (do not refill) during a flare-up. The maximum dose is 6 mg/day. Many patients will develop adverse GI effects even before the pain is relieved. Colchicine can also be taken daily in small amounts for prophylaxis. 1783TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 524. D) Comprehensive eye exam A comprehensive eye exam by an ophthalmologist is recommended because hydroxychloroquine can adversely affect the retina (scotomas or visual field defects, loss of central vision, loss of color vision).

About 10% of women in the United States (ages 15-44 years) have difficulty getting pregnant (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009). PCOS is one of the most common causes of female infertility. Infertility in men is often caused by a varicocele (heats up the testes) and abnormal and/or low sperm count. 1818TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 559. B) M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease The classic triad of symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss (low frequency). Tinnitus is usually low pitch (like listening to a conch shell). One may have a strong sensation of ear fullness. The condition can resolve spontaneously or may be chronic. Pathologic lesion in the middle ear is called endolymphatic hydrops . Vasovagal syncope does not cause hearing loss or tinnitus, nor is it episodic. Hypoglycemia is not associated with episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. 1819TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 560. C) Increased lung compliance Lung compliance decreases as we get older; therefore, the FEV1 also decreases. There is minimal change in the total lung volume. Airways tend to collapse earlier (than in young patients) with shallow breathing, which increases the risk of pneumonia. 1820TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 561. D) Surgical procedures are regarded as important treatment for many illnesses Some Asian cultures regard surgery as the last resort and regard loss of blood as depleting the vital forces of the body and causing illness. Western medicine is considered to be \"hot\" and patients may discontinue or reduce the doses of their medicine without asking. An imbalance of the hot and cold (yin/yang) causes illness. Treating a \"yin\" disease (common cold) means avoiding eating yin foods (melons, cucumbers) because they will worsen it. Instead, yin diseases are treated with \"yang\" foods (meat, spicy foods) so that the body becomes more balanced. 1821TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 562. D) Tdap The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that one of the tetanus boosters be replaced with the Tdap (once in a lifetime).

Another name for it is sunspots . 1823691 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 564. C) Antinuclear antibody (ANA) The ANA test is usually positive in lupus patients. Other types of autoantibody testing recommended for these patients, in addition to ANA tests, are antiphospholipid antibodies, antibodies to double- stranded DNA, and anti-Smith (Sm) antibodies. Patients with suspected lupus should be referred to a rheumatologist. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the C-reactive protein (CRP) are nonspecific findings of inflammation and are elevated in patients with autoimmune diseases, infections, and others. 1824TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 565. A) Educate the patient about hypertension, how the medicine works on his body, and the importance of taking his pill daily When Hmong (an ethnic group prevalent in Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam) see a medical doctor for a symptom, they expect to be treated and \"cured\" of their illness after one visit. When the symptoms disappear, many will stop taking the medicine. When medication is to be taken on a long-term basis, it is important to educate the patient (and the patient's family) about the disease (in this case, hypertension), how the medicine works on the body, and the reason why the patient has to take the medicine as prescribed (in this case, daily). Many Southeast Asians are very polite and consider speaking in a loud voice, staring, or confrontation to be rude behavior. 1825TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 566. C) Multiply the treatment PSA value by 2 Before starting a prescription of finasteride (Proscar), obtain the baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value. Recheck the PSA again within 2 to 3 months during treatment to assess the patient's response (treatment PSA). For this example, the corrected treatment PSA is 20 (multiply 10 \u00d7 2 = 20). When comparing the corrected treatment PSA (20) with the baseline PSA (30), the value is lower (means the prostate shrunk in size). The patient's symptoms will also show improvement, including less nocturia, less dribbling, and stronger urinary stream. 1826TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 567. D) The nurse practitioner has an ethical duty to provide quality health care to patients Currently, health caregivers are not legally required to report illegal aliens to the state or local authorities. This patient does not have the signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis (TB) disease (cough, weight loss, night sweats) and has a negative chest x-ray. Therefore, he has latent TB infection and is not contagious. Only active TB disease (has signs/symptoms) is required to be reported to the state public health department. 1827TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 568. C) Body areas where skin rubs together, such as under the breast or in the groin area Candidal intertrigo infections are more common in obese individuals and in women with pendulous breasts.

A) Minor surgery in a walk-in surgical center Medicare Part A will pay for medically necessary inpatient care and supplies. Therefore, any type of surgery that is done in outpatient settings, such as a walk-in surgical center, will not be reimbursed. If plastic surgery is medically necessary (e.g., plastic surgery to repair facial damage from a burn), then it will be reimbursed. Costs for organ transplantation, such as kidney transplants, are reimbursed. 1831TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 572. D) Clean the wound with soap and water and prescribe amoxicillin- clavulanate (Augmentin) 500 mg PO BID \u00d7 10 days Cat bites are more likely to become infected than dog bites, and this bite is located on an extremity. These facts justify the prescription of Augmentin 500 mg PO BID \u00d7 10 days for the patient. Because the last tetanus booster was given at age 13 years, it has only been 4 years since the patient's last tetanus booster. This incident falls within the 5-year time period in which the previous booster would offer protection; hence there is no need for a tetanus booster at this visit. 1832TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 573. A) Small, smooth testicles with no pubic or facial hair Small, smooth testicles with no pubic or facial hair (Tanner stage I) is a worrisome finding at the age of 15 years because it signifies that the boy is not in the pubertal stage yet.

C) Finasteride (Proscar) Finasteride (Proscar) belongs to the drug class called 5- alpha reductase inhibitors . It helps to lower serum testosterone, which helps to decrease the size of the prostate. It is also used for male-pattern baldness. It can decrease prostate size by half (50%) resulting in a smaller prostate and less obstructive voiding symptoms such as weak stream, frequency, and nocturia. Another drug class used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy is the alpha-blockers, such as terazosin (Hytrin) and tamsulosin (Flomax). They work by relaxing the smooth muscle tissue of the prostate gland, which enlarges the diameter of the urethra, rather than by shrinking prostate tissue (like finasteride [Proscar]). 1875TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 616. A) Check the TSH and free T4 level The upper limit of the serum thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH) level is about 4.0 mU/L (range of 0.4-4.0). With an elevated TSH of 10, it is necessary to rule out hypothyroidism. The next step is to recheck the TSH with the free T4 (thyroxine) level. Classic findings of primary hypothyroidism are an elevated TSH and low free T4. As the disease worsens, the T3 (triiodothyronine) level becomes lower. 1876TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 617.

D) Pap smear The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF; 2012) does not recommend Pap smears (cytology) in women younger than 21 years of age because cervical cancer is rare before this age. A history of sexual intercourse or multiple sex partners is not considered to be an indication for a Pap smear in this age group. There is evidence that screening earlier than age 21 years, regardless of sexual history, would lead to more harm than benefit (USPSTF, 2012). Instead, testing for sexually transmitted disease/infection is the best choice for this age group. The USPSTF recommends screening for cervical cancer in women aged 21 to 65 years with cytology (Pap smear) every 3 years. Another option for women aged 30 to 65 years who want to lengthen the screening interval is a combination of cytology with HPV testing (co-testing) every 5 years. 1888699 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 629. C) Serum interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) The preferred method of testing for tuberculosis (TB) infection in persons who previously received the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine is a TB blood test\u2014the interferon-gamma release assay\u2014such as the QuantiFERON-TB Gold (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016).

C) Check serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen (CA) 125 levels The patient is a woman who is of Ashkenazi Jewish background with a positive family history of breast cancer (mother, sister). She is at very high risk for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations (hereditary breast cancer). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2013) recommends that primary care providers screen women for a family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer. Women with positive screening results should receive genetic screening, and, if indicated after counseling, BRCA testing. These high-risk women are screened with a mammogram and breast MRI and are best managed by breast cancer specialists. 1901TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 642. A) Mitral valve prolapse A systolic murmur that is accompanied by a mid- systolic click located at the apical area is a classic finding of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Most cases of MVP are asymptomatic. detect MVP, order an echocardiogram with Doppler imaging. 1902TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 643. B) Bone conduction (BC) > air conduction (AC) The sound is heard louder by bone conduction versus air conduction (BC > AC) in serous otitis media and other types of conductive hearing loss. This is because when the affected ear is filled with fluid, the tympanic membrane cannot move in response to the sound waves due the fluid trapped inside the middle ear. Because the sound waves are blocked, the sound is heard better by bone conduction. 1903701 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 644. D) Budesonide (Rhinocort) one to two sprays in each nostril twice a day The first-line treatment for allergic rhinitis is topical glucocorticoid nasal sprays such as budesonide (Rhinocort). It will decrease swelling and open the Eustachian tubes so that the middle ear can drain. The other medications (cetirizine, azelastine, nasal saline) are not considered first-line agents for allergic rhinitis, but they can be added if the symptoms are not well controlled. Azelastine (Astelin) is a topical antihistamine. Cetirizine (Zyrtec) is a systemic antihistamine. Do not combine it with azelastine (Astelin) because both are antihistamines and taken concurrently will cause excessive drowsiness. Topical nasal steroid sprays, cetirizine, and nasal saline sprays are sold over the counter. But azelastine (Astelin) is available only by prescription. 1904TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 645.

It can result in acute kidney injury or acute renal failure. There are many causes such as severe exercise, traumatic crush injuries, medicines (statins, fibrates especially if combined), illicit drugs, and others. The signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are muscle pain (shoulders, thighs, calves, lower back), muscle weakness, dark-red or brown urine, fever, tachycardia, and/or decreased urination. Almost half of patients report no muscular symptoms. 1906TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 647. C) Anterior epistaxis Trauma to the small blood vessels in Kiesselbach's triangle (or plexus), located inside the nose anteriorly, causes anterior nosebleeds (anterior epistaxis). This is the most common type of nosebleed and is usually self-limited. Up to 10% of nosebleeds are posterior nosebleeds in hemorrhage. Posterior nosebleeds can cause significant hemorrhage. If suspected, call 911. Trauma to Kiesselbach's triangle does not cause stroke or subdural hematoma. 1907TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 648. A) Medial tibial stress fracture stress syndrome (MDSS, or \"shin splints\") are more common in individuals who participate in sports that involve running and/or jumping (track and field, soccer, basketball). Medial tibial stress fracture is more common in female athletes. It is caused or exacerbated by excessive training, sudden increase in training intensity, or overuse. The symptoms of medial tibial stress fracture can resemble MDSS, but the pain is more persistent and worsens until it also occurs at rest. The physical exam findings reveal a focal area of tenderness on the anterior medial aspect of the tibia. The imaging test of choice is MRI. A radiograph (x-ray) will not show a stress fracture. If a medial tibial stress fracture is suspected, the patient should be advised to stop the sport/activity, use RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) to relieve symptoms, and should be referred to an orthopedic specialist. 1908702 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 649. B) Thumb spica cast The scaphoid bone is located on the radial aspect of the wrist (same side as the thumb). Another term for scaphoid fracture is navicular space fracture of the wrist . In patients with this injury, palpating in the anatomic snuffbox area reveals local tenderness. A thumb spica cast is used to stabilize fractures of the wrist. It is applied below the elbow (forearm in neutral position) and extends to the hand (wrist and thumb are immobilized). Sometimes, this type of fracture is stabilized with a screw (surgery) because it has a higher rate of nonunion. 1909TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 650.

Macular degeneration, osteoporosis, and Parkinson's disease are more common in the geriatric population. 1917TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 658. A) Straight leg raising test The straight leg raising test is used to evaluate for sciatica. Classic findings are mid-buttock burning or sharp pain, which may radiate down the thigh, lower leg, and foot. A severe case of sciatica can result in \"foot drop,\" which is why the patient is complaining of weakness of the foot that interferes with walking. This type of sciatica patient needs to be referred to a neurologist to rule out nerve root compression. Sciatica is a type of lumbar radiculopathy. The imaging test of choice is an MRI of the lower spine. The McMurray test is used to assess meniscus damage of the knees. The Lachman test assesses damage to the anterior cruciate ligament. The Markle test (or heel jar test) is used to assess for pelvic inflammatory disease or peritonitis. 1918TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 659. C) Auspitz sign Auspitz sign is observed when a psoriatic lesion is scraped or scratched multiple times, resulting in pinpoint areas of bleeding on the psoriatic plaque. Lichenification is thickened skin caused by chronic irritation (itching). It is considered a secondary lesion. Another type of secondary skin lesion is an erosion, which occurs with loss of epidermis (but not the dermis). It can resemble a shallow ulcer. The Koebner phenomenon refers to lesions (often linear) that appear on the skin of patients with psoriasis as a result of trauma to the skin (e.g., scratching). 1919TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 660. D) Fibromyalgia The American College of Rheumatology (2010) uses several criteria to diagnose fibromyalgia: widespread pain index, symptoms present at a similar level for at least 3 months, and presence of pain or tenderness at certain body sites. The locations in the body (widespread pain index) are neck, jaw, shoulder girdle, upper and lower arm, chest, abdomen, upper and lower back, upper and lower leg, and hip (trochanters). Other criteria include fatigue, sleep problems, and cognitive symptoms. The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown. Treatment is symptomatic. 1920TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 661. D) Claims against the nurse practitioner are covered if both the incident and claim happen when the policy is still active . Therefore, both the incident and the claim have to be filed when the policy is active (during the coverage time period). When the nurse practitioner stops paying the premiums for this type of policy, it is no longer active. 1921704 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 662. D) Transient ischemic attack (TIA) A TIA is a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction due to focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction. Originally, TIA was defined as sudden onset of focal neurologic signs and/or symptoms lasting fewer than 24 hours. Patients with suspected TIA require urgent evaluation due to high risk of stroke. An MRI of the brain is preferred to a CT of the brain. A search for the cause of the TIA includes conditions such as hypertension, blood clot from the heart, carotid blockage, and so forth. For secondary prevention, aspirin therapy and statin therapy are recommended. Some patients may need antithrombotics. Symptoms of a TIA are the same as a stroke but last only a short time. The mnemonic is \"FAST\" with F (one side of face is drooping), A (ask patient to raise both arms, does one arm drift downward), S (slurred speech), and T (time; if present, call 911). These signs are seen in stroke along with change in level of consciousness, confusion or memory loss, difficulty swallowing, difficulty writing, inability to recognize objects/people, incontinence, and trouble speaking or understanding others. 1922TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 663. A) Calcium channel blockers blockers (CCBs) and thiazide diuretics are preferred for treatment of isolated systolic hypertension of the elderly. There is no preference of one over the other, and therapy may be started with either a thiazide diuretic or a CCB. Isolated systolic hypertension of the elderly is caused by hardening of the arteries, resulting in increased peripheral vascular resistance. The goal for patients aged 60 years or older is blood pressure less than 150/90 mmHg unless diabetic or they have chronic kidney disease (goal BP <140/90 mmHg). Watch for orthostatic hypotension (or decrease in SBP of >20 mmHg), which is a risk factor for falls. 1923TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 664. C) Use the spirometer to assess severity of symptoms The patient is having an acute asthmatic exacerbation. The patient's vital signs reveal a respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min and pulse of 88 beats/min, which are within normal limits (not in respiratory distress). Before administering nebulized albuterol, use the spirometer to quantify the degree of impairment and listen to the breath sounds. Then after the treatment, recheck spirometry to evaluate the patient's response. The nebulizer treatment can be repeated in 20 minutes as needed. Change the patient's prescription to a combination steroid and long-acting beta-agonist inhaler plus a Medrol dose pack. 1924TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 665. B) Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) The preferred drugs for treatment of patients with stable heart failure are ACE inhibitors or ARBs, usually in combination with beta-blockers, a diuretic, and/or spironolactone. 1925TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 666. C) Basal cell carcinoma This is a photograph of basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer. Although the lesion does not have central ulceration, it contains telangiectasia with a waxy or pearly (shiny) appearance. The gold-standard diagnosis for any type of skin cancer is a biopsy of the lesion that is sent to the lab for pathological evaluation. 1926TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 667. A) 1, C) 2, B) 3 HPV strains 16 and 18 are highly oncogenic. This patient has cervical cancer and requires immediate biopsy, excisional treatment, and staging for cervical cancer. The correct order of these actions is: (1) Refer the patient for a colposcopy, (2) obtain cervical biopsy specimens for pathological evaluation, and (3) perform loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for removal of cancerous cervical tissue. 1927TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 668. D) Melanoma This is a photograph of melanoma. Think of the \"ABCD\" rule for pigmented lesions that are highly suspicious: A (asymmetry), B (irregular borders), C (three or more colors such as black, blue, tan, red, white), and D (diameter >6 mm or >\u00bc inch). 1928TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 669. A) Diarrhea with blood mixed in the stool Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is considered a functional disorder since the colon tissue is normal. There is no inflammation or bleeding in IBS. Patients report chronic abdominal pain, flatulence, bloating, and changes in bowel movements. IBS is more common in women than men. Rectal bleeding, blood in stool, anemia, fatigue, and weight loss are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. 1929705 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 670. D) Penicillins Levothyroxine does not interact with penicillins. But it does have numerous drugs it interacts with such as anticoagulants, tricyclic antidepressants, multivitamins, proton-pump inhibitors, estrogens, metformin, and others. Certain foods interfere with absorption (calcium-fortified foods, dietary fiber, walnuts, soy). Patients should avoid taking them together, and should space these foods and drugs several hours apart. Levothyroxine (Synthroid) is a synthetic form of T4. 1930TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 671. C) Anterior cruciate ligament damage A positive anterior drawer sign occurs when there is damage to the anterior cruciate ligament. The patient is tested in supine position with knees flexed at 90 degrees and feet flat on the exam table. Hold the proximal lower leg (upper tibia) and push the leg anteriorly. The test is positive if the affected knee slides or has laxity when compared with the uninjured knee. Refer patient to an orthopedic specialist if the knee is unstable. The best imaging test for joints is the MRI. 1931TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 672. A) Metronidazole (Flagyl) 500 mg orally TID \u00d7 10 to 14 days The first-line antibiotic for patients with mild to moderate Clostridium difficile colitis is metronidazole. Vancomycin is reserved for patients with severe cases. 1932TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 673. A) Giardiasis Giardia lamblia is that infects the small intestine. Giardiasis is common in the developing world and rural areas and can cause acute and chronic infection. Campers, hunters, backpackers, and travelers to endemic areas are at highest risk. The incubation period is 7 to 14 days, and symptoms can last for 2 to 4 weeks. Chronic infection can result in malabsorption and significant weight loss. First-line antibiotics are tinidazole (Tindamax) or nitazoxanide (Nizonide). Alternative antibiotics are metronidazole (Flagyl) and others. 1933TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 674. D) Expert opinion Expert opinions and professional society opinions are considered to offer the lowest level of evidence because they are subjective and not based on research. Cohort studies are used to investigate risk factors and causes of disease. An example of a cohort study is the Framingham Study. An experiment that uses randomization, control group, and intervention group(s) offers a lower level of evidence than a randomized controlled trial. The ranking of options for this question is as follows: (1) randomized controlled trial, (2) experiments, (3) cohort studies, and (4) expert opinions. The best method of correctly answering this type of question is to memorize the categories for the best level of evidence (meta-analysis and/or systematic review and/or RCTs) and the lowest form of evidence (opinions, editorials). 1934TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 675. A) Meta-analysis Meta-analyses and systematic reviews offer the highest level of evidence. The ranking of options for this question is as follows: (1) meta-analysis, (2) randomized controlled trial, (3) cohort study, and (4) expert opinion. The best method of correctly answering this type of question is to memorize the categories for the best level of evidence (meta-analysis and/or systematic review and/or randomized controlled trials) and the lowest form of evidence (opinions, editorials). Cohort studies are used to investigate risk factors and causes of disease. An example of a cohort study is the Framingham Study. 1935TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 676. B) 7.5% or higher The estimated 10-year ASCVD risk score is 7.5% or higher. The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend treatment with high-intensity statins for patients aged 40 to 75 years with very high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) values who have a score of 7.5% or higher. 1936706 TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 677. C) High-intensity statin This patient fulfills the criteria for high-intensity statin dosing criteria from the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) blood cholesterol guideline. He already has heart disease (angina), type 2 diabetes, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of 195 mg/dL, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) of 25 mg/dL. This patient is at very high risk for heart disease and warrants a high-intensity dose of statin. There are only two choices at this level: atorvastatin (Lipitor) 40 to 80 mg or rosuvastatin (Crestor) 20 to 40 mg. 1937TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 678. A) Discontinue atorvastatin (Lipitor) and order a liver function profile The patient has symptoms of liver damage, including fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, and darker colored urine. The statin should be discontinued, and a liver function profile is indicated. This patient is taking high-dose atorvastatin (60 mg) plus a high-dose B- complex vitamin (which contains niacin or vitamin B 3 ). The combination of a statin with niacin raises the risk of drug-induced hepatitis and rhabdomyolysis. 1938TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 679. D) Vascular dementia Vascular dementia (multi infarct dementia) is the second most common type of dementia. It is caused by stroke, large artery infarctions, small artery infarctions (lacunes), and chronic subcortical ischemia of the brain. Symptoms vary depending on the location of the damaged tissue in the brain. Common symptoms are memory loss, impaired judgment, apathy (loss of motivation), and impaired decision-making function. The most common type of dementia in the United States is Alzheimer's disease. 1939TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION SECTION, TAP ON THE ANSWER NUMBER 680. B) Azithromycin 1 g PO in a single dose There are two regimens for treatment of nongonococcal urethritis: either azithromycin 1 g PO in a single dose or doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days. Before treatment, test the patient for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Use the first urine of the day to test the patient with a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT).
