We are committed to protecting the health and safety of all members of the Georgetown community. One of the most important elements of our layered approach to COVID-19 mitigation is the University's COVID-19 vaccination requirement. All students, faculty and staff must receive a primary series and, when eligible, an additional dose of a [COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.georgetown.edu/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/), or have an approved medical or religious exemption. Please [upload your COVID-19 vaccination documentation](https://uis.georgetown.edu/coronavirus-instructions-for-uploading-your-vaccination-documentation/), including your additional dose (\"booster\"), via the GU360 mobile app or [GU360 website](https://gu360.georgetown.edu/s/), or [request a medical or religious exemption](https://gu360.georgetown.edu/s/vaccination-exemption-form#_ga=2.53871914.346858612.1648477639-663955027.1642104236), as soon as possible. The deadline for submitting COVID-19 vaccination documentation is July 22 for students beginning courses in the Fall 2022 term. On July 23, 2022, students who have not complied with Georgetown's COVID-19 vaccination requirement will be officially dropped from all courses or prevented from registering for courses, placed on an immediate leave of absence and receive a 100% tuition refund for the semester. - Once placed on leave, the University cannot guarantee the student's class schedule, should they be allowed to re-enroll. - Students will have a maximum of two years from the date of leave to request reinstatement at the University per the reinstatement guidelines for their applicable school; after that time, the student will be withdrawn from the University unless an extension of leave is approved. - If students believe this action was taken in error, they will have three business days to appeal the action to the applicable school dean and program director. If you need assistance, please refer to the resources below. - If you have questions regarding COVID-19 vaccination, please contact the University's Public Health team at [HoyaVaxa@georgetown.edu](mailto:HoyaVaxa@georgetown.edu)or visit the University's [COVID-19 Resource Center](https://www.georgetown.edu/coronavirus/)for more information. - If you have any questions about accessing GU360, please email University Information Services at [help@georgetown.edu](mailto:help@georgetown.edu). - If you have questions related to your academic needs, please contact your advising dean or program director.
