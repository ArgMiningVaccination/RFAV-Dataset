Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine have a lot in common. Both are ancient holistic healing systems that treat the whole person, rather than just the symptoms of a disease. They both emphasize that one's overall health is more important than fixing a specific problem. In fact, they believe that improving your general health will cure any disease you might have. Both also use herbs and other natural remedies as part of their healing approach, and both emphasize the importance of eating healthy foods.
