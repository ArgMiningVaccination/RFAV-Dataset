Health Disparities Frequency: Completed twice every federal fiscal year, as part of the second- and fourth-quarter progress reports SAMHSA defines behavioral health as mental/emotional well-being and/or actions that affect wellness. The phrase \"behavioral health\" is also used to describe service systems that encompass prevention and promotion of emotional health; prevention of mental and substance use disorders, substance use, and related problems; treatments and services for mental and substance use disorders; and recovery support. Healthy People 2030 prioritizes eliminating health disparities, achieving health equity, and attaining health literacy to improve the health and well-being of all. Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group; religion; socioeconomic status; gender; age; mental health; cognitive, sensory, physical disability; sexual orientation or gender identity; geographic location; or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion.\" In this section, we would like you to describe the efforts and activities that your state, tribe, or jurisdiction has undertaken in the project to address Behavioral Health Disparities related to HIV or substance use disorders risks, prevalence, and outcomes. 2.1. Cultural Competence and Behavioral Health Disparities Activities 1. Which of the following health disparities-related activities did your organization or institution conduct during this reporting period? (select all that apply) Conducted needs assessment activities specific to behavioral health disparities (e.g., identified subpopulations experiencing health disparities and their specific needs, collected data on identified subpopulations) Involved members of subpopulations experiencing behavioral health disparities in your CSAP/MAI activities, such as assessment, capacity building, planning, implementation, and evaluation Built organizational capacity for addressing behavioral health disparities (e.g., received trainings or built coalitions specifically for addressing disparities) Implemented strategies to address behavioral health disparities (e.g., interventions tailored to vulnerable subpopulations, efforts to increase access of vulnerable subpopulations to SA and HIV prevention and treatment services) Increased access to substance use and HIV prevention services for subpopulations experiencing behavioral health disparities (i.e., increased these populations' ability to get to or use these services). Increased access may refer to enhanced health coverage, services, timeliness, and workforce. Evaluated effects of implemented strategies on subpopulations experiencing behavioral health disparities Developed a plan to sustain progress made in addressing substance use and HIV-related health disparities beyond the CSAP/MAI grant Other (Specify) __________________________________________ _______________ 3 2.2 Accomplishments and Barriers 1.
