Role: Co -PI 1RO1DK096549- 01A1 (Coca) Serum and Urinary Biomarkers of Diabetic Kidney Disease The two major goals of this study are to 1) identify biomarkers for primary prevention of incident diabetic kidney disease and for secondary prevention of progressive kidney disease; and 2) to better understand the renal outcomes of ACCORD in relation to the applied interventions. The ultimate goal is to identify better surrogates or therapeutic targets for kidney disease in diabetics. Clinical Research Data Network The LACDRN will increase the capacity to conduct robust comparative effectiveness research by building a health information technology infrastructure that provides access to comprehensive clinical data for more than one million patients statewide.

ACCORDION is an observational follow up study that will be done over the next 3\u00bd years to see if the effects of the ACCORD treatmen ts change over time. Reduction Approaches for Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study (The GRADE Study) The primary aim of the GRADE Study is to examine five different medications that are commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes and compare their effectiveness in lowering and maintaining HbA1c levels over time in recent- onset type 2 diabetes when used in combination with metformin. In addition , other attributes of the medication combinations, including adverse events, acceptability, and effects on cardiovascular risk factors, quality -of-life, and other outcomes, will be compared. Finally, in a subset of the study cohort, the relative effects of early combination therapy will be compared with the traditional sequential approach. 7 U01 DK098245- 01 (Pittas) 10/01/2012 - 06/30/ 2014 2.40 calendar NIH/NIDDK Vitamin D to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes (The D2d Study) The primary aim of the D2 d study is to determine the effectiveness of Vitamin D is preventing Type 2 diabetes mellitus. 1R21DK094006- 01(Fonseca; Navar) 08/15/2012 - 07/31/2014 1.20 Urinary AGT as a Novel Biomarker for Intrarenal RAS Ac tivity in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus The purpose of this research study is to investigate a more sensitive and specific test for determining the early presence of diabetes nephropathy, a disease of the kidneys.
