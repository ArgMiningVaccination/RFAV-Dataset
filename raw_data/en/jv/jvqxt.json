This book is the result of many minds, hearts, and souls who have shared a vision of healing with me. It would not exist without them. It began when Lance Sholdt, then at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, asked if I would work with him to put together a course in complementary and alternative medicine for the medical students. His careful construction of this course helped us outline the contents of the book. This book is the brainchild of Jeff Levin. He was the first to suggest that a textbook like this was needed and could be written. His heartfelt work and attention to detail kept things moving when I was bogged down. Janette Carlucci is the soul of the book, managing both the special features and the day-to-day contact with the many authors. To her, a special thanks on this journey. Ron Chez provided a much needed balance for the book. He was always ready and willing to assist with a critical eye and keep us anchored to how this book could be of benefit for patients. I would also like to thank the editors, Jane Velker, Beth Goldner, and Joyce Murphy, for understanding the complexity of the topic and for a commitment to quality over deadlines. And Tim Hiscock for finally saying that we were going to press\u2014 ready or not. I would just as soon have worked another three years on it as finish. Complementary Therapies in Medicine 2000 Objectives: To see how lay people group or classify various CAM therapies. Design: Nearly 600 adults rated 39 relatively familiar branches of complementary medicine on four dimensions: whether they had heard of it, whether they think they know how it works; whether they had tried it; and a rating of efficacy on a 10-point scale. Results: As predicted those most heard of were acupuncture, aromatherapy, herbal medicine, hypnosis, massage and yoga while those with lowest ratings were autogenic training, ayurveda, biochemic tissue salts, chelation cell therapy and ozone therapy. A number of multivariate statistical techniques were used to attempt to investigate the perceived dimensional structure of the different therapies. Slightly different structures emerged depending on the question asked and the analysis computed. Conclusion: The 'bottom-up' empirically derived taxonomization of therapies was interpretable and showed 10 different factors. The issue of classifying or taxonomizing complementary medicines is discussed. 1996 ABSTRACT This paper deals with the air pollution most especially the causes and how it can be prevent.
