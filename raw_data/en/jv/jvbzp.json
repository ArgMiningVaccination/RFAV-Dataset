I accept total responsibility for the accuracy of all information obtained on such billings, regardless of the method of compilation, assimilation, or transmission of the information (either by myself, my staff, and/or a third party acting on my behalf, such as a service bureau). I fully recognize that any billing intermediary or service bureau that submits billings to the Indiana Family and Social S ervices Administration (FSSA) or its Fiscal Agent Contractor is acting as my representative and not that of the FSSA or its Fiscal Agent Contractor. I further acknowledge that any third party that submits billings on my behal f shall be deemed to be my agen t for the purposes of submission of IHCP claims. I understand that the standard paper claim form may include a signature line. I understand that all the stipulations, conditi ons, and terms of the provider agreement apply in the event that I fail, for any reason, to sign the paper claim , and the claim is approved for payment. I agree that payment of a paper claim that did not contain my signature in no way absolves me of the terms stated in the provider agreement that I have signed.
