Colorado State University General Catalog2002-2003 The Colorado State University campuses are located in or n ear the city of Fort Collins. The county seat of Larimer County, this community of approximately 119,000 is located 65 miles north of Denver on Interstate 25, and 45 miles south of Cheyenne, Wyoming. The city is served by railroad-freight and bus lines. Transportation from Fort Collins to Denver International Airport is provided by shuttle service. At the foot of the Rocky Mountains, Fort Collins is within an hour's drive of such major recreational areas as Estes Park, Red Feather Lakes, Horsetooth Reservoir, and se veral mountain parks, including the 790,000-acre Roosevelt National Forest and Rocky Mountain National Park. A wide variety of recreational activities is fostered not onl y by the presence of such areas but also by the climate in the Fort Collins region. Located at an elevation of 5,000 feet, Fort Collins has a clear, dry atmosphere, over 300 days of sunshine and generally pleasant temperatures throughout the year. The summer temperature ranges from an average high of 85\u00b0 to an average low of 52\u00b0; the winter temperature ranges from an average high of 42\u00b0 to an average low of 13\u00b0. Indicative of the cultural life of Fort Collins are the museum, the public library, and civic symphony. An active University calendar-guest speakers, art exhibits, theater, cinema, concerts-adds to community life. This broad spectrum of cultural and outdoor recreational facilities, the excellent climate, and the mountain surroundings contribute toward making Fort Collins an ideal university setting. This General Catalog contains basic information about Co lorado State University and the educational programs that started in Fall 2000.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Welcome to Colorado State University! Education should prepare students not only to make a living, but to live full, rewarding lives. This academic program guide provides an introduction to the rich variety of experiences available to students who undertake this vital and challenging journey at Colorado State. This is an exciting time at our University - a time when we're renewing our commitment to undergraduate education and celebrating excellence in teaching and advising. The introduction of first-year seminars and a rigorous new core curriculum are evidence of this commitment. This general catalog can offer insight into the breadth and depth of the educational offerings at our University, but descriptions of courses and majors only tell part of the story. The educational experience at Colorado State involves more than just what students learn in the classroom. A Colorado State education involves a rich variety of academic, cultural, and research experiences that prepare students to confront the challenges of a complex and demanding world. Colorado State is known worldwide for its top research programs in. such fields as engineering, water resources, forestry, agricultural sciences, atmospheric sciences, veterinary medicine, and more. But our University's most important mission is to educate students-undergraduate and graduate. Colorado State has been shaped by thousands of students with diverse interests and character-students who enliven the community through music, drama, and art; students who work with professors on important scientific breakthroughs; students who have built one of the nation's top student volunteer programs. Colorado State graduates have gone on to win Pulitzer Prizes, fly on space-shuttle missions, become leaders of industry, conduct important scholarly work, and much more. Our goal is to help all students pursue their individual dreams and realize their potential as educated citizens. We welcome you to our University and encourage you to take advantage of all it has to offer. Sincerely, Albert C.

The University THE MISSION OF COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY In 1870 the Territorial Council and House of Representatives of the Territory of Colorado created the Agricultural Collegeof Colorado. When the Territory became a State in 1876, theCollege was placed under the governance of the State Boardof Agriculture. The College admitted its first students in 1879and received designation that same year as Colorado'sland-grant college under the Morrill Act of 1862. The MorrillAct provided federal endowment support for state institutions, where the leading object shall be, without excludingother scientific and classical studies, and includingmilitary tactics, to teach such branches of learning asare related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, insuch manner as the Legislatures of the States mayrespectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberaland practical education of the industrial classes in theseveral pursuits and professions in life. Subsequent federal legislation led to the establishment of anagricultural experiment station and extension service, whilestate legislation added responsibility for the Colorado StateForest Service. Following several name changes, the Collegebecame Colorado State University in 1957 and earnedrecognition by the North Central Association of Colleges andSchools as a mature university in 1974.

Undergraduate Admissions 20 Policy and Procedures For Transfer Students Undergraduate students who wish to transfer to Colorado State should request an application from the Office ofAdmissions. Students may also apply using the application onthe World Wide Web at: http://admissions.colostate.edu. A$30 nonrefundable processing fee is required. Undergraduate students who have graduated from high school and completed more than nine credits at other institutions mustapply as transfer students. Those who were enrolled in highschool and took college-level course work concurrently(regardless of the number of credits attempted) or those whohave completed nine or fewer semester credits after highschool must apply for admission as freshmen (see \"For HighSchool Graduates\" above) and must also submit officialtranscripts of all collegiate work attempted. The deadline for submission of admission applications and all required documentation is July 1 for fall semester and December 1 for spring semester. All applications and/orsupporting documentation postmarked after the deadline willbe processed for the next term. Earlier admission improveschances for financial aid and housing, and facilitates academicadvising in the student's chosen major. Applicants must submit official transcripts showing all work attempted from each university or college attended. No part of the previous collegiate record may be disregarded. Failure to list all institutions previously attended is a serious offense thatwill cancel admission or enrollment. Transfer students currently registered at another institution must submit a list ofcourses indicating those in which they are presently enrolledand those in which they will enroll prior to entering ColoradoState. Additionally, high school transcripts may be requestedto determine if course work requirements have been met. Transfer students must meet the admission requirement in mathematics. This requirement may be met by completing atransferable mathematics course (e.g., College Algebra) witha grade of \"C\" or higher, OR completing intermediate algebrawith a grade of \"B\" or higher, OR completing algebra I,geometry, algebra II (or a comparable math sequence) withgrades of \"C\" or higher while in high school (submit a highschool transcript), OR achieving a satisfactory score on theColorado State University Entry Level Mathematics Exam,OR by submitting other credible evidence of adequatepreparation of university-level mathematics courses.. Foreign/second language is required. Transfer students may meet this requirement by successfully completing with a gradeof \"C\" or higher: two years of the same second language inhigh school (submit a high school transcript) OR twosemesters or three quarters of the same second language at thecollege level. If this is not fulfilled at the high school orcollege level, it must be completed while enrolled at ColoradoState University.Applicants are granted admission on the basis of theirprevious academic and conduct records, the appropriatenessof their previous courses to their proposed program of study,and the availability of space in the program. Admission issubject to satisfactory completion of current courses andsubmission of a final, complete, official transcript. Transferstudents should plan to complete composition before applyingfor admission to Colorado State. Priority will be given tostudents who demonstrate the greatest academic potential forattaining a degree at Colorado State. Students who have completed an Associate of Arts or an Associate of Science degree from an accredited Coloradoinstitution will be guaranteed admission providing that it is thelast institution attended and that a cumulative 2.00 (A=4.0)has been achieved from ALL institutions attended andprovided enrollment limitations have not been met. Because of demand, admission to some programs of study is more competitive than others; admission to these programs islimited to students presenting the strongest academiccredentials. For example, students applying to the College ofEngineering must have successfully completed at least oneterm of calculus and one term of calculus-based physics orchemistry prior to enrolling. Preference will be given to thoseapplicants with the strongest records in pre-engineeringprograms. Consult individual college sections for additionaladmission information. Course work taken at vocational-technical institutes or nonaccredited colleges generally is not counted toward theminimum number of credits required for admission of transferstudents. In special cases, students otherwise well-qualified, but not meeting all of these requirements, are considered foradmission on a case-by-case basis. Good Standing Requirement Transfer applicants for admission to Colorado State whoserecords indicate they are under disciplinary censure generallymay not be admitted until they have cleared their disciplinaryrecords. While each case is decided on the basis ofinformation furnished by the applicant and institutionconcerned, the general rule is applicants may be consideredfor admission to Colorado State for the term nearest the datethey are eligible to return to their former institutions.

The tuition law, which applies to all publicinstitutions of higher education in Colorado, is subject tojudicial interpretation and change at any time by the Coloradolegislature. Colorado State University must apply the rules setforth in the Colorado Revised Statutes, and is not free to make exceptions except as specifically permitted under the Statute. Definition of \"In-State Residency\" for Tuition Purposes Under the Colorado tuition law, the term \"in-state\" student means: \"A student who has been domiciled in Colorado forone year or more immediately preceding the first day ofclasses for the term for which such status is claimed.\" Furtherthe tuition law states: \"Attendance at an institution of highereducation, public or private, within the state of Colorado shallnot alone be sufficient to qualify for domicile in Colorado.\" \"Domicile\" is the legal term used to describe the place where a person has chosen to make a true and fixed permanent home.\"Domicile\" includes both physical presence and intent, andmust be established for 12 months prior to the first day ofclass. A student can only establish domicile in Colorado fortuition purposes if s/he intends to reside permanently in thestate, and meet the definition of a \"Qualified Person.\" A copyof the tuition law, as identified above, is available at StudentFinancial Services, 103 Administration Annex, or on the website http://www.sfs.colostate.edu . Military Personnel and/or Their Dependents Active duty members of the armed forces of the United States and Canada on permanent duty stationed in Colorado and theirdependents (as defined by military regulations) are eligible forin-state status, regardless of domicile or length of residence inColorado. The military member must have reported to a dutystation in the state, as certified by the military command, nolater than the first day of classes of the applicable academicterm. It is the responsibility of the active duty member of themilitary or their dependents to notify the University to initiateand maintain the status. International Students Non-United States citizens may, under HB96-1083, be eligible to establish \"domicile\" for classification for in-state status fortuition purposes.

ADDITIONAL EXPENSES Health Insurance The University administers an optional health insurance plan for students at a reasonable rate. This insurance is in additionto the Hartshorn Health Service program funded by studentfees. Insurance is not a prerequisite to the use of the HartshornHealth Service, but is designed to supplement it and to helpprotect against the high medical costs of an accident orsickness requiring hospitalization. This insurance planprovides additional coverage for any family plan; it providesprimary coverage when no other plan is involved. The plan isoptional; however, students are encouraged to enroll unlessthey already have adequate health insurance. Information onstudent health insurance is contained in the Student HealthInsurance brochure which is available to all new students. Personal and Living Expenses The amount of money spent by a student in an academic year (two semesters-August to May) for all other expenses varieswith current prices and the habits and needs of the student;therefore, it is difficult to estimate the amount of moneyneeded by individual students for such items as entertainment,laundry, and clothing. Expenses not directly related toeducational costs are not included in the estimates. Estimated Yearly Expenses The following estimate of student costs, exclusive of tuitionand fees, is based on a minimum but adequate standard.Students' actual expenses may be lower or higher, since theseare only estimates. Certain courses carry a special course feein addition to the regular tuition and fees. Total Per Academic Year Semester (Two Semesters) Living Allowance $2925 $5850 Books and Classroom Supplies $ 450 $ 900 Incidental Personal Expenses $1000 $2000 Total of Estimated Costs $4375 $8750 International Students Students from other countries should anticipate expensesconsiderably higher than those quoted above. The above estimates do not include costs of deposits for off-campus housing, transportation, clothing (particularly winter clothing for those coming from warmer climates), living expensesduring vacation periods and during the summer months forthose who choose to remain on campus, and items of personaluse which cannot be brought in a suitcase and which must bepurchased in the United States after arrival. An annualinflation rate of 3-5% should be anticipated in all calculations.These figures, therefore, are subject to change. For an up-to-date list of estimated expenses for the 2002-2003 calendaryear, please see the following website after July 1, 2002:http://www.international.colostate.edu. The minimum amount of financial support necessary per academic year (nine months) for a single, undergraduatestudent is based on current tuition and fee amounts for 2001-2002. The actual total may exceed this minimum, as it reflectsa relatively modest standard of living.

Student Rights and Responsibilities As in any community situation, an individual can be most effective and influential working through an establishedorganization. At Colorado State, the two primaryorganizations are the department in which the student ismajoring, and the University-wide student governing body,Associated Students of Colorado State University (ASCSU). Academic department heads are required to incorporate student input into decisions affecting academic instruction andadvising. This input usually takes form through departmentaladvisory committees and student evaluation of facultymembers. Individual students, however, may makeappointments with their department heads to discuss specificproblems, plans, or suggestions. The student governing body, ASCSU, is authorized by the State Board of Agriculture to establish a system ofself-government, organized and administered by electedstudent representatives. It has the responsibility to advise andrecommend to the University administration and to allocatefunds designated by the Board in support of student programsand activities of authorized student groups and clubs.Additional information on student involvement is availablethrough the ASCSU office and the Office of CampusActivities, both located in the Lory Student Center, and theFaculty Council Committee on Student Affairs.

University-Wide Instructional Programs Many academic programs at Colorado State University have an all-university focus and are not found in one particularcollege. This catalog section summarizes: Environmental Studies Programs Interdisciplinary Studies Programs International Programs Center for Life SciencesReserve Officers' Training ProgramUniversity Honors Program ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES Colorado State University is second to none in terms of relevant academic, research, and outreach programs whichaddress the environmental needs of Colorado, the nation, andthe world. A key component of Colorado State's 21st-century,land-grant mission is to provide \"liberal and practical\"education in the science and technology of environmentalmanagement. The broad spectrum of environmental studies atColorado State is uniquely dispersed over 100 majors andconcentrations housed in 31 of the 55 departments of theUniversity. At Colorado State it is hard to find a degree ordepartment that does not directly connect with environmentalissues. Campus-wide participation in environmental science and management is a result of the fundamental linkages betweenbasic science and management of critical environmental issuesthat are a part of the Colorado State culture. A unique strengthof the campus is the integration of its many programs.Integration results from a long-standing institutional cultureand commitment that is very supportive of interdisciplinaryresearch, teaching, and service. Regardless of the major or program of study selected by the student, the goal of each is to: 1. Understand that scientific knowledge, policy considerations, and ethical issues are necessarily joined; 2. Comprehend the interrelationships among the environment, natural resources, and human society; 3. Perceive the need to integrate diverse social, political, legal, institutional, and biophysical considerations inherent in attaining environmental goals; 4. Educate students to be articulate, sensitive, and knowledgeable about the complex environmental issuesfacing society; 5. Provide a balanced understanding of the natural and social processes as they relate to the environment. All programs of study relating to environmental studies atColorado State are incorporated in existing majors in thefollowing departments.

University-Wide Instructional Programs 59 UNIVERSITY INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES PROGRAMS An interdisciplinary studies program is a series of coursesfocused upon a particular problem or area of concernproviding a variety of disciplinary perspectives. Although completion of courses in an interdisciplinary studies program does not lead to a degree, credits earned in thesecourses can be used in meeting the requirements for a degree. An interdisciplinary studies program includes a core of required courses, with some selectivity, and also a wide choicefrom supporting courses. Interdisciplinary studies are designated in the catalog to assist the student in identifying logically related course work in abroad subject-matter area. Completion of requirements for an interdisciplinary studies program is noted on the student's academic record (transcript)but not on the diploma. The minimum number of credits in anundergraduate interdisciplinary studies program is 20. Nominimum number of credits is specified at the graduate level. American Ethnicity Interdisciplinary Studies Program Office in C 127 Clark Building, Coordinated by a Faculty Advisory Board and the Directorof The Center for Applied Studies in American Ethnicity The Center for Applied Studies in American Ethnicity offers graduate research and undergraduate curricula leading to acertificate in American Ethnicity. The certificate will be inaccordance with the philosophy that studying andunderstanding ethnicity in America can deepen appreciationof the various ethnic heritages of America, the patterns ofinteraction among those ethnic traditions, and the nature ofproblems suffered because of abuses and misunderstandingsabout ethnic and perceived racial identities. The AmericanEthnicity Studies Program is dedicated to meeting theeducational and research needs of students and facultyinterested in issues such as self-concept, historicaldevelopment of racial and ethnic beliefs, philosophicalimplications, social practice, or public policy. The program isdesigned to provide as well an instructional and resource basefor in-service and future professionals working in fields orgeographical areas where an understanding of ethnicity inAmerica or of a particular ethnic group will enhance theirprofessional effectiveness. Students may pursue, in conjunction with their major, an interdisciplinary program of studies in one of five options.Four ethnic-specific options allow for the historical andsociocultural study of the four major racialized groups in theUnited States: African American, Asian American/PacificAmerican, Chicana(o)/Latina(o) American, and NativeAmerican. The fifth option is a comparative framework for thestudy of race and ethnicity as a social construct in the shapingof U.S. national character, cultural values, and institutions.Each option contains a core of program courses and a choiceof courses from various departments approved by the Centeras appropriate for the option. Each student pursuing acertificate in any of the options is required to take theintroductory courses, ETCC 200 and ET 292. A total of 24credits is required for the certificate.

Geospatial Science Graduate Interdisciplinary Studies Program Department of Forest Sciences and Graduate School Colorado State University offers a graduate level certificate in geospatial science. The certificate is designed to meet theeducation needs of two groups of people: (1) those who wantto redirect their career with new skills in geospatial science,but who are not interested in pursuing a full graduate degreeprogram at the present time, and (2) those who want ageospatial science focus as part of a traditional graduatedegree program in some other discipline. To meet therequirements for the certificate, graduate students take one ormore courses in each of four groups or subject matter areas,rather than a defined set of specific courses. These groups andcourse requirements include: two courses in GIS, two inremote sensing, one in GPS, and two courses in an \"other\"category. Upon completion of the minimum number of creditsin each of the four categories and with an average GPA of 3.0in the courses taken, the student is eligible to receive thecertificate. A total of 15 to 21 credits is usually needed to meetthese requirements. The Certificate program involves facultyfrom various departments throughout the University servingas advisers for the students, but it is official housed in theGraduate School and administered through the Department ofForest Sciences. It is important to note that students applyingfor the certificate must meet all of the normal graduateadmission requirements of the academic department to whichthey are applying.

This also serves to emphasize that molecularbiology is an interdisciplinary field, primarily the study ofmacromolecular structure and of the replication andexpression of the information in our hereditary material(DNA). Jacques Monod defined molecular biology as \"therecognition that the essential properties of living beings couldbe interpreted in terms of the structures of theirmacromolecules.\" Molecular biology is becoming increasingly recognized as a significant area of study, particularly for students interested inthe rapidly emerging field of biotechnology. The courserequirements for this program complement extant life sciencedegree programs on campus. The certificate in the MolecularBiology Interdisciplinary Studies Program will providerecognition that the student has completed a body ofcoursework that provides both breadth and depth in this area.This program provides students with a strong, well-balancedbackground in the biological, physical, and mathematicalsciences. It is ideally suited for undergraduates who wish topursue advanced degrees in biochemistry, microbiology,molecular biology, or related life sciences; for pre-professional students in health related fields; and for studentsinterested in employment in the biotechnology industry. Theprogram includes study of macromolecular structure andfunction; cellular biochemistry; metabolism; gene expression,structure, replication, and repair; cell organization,communication, growth, aging, and death. Courses in physics,organic chemistry, statistical measurements, and researchmethods are required. Independent study, internships, oradvanced research-oriented laboratory classes are taken duringthe junior and senior years to provide opportunities forexperiential learning and working closely with aninterdisciplinary group of faculty. Students interested in participating in this program should contact the Department of Biochemistry and MolecularBiology.

DIVISION OF ARMED FORCESSERVICES Reserve Officers' Training Corps History An Act of Congress dated July 2, 1862, provided for military science and tactics instruction in federal land-grant colleges.Such instruction has been given at Colorado State Universitysince its establishment. In 1919, the Department of MilitaryScience and Tactics of the institution was included in theReserve Officers' Training Corps under the provisions of theFirst National Defense Act, July 3, 1916. The ROTCVitalization Act of 1964 provides for a two-year ROTCprogram in addition to the traditional four-year program andauthorizes ROTC scholarships. General Information The Army and Air Force four-year programs complement the four college years and include one summer encampment.Students satisfactorily completing Army or Air Forcedepartmental requirements will be commissioned as secondlieutenants in the Army or Air Force. Additionally, each service offers a two-year program whereby a student may earn a commission after completing two yearsof ROTC training during the junior and senior undergraduateyears or during a two-year graduate degree program. Thisprogram is designed for transfer students or students unable totake ROTC training during their freshman and sophomoreyears. Each student entering the junior year (sophomore year if on scholarship) of ROTC enlists in the Army or Air ForceReserve and signs a contract.

The instructor shall retain a copy of thisstatement in his/her grade records and provide copies to thestudent and the department head or his/her designee. Aftersuccessful completion of the makeup requirements, incompletegrades will be changed by the instructor of record or thedepartment head, in the absence of the instructor of record.After one year or at the end of the semester in which thestudent graduates (whichever comes first), an incomplete willbe automatically changed to an F (failure) unless the coursehas been previously completed and a grade change submittedby the instructor or the department head. Grade Appeals Instructors are responsible for stating clearly the instructionalobjectives of the course at the beginning of each term and forevaluating student achievement in a manner consistent withthese objectives. Students are responsible for maintainingstandards of academic performance established for each coursein which they are enrolled. Instructors are responsible fordetermining and assigning final course grades. Gradedexaminations, papers, and other materials used as a basis forevaluating a student's achievement will be available to thestudent for inspection and discussion. Students may appeal instructors' grading decisions. The burden of proof, however, rests with the student to demonstratethat the grading decision was made on the basis of any of thefollowing conditions: 1. A grading decision was made on some basis other than performance and other than as a penalty for academic dishonesty.2. A grading decision was based on standards unreasonably different from those which were applied to other students. 3. A grading decision was based on a substantial, unreasonable, or unannounced departure from previouslyarticulated standards. Before making an appeal, the student should discuss thesituation with the instructor(s) involved in the decision.

If no appeal is filed within thistime period, the grade shall be considered final. Within 30 days of receipt of the request for an appeal, the student's appeal shall be provided to the instructor(s) whoassigned the grade and an appeals committee formed inaccordance with the departmental code. If the request isreceived prior to or during the summer session when theinstructor(s) who assigned the grade or other faculty membersmay not be available, then the appeals committee will beformed no later than 30 days from the beginning of thefollowing fall semester. This committee shall be composed oftwo faculty members and two students from within thedepartment and one outside faculty member who shall serve asa voting chair. The appeals committee will review the written appeal and response of the instructor(s). They may elect to separatelyinterview both the student and the instructor(s) beforerendering a decision. The decision of the appeals committeewill be based upon whether one of the conditions for an appealset forth above has been met. At the conclusion of thedeliberations, the committee shall render one of the followingdecisions: 1) the original grading decision is upheld, or 2) thedepartment chairperson or his/her designee(s) will reevaluatethe student's achievement of the instructional objectives of thecourse and assign a grade accordingly. Written notice of the committee's decision and the reasons for the decision normally will be sent to the student and theinstructor(s) within 30 calendar days of the appointment of thecommittee.

Grading and Scholastic Standards 91 Academic Dismissal Students on academic probation who do not raise their CUM GPA to 2.0 or higher after two regular semesters (fall andspring) will be dismissed from the University. Students whohave been academically dismissed have two options. First,they can take classes through the Colorado State Universitysummer session or through the Division of EducationalOutreach, but they are not eligible for readmission in goodacademic status until the CUM GPA is raised to 2.0 or higher. The second option available to students who have been academically dismissed is to enroll at another accreditedinstitution and meet the requirements to be admitted as atransfer student to Colorado State University. Upontransferring back to Colorado State, students will have twosemesters following re-enrollment to raise their CUM GPAearned at Colorado State to 2.00 or higher or face academicdismissal for a second time. Transfer credits are not computedwithin the CUM GPA earned at Colorado State. Students who have raised their CUM GPA to a 2.0 or higher or who apply as students transferring from another institutionmay apply for readmission to the University subject to anyenrollment limitation as set by the Colorado Commission onHigher Education or the governing board of the University. Appeal of Academic Dismissal Students have the privilege to appeal academic dismissal. A written appeal may be submitted to the HELP/Success Centerfor consideration by the Scholastic Standards and AwardsCommittee. All appeals must be submitted to theHELP/Success Center in accordance with the Center's writteninstructions. All appeals of academic dismissal will be actedupon by the Scholastic Standards and Awards Committee nolater than seven business days prior to the first day of classesfor the next regular academic semester (either fall or spring). Academic Fresh Start Undergraduate students may apply for an academic fresh start,a policy which allows students to establish a new academicrecord. A student may be granted a fresh start only once. An academic fresh start may be granted only after five years have elapsed since the student's last term of enrollment as aregular student, regardless of the number of credits taken. Thetime period during which courses were taken through theDivision of Educational Outreach or the Colorado Statesummer session after leaving the University will not count aspart of the five-year interval. Applications for a fresh start will be made through the HELP/Success Center and should be submitted one semesterprior to the academic term in which a student wishes to enrollin the University. Receipt of a fresh start does not guaranteeadmission but may aid the student in normal admissionsprocedures. A student granted a fresh start and enrolled will have a demarcation on the permanent academic record to delineatethe previous record from the new academic record achievedunder the fresh start policy. Credits for those courses in whicha grade of at least \"C\" or \"S\" was awarded prior to the freshstart may be applied toward graduation requirements under thefresh start policy. Only grades earned after the fresh startdemarcation will be computed in the new GPA.

Beingprepared to register will minimize mistakes and time on thesystem, thereby reducing the demand during peak registrationperiods. Registration Restrictions Since portions of registration are completed by mail it isessential that students maintain a current mailing address withEnrollment Services. Deadlines for registrations and paymentsof tuition, fees, and other charges must be met to ensureregistrations are confirmed. Therefore, students must respondto correspondence from the University in a timely manner.This may require authorization for others to act in the student'sbehalf when they will be unavailable to receive their mail fora period of time. Late Registration A late registration charge of $50 is assessed for adding the firstcourse on or after the first day of classes or for late adds afterthe registration period.

Enrollment mustconform to the courses listed in the class schedule or itsofficial addendum. Faculty Advisers A faculty adviser provides students with pertinent informationabout a major and assists in planning a program of study. Thefaculty adviser is associated with a student's major departmentor field and is assigned by the department head or collegedean.Close cooperation and understanding between student andadviser is to a student's advantage. Therefore, students areresponsible for seeking out their advisers for aid in solvingacademic problems, especially before each registration. Credit Load A credit hour is defined as 50 minutes of lecture ordiscussion/recitation per week for 16 weeks (800 minutes in asemester), 100 minutes of laboratory per week for 16 weeks(1600 minutes in a semester) when outside preparation isrequired, or 150 minutes of laboratory per week for 16 weeks(2400 minutes in a semester) when no outside preparation isrequired. For workload planning purposes, students shouldplan on an average of 15 credits per semester and shouldexpect that each credit hour w ill require approximately three hours (for some students in some classes, more time and in afew classes less time) of effort per week to attend classes andto accomplish readings and out-of-class assignments inpreparation for successful completion of the courserequirements. Credit Overload Undergraduate students who wish to register for more than 18credits per semester must have an overload approved by theiradviser and major department head.

Graduation Requirements Administration Annex, Room 100 The following are general graduation requirements and regulations which apply to all students entering ColoradoState University, who enroll in programs of study based on theAll-University Core Curriculum. Students are required to complete all curricular requirements in place in the current catalog at the time of graduation. (See Changes in Undergraduate Curriculum Requirements in this section.) The list is a sufficient guide for academic planning, but does not represent all rules which might apply to a particular student or program of study. Major Requirements The student wishing to graduate must complete therequirements for a major and the All-University Core Curriculum (see that section). A major is a sequence of courses in a subject-matter area or discipline which, when accompanied by appropriate supporting courses, leads to a degree. A minimum of 27 semester credits constitutes a major.Completion of a major is shown on both a student's diploma and academic record. Students may also elect to completeconcurrently the requirements for a second major. Second Major Requirements Students may elect to complete concurrently the requirements for two majors. Combinations are available in unrelated as well as related majors. At least one full term before the graduation term, students selecting second majors must contact the Office of Recordsand Registration to make official declarations and gaindepartmental approval for the joint curricular plans. Common requirements for either major may count in meeting curriculum requirements for both majors. Students must file an intent-to-graduate form and a contract for graduation in theDegree and Transfer Evaluation Office for both majors. Thesingle degree awarded is that degree appropriate for the firstmajor. A single diploma is issued which displays both majors,and both are recorded on the student's academic record. Students must complete degree requirements for the first major before they can graduate. Students completing degree requirements for the second major only cannot graduate until the first major's degree requirements have been met.Concentration Requirements Some majors have concentrations (or specialization areas). A concentration is a sequence of at least 12 semester credits of designated courses within a major designed to accommodate specific interests of students. Completion of a concentration is shown on a student's academic record. Option Some majors have options which are a sequence of courses within a major or concentration of either guided electives or electives selected from areas of interest as approved by the student's adviser. Options do not appear on diplomas or transcripts. Minor Requirements Students may elect to pursue a minor program of study in addition to the requirements for a major. Minor programs ofstudy are optional and are offered only at the undergraduatelevel. A minor program of study consists of a minimum of 21 semester credits of required course work outside the academic discipline which constitutes the student's program of study (major). Students may take minors in their department whichare outside their major. A minimum of 12 of the 21 credits must be course work at the upper-division level (300-400) and aminimum of 12 credits must be from course work within the department offering the minor. A list of currently available minors can be found in the Degree Programs section of this publication.At least one full term before the graduation term, students declaring minors must contact the Office of Records and Registration to make official declarations and obtain required departmental approvals. Once approval has been obtained, students deciding not to complete minors must drop them officially through the Office of Records and Registration. Students must complete intent-to-graduate forms and file contracts for graduation in the Degree and Transfer Evaluation Office for the minor programs of study. Minors must be completed the term of graduation. Completion of a minor isshown on the student's academic record, but not on the diploma.

Graduation Requirements 103 Second Bachelor's Degree Acceptance to work toward a second bachelor's degree is contingent upon completion of a first bachelor's degree and fulfillment of regular admission requirements as well as receipt of favorable recommendations by the appropriate college and/or department. Requireme nts for a second bachelor's degree include the following: 1.A minimum of 30 semester credits in residence in addition to the minimum number of credits required for the first degree. 2.All curriculum requirements for the major including All- University Core Curriculum requirements (see that section of this catalog). Students seeking second bachelor's degrees cannot declare second majors. Changes in Undergraduate Curriculum Requirements Students who enter the University as first-year students (freshmen) in Summer Session 2000 or thereafter, must complete the All-University Core Curriculum (AUCC) requireme nts. Until Summer Semester 2002, students with continued enrollment from Spring Semester 2000 and newly admitted transfer or readmitted students are admitted under the University Studies Program (USP) and must complete those requirements unless they make an adviser-assisted decision to switch their program of study to the AUCC. Details about the University Studies Program and its programs of study are available in the Colorado State University General Catalog, 1999-2000. Students are held for curricular requirements (including AUCC requirements) as set forth in the current catalog at the time of graduation, except 1) if so doing will extend the time normally required to complete the degree; or 2) if so doing will force students classified as juniors or seniors to take additional lower-division courses, exclusive of AUCC requirements. A request for waivers of or substitutions for curriculum requirements must be approved by the adviser and department head. Ultimate responsibility for ensuring that curriculum requirements are observed and that substitutions of equivalent courses or waivers are for good and sufficient academic reasons rests with the college dean and the Provost/Academic Vice President.Course Restrictions Undergraduates may enroll for a maximum of nine credits of course work which may be applied toward a graduate degree at Colorado State provided that such course work: 1) is not used to meet bachelor's degree requirements; and 2) has been approved by the chairperson of the department in which a graduate degree will be sought. Undergraduate students may not enroll in courses numbered 600-699 to satisfy undergraduate degree requirements. Undergraduate students may not enroll in courses numbered 700-799. Exclusion of Courses from the Bachelor's Degree Undergraduates who enroll in 500-level courses which are not applied toward the bachelor's degree may request that an exclusion statement be placed on their academic records. This makes such courses potentially applicable to a Colorado State graduate degree. Students cannot exclude any courses below the 500 level under this policy. (See Course Restrictions above.) Courses at the 600 level are automatically excluded from use for an undergraduate degree. A written request must be filed with the Degree and Transfer Evaluation Office, Room 100, Administration Annex, no later than the end of the term in which the excluded course is taken. Exclusion of these courses from the bachelor's degree does not assure acceptance of this credit toward a graduate degree program. These excluded courses are computed in the undergraduate grade point average. Graduation Credit Requirements To meet requirements for the bachelor's degree, a student must fulfill: Minimum Credit Requirement A bachelor's degree requires a minimum of 120 semester credits; however, individual programs in colleges and departments may exceed the minimum. Minimum Grade Requirement Only credits completed with grades of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, and S may count toward the graduation total. Some majors require a minimum grade of C or C- in required courses. For further information, contact the department offering the major.

Total credits earned and counted toward graduation may differ from total credits used in computing a scholastic average, since the scholastic average is computed by dividing the total grade points earned at Colorado State by the total credits attempted including credits for grades of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-,C+, C, C-, D+ D, D-,and F. Credits graded S may count toward graduation. Upper-Division Credit RequirementA minimum of 42 semester credits in upper-division courses (300-400 level) is required of all students completing a bachelor's degree program. Although 500-level courses cannot be required in undergraduate programs of study, electivecredits taken at the 500 level may be used to fulfill the upper-division requirement. \"In residence\" Requirement A minimum of 30 upper-division semester credits must be completed in residence at Colorado State University. \"In residence\" courses include any authorized Colorado StateUniversity course recorded as Colorado State credit on theColora do State transcript. As an approved exception, \"in residence\" may also be satisfied by pre-approved upper-division credits earned in authorized Study Abroad programsand designated domestic exchange programs, ifsimultaneously enrolled in designated CSU courses. Pre- approval procedures are required. Senior Year RequirementOf the last 30 semester credits earned immediately preceding graduation, no more than 15 may be completed at other colleges or universities. NONTRADITIONAL CREDIT POLICIES The evaluation of nontraditional credit is done only after a student has been accepted for admission to Colorado State. College-Level Courses Completed by High School Students Colorado State credit may be allowed for college-level courses completed at a college or university while a student is still inhigh school if the following conditions are met:1.The college or university must be fully accredited by one of the six regional associations of schools and colleges. Credit will be granted only for academic courses. 2.An official transcript must be provided by the college or university showing the courses completed. The College Board Advanced Placement Program The Advanced Placement Tests administered by The College Board are used by the University to award credit and advanced placement in any of several fields in which a studentmay have participated in high school. Credit awarded is treatedas transfer credit without a grade but is counted toward graduation and may be used in fulfilling specific curriculumrequirements. Credit is granted for scores of four or five on the Advanced Placement Tests in United States government, biology, computer science, English, and human geography. Credit isgranted in art, chemistry, economics, French, German, history- European, history-United States, Latin, mathematics, music, physics, Spanish, and statistics for scores of three or higher. Scores of one and two are not granted credit. See the website, www.registrar.colostate.edu, use the link \"Transfer Office,\" for a complete table indicating those courses for which credit is awarded. College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) The College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) was designed by The College Board to enable both traditional andnontraditional students to receive college-level credit by examination. There are two types of examinations offered-the General Examinations and the Subject Examinations. Information may be obtained and arrangements for taking thetests by contacting the University Testing Service, C 81 ClarkBuilding, or by writing to The College Board, Box 1822, Princeton, NJ 08541-6601 for a list of test centers. Creditawarded for these examinations cannot be used in meeting theColorado State residency requirement for the baccalaureatedegree. General Examinations The General Examinations measure college-level achievementin five basic areas of the liberal arts: English composition, humanitie s, mathematics, natural sciences, and social science-history. The test material usually covered in the first two years of college is often referred to as the general or liberal education requirement. Therefore, if a student takes acollege-level course in a particular area, credit will not beallowed for the CLEP General Examination covering that area.

Major in Landscape Architecture Studying landscape architecture at Colorado State is an adventure. Taking part in a challenging course of study,students prepare themselves for careers in a field whoseenormous potential has only begun to be recognized.Landscape architecture students study design as accomplishedlandscape architects see it: shaping spaces as well as planningand preserving them. Landscape architects create and design detailed landscape plans to be functional, aesthetic, and compatible with thenatural environment. Throughout the program, emphasis is onthe relationship between design, nature, and society: the impactof environments on the individual as well as the impact ofusers on the environment. Registration laws for landscapearchitects in 45 states encourage graduation from programssuch as that offered at Colorado State University, which isaccredited by the Landscape Architecture Accreditation Boardof the American Society of Landscape Architects. Landscape architects must analyze the natural elements of a site including the climate, soil, slope of the land, drainage,sunlight, and vegetation. Computer-aided design (CAD) hasbecome an essential tool for landscape architects. Landscapearchitects often work with building architects, surveyors,engineers, and urban planners and collaborate withenvironmental scientists, foresters and other professionals tofind the best way to conserve or restore natural resources.Knowledge of appropriate local, state or Federal regulationssuch as those protecting wetlands or historic resources isessential. Nature, culture, form, and space are the classic elements of landscape architecture with which students work in a series ofdesign studies and related courses. Coursework focuses on avariety of landscape projects that grow more complex as thecurriculum proceeds. The courses include subjects such as sitedesign, landscape design and construction, surveying,landscape ecology, and urban and regional planning. Othercourses specific to the major are history of the designedlandscape, plant and soil science, geology, and professionalpractice. Students are also encouraged to take advantage ofsummer travel courses available to study highly valuedecological/cultural sites in Colorado and designed landscapesin Europe. Colorado State University offers the only nationally accreditedundergraduate professional landscape architecture program inColorado. Characteristics and Skills Strong interest in computers and drawing as tools for creative and artistic thinking Strong interest in spatial and environmental issues applied to landscape Strong oral communication skills Good presentation skills Problem solving skills Ability to work well with other professionals Strong writing skills Analytical skills Potential Occupations Many types of organizations and individuals hire landscape architects-from real estate development firms starting newprojects, municipalities constructing airports or parks, to homeowners desiring garden designs. Many landscape architects areemployed by government agencies doing site design forbuildings, parks, and other public assets. Others are involvedin park and recreation planning in national parks and forests,and restoration of environmentally damaged landscapes.Employment of landscape architects is expected to increasefaster than the average for all occupations through the year2006. Starting in 1998, average salaries for landscapearchitects exceeded average salaries of architects. Anticipatedgrowth in construction is expected to increase demand forlandscape architectural services over the long run.Participation in internships and cooperative educationopportunities is highly recommended to enhance practicaltraining and development. Graduates who go on for advancedstudies can attain more responsible positions with thepossibility of rising to top professional levels. Some examples are: design consultant; landscape designer and contractor; private practice business; construction supervisor;land or environmental planner; urban designer; historicpreservationist; golf course architect; resort planner.

The College ofEngineering continues its tradition-a tradition as old asColorado State-of providing broad training in the basic fieldsof engineering through both undergraduate instruction andgraduate programs strongly supported by modern researchfacilities. The mission of the College of Engineering is to provide high quality teaching, advising, research, outreach, and service in aland-grant, Carnegie Class I environment and to serve thepeople and industries of the state, nation, and the world. Undergraduate Majors Undergraduate programs are administered by the Departments of Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Thesedepartments offer four-year programs leading to a bachelor ofscience degree. Although emphasis is on broad training inbasic engineering, students may specialize to some extent byproper choice of technical electives.A program leading to a bachelor of science degree inenvironmental engineering is administered by the Departmentof Civil Engineering. This program, which builds upon afoundation in biological science as well as mathematics andphysical science, is supported by faculty from the Departmentsof Atmospheric Science, Chemical Engineering, CivilEngineering, and Mechanical Engineering. It has a stronginterdisciplinary flavor and prepares students for careers withlarge industries, consulting companies, and regulatoryagencies. A program leading to a bachelor of science degree with a major in engineering science is also coordinated by theAssociate Dean for Academic Affairs in the College ofEngineering. This program offers three well-definedconcentrations: engineering physics, space engineering, and adual degree (five-year) program leading to a B.A. degree in theCollege of Liberal Arts and a B.S. degree in the College ofEngineering. Students may consider simultaneously completing the requirements for a second major. See Second Major Requirements in the Graduation Requirements section for a complete description of the program. A student may pursue aminor program of study inside or outside the College ofEngineering in conjunction with the desired engineeringmajor. Students interested in a combined program in engineering and business may consider obtaining a B.S. degree in engineeringand the M.B.A. degree. This program is jointly administeredby the Colleges of Business and Engineering; direct inquiriesto the associate dean of one of these colleges. All engineering programs are accredited at the basic level by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. Registration as a Professional Engineer Registration and licensing are required under certain legally defined circumstances in order to practice as an engineer. TheCollege of Engineering actively encourages all of its studentsto fulfill the necessary requirements as soon as they areeligible. The Fundamentals of Engineering Examinationadministered by the State Board of Registration forProfessional Engineers and Professional Land Surveyors maybe taken by seniors during the two semesters prior tograduation. After the required practical experience, thePrinciples and Practice of Engineering Examination forlicensing may be taken.

College of Engineering 203 Engineering Field Trips The first Fridays of November and March are set aside for departmental field trips primarily to industrial and researchorganizations in Colorado. Specific requirements of the fieldtrips are established by individual departments. Transportationexpense of trips is borne by the student. Study Abroad Study abroad programs are available to students in the College of Engineering. Because the knowledge of at least one otherculture is valuable in understanding our own, students arestrongly encouraged to take a summer or semester to studyoutside the United States as part of their overall program atColorado State University. Students interested in study abroadshould plan, far in advance, by discussing opportun ities with their academic adviser and by visiting the Office ofInternational Programs in Laurel Hall or the website,www.international.colostate.edu/us/studyabroad. ADMISSION INFORMATION Students may be admitted to one of the undergraduate majorsin this college or as undecided freshmen (Engineering OpenOption). Undecided engineering students must specify theirchoice of major prior to registration for the sophomore year.Should the demand for any engineering major exceed thecapacity to maintain a high-quality education, the college mayfind it necessary to limit enrollment in some majors. Theundecided engineering student who wishes to transfer to oneof these majors may be at a disadvantage when demandexceeds capacity. In general, students are better served byselecting one of the college's majors at admission and thenchanging majors, if necessary, than by entering as undecidedfreshmen. High School Graduates See Undergraduate Admissions Policy and Procedures section in this catalog for specific College of Engineeringrequirements. The required units listed are minimums.Students desiring to enter the engineering majors are urged totake available advanced math and English classes as well ascourses in computer programming, physics, and mechanicaldrawing or three-dimensional representation (art). Course Placement and Advising for Freshmen All entering freshmen are required to take composition and mathematics placement examinations prior to registration. Theexamination results, together with other information aboutstudents, are used by faculty advisers to counsel students.Those with weaknesses in mathematics will be advised to takeup to five credits of review courses (M CC 120A-B, M CC121, M CC 124, M CC 125, and M CC 126) before enrollingin calculus (M CC 160). Credits for review courses may not beused toward a degree in engineering. Faculty advisers recommend programs suited to the student's background and interests. Superior preparation is recognized,and appropriate placement and/or credit is given. Transfer Students Students who wish to transfer into engineering must have completed at least one semester of calculus and one semesterof calculus-based physics or chemistry equivalent to C CC111, with at least one B and nothing less than a C. Should thedemand for any engineering major exceed the capacity tomaintain a high-quality education, individual departments mayfind it necessary to enforce more stringent requirements.Transfer advisers in each department are available for assistingstudents who wish to transfer. Transfer of credits earned at other colleges and universities within Colorado is facilitated by the existence of standingagreements on course equivalencies. Change of Major to Engineering Students who wish to change from another major at Colorado State to an engineering major must have completed at least onesemester of calculus (M CC 160) and one semester of physics(PHCC 141) or chemistry (C CC 111) with at least one B andnothing less than a C to be eligible for consideration. Studentsare selected for admission once each term; the number ofstudents admitted is based on space available as well asacademic criteria. Some majors may specify more stringentrequirements in math and science courses. Engineering coursesare normally open to engineering majors only. The change ofmajor must be initiated at the HELP/ Success Center. CURRICULAR REQUIREMENTS The curricula of the College of Engineering include courses inengineering, mathematics, science, humanities, and socialsciences. During the first two years, all engineering studentstake a program emphasizing mathematics, physics, chemistry,and basic engineering since all branches of engineering rely onthis foundation. The junior and senior years are devotedprimarily to a balanced selection of specialized engineeringcourses. The minimum credits for graduation with a bachelorof science degree varies with the engineering major. Good engineers are not only competent to render professional service in their fields of specialization but are able to assumeresponsibilities as citizens. To broaden the student'sperspectives in nontechnical areas, the programs inengineering require a minimum of 15 credits in arts andhumanities and behavioral and social sciences to be selectedfrom anthropology, economics, foreign la nguages, history, Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

These courses must be selected in such a way that theyalso meet All-University Core Curriculum requirements. The ability to express oneself clearly and concisely in both written and oral forms is an asset of great value to the engineerwho is constantly called upon to prepare reports in whichclarity, organization, and precision are essential. For thisreason, engineering students must do more than meet theminimum English course requirements. In fact, thedevelopment of communication skills is emphasizedthroughout the engineering curricula. This emphasis isespecially evident in laboratory and design-oriented courses,in which the presentation of both oral and written reports is amajor component. The College of Engineering requires a minimum grade point average of 2.0 in required engineering, mathematics,chemistry, and physics courses as a graduation requirement. Astudent who has less than this average at the end of any term issubject to referral by the department head or college dean tothe Committee on Scholastic Standards and Awards forconsideration of academic dismissal from the College ofEngineering. Additional minimum grade requirements apply insome engineering majors. An engineer applies physical understanding and analytical techniques to the design of devices and systems needed by modern society. The preparation of an engineer, therefore,must include engineering design experience. To meet thisobjective, all undergraduate engineering students mustparticipate in a well-structured sequence of design-relatedcourses culminating in a capstone design experience in orderto graduate.

Performance Concentration Great personal satisfaction and fulfillment can be achieved through an arts career. Because work is often an expressionof the artist's innermost feelings and ideas, an artist's personalidentity may be more closely bound to that work than in otherfields. It is particularly important to explore whether a musiccareer is realistic given an individual's interest, talent, andtemperament. Making an intelligent career choice involvesweighing the realities of the music field against the desire tocreate. Auditions are required for entry into the music program. Options include voice, composition, orchestral instrument(brass, woodwi nd, strings, or percussion), organ, piano, piano pedagogy, and string pedagogy .

Students have numerous opportun ities to participate in ensembles, bands, orchestras, and choir. Eachsemester, students perform in jury exams before selectedmusic faculty as well as participate in ensembles, concerts,and recitals. Characteristics and Skills Strong talent and desire to develop proficiency in instrumental or voice performance or composition Commitment to excellence in performance Patience and self discipline in development of talents and abilities Ability to work with people and independently Strong aptitude for music theory and music history Potential Occupations Breaking into the field of music is not easy. Music is competitive and requires talent, contacts, luck, timing,persistence, hard work, and ability to get along with people tosucceed. Most artists also depend upon other arts-related jobsor second careers to earn a living wage. Young musiciansalmost always start at the bottom and work up. Another wayto get a foot in the door is to do an internship in the musicbusiness. For careers in the recording industry one must go towhere the companies are: New York, Nashville, and LosAngeles. Many cities support professional orchestras,although funding in some locations has diminished. Contactthe Department of Music, Theatre, and Dance for more careerinformation.

Courses in art, music, or dance are required, depending onyour interests. Senior students are required to do a specialproject in an area of personal interest. Projects includedirecting a full-length play, designing or lighting a main stageproduction, presenting an acting recital, or writing a majorresearch paper. An exciting new prospect for the pursuit of a degree in the performing arts at Colorado State is the commitment to buildthe University Center for the Arts. This state-of-the-art facilitywill create a vibrant learning environment and showcase of theperforming and creative arts and will significantly enhance thecurrent classrooms, studios, and performance venues in music,theatre, dance, and the visual arts. The theatre program produces a six-show academic season and multiple student-produced projects. Among the practicalexperience opportunities for students are the improv team, aCAD lab featuring integrated computer visualizationtechnology, and the unique Summer Outdoor Caf\u00e9 Theatre.Creative and Performing Arts Awards are available fortalented students and qualified students. Theatre also offers minors in acting/directing and design/technical theatre in order to give students in related majors the opportunity to formalize their interest in theatre. These minors offer an opportunity for concentrated study in atleast one of the basic theatre crafts as well as a background ingeneral theatre practice and history. Characteristics and Skills A broad liberal arts education An understanding of theater history Competence in the theatrical disciplines including production, directing, acting, costume, scenic, andlighting design Mastery of the theory and practice of scenic techniques Understanding of set design and construction Experience in all aspects of stage production Potential Occupations Talent and training are the main factors for success in acting. A pleasing voice, good diction, physical attractiveness,imagination, charm and ability to understand people are alsovalued. Earning a living solely by working in the performingarts is rare. Most artists also depend upon other arts-relatedjobs or second careers. For many, success is based on creativework rather than on money and status. Theatre and dancemajors often select a second major such as business oreducation to enhance their job prospects. Experience acquired through extracurricular performances or internships is highly recommended to enhance your practicaltraining and development. Students who go on for advancedstudy at the graduate level can obtain more responsiblepositions. Possible career opportunities include, but are not manager; producer; musicaldirector.

Williams, Chair Major in Philosophy Philosophy is the oldest form of systematic, scholarly inquiry.It is the study of the most basic moral, legal, aesthetic,religious, and metaphysical ideas by which we understand theuniverse and ourselves. Philosophers pursue fundamentaltruths, quest for understanding, and study principles ofconduct. Philosophers seek to establish standards of evidence,provide rational methods of resolving conflicts, establishcriteria for a just social order, and create techniques forevaluating ideas and arguments. The study of philosophy broadens and intensifies liberal education while enhancing interpretive abilities in many fields.The curriculum encourages a broad liberal arts background,including courses in foreign languages and a generous choiceof elective courses. While some students plan for graduateschool and teaching careers in philosophy, the broad relevanceof philosophy to other fields permits most students to worktoward goals such as professional training in law, medicine,computer science and technology, or theology.

Dennis Child, Head Major in Rangeland Ecology The Department of Rangeland Ecosystem Science offers asingle major in rangeland ecology emphasizinginterdisciplinary study of and research on the world'srangelands. Rangelands occupy nearly 50 percent of theearth's land surface and consist of natural grasslands,savannas, shrublands, riparian areas, deserts, tundra, alpinecommunities, and coastal marshes. Colorado is an ideal settingfor the study of rangeland ecology and management with shortgrass prairie to the east and high elevation grasslands andriparian areas to the west. Students are prepared to manage the animal, soil, and vegetation resources on rangelands primarily for state andfederal land management agencies. The curricula areaccredited by the Society for Range Management and meetU.S. Civil Service requirements for range conservationist andsoil conservationist. With a few additional courses graduatescan meet U.S. Civil Service requirements for soil scientist andecologist. Students develop an in-depth understanding of basicplant and animal biology; a basic understanding of the physicalsciences as they relate to rangeland ecology; knowledge ofimportant concepts of ecology and range management; anunderstanding of economics related to recognizingalternatives; and analytical and decision making skills.Students also develop communication, political, andinterpersonal skills to make their education effective. Four concentrations are offered: range and forest management; restoration ecology; rangeland management; and science. Characteristics and Skills Strong interest in applied ecology Desire to understand range, wildlife, and watershed management principles Aptitude for natural sciences Like working with physical things and in nature Organizational and decision making skills Prefer hands-on work Prefers working outdoors-in the field Well organized and able to pay attention to detail Adaptable to changing conditions and environments Interest in policy formation and implementation Able to work in a team and alone Able to write and speak concisely and clearly Interest in data and policy analysis Able to integrate knowledge of a variety of concepts to obtain an holistic perspective Potential Occupations Rangeland scientists are trained to manage lands that produce herbage for all grazing animals, for aesthetic values, and forwatershed enhancement. Knowledgeable in ecosystemstructure, rangeland scientists possess an understanding of thefunctions of the ecosystem with respect to nutrient cycling,energy flows among feeding levels, and animal requirementsfor food and shelter. These scientists are also trained to assessrehabilitation potential following drastic disturbances and todevelop procedures for land reclamation and management.Rangeland scientists often work closely with other specialistsin wildlife, hydrology, forestry, soils, agronomy, recreationand other disciplines.

College of Natural Resources 313 Rangelands occupy nearly one-half of the world's land surface, and employment opportunities for graduates in this major arediverse and excellent. The profession offers an opportunity towork full time with natural resources, the improvement ofenvironmental quality, and the basic problem of ecology.Because of growing interest in all aspects of the environment,the demand for additional rangeland scientists is expected toincrease by 33 percent in the next decade. In the U.S. mostrangeland scientists work for the Federal and stategovernments while private industry, colleges and universities,and international agencies are increasingly employingrangeland scientists. Participation in internships, volunteer activities, or cooperative education opportunities is highly recommended to enhancepractical training and development. Graduates who go on foradvanced studies can attain more responsible positions withthe possibility of rising to top professional levels. Examples of career opportunities include, but are not limited to: restoration realestate/land manager; international rangeland specialist.

In this role the college servesColorado State's broad liberal and general educationobjectives. COLLEGE PROGRAMS Undergraduate Majors The college's 8 departments offer 10 undergraduate majors, all leading to a bachelor of science degree which requires aminimum of 120 credits with a minimum of 42 credits inupper-division courses.Preparation for the Health Professions Special advisers assist students in planning for entrance into accredited colleges of dentistry and dental hygiene, humanmedicine and osteopathy, nursing, optometry, pharmacy,physical therapy, physician assistant, podiatry, chiropractic,and other health professions. Since the advisers are acquaintedwith University courses and the requirements of theprofessional schools, they can help students fulfillrequirements, plan for alternate but related careers, and makethe most of their total undergraduate experience. Students entering a health preprofessional program must declare a formal academic major and be assigned anappropriate adviser. No preprofessional program is a major initself. The major may be in any college and should be chosenwith the student's educational and alternative vocationalobjectives in mind. Students planning to enter a health field may make initial inquiry at the Center for Life Sciences, (970) 491-3658. Freshman Open Option Office in Statistics Building, Room 117 Students who have not decided on a major but whose interests, aptitudes, and high school academic preparation inmathematics and the natural sciences clearly point to a majorin this college may enroll as Natural Sciences Open Option.This option extends through the two semesters of the freshmanyear. Students may declare a departmental orinterdepartmental major anytime during their freshman yearand are required to do so at the beginning of their sophomoreyear. Courses that should be taken by Natural Sciences Open Option students are mathematics, one or two basic sciencecourses (chemistry, biology, physics), arts and humanities andbehavioral and social sciences courses, and COCC 150. Ifbiology is chosen as one of the science courses, it is stronglyrecommended that general chemistry also be taken.

Because the knowledge of at least oneother culture is valuable in understanding our own, studentsare strongly encouraged to take a semester or longer to studyoutside the United States as part of their overall program atColorado State University. Students interested in study abroadshould plan, far in advance, by discussing opportunities withtheir academic adviser and by visiting the Office ofInternational Programs in Laurel Hall, www.international. colostate.edu/us/studyabroad. The College of Natural Sciences has a special agreement to exchange students with the University of Tasmania. Graduate Programs The master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees areoffered by all departments. For detailed information, see theGraduate and Professional Bulletin , and consult the appropriate department. INTERDEPARTMENTAL MAJOR Major in Natural Sciences The bachelor of science in natural sciences meets the needs of two audiences: Students who want to become high school or junior high/middle school science teachers; Students who want a broad exposure to mathematics and the physical sciences, rather than specialization inone discipline. Characteristics And Skills The two options in the natural sciences major require similar personal attributes: Aptitude for science and mathematics Interest in the physical and/or life sciences Curiosity and creativity Keen power of observation Attention to detail Logical and critical thinking ability Patience and perseverance Enjoyment of reading Written and oral communications skills Ability to work independently or on a team Potential Occupations Graduates with licensure in secondary science education will find a strong demand for high school and junior high/ middle school teachers in Colorado and elsewhere in the nation. Inaddition, these graduate will also have the backgroundrequired for graduate science education programs. With proper planning, physical science graduates can meet requirements for professional schools (e.g., medicine or law) or graduate programs in the basic or applied sciences.Internships and volunteer activities can provide practicaltraining and experience. Recent graduates have found employment as: technical writers; atmospheric scientists; computer sales representatives; crimelaboratory analysts; patent examiners; quality controltechnicians. Secondary Education The bachelor of science in natural sciences degree provides the subject matter, the education classes, and the classroomexperience required for secondary education licensure inColorado. Concentrations in the natural sciences major include: biology education; biology/natural resource education; chemistry education; general science education; geology education; and physics education.The program includes science courses in a concentration such as biology, geology, physics, chemistry, etc.; the All-University Core Curriculum; and professional classes in theSchool of Education (SOE). In addition, the SOE helpsschedule classroom visits and practica. The experienceculminates in a semester of student teaching under thesupervision of a master teacher.

DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Office in Molecular and Radiological Biosciences Building, Room 316Professor Norman P. Curthoys, Chair Major in Biochemistry As the name suggests, biochemistry links biology andchemistry. Biochemistry is most simply defined as thechemistry of living systems. It is the science which tries toexplain how \"lifeless\" molecules work together to make\"living\" organisms. The methods of chemistry and molecularbiology are used to study the structure and behavior of thecomplex molecules found in biological materials and the waysthese molecules interact to form cells, tissues, and wholeorganisms. Biochemistry provides the basis for advances inhuman and veterinary medicine, agriculture, andbiotechnology. Biochemists may participate ininterdisciplinary research and development projects alongsidechemical engineers, biologists, microbiologists, agronomists,physicians and other professionals. They investigate themolecular mechanisms of diseases such as AIDS, diabetes, andheart disease and develop solutions to environmental problemsthrough biotechnology. The biochemistry major provides a student with a strong, well-balanced background in the biological, physical, andmathematical sciences. As a biochemistry major, your studieswill include macromolecular and function; gene expression, structure,replication, and repair; cell organization, communication,growth, aging, and death. You will also be required to takecourses in physics, organic chemistry, physical chemistry forlife sciences, and statistical measurements and methods usedin research. Opportunities exist for independent study,internships, or advanced research-oriented laboratory classesduring your junior and senior years, which provideopportunities for experiential learning and working closelywith our faculty. Characteristics and Skills Interest in sciences Motivation to learn, intellectual curiosity Attention to detail Critical thinking skills Strong organizational skills Analytical skills Problem solving skills Imaginative, yet logical Interpreting technical/scientific data Perceiving/defining cause and effect relationships Ability to work as part of a team Patience Good decision maker Strong communication skills -oral and written Computer literate Ability to use scientific instruments and equipment Potential Occupations Because biochemistry is such a broad science, it is an excellent preparation for many different careers. Over one-half ofColorado State's biochemistry graduates continue in graduatestudies (biochemistry, molecular biology, or related lifesciences). Graduates who go on for advanced studies can attainmore responsible positions with the possibility of rising to topprofessional levels. Approximately one-fourth enter medical,veterinary, dental, or other health professional schools, andone-fourth obtain employment in industrial, governmental,academic, or biotechnology sectors of the job market.Participation in independent research projects or internships ishighly recommended to enhance practical training anddevelopment. This type of experience provides the opportunityto build a relationship with a faculty member. Thus, a studentobtains experience and a meaningful reference, which greatlyenhances their ability to obtain a job of their choosing orentrance into a top graduate or professional program. Biochemists are involved in laboratory-based research and development, production, marketing, sales, and managementin pharmaceutical, agricultural, food, biotechnology, andhealth care industries. Some of the Federal governmentemployers are the Food and Drug Administration, U.S.Departments of Agriculture, Interior, and Defense, and theNational Institute of Health. Good employment opportunitiesexist in biotechnology, genetic engineering, cancer research,and pharmacology. However, considerable competition existsfor academic positions. Possible opportunities, which may require further training or education, for graduates in biochemistry include, but are notlimited to: process writer; fisheriesbiologist; research analyst; medical or clinical lab technologist.

Herbers, Chair Major in Biological Science Biology is the study of all living things-from bacteria andviruses that can be seen only under a microscope, to plants,animals, and humans and their relationship to theirenvironments. Biology majors study the structure and functionof cells, organ systems and tissues in animals and humans, thestructure and function of plants, ecology (the relationshipbetween living things and their environment), and evolution.They learn about forensic biology (identification of humanremains), genetics and heredity, aquatic toxicology (methodsthat biologists use to measure the impact of pollution onwater), microscopic organisms such as bacteria, and laboratorytechniques that biologists use in research. This major providesa broad background in the basic biological sciences. It alsooffers an opportunity to choose an area of emphasis within lifesciences that is related to particular career goals. (Forexample, anatomy for health professions, aquatic biology formarine biologists, etc.) The curriculum includes a two-semester introductory biology sequence, cell biology, developmental biology, ecology andgenetics. Required courses in the physical sciences include aminimum of one year in introductory chemistry, and at leastone course in organic chemistry, physics, and one inbiochemistry, including labs in each. In addition, studentschoose a selected field of 12 credits in one of the following:anatomy/physiology, aquatic biology, behavioral biology,cellular/molecular and genetic biology, ecology,evolution/genetics and systematics, microbiology, orintegrative organismal biology. There is an additionalrequirement of one course in two other fields, which assures abroad base of study. A calculus course and a statistics courseare also required.

College of 330 Natural Sciences Good decision maker Communication skills - oral and written Potential Occupations Training in biology prepares you for a very large number of occupations. Some involve daily interaction with dozens ofpeople, others can be done in complete isolation; some arenarrowly specific, others require knowledge far beyondscience. Without advanced degrees, the demand for this majorhas never been high in any given employment area, butbecause of the diversity of career options, most students findemployment. Career options related to biology include waterquality assessments, field and lab technician work,biotechnology, genetic research, agriculture, or sales (i.e.,pharmaceutical, agricultural). Biological sciences can also bethe beginning of an education towards dental, medical, orveterinary school, and a number of health professions such aspodiatry or optometry. Graduates are encouraged to pursueadvanced degrees to attain higher salaried positions andopportunities for rising to top professional levels.Participation in internships and laboratory or researchexperience is highly recommended and encouraged by thedepartment to enhance practical training and development. Combining biology with nonscience skills can involve someexciting careers as well. Incorporate biology and English tobecome a technical writer or science fiction novelist. Combinebiology and art and go into medical and scientific illustration.Link biology and computer science to become abioinfomaticist, historian of science or medicine. Work in bothbiology and philosophy/religion to be a medical ethicist orbioethicist. Combine biology and psychology as aneuroscientist or genetic counselor. Join biology and politicalscience to work in environmental law or be a patent lawyer inbiotechnology. Try mixing biology and business to get intohospital administration and biotechnology administration.There are specialized master's degrees designed for many ofthese unique career paths. The following are some of the career opportunities for biology majors: aquarium and museum worker; assistant researchscientist; biological researcher or salesperson; public officer;science librarian; educator, specialist, industrial degree); medical or clinical laboratorytechnologist; Peace Corps volunteer.To be qualified for graduation, students in the biological science major must have a minimum grade of C- in each of their biological, physical science, andmathematical courses used to meet requirements for the major. This appliesto courses taken as substitutions for meeting these requirements. Theminimum scholastic average acceptable for graduation is 2.00 computed onlyfor courses attempted at Colorado State. M CC 120, M CC 121, M CC 124, and M CC 125 are considered review courses; credits in these courses may not be used toward a degree in themajors in biological science, botany, or zoology.

College of 342 Natural Sciences UPPER DIVISION CS Courses numbered 300 or above* 12 PROGRAM TOTAL = 26-28 credits without prerequisites *Additional course work may be required because of prerequisites; all prerequisites must be completed. Graduate Programs in Computer Science Master of science and doctor of philosophy degree programs in computer science are offered emphasizing either theoreticalor practical aspects of computer science. A description of theseprograms may be found in the Graduate and ProfessionalBulletin . DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS Office in Weber Building, Room 101Professor Rick Miranda, Chair Major in Mathematics Mathematics is the science of numbers, shapes, probabilities,and measurements. It is a universal language in whichinformation is stated in its simplest possible form.Mathematics has a dual nature-it is an independent field ofstudy valued for its precision of thought and elegance, and itis an important source of techniques and methods increasinglyapplied to a variety of problems in a wide array of disciplines.For example, mathematical modeling and simulation is used toprovide answers, faster and less expensively, than with testsperformed on scale models. The undergraduate program provides a liberal arts and practical education toward the ends of education andemployment. The liberal arts component requires students toacquire a broad background in communication skills,humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. The majorcore focuses on developing students' understanding andappreciation of the mathematical sciences, their problemsolving skills, and ability to combine knowledge and skills inproductive ways. Core subjects include three semesters ofcalculus, matrices and linear equations, advanced calculus ofone variable, abstract algebra, linear algebra, computerprogramming, and statistics. Six concentrations are available in the program: general mathematics, mathematics education, applied mathematics, computational mathematics, actuarial science, and statistics. Characteristics And Skills A strong interest and aptitude for mathematics Ability to think logically and quantitatively Methodical and accurate in nature Strong problem solving ability Strong reasoning and abstract thinking ability Ability to concentrate for extended periods of time Inquisitive and curious nature Innovative Analytical thinker Flexible, patient, and persevering Good communications skills Ability to work independently or in a team Abstract thinking and reasoning ability Fast in working with numbers Potential Occupations The mathematics major prepares students for a wide variety of occupations in business, industry, government, and education.Although there is no longer a national shortage of mathematicsteachers, our math education graduates have been successfulin finding positions. Actuarial science graduates who havepassed the first two professional actuary exams can expect tofind positions in large metropolitan areas with good entry-levelsalaries. Applied math graduates continue to find employmentopportunities in government and private industry. Manypursue advanced degrees in mathematics, computationalscience or engineering. About one-third of general mathgraduates continue on to graduate school in mathematics orother disciplines, with the rest finding employment in a largevariety of capacities. Participation in internships, volunteeractivities, or cooperative education opportunities is highlyrecommended to enhance practical training and development.Graduates who go on for advanced studies can attain moreresponsible positions with the possibility of rising to topprofessional levels. Career opportunities include, but are not limited to: mathematician; auditor; riskanalyst; accountant; math educator. Actuarial Science Concentration The actuarial science concentration trains students how to usemathematics, statistics, business, and economics to analyze andplan for future situations involving financial uncertainties andrisks. This concentration is designed to qualify students totake the first two examinations administered by the Society ofActuaries and lay the foundation for the remainingexaminations.

Statistics Concentration Statistics provides the reasoning and the methods for producing and understanding data; it is the science of learningfrom data. It includes designing experiments or samplingsurveys for the collection of data, collecting the information,evaluating it, drawing conclusions, and presenting the results.Statisticians work with people from other professionalbackgrounds to solve practical problems. Statisticians canprovide crucial guidance in determining what information isreliable and which predictions can be trusted. This diversity ofapplication is an exciting aspect of the field, and is one reasonfor continuing strong demand for well-trained statisticians.

College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences Office in Anatomy-Zoology Building, Room W 102 Professor Lance Perryman, DeanProfessor Kenneth Associate Torrance Nett, Associate DeanAssociate Professor Sherry McConnell, Assistant Dean UNDERGRADUATE MAJORS Environmental HealthMicrobiology UNDERGRADUATE MINORS Anatomy and NeurobiologyMicrobiology COLLEGE PROGRAMS Biomedical Sciences Open Option Doctor of Veterinary Medicine Preprofessional Program in Veterinary Medicine A concern for health and the diseases of animals and humansprovides the unifying theme for the undergraduate,professional, and graduate programs of the College ofVeterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. The collegecombines teaching, research, and public service activities inbasic biomedical disciplines such as anatomy, neurobiology,physiology, microbiology, pathology, and radiological healthsciences, with applied disciplines such as clinical veterinarymedicine and surgery, radiology, clinical laboratory sciences,epidemiology, and environmental health sciences. Graduatesof the college in either the veterinary sciences or thebiomedical sciences serve society in the broadest sense-theyrepresent the concept that there is but \"one medicine\" withhuman and animal health intimately interrelated. Major Courses of Study The College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences offers undergraduate, professional, and graduate courses ofstudy. There are two undergraduate programs leading to thebachelor of science degree with majors in environmentalhealth and microbiology. The bachelor of science degreerequires a minimum of 120 credits with a minimum of 42 inupper-division courses. The four-year professional veterinarymedical program leads to the doctor of veterinary medicinedegree. Graduate studies in each of the four departments ofthe college lead to master of science and doctor of philosophydegrees. The college also offers a nondegree preveterinarymedical program. Biomedical Sciences Open Option Biomedical Sciences Open Option is a program offered by theCollege of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences forstudents who are in their first two years of undergraduatework at Colorado State. The program is especially designedfor students who have an interest in a career or advancedstudies in any of a number of fields which require training inbiomedical sciences and who have not made a specific choiceof major for the bachelor's degree. Open Option allowsstudents to explore programs and majors in the college byfulfilling course work requirements common to environmentalhealth and microbiology degree programs as well as the preveterinary medicine curriculum. (Refer to the freshman/ sophomore years in these programs fo r an example of a typi- cal course of study that students would follow.) After completion of the Open Option curriculum, or at anytime during the course of study, students will select a majorleading to the bachelor's degree. Those who select theenvironmental health or microbiology majors can completedegree requirements in two additional years, as described bythe departments. The program also prepares students for mostother majors in biological sciences. Upon completion of oneof the college's baccalaureate degree programs, students areprepared to enter a career directly or to continue graduatestudies in biological sciences or professional studies inveterinary medical, medical, or dental schools. Students whointend to apply to veterinary school may complete theColorado State preveterinary requirements in one year beyondthe Open Option program. Study Abroad Study abroad programs are available to students in the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. Because theknowledge of at least one other culture is valuable inunderstanding our own, students are strongly encouraged totake a semester or longer to study outside the United States aspart of their overall program at Colorado State University.Students interested in study abroad should plan far in advanceby discussing opportunities with their academic adviser and byvisiting the Office of International Programs in Laurel Hall,www.international.colostate.edu/us/studyabroad.

College of Veterinary 356 Medicine and Biomedical Sciences Continuing Education The College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences supports the veterinary profession by offering continuingeducation courses which enable practicing veterinarians toobtain new medical information and meet the ColoradoVeterinary Practice Act's continuing education requirementsfor relicensing. The college shares responsibility forcontinuing education and maintains close liaison with theAmerican Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), theColorado Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA), theColorado Board of Veterinary Medicine, and the WesternInterstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE). Graduate Programs Programs leading to the master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees are offered in all departments of thecollege. Students with bachelor of science or doctor of veterinary medicine degrees or well-qualified students who are currentlypursuing veterinary medicine degrees, are eligible to study foradvanced degrees offered in the Departments of BiomedicalSciences; Clinical Sciences; Environmental and RadiologicalHealth Sciences; and Microbiology, Immunology, andPathology. The College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (CVMBS) and the College of Business have created acombined five-year program of study that can result in earningboth the master of business administration degree and doctorof veterinary medicine degree. Applicants to the ProfessionalVeterinary Medical (PVM) program are encouraged toconsider extending their veterinary education to include a one-year start to an M.B.A. degree. After successfully completingthe first year of the M.B.A. program, students will beguaranteed admission to the first year of the PVM program andwill be expected to complete the remaining M.B.A. courserequirements concurrently with the first two years of the PVMcurriculum. A recent national study of the veterinaryprofession indicated that traditional scientific sk ills and knowledge might not be sufficient to capitalize on futureeconomic opportunities. This program was undertaken toimprove training of our students in veterinary practicemanagement and business skills. For detailed information about graduate programs, refer to the individual departments or write to the department concerned.See also the Graduate and Professional Bulletin .INTERDEPARTMENTAL PROGRAM Doctor of Veterinary Medicine A four-year professional program in veterinary medicine is offered to approximately 134 selected students. Because thenumber of applicants exceeds the number of students who canbe admitted to any class, the Admissions Committee for theCollege of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciencescarefully evaluates each applicant to recommend those bestqualified. Information concerning the academic programwhich leads to the doctor of veterinary medicine (D.V.M.)degree may be found in the Graduate and ProfessionalBulletin . The full course of study requires a minimum of six years: at least two years in a preprofessional program and,after acceptance, four years in the professional program. Preprofessional Curriculum Students may take their preprofessional training at anyaccredited institution; however, courses must be substantiallyequivalent in subject content and level to those required atColorado State. Specific inquiries regarding equivalent orsubstitute courses should be directed to the Office of the Deanor to the Preveterinary Advising Office. While Colorado State students in a degree program will take a higher number of credits, the minimum course requirementsfor admission to the professional program, exclusive ofelectives, are: Arts, Humanities, Behavioral and Social Sciences - at least 12 semester credits.

DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY, IMMUNOLOGY,AND PATHOLOGY Office in Microbiology Building, Room B 116 Professor Stephen A. Benjamin, Interim Head Major in Microbiology Microbiology is the study of organisms too small to be seenwith the naked eye, including bacteria, viruses, algae,protozoa, and fungi. Microbiology emerged as a distinctscience in the late nineteenth century, with the discovery thatmicroorganisms are the cause of many infectious diseases, andthat they play essential roles in the ecosystem and in industrialprocesses. Much past work in this field was directed towardthe cure, control, or eradication of disease in humans andanimals. Recent research has focused upon the use ofmicroorganisms for the production of improved foods and newmedicines. Discoveries of how to insert new genes intomicroorganisms and how to produce antibodies againstorganisms that cause disease has great potential to influencehuman health. Use of microbial agents to \"digest\" toxic wastesmay help clean up local environments or avert major disasters. Microbiology majors acquire knowledge and laboratory skill in the structure, physiology, genetics, pathogenicity, ecology,and taxonomy of microorganisms. Required courses inbiological sciences, chemistry, physics, and mathematicssupport the major. Specialties are in human and animalinfectious diseases, immunology, bacteriology, virology,molecular genetics, and environmental and industrialprocesses. Microbiology is an ideal major for students whoare preparing for professional veterinary or human medicalprograms or graduate studies in various biological sciences. Characteristics and Skills Understanding of physics, chemistry, mathematics Knowledge of microbial genetics, microbial physiology, organic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology,virology and immunology Ability to analyze data and test theories Knowledge and practice in laboratory techniques and procedures Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

In \"recognition\" of a tradition of excellence at Colorado State University, here is a guide to the University's official seal and logo. Each was designed to unify all those who are, and who will be, associated with the University. Identification with one or all of the symbols below is facilitated by the images, feelings, and memories they invoke. In identifying with these trademarks, the spirit of Colorado State University is perpetuated through generations of students, alumni, administrators, and personnel! The University Logo Our name says it all! Our logo communicates immediately that we are Colorado State University to any audience, anywhere. The University's name distinguishes it as a historical institution dedicated to excellence and innovation. The name has changed at three different junctures to accommodate the changes in educational needs paralleled by developments in society. The University's name identifies the institution as the first authorized college and the only land-grant institution in Colorado. Initially, Colorado State was referred to as Colorado Agricultural College. This name was deemed appropriate for the purposes of the University until the 1930s when the curricula expanded beyond an agricultural education. At that point, the institution was renamed Colorado State College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts (Colorado A&M). The final name change, Colorado State University, coincided with the University's implementation of an institutional focus on research. The University's logo, and name in any form, is protected from unauthorized use by federal trademark regulation. Knowledge to Go Places Knowledge to Go PlacesThe University Seal The official University seal displays the year of the University's establishment, the institution's name since 1957, and the components of its land-grant mission: education, service, extension, and research. The official seal is reserved for use on diplomas, medallions, awards, certificates, and official University documents. Such uses require the formal dignity of the University as signified by the seal. The Ram Logo The ram logo provides a standard graphic identity for the University's athletic programs. The ram logo was designed by a University employee whose design was selected from 273 entries in a ram logo contest. Knowledge to Go Places In retrospect . . . exactly what Colorado State University means to us will be different for everyone. Through all the experiences, the University's name and symbols remind us of a time and a place, of fond memories, of living, learning and growing that result from our Colorado State experience.
