Here, we take a look at proven energy psychology techniques that can help you move past trauma that's manifesting as undesirable outcomes in your life, so you can be fully recovered and well. What is Energy Psychology? [Energy psychology revolves around the concept of a mind-body-energy system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4654789/) in which emotion, cognition, and consciousness are linked via the biofield. When we experience trauma, it can become \"stuck\" inside of us, and this stuck trauma can be addressed by connecting to the energy within and around us. Energy psychology techniques often involve a combination of biofield interventions and cognitive-behavioral techniques that are designed to address these complex relationships and empower you to heal quickly and safely. By addressing disruptions to your energy system, you can release emotional blockages and change your trauma-related feelings, physical responses, and emotional patterns in a real and lasting way. How Energy Psychology Works Based on the belief that trauma, and therefore negative energy, can become stuck in the body and mind, energy psychology techniques aim to restore balance and facilitate healing by tapping into and releasing blockages. Research has shown that by understanding and using acupressure points, we can modulate the limbic system - the part of the brain that deals with memories and emotions. Energy Psychology combines the use of these points and other [energy medicine tools](https://www.sanctuary.net/treatments/energy-medicine/) with cognitive-behavioral techniques that help us let go of traumatic memories and trapped negative energy. Energy psychology techniques are used around the world and are known to be effective for [treating trauma and PTSD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4654788/), depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and chronic stress. Energy Psychology Techniques [The Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) is shown to be effective in treating PTSD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23364126). Also known as \"tapping,\" this technique begins by developing a statement that both acknowledges and accepts the negative feeling you wish to address. While repeating an abbreviated version of the statement, your therapist taps on specific acupressure points to release blockages. Before and after going through the sequence, you'll be asked to rate the intensity of your emotional response. This process is repeated as necessary until the negative feeling dissipates. Similar techniques include Thought Field Therapy, which involves talking about a problem while tapping on meridian points, and [tapas acupressure](https://tatlife.com/what-is-tat/about/), a technique based on Traditional Chinese Medicine principles that involve applying pressure to designated points in order to release energy blockages. Is Energy Psychology Right for You? If you're looking to release the blocks that are keeping you from completely healing from trauma, energy psychology may be right for you.
