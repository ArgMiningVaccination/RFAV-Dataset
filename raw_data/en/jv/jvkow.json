Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 1 Introduction Defining stigma: from a \"mark of disgrace\" to a dynamic social process Variously described as a \"token of infamy or subjection,\" a \"mark of disgrace,\" a \"sign of severe censure or condemnation,\" a \"morbid spot (...) on the skin,\" or a \"mark resembling the wounds (...) of Christ,\" and explained as \"made upon the skin\" by man, \"supernaturally impressed\" by divine forces, or \"a sign of (...) disorder\" innate to its bearer (Dictionary), stigma is a concept that challenges simple definition. Whether considered righteous and holy or, far more often, \"bad and objectionable,\" the stigmatized share a quality of otherness, set apart from those who surround them by some visible or invisible mark. The stigma associated with mental illness pervades contemporary discussions about the quality, accessibility, and appropriateness of health care, inc luding mental health care, for people diagnosed with a mental illness. In his seminal work on stigma, Goffman defined stigma as an \"attribute that is deeply discrediting\" and one which reduces the bearer \"from a whole and usual person to a tainted, discounted one\" (Goffman 1963). Jones and colleagues (1984) expanded on Goffman's observations to generate a definition of stigma as a mark that links a person to undesirable characteristics, or stereotypes. Link and Phelan (2001), commenting on the variability that exists in the definition of stigma, emphasized the importance of establishing a clear theoretical basis for conceptualizing and studying stigma; as the authors noted, stigma has been studied in a wide variety of situations and conditions, and by a broad range of disciplines, including psychology, anthropology, sociology, political science, and others. Investigators have Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 2 operationalized stigma relying on everything from dictionary definitions (e.g. \"a mark of disgrace\") to associated processes such as stereotyping, social rejection, and the sanction of restrictions on civil rights, with concomitant heterogeneity in the research instruments used and the underlying constructs measured. In an influential paper, Link and Phelan (2001) set out to address some of the challenges to the stigma concept: namely, that most researchers do not themselves belong to stigmatized groups and develop theories that are not informed by the lived experience of those whom they study (Schneidre 1988; Kleinman, Wang et al. 1995) ; and that the study of stigma has largely proceeded with an individualistic focus, neglecting both the structural determinants of stigma and the effects of discrimination (Oliver 1992). In their conceptualization, Link and Phelan posit that: \"Stigma exists when the following interrelated components converge. In the first component, people distinguish and label human differences. In the second, dominant cultural beliefs link labeled persons to undesirable characteristics \u2014to negative stereotypes. In the third, labeled persons are placed in distinct categories so as to accomplish some degree of separation of 'us' from 'them.' In the fourth, labeled persons experience status loss and discrimination that lead to unequal outcomes. Finally, stigmatization is entirely contingent on access to social, economic, and political power that allows the identification of differentness, the construction of stereotypes, the separation of labeled persons into distinct categories, and the full execution of disapproval, rejection, exclusion, and Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 3 discrimination.\" (Link and Phelan 2001) Stigma is thereby reimagined not as a \"mark of disgrace\" inherent to its bearer, but as a dynamic social process, in which the interrelated components of labeling, stereotyping, separation, and status loss and discrimination result in stigmatization only if they occur in the context of a power differential that places the stigmatized at social, economic, and /or political disadvantage. Link and Phelan's conceptualization has critical implications for the study of stigma and for the development of effective stigma reduction campaigns, not least in the context of the health care system, where, on the individual level, a power differential is implicit to the doctor-patient relationship, and where, on the population level, mental health services funding, access to mental health care, research allocations and priorities, and policy decisions reflect structural and institutional discrimination (Corrigan, Watson et al. 2004; Jamison 2006). Public attitudes toward mental illness People with mental illness experience widespread stigma and discrimination. Although some potentially stigmatizing conditions such as obesity or non -Caucasian ethnicity are readily apparent, mental illness is often considered a \"concealable\" stigma, prompting individuals to expend substantial energy to hide any signs or characteristics that might identify them as mentally ill, an anxiety-provoking and stressful exercise (Stier and Hinshaw 2007). Significantly more people with a mental illness, especially schizophrenia, report concealing their illness from family members, partners, friends, and colleagues, compared to people with diabetes (Lee, Lee et al. 2005). Chronic physical conditions show a much lower association with stigma than do Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 4 depressive or anxiety disorders (Alonso, Buron et al. 2008). Qualitative studies exploring the subjective experiences of people with schizophrenia have pointed to multiple dimensions in which stigma is felt: interpersonal interactions, structural discrimination, public images of men tal illness, and access to social roles (Angermeyer, Schulze et al. 2003). Interpersonal interactions are a potent locus of stigma: people with psychotic or substance use disorders are most likely to report instances of verbal abuse and harassment, while people with depressive and anxiety disorders may report feeling patronized (Dinos, Stevens et al. 2004). Family members of people with mental illness are also subject to \"courtesy stigma,\" or stigma by association , particularly in the case of substance dependence, with family members likely to be ostracized and blamed for the onset of the disorder in their relative (Corrigan, Watson et al. 2006). Mental health problems are associated with stigma in every society studied (Littlewood, Jadhav et al. 2007; Thornicroft, Brohan et al. 2009) . While cross-cultural studies of stigma show variations in attitudinal measures between ethnocultural groups, between new and \"acculturated\" immigrants, and between countries, no cultural group nor nation appears to be immune to the problem of stigma (Griffiths, Nakane et al. 2006; Stuart Carne et al. 2012; Pescosolido, Medina et al. 2013). Negative attitudes toward mental illness have been reported in adolescents and in children as young as five years old (Weiss 1986; Wahl 2002). Research on social cognition suggests that children do not conceptualize people as having stable traits until somewhere between 7 and 11 years of age (Adler and Wahl 1998). In one study, although a group of third-graders ascribed more negative attributes and behavior to characters labeled \"mentally ill\" than to characters labeled \"physically disabled \" or \"regular grown-up,\" there were few specific characteristics that consistently differentiated the three Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 5 groups in these children's stories and direct statements about the characters; th e authors concluded that children seemed to know that those labeled \"mentally ill\" are in some way undesirable and to be avoided, even though they were not able to articulate concrete trait differences (Adler and Wahl 1998). How children acquire an understanding of mental illness has been the subject of substantial academic interest, as identifying factors in the development of stigmatizing attitudes could have implications for effective anti-stigma interventions in childhood and adolescence. While parents, teachers, and peers all contribute to children's attitudes toward mental illness, popular media play an important role in the transmission of stigma, with some authors arguing that the influence of media is even greater in children, who have fewer opportunities to encounter and learn about mental illness from other sources (such as employment, higher education, etc.) than do adult s (Wahl, Hanrahan et al. 2007). Several studies have focused on the representation of characters with mental illness in children's television programs and films. Mentally ill characters fail more often , and are more likely to be killed, injured, or exploited (Gerbner 1995); they are more likely to be threatening or frightening to other characters, to behave in violent or aggressive ways, and to be referred to by slang terms (e.g. crazy, psycho, lunatic) than by medical or psychological labels (Wahl, Wood et al. 2003). Psychiatric terminology (e.g. \"Have you lost your mind?\") in children's movies is often used to disparage or discredit the opinions or behaviors of others (Wahl, Wood et al. 2003). In a study of Disney films, researchers found that 85% contained some reference to mental illness, and that most of the references were used to communicate a character 's inferior status; the majority of the Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 6 characters identified as mentally ill were the object of fear, derision, or amusement (Lawson and Fouts 2004). Although there is some promising evidence of improvements in media reporting of mental illness (Thornicroft, Goulden et al. 2013), negative attitudes in adulthood are too often informed and reinforced by unfavourable depictions of the mentally ill in television and film, and by sensationalistic media coverage of mental illness, most notably of rare but high-profile violent crimes committed by people with mental disorders (McGinty, Webster et al. 2013; Murphy, Fatoye et al. 2013). One approach to reducing stigma involves improving pub lic understanding of the nature of mental disorders through education in \"mental health litera cy.\" Much of this work has assumed that conveying neurobiological explanations for mental disorders wi ll reduce stigmatizing attitudes. Large-scale population studies have documented increasing mental health literacy in recent years, but findings have been mixed with respect to shifts toward less stigmatizing attitudes, with some studies reporting a small but encouraging positive change in public beliefs about mental illness (Link, Phelan et al. 1999; Crisp, Gelder et al. 2005) , while other studies find no change in stigmatizing beliefs despite increased acceptance of neurobiological explanations for mental illness (Pescosolido, Monahan et al. 1999; Pescosolido, Martin et al. 2010; Schomerus, Schwahn et al. 2012). Psychiatric illness is exceedingly heterogeneous, and different psychiatric disorders elicit different patterns of attitudes and social responses . One way attitudes are measured is in terms of desired social distance, in which a person's willingness to engage in social relationships of varying intimacy with a member of a stigmatized group is quantified. Evidence from a multitude Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 7 of population-based studies (Link, Phelan et al. 1999; Crisp, Gelder et al. 2000; Pescosolido, Schomerus, Lucht et al. 2011; Pescosolido, Medina et al. 2013) consistently suggest that the greatest social distance is desired from people with substance use disorders and schizophrenia, as compared to depression or anxiety disorders; and that perceptions of \"character weakness\" (or personal responsibility) (Feldman and Crandall 2007; Griffiths 2008; Jorm and Oh 2009), behavioural potential dangerousness (Feldman and Crandall 2007), and biogenetic causation of illness (the belief that illness is primarily the result of objective biological or genetic factors ) (Read, Haslam et al. 2006) contribute to increased desire for social distance. Endorsement of the stereotype that people with mental illness are unpredictable and potentially dangerous is one of the most consistent predictors of desired social distance (Link, Phelan et al. 1999; Angermeyer and Matschinger 2004) . Angermeyer and colleagues (2010) report that the most prevalent emotional reaction to people with mental illness is positive, while the second most prevalent emotional reaction is one of fear and anger. However, these authors note that emotional reactions vary substantially according to the psychiatric disorder, and appear to mediate the desire for social distance. Even positive responses may prove problematic, if pity predominates. Beliefs that people with mental illness cannot care for themselves (associated with a perceived need for a paternalistic mental health care system to make decisions for patients assumed to be incapable of making their own), or, conversely, that they are innocent and childlike ( associated with a benevolent response evoking the need for a \"compassionate caretaker\" ) may also influence desired social distance (Corrigan, Edwards et al. 2001). Familiarity with mental illness tends overall to decreas e stigmatizing attitudes, although the effect tends to be disorder-specific (Corrigan, Edwards et al. 2001; Crisp, Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 8 Gelder et al. 2005; Wolkenstein and Meyer 2009) . The impact of stigma and discrimination on health outcomes The stigma of mental illness has repeatedly been identified as a major barrier to help -seeking in people with mental health difficulties across a variety of disorders and care settings (Gary 2005; Wrigley, Jackson et the lifespan (de Mendonca Lima, Levav et al. 2003; Rose, Thornicroft et al. 2007; Moses 2009; Moses 2010). Stigma has also been identified as a major barrier to community reintegration and rehabilitation in those suffering from severe mental illness (Prince and Prince 2002). The deleterious effects of stigma on self - assessed quality of life (Marcussen, Ritter et al. 2010), along with substantial evidence demonstrating that stigmatizing attitudes are internalized by people with a mental illness (a phenomenon termed \"self-stigma\") (Link, Struening et al. 1997; Teachman, Wilson et al. 2006; Lysaker, Karidi, Stefanis et al. 2010) and further worsen outcomes, underscore the magnitude of the problem. People with mental illness suffer the effects of stigma in many aspects of their lives, and consistent evidence of worse health outcomes among people with mental illness suggests that they are also subject to inequitable treatment in the health care system . People with severe mental illness carry a higher burden of physical illness (including but not limited to cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS) and have a marked excess mortality Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 9 compared to the general population, translating to an astonishing 13- to 30-year decrease in life expectancy, even in countries with good-quality health care systems (Lawrence and Kisely 2010; Thornicroft, Rose et al. 2010; Hert, Correll et al. 2011; Lawrence, Hancock et al. 2013) . While modifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, diet, and exercise) account for a po rtion of the increased burden of physical illness, it is clear that systemic issues within the health care system also contribute to the problem (Phelan, Stradins et al. 2001). People with mental illness have diminished access to primary health care (Levinson Miller, Druss et al. 2003). There is evidence to suggest that people with mental illness receive fewer preventive health care services such as routine cancer screening and immunization (Druss, Rosenheck et al. 2002; Carney and Jones 2006; Xiong, Bermudes et al. 2008) , and fewer therapeutic interventions for common conditions such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and stroke (Nasrallah, Meyer et al. 2006; Kisely, Smith et al. 2007; Kisely, Campbell et al. 2009; Laursen, Munk-Olsen et al. 2009; Mitchell, Lord et al. 2012) compared to the non-psychiatric general population, despite higher rates of disease. The term \"diagnostic overshadowing\" has been used to refer to the \"misattribution of physical signs and symptoms to concurrent mental disorders, leading to underdiagnosis and mistreatment of the physical conditions\" (Thornicroft, Rose et al. 2007). In one experimental study that appears to support the theory of diagnostic overshadowing, physicians were less likely to order tests for a hypothetical patient with headache or abdominal pain if the patient had a histor y of depression; researchers concluded that physicians had a lower estimate of pretest probability of disease in patients with psychiatric histories (Graber, Bergus et al. 2000). Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 10 Researchers are increasingly framing the problem of stigma as a public health issue. In an historic issue of the American Journal of Public Health entirely devoted to covering stigma and discrimination against people with mental illness, Hatzenbuehler and colleagues (2013) argue that stigma \"should be considered alongside the other major organizing concepts for research on social determinants of population health \" (p. 813). In support of their argument, the authors draw on \"fundamental cause theory,\" which proposes that \"some factors or circumstances remain persistently associated with health inequalities over time despite dramatic changes in diseases, risk factors, and health interventions \" (Hatzenbuehler, Phelan et al. 2013). Consistent with the emphasis placed upon discrimination and power imbalance in Link and Phelan's model of mental illness stigma, fundamental cause theory re -orients the focus of stigma reduction efforts to \"interventions that either produce fundamental changes in attitudes and beliefs or change the power relations that underlie the ability of dominant groups to act on their attitudes and beliefs \" (Link and Phelan 2001). Subjective experiences of stigma and discrimination within the health care system \"I am going to mention one thing [that needs to change] but it is very positive. It is the attitude of staff. Attitude is so important. If someone has a helpful attitude, it makes a difference\" (Pinfold, Byrne et al. 2005) This comment from one participant in a qualitative study of mental health service users' views about how anti-stigma campaigns should prioritize their actions points to the importance of health care providers as a target for interventions . Accounts of diminished credibility, Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 11 disempowerment, and communication problems with health professionals emerged as common themes, with users ranking health services reform (specifically psychiatric services reform) as a campaign priority (Pinfold, Byrne et al. 2005). Indeed, subjective experiences of stigma and discrimination are manifest wit hin the health care and mental health care systems. A core concern of mental health service users is the dehumanization they experience in mental health services (Corrigan 2005). This includes exclusion from the decision-making process, the assumption of incompetence, provision of inadequate information, and an ever -present, if implicit, threat of coercive treatment, which tarnish a relationship that should be fundamentally collaborative in nature (Ucok, Polat et al. 2004; Thornicroft, Rose et al. 2007). Pessimistic statements about prognosis are also cited by service users as aspects of clinical interaction s that reduce the patient from a person to an amalgam of \"illness-related deficits\" (Schulze 2007). \"It's a scary business\": qualitative reports of health care professionals' attitudes From the other side of the clinical encounter, qualitative studies suggest that health professionals approach patients with mental illness with a mixture of fear, anxiety, uncertainty, and hopelessness, overshadowed by a concern about the \"genuineness\" of the symptoms and suffering (Liggins and Hatcher 2005). In a qualitative study of medical interns and residents, three dimensions were identified as relevant to the interaction between physicians and patien ts with psychiatric presentations: i) emotional difficulty with the patient interaction (moderated by physician interest, perceived unpredictability of patient behaviour, time pressure s, attributions of Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 12 illness, and physician experience with psychiatric pa tients); ii) uncertainty around the etiology and management of psychiatric disorders ; and iii) pessimism regarding prognosis (Solar 2002). Similarly, in a study of Australian nurses, attitudes toward caring for people with mental illness in a rural general hospital setting were closely linked to issues that influenced nurses' perception of their ability to provide care (the need to prioritize physical care, time constraints, and lack of skill, among other factors); nurses receiving support and education from mental health nurses reported more positive experiences (Reed and Fitzgerald 2005). Knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour of health care and mental health care professionals Given the ample evidence for stigma and discrimination within the health care system, t he knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour of health care and mental health care professionals toward people with mental illness warrant exploration. A substantial body of research has focused on the attitudes of medical students, whose perceptions and beliefs about mental illness, progressively molded and altered by their professional training might be expected to straddle the border between public attitudes and those of health care professionals . Although a majority of medical students in one study endorsed the opinion that people with schizophrenia and substance use disorders were dangerous and unpredictable, they also reported more optimistic views with regard to the effectiveness of treatment compared to the general population (Mukherjee, Fialho et al. 2002). Medical students' views of psychiatry are often considered a barometer of the discipline's status within medicine (Schulze 2007), an important issue for recruitment into psychiatry and for Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 13 collaborative care. While medical students may consider psychiatry more interesting and intellectually challenging than other specialties, they consistently report the belief that psychiatric patients are \"not easy to lik e\" (Sivakumar, Wilkinson et al. 1986; Malhi, Parker et al. 2003; Schulze 2007). The mere presence of a psychiatric label resulted in greater desire for social distance among medical students (Ogunsemi, Odusan et al. 2008). Psychiatric training may not change (Fischel, Manna et al. 2008), may improve (Ay, Save et al. 2006; Dixon, Roberts et al. 2008), or may worsen (Baxter, Singh et al. 2001; Totic, Stojiljkovic et al. 2011) stigmatizing attitudes toward people with mental illness. Even in a study in which overall attitudes were found to improve after training, an increase was noted in the proportion of students who did not perceive schizophrenia as \"temporary\" and \"curable\" and in the perceived dangerousness of people with schizophrenia (Ay, Save et al. 2006). Where psychiatric training has been associated with a positive change in students' attitudes toward psychiatry, psychiatrists, and mental illness, it is not clear whether the effect is persistent or transient (Sivakumar, Wilkinson et al. 1986; Creed and Goldberg 1987). The nature and content of psychiatric education may mediate the relationship between training and attitudes . For instance, an innovative, workshop-based approach to psychiatric education combining a filmed narrative by a young person with schizophrenia and simulated auditory hallucinations was associated with improvement in medical students' attitudes toward people with schizophrenia (Galletly and Burton 2011), while traditional methods of teaching psychopathology did not reduce mental illness stigma in psychology students (Mann and Himelein 2008). Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 14 The attitudes of general practitioners, psychiatrists, and other health care professionals have been studied within each group, relative to one another, and relative to the general public . General practitioners may be less comfortable having a patient with schizophrenia than a patient with depression or diabetes in their practice (Lawrie, Martin et al. 1998) and more likely to endorse pessimistic views regarding the effectiveness of psychiatric treatment (Kua, Parker et al. 2000). There is evidence to suggest that the attitudes of non -psychiatrist physicians are more negative than psychiatrists' (Chin and Balon 2006), as stigmatizing as the attitudes of the public (Hori, Richards et al. 2011), and possibly even more pessimistic than the public's attitudes with respect to long-term outcomes of mental illness and the likelihood of discrimination (Jorm, Korten et al. 1999). Nevertheless, the picture is far from rosy for mental health professionals. As Thornicroft puts it: \"Is it possible that staff trained specifically to treat mental illnesses may contribut e to the stigma that service users feel? The answer seems to be yes.\" (Thornicroft, Rose et al. 2010). Two systematic reviews of the published literature on mental health professionals' attitudes toward mental illness (Schulze 2007; Wahl and Aroesty -Cohen 2010) arrive at similar conclusions: the overall attitudes of mental health professionals are found to be both positive in an absolute sense and more positive in comparison to public views in a majorit y of studies, but some negative attitudes persist even in those studies with predominantly positive results. Many mental health professionals appear to share the public belief that people with serious mental illnesses are dangerous; many doubt the possibility of recovery for most patients ; and they tend to be similar to the public in being reluctant to accept those with psychiatric disorders within their social and occupational circles (Wahl and Aroesty-Cohen 2010). Noting that secondary and tertiary care psychiatrists accumulate most of their clinical experience in treating patients who Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 15 either do not recover fully or recover and relapse fre quently, Thornicroft and colleagues (2010) suggests that \"physician bias\"\u2014which arises because most doctors base their attitudes on their personal experience of treating people with mental disorders\u2014is the principal factor underlying pessimistic views around recovery from mental illness (Hugo 2001). A physician bias could also explain why psychiatrists may report more negative attitudes than other professionals such as psychologists, nurses, or other therapists (Caldwell and Jorm 2001; Lauber, Nordt et al. 2006) . There is increasing interest in demographic correlates and predictors of negative attitudes in psychiatrists. In an attempt to refine the study of stigma in psychiatrists, Brazilian investigators categorized their respondents into three distinct 2013), of which the \"unobtrusive\" group is perhaps of most interest: significantly younger on average, these psychiatrists reported the least desired social distance but endorsed high levels of perceived prejudice ( i.e. the belief that people with mental illness are likely to be negatively viewed or treated by others, which is often interpreted as a socially acceptable proxy expression of the respondent's own negative views, but could, conversely, reflect a sincere concern for the wider social response to people with mental illness ) and concurred with the need for coercive treatment. Indian investigators reported that older age, higher education, and longer duration of contact with the mentally ill predicted more favourable attitudes in a population of inpatient psychiatrists (Vibha, Saddichha et al. 2008). Similarly, the greater the amount of professional experience, the less likely were nurses to perceive people with schizophrenia as dangerous and unpredictable (Bjorkman, Angelman et al. 2008). The greater a psychiatrist's caseload of people with schizophrenia, the less likely they were to describe people with schizophrenia as \"hard to talk to\" and unpr edictable (Kingdon, Sharma et al. 2004)\u2014Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 16 findings seemingly at odds with Thornicroft's theorized \"phy sician bias\" (Thornicroft, Rose et al. 2010). Greater professional experience may heighten pessimism around recovery from mental illness, and yet, at the same time, provide psychiatrists with a more nuanced perspective on their patients' life experiences as well as a greater facility for engaging with them as individuals. While the evolution of stigmatizing attitudes across the span of professionals' career has not been extensively examined, one study suggested that, although compared to non-psychiatry residents, psychiatry residents harbour less stigmatizing attitudes toward both schizophrenia and depression, there was no significant difference in attitudes between junior and senior psychiatry residents (Chin and Balon 2006). In this same study, having a family member with a psychiatric illness was strongly associated with less stigmatizing attitudes in residents, raising the possibility that experiences gathered outside of professional training were more influential predictors of stigma than psychiatric education itself. Reviewing the evidence on the \"intricate relationship\" between stigma and mental health professionals, Schulze (2007) highlighted the complexity of studying mental illness stigma in a group of people who have devoted their professional lives to caring for the mentally il l. Substantive critiques have been levelled against psychiatrist -led anti-stigma campaigns. Detractors have argued that these campaigns are uninformed by the perspectives of people with lived experience of mental illness and function as little more than a thinly veiled attempt at destigmatizing the psychiatric profession within medicine \u2014an exercise in professional self - interest rather than an effort grounded in compassion and a commitment to social justice for patients. If psychiatrists are to lead the charge in public campaigns to decrease the stigma of Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 17 mental illness, a candid examination of their own attitudes and professional blind spots appears essential to preserve both the credibility and moral legitimacy of any such campaign. A disease like any other: stigma and the failure of the biogenetic model Merely labeling a clinical presentation as psychiatric or describing a fictional person in a clinical vignette as having visited a psychiatrist increases the desire for social distance, e ven in health professionals (Baxter, Singh et al. 2001; Mukherjee, Fialho et al. 2002; Stojiljkovic et al. 2011) . Yet anti-stigma campaigns have largely been predicated on p resenting mental illness as \"a disease like any other\" and on increasing mental health literacy within a biomedical framework. Critics have argued that placing an emphasis on the biogenetic aspects of mental illness could result in a perception of mental illness as intrinsic an d immutable, potentially resulting in greater desired social distance (Haslam and Ernst 2002; Read, Haslam et al. 2006; Haslam, Ban et al. 2007; Rusch, Todd et al. 2010). Attribution theory postulates that a person's perceived responsibility for a stigmatizing condition such as a mental illness may predict either anger and punitive reactions (if the person's condition is felt to be controllable) or pity and helping behaviours (if the person 's condition is felt to be uncontrollable) (Link, Yang et al. 2004). Recovery is considered possible when the cause of a particular illness is viewed as changeable over time (i.e. unstable), but not when a cause is viewed as unchanging (i.e. stable) (Link, Yang et al. 2004). Attributions of causality and control may be influenced by the models that clinicians hold of specific types of mental health problem. Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 18 Interestingly, there is evidence that clinicians continue to employ a mind -brain dichotomy when reasoning about clinical cases (Miresco and Kirmayer 2006; Ahn, Proctor et al. 2009), viewing some types of mental health problems as more biological and others as more psychological, and attributing responsibility for a given condition differentially based on the presumption of a predominantly biological (uncontrollable) or psychological (co ntrollable) etiology of illness . Population-based studies suggest that increased public endorsement over the past decade of a neurobiological etiology of mental illness has not been associated with a decrease in desired social distance from persons with mental illness (Pescosolido, Martin et al. 2010). Although some studies have found that neither biological nor non-biological attributional beliefs appear to predict social distance (Sears, Pomerantz et al. 2011), and that attributions of \"weakness of character\" are more closely related to desired social distance than are medical il lness conceptualizations (Jorm and Griffiths 2008), acceptance of a biological or disease explanation of mental health problems is associated with greater pessimism about the prospects for recovery and with decreased perceived personal responsibility for the illness (Angermeyer and Matschinger 1996; Lam and Salkovskis 2007; Bennett, Thirlaway et al. 2008) . A systematic review of population studies examining biogenetic explanations and public acceptance of mental illness concluded that a greater proportion of the public now embraces a neurobiological understanding of mental illness (Angermeyer, Holzinger et al. 2011). However, while there was a concomitant increase in support for mental health services, there was no associated decrease in desired social distance and perceived dangerousness of people with mental illness (Angermeyer, Holzinger et al. 2011). Where a neurobiological etiology was associated Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 19 with stigma, its effect was to increase, not decrease, attitudes favouring social exclusion (Angermeyer, Holzinger et al. 2011; Lee, Laurent et al. 2013) . Genetic attributions even appear to increase levels of associative stigma toward family members of people with mental illness (Bennett, Thirlaway et al. 2008). Evidence-based stigma reduction strategies As the pitfalls of the \"disease like any other\" approach to mental illness stigma reduction are increasingly recognized, interest in alternative strategies has grown. Substantial evidence exists for the effectiveness of interpersonal contact in reducing the stigma of mental illness. Interpersonal contact challenges stereotypic views of mental illness through direct interactions with people who have mental health problems (Corrigan, River et al. 2001), thereby disrupting the stereotyping process which subjects the labelled person to a separation between \"us\" and \"them,\" and which nurtures and perpetuates stigma (Link and Phelan 2001). Simply put, interpersonal contact forces an acknowledgement of the stigmatized individual's personhood. Interestingly, there exists experimental support for the notion that feeling empathy for a member of a stigmatized group can improve attitudes to the group as a whole (Batson, Polycarpou et al. 1997). A review of the literature on interpersonal contact and mental illness stigma (Couture and Penn 2003), cautioning that the interpretation of existing evidence is hampered by nu merous methodological problems, highlights one of the key unanswered questions about interpersonal contact and stigma: just what kinds of contact reduce stigma? The authors note that several Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 20 factors appear to mediate the relationship between interpersonal contac t and stigma reduction: equal status, level of intimacy, voluntary nature of the contact, perception of the experience as pleasant, and perception of the experience as cooperative vs. competitive (Couture and Penn 2003). The greater the amount of interpersonal contact, the greater the perceived variability among individuals of the stigmatized group, supporting the notion that viewing m embers of a stigmatized group as individuals is key to fostering more positive attitudes. Contact-based stigma reduction teaching models have proliferated in health care education, from the introduction of \"structured dialogue\" models for social work stud ents (Shor and Sykes 2002) and unstructured question-and-answer type social interactions between pharmacy students and people in recovery from a mental illness (Patten, Remillard et al. 2012), to the screening off mental health service user-made documentary films for medical students (Kerby, Calton et al. 2008)\u2014to borrow from communication theorist Marshall McLuhan, in these pedagogical models, \"the person is the message.\" Involving people with lived experience o f mental illness in the process of developing contact-based stigma reduction programs is critically important (Schulze 2007), yet these partnerships are fraught with potential pitfalls. Can \"co-teaching pedagogy,\" in which a disabled or otherwise stigmatized person partners with professionals to lead seminars for health care students, generate an authentic space in which the stigmatized can make their voices heard, or does it represent an insidious form of \"tokenism\" (Gutman, Kraiem et al. 2012)? Designing effective pedagogical or public health int erventions requires better theoretical understanding of the dynamics of stigma production and reduction, which must include systematic attention to issues of power, voice, culture , and context. Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 21 Other approaches to stigma reduction have focused on the labeling process. Interestingly, a move has been made to rename schizophrenia, both in Japan (Takahashi, Ideno et al. 2009; Omori, Tateno et al. 2012) (where \"Seishin-Bunretsu-Byo,\" Mind-Split Disease, was replaced with a new term, \"Togo-Shitcho-Sho,\" Integration Disorder) and in North America (Tranulis, Lecomte et al. 2013; Henderson and Malhi 2014) (where \"salience syndrome\" was one of the alternative names proposed over the course of discussions preceding the publication of DSM-5) in the hopes of diminishing negative stereotypes associated with the diagnosis . These \"rebranding\" efforts have been met with mixed results both among health care professionals (Omori, Tateno et al. 2012) and the public (Takahashi, Ideno et al. 2009; Tranulis, Lecomte et al. 2013) , and some investigators argue that any benefit associated with a name change is likely to be transient at best (Tranulis, Lecomte et al. 2013). Measuring stigma: explicit and implicit approaches In emphasizing the importance of establishing a clear theoretical basis for the conceptualization and study of stigma, Link and Phelan (2001) underlined a major challenge in stigma research, namely, the problem of heterogeneity in stigma constructs and corresponding research instruments. In a comprehensive review of approaches to mental illness stigma measurement, Link and colleagues (2004) offered a classification of measurable stigma components and constructs, including behaviour, labeling, stereotyping, cognitive separating, emotional reactions , status loss/discrimination (expectations), status loss/discrimination (experiences), structural discrimination, and behavioural responses to stigma. The authors also summarized and reviewed existing stigma measurement tools , including: desired social distance (assessing the willingness Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 22 to interact with a target person in different types of social relat ionships); semantic differential and related measures (assessing stereotyping, or the tendency to associate a label with a set of negative attributes); Opinions about Mental Illness scale (assessing authoritarianism, benevolence, restrictiveness, and inter personal etiology of mental illness); Community Attitudes Toward the Mentally Ill scale (assessing authoritarianism, benevolence, restrictiveness, and attitudes toward community mental health treatment) ; attributional measures (assessing emotional reactions, behavioural intentions, and perceived controllability of a stigmatizing condition); Key Informant Questionnaire and EMIC (assessing perceptions of mental disorder in the community and help-seeking behaviours); Emotional Reaction to Mental Illness Scale (assessing aggressive emotions, pro-social reactions, and feelings of anxiety) ; and the Perceived Devaluation-Discrimination Scale (assessing respondents' perceptions of what most other people believe about the mentally ill) (Link, Yang et al. 2004). While the study of the stigma associated with mental illness has relied primarily on self -report measures, there is growing interest in forms of bias that occur outside of conscious awareness (Teachman, Wilson et al. 2006; Peris, Corrigan et al. 2010; Rusch, Todd et al. 2010). Research on the processing of social information\u2014including stigmatization\u2014has indicated that \"individuals process such infor mation on both an explicit level (i.e., consciously, controllably, and reflectively) and an implicit level (i.e., subconsciously, automatically, and intuitively)\" (Stier and Hinshaw 2007). Explicit measures such as the social distance scale are susceptible to the phenomenon of social desirability, wherein the respondent provides an answer based on what he or she expects to be favourably viewed by others; moreover, explicit measures often correlate poorly with alternative measures of stigma that focus Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 23 on less consciously exhibited attitudes or on behavioural discrimination (Stier and Hinshaw 2007). This has led to efforts to identify less reactive measures of implicit bias. For example, a small body of research has adopted an entirely novel approach to unconscious attitudes and focused on psychophysiological changes in response to labels of mental illne ss (Graves, Cassisi et al. 2005), showing that increases in physiological reactivity predicted desire for greater social distance. One widely used measure of implicit bias is the Implicit Association Test (IAT) (Greenwald, McGhee et al. 1998). The IAT is a computer-based response time task that measures implicit association strengths between concepts and attributes by requiring participants to classify word stimuli into superordinate categories . The response time to each item reflects the ease with which participants can associate concepts in memory. In practice, the task requires items to be classified while two category labels are pair ed on either side of the screen (e.g. \"insect\" and \"bad\" on the lefthand side of the screen, and \"flower\" and \"good\" on the righthand side) . The measure of bias involves comparing the time taken to classify stimuli when paired categorie s match a person's automatic associations (e.g. \"insect\" and \"bad\") versus the time taken when paired categories contradict automatic associations (e.g. \"flower\" and \"bad\"). Thus, the IAT is an inherently comparative task based on the use of a relevant comparator category. The use of the IAT has allowed researchers to conclude that implicit preferences and stereotypes are pervasive across demographic groups; that is, even when people report no bias, they show reliable biases that are consistent with prevalent patterns . Of course, as with self-report measures, there is substantial inter-individual variability in implicit attitudes and stereotypes Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 24 While variations in gender, ethnicity, age and political orientation predict vari ation in implicit and explicit measures , implicit and explicit attitudes and stereotypes are related, but disti nct (Nosek, Smyth et al. 2007). Indeed, in a study of attitudes toward obese persons, investigators noted that implicit attitudes predict ed prejudicial and discriminatory behaviour toward individuals with obesity, whereas explicit attitudinal measures were not correlated with behavioural choices (Bessenoff and Sherman 2000). The relationship between explicit and implicit attitudes and behaviour is complex, and a metaanalysis of the relationship between the IAT and self-report measures showed only a small effect size (Hofmann, Gawronski et al. 2005). Low correlations between implicit and explicit measures may be due to biases in explicit self- reports (for instance, a reluctance to endorse prejudicial views), the inability to consciously access implicitly assessed representations, differences with respect to the cognitive effort required to retrieve implicit vs. explicit representations, or to method-related characteristics of the two measures (for instance, whether explicit and implicit measures are directly related conceptually); alternatively, low correlations between implicit and explicit measures may simply reflect the complete independence of the underlying constructs (Hofmann, Gawronski et al. 2005). The same authors noted that correlations between implicit an d explicit measures increased with more spontaneous self-reports and explicit and implicit measures that were more closely conceptually related. While explicit attitudinal measures may better predict intentional behaviours that are under conscious control, such as friendliness, implicit meas ures may more reliably predict automatic, non-verbal behaviours, such as eye contact, verbal slips, and other subtle avoidance behaviours (Stone and Moskowitz 2011). In a study of the implicit and explicit attitudes toward mental illness in two groups, a healthy Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 25 control sample and a population diagnosed with a mental illness, Teachman and colleagues (2006) found relatively more negative explicit reports of attitudes toward mental illness compared to physical illness on a semantic differential scale and negative implicit attitudes toward mental illness (as compared to physical illne ss) on the IAT using stimuli such as \"bad,\" \"helpless,\" \"blameworthy\"; they noted that explicit and implicit attitudes were uncorrelated. Another study of the explicit and implicit attitudes of the general public, undergraduates, and mental health clinicians found a significant but relatively small implicit preference for people with mental illness compared to welfare recipients (the comparator group in the IAT used in that study), and relatively more implicit positivity toward mental illness in the group of responde nts with mental health care experience (Peris, Teachman et al. 2008). As recognition grows that health care disparities may be mediated by implicit bias in health care providers (Blair, Steiner et al. 2011), there has been interest in the IAT as a method for studying physicians' attitudes toward sensitive issues such as obesity, race, and mental illness\u2014conditions subject to stigma and discrimination within the health care system. In one study of physicians' explicit and implicit attitudes about weight , strong implicit and explicit anti-fat bias was observed in physicians, comparable to attitudes in the general public (Sabin, Marini et al. 2012). Another study of health care professionals reported ev idence for implicit anti-fat bias that was strong (albeit less negative than in the general population), while explicit anti-fat bias was minimally endorsed (Teachman and Brownell 2001). A fascinating study of implicit race bias among physicians demonstrated that as pro-white implicit bias increased, so did the physicians' likelihood of treating a hypothetical white patient \u2014but not a hypothetical black patient\u2014with thrombolysis for myocardial infarction (Green, Carney et al. 2007). In a study of first-year Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 26 medical students, IAT scores were consistent with implicit preference for white persons but no association was found between implicit bias and clinical assessments in a series of vignette scenarios (Haider, Sexton et al. 2011). Adopting a somewhat novel angle on the interplay between implicit bias and health care provision, investigators concluded that greater implicit prejudice toward injecting drug users predicted job stress and intention to change jobs in nurses working in a substance abuse treatment program (von Hippel, Brener et al. 2008). Other researchers have employed the IAT as a pre-post measure of attitudinal change relative to an intervention theorized to modify stigma. Japanese investigators studying the ramifications of renaming schizophrenia found that implicit attitudes became more negative, contrary to their initial hypothesis, after residents completed clinical training in psychiatry (Omori, Tateno et al. 2012). However, implicit attitudes remained unchanged in a group of psychology and medical students who underwent different psychoeducational interventions on the etiology of schizophrenia , even as stereotyping, social distance, and attributions shifted from pre- to post-intervention (Lincoln, Arens et al. 2008). Rationale and hypotheses There is ample evidence that people with mental illness suffer stigma and discrimination across a variety of contexts, including the health care and mental health care settings. Although mental health professionals' attitudes tend to be both positive in an absolute sense and more positive in comparison to public views in a majority of studies, negative attitudes persist, particularl y with respect to perceptions of dangerousness, doubts about the possibility of recovery, and reluctance Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 27 to accept those with mental illness within their social and occupational circles. There is a need for more data about the explicit and implicit attitudes of psychiatrists and psychiatry residents, about the interplay between explicit and implicit bias, and about demographic predictors of stigma. Accordingly, the present study was designed to examine the attitudes of psychiatric trainees and practitioners on both explicit and implicit measures of stigma -related bias. Hypotheses included: 1) psychiatrists and psychiatry residents have negative implicit and explicit attitudes toward people with mental illness; 2) explicit and implicit attitudes are independent (not correlated); and 3) increased patient contact predicts more positive attitudes. Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 28 Methods Study design The study compared the responses of psychiatrists and psychiatry residents on explicit and implicit measures of bias for two conditions: schizophrenia and diabetes. Sample The participants in this study were drawn from two sources: the McGill University Department of Psychiatry (counting 286 members, and an additional 54 residents and fellows), and the Canadian Psychiatric Association (comprising 1,743 ps ychiatrists and 240 members-in-training, who are principally psychiatry residents). An invitation to participate in the study was emailed once to all members of the McGill University Department of Psychiatry, including residents, with a reminder email sent one month later; paper invitations were also distributed in faculty mailboxes at the two largest teaching hospital sites. Residents in the McGill University Department of Psychiatry were sent additional reminder emails to participate. An invitation to participate in the study was emailed once to all members, including members -in-training, of the Canadian Psychiatric Association, with two email reminders within the subsequent month. All study invitations were sent in a bilingual format, and respondents were given the choice of completing the study in either English or French. Informed consent was obtained online. Demographic information Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 29 All respondents were asked to provide basic demographic data, including gender, year of birth, mother tongue (English, French, or other), country of birth (Canada or other), and province or territory of residence, as well as information on training and practice. Subsequent demographic data was individualized in accordance with the category of respondent: medical studen t, medical resident, family or specialist physician, or allied health professional (Appendix B). Medical students were asked about their level of training, anticipated year of undergraduate medical graduation, amount of clinical training in psychiatry or mental health, psychotherapy training, if any, and interest in pursuing a career in psychiatry (Likert scale ranging from 1, not at all interested, to 5, completely interested). Medical residents were asked about their specialty (family medicine, psychiat ry, or other), level of training, year of undergraduate medical graduation, country of medical education (Canadian or international), amount of clinical training in psychiatry or mental health, and psychotherapy training, if any. Information about number o f patients seen in a typical week, number of patients with mental illness seen in a typical week, and number of hours spent on direct patient care in a typical week was also collected, in order to derive an estimate of number of hours per week of direct contact with patients with mental illness. Family and specialist physicians were similarly asked about their specialty (family medicine, psychiatry, or other), year of undergraduate medical graduation, country of medical education (Canadian or international), amount of clinical training in psychiatry or mental health, and Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 30 psychotherapy training, if any. Again, in order to derive an estimate of the number of hours per week of direct contact with patients with mental illness, information about number of patien ts seen in a typical week, number of patients with mental illness seen in a typical week, and number of hours spent on direct patient care in a typical week, was collected. More detailed practice profile information was also sought, including information about main patient care setting (private office/clinic, community clinic/community health centre, university -affiliated teaching hospital, community hospital, emergency department, nursing home/home for the aged, university, research unit, administrative of fice/corporate office, or other), and primary patient population served (inner city, urban/suburban, small town, rural, geographically isolated/remote, cannot identify a primary population, or other) (questions adapted from the National Physician Survey co-sponsored by the Canadian Medical Association, Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, and College of Family Physicians of Canada) (National Physician Survey. College of Family Physicians of Canada 2013). Family and specialist physicians were also asked to specify the year of first medical licensure in Canada. Finally, allied health professionals were asked to specify their profession (registered nurse, occupational therapist, psychologist, social worker, psychoeducator, or other), the year of first professional licensure in Canada, main patient care setting, primary patient population served, amount of clinical training in psychiatry or mental health, and psychothe rapy training, if any. Again, in order to derive an estimate of the number of hours per week of direct contact with patients with mental illness, information about number of patients seen in a typical week, number of patients with mental illness seen in a typical week, and number of hours spent on direct patient care in a typical week, was collected. Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 31 Measures Social distance scale Developed by sociologist Emory Bogardus in the 1920s to measure attitudes toward racial and ethnic minorities in the United S tates (Bogardus 1933), the social distance scale (SDS) was conceived as an empirical tool for measuring a person's willingness to engage in social contacts of varying degrees of intimacy with people from a defined racial or ethnic group. Conceived in its original form as a cumulative scale, wherein agreement with any of the seven items implies agreement with all preceding items (the items are presented in order of increasing social intimacy), the SDS has since been adapted for use in the measurement of attitudes toward a wide range of social groups. A version of the SDS was first used for measurement of attitudes toward people with mental disorders by Cumming and Cumming (1957), who devised several versions of the SDS ranging in length from 5 to 8 items (e.g. \"We should strongly discourage our children from marrying anyone who has been mentally ill\"). Many variants on the original SDS have been developed over the years, most of which ask respondents to indicate desired social distance relative to a vignette condition rather than to an amorphous or umbrella term such as \"mental illness\" (Jorm and Oh 2009). Contemporary versions of the SDS generally employ 5-point Likert scales rather than categorical \"yes/no\" answer keys. Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 32 In this study, the SDS provided an explicit measure of bias capturing aspects of the separation component in Link and Phelan's conceptualization of stigma (Link and Phelan 2001) . The questions comprising the SDS were reproduced from previous large-scale surveys of public attitudes toward mental illness (Pescosolido, Martin et al. 2010). Two short vignettes were presented to the respondent in random order, differing only in the diagnostic label attached to the person described: 1) \"John is a 40-year-old patient with schizophrenia, which is well-controlled on medication.\"; and 2) \"Peter is a 40 -year-old patient with diabetes, which is well-controlled on medication.\" Respondents were asked how willing they would be to have the person described in the vignette: 1) work closely with them on a job; 2) live next door; 3) spend an evening socializing; 4) marry into the family; and 5) as a friend. All responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale (where 1 = \"definitely willing\" and 5 = \"definitely unwilling\") an d summed to provide a measure of social distance. Mean desired social distance was calculated for each vignette condition as the sum of individual responses to the five items on the scale, divided by 5, to yield a score between 1 (least desire for social distance) and 5 (greatest desire for social distance). The vignettes were kept very short to avoid introducing details that might influence the bias associated with the illness label. Hence, \"John\" and \"Peter\" were of identical age, gender, and social status; both were identified as patients, from whom physicians would be expected to desire a degree of social distance in keeping with professionalism standards, irrespective of t he patient's specific diagnosis . Their respective conditions were explicitly described as well- controlled on medication, suggesting both adherence to medical care an d absence of overt symptomatology; and no extraneous information was provided about either's behaviour or social Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 33 or occupational functioning. As a result, respondents had little choice but to conjure their own mental image of a \"typical\" patient with sc hizophrenia or a \"typical\" patient with diabetes when answering questions about desired social distance. Diabetes was chosen as a comparator condition to identify stigma associated with a mental disorder (schizophrenia) rather than with illness severity o r chronicity per se. Both schizophrenia and diabetes are chronic conditions, usually requiring ongoing treatment, and both are understood to have a genetic basis (Hedgecoe 2002). As discussed earlier, schizophrenia has consistently been found to be one of the most highly sti gmatized psychiatric conditions, alongside substance use disorders. Although entirely different in its etiology, symptoms, and treatment, diabetes is also associated with social stigma (Tak-Ying Shiu, Kwan et al. 2003; Weiler and Crist 2009); interestingly, the management of diabetes is largely discussed in terms of \"control\" (of food intake and of blood sugars) and of \"compliance\" (with medications and dietary restrictions), and diabetes-related behaviour, \"in terms that position [patients] as disobedient children, or as wicked or foolish adults\" (Broom and Whittaker 2004). Although vignettes can be criticized for failing to generate \"life -like\" emotions (Collett and Childs 2011), in contrast to laboratory simulations or more complex multimedia probes (e.g. a video of a person discussing his or her diagnosis of schizophrenia), vignettes are efficient, practical, and cost-effective (Hughes and Huby 2002); the label or condition to which the study participant is responding can be more conclusively isolated, and a meaningful association established between the label and the questionnaire responses. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that when people are confronted with a label of chronic mental illness, in the absence of Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 34 other information, \"their default response is to accord the targeted individual with lowered human status\" (Martinez, Piff et al. 2011)\u2014a de facto dehumanization process that is not elicited by a label of chronic physical illness, suggesting a differential evaluation process that is triggered merely by the labels used. Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers The Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC) is a 12-item scale developed specifically to assess the attitudes of health care professionals toward patients with mental illness and toward self-disclosure of a mental illness (Kassam, Papish et al. 2012). In this study, the OMS-HC was used as one of two measures of explicit attitudes . Based on a conceptualization of stigma organized around three core elements of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour, t he scale was constructed with the input of focus groups consisting of health care providers and trainees, as well as people with lived experience of mental illness. The OMS -HC was tested with 787 health care provers and trainees across Canada and showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.82) and only a weak correlation with a measure of social desirability (Kassam, Papish et al. 2012). After factor analysis, the original scale was reduced from 20 to 12 items, resulting in a two-factor structure that accounted for 45% of the variance. The OMS -HC has since been used as a pre-post outcome measure to assess the effectiveness of contact -based education for reducing mental illness stigma in pharmacy students (Patten, Remillard et al. 2012). Respondents are asked to indicate on a 5-point Likert scale (where 1 = \"strongly disagree\" and 5 = \"strongly agree\") their agreement with statements such as \"If a person with a mental illness Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 35 complains of physical symptoms (e.g. nausea, back pain or headache), I would likely attribu te this to their mental illness,\" and \"If I were under treatment for a mental illness I would not disclose this to any of my colleagues .\" The OMS-HC therefore captures aspects of both stereotyping and separation in Link and Phelan's conceptualization of stigma. Mean scores on the OMS-HC were calculated as the sum of individual responses to the 12 items on the scale, with item 12 reverse-scored. Scores for the two subscales defined by Kassam and colleagues (2012) were also calculated, respectively, as the sum of individual responses to items 1 through 7 (attitudes of health care providers towards people with mental illness), and the sum of individual responses to items 8 through 12 (attitudes of health care providers towards disclosure of a mental illness), with item 12 reverse-scored. By addressing subtle aspects of mental illness stigma that are of specific relevance to health care providers, such as attitudes toward self-disclosure of a mental illness, the OMS-HC is an outcome measure complementary to the SDS. The use of two different measures of explicit attitudes\u2014each of which captures distinct facets of mental illness stigma in health care providers\u2014is particularly useful given the study hypothesis that implicit and explicit attitudes are not correlated; this hypothesis can therefore be tested twice . Implicit Association Test An online computerized version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT ) (Greenwald, McGhee et al. 1998), using Inquisit software (Inquisit 2012), was used to assess automatic (unconscious or intuitive) associations to the diagnostic labels \"schizophrenia\" or \"diabetes\". The IAT is a response-time task that requires participan ts to classify word stimuli that appear on their Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 36 computer screen into superordinate categories. Participan ts classify to the left or to the right the items that appear in the lower portion of the screen , while a target category and attribute are paired on either side of the upper portion of the screen. The ease with which participants associate concepts in memory is theorized to reflect automatic associations: when paired target category and attribute labels match a person's automatic associations, response times are expected to be shorter; when paired target category and attribute labels contradict automatic associations, response times are expected to be longer. The IAT may therefore capture implicit stereotyping. The IAT measures relative response rates and hence, requires a comparison condition . To mirror the SDS and to permit explicit and implicit measures to be contrasted, the target categories selected for the IAT were were schizophrenia (\"hallucination,\" \"happy,\" vs . \"terrible,\" \"nasty,\" \"awful\") (see Appendix F for a list of probes for each target category and attribute category). Response times were expected to be faster in the test blocks in which the \"schizophrenia\" category and \"bad\" attributes were paired, compared to the test blocks in which the \"diabetes\" category and \"bad\" attributes were paired. Stimuli were similar to those employed in a previous IAT study, which contrasted \"mental illness\" and \"physical illness\" using attribute categories (Teachman, et al. 2006; Stull, McGrew et al, 2013) . Although other studies have employed more complex attribute pairs (\"helpless\" vs. \"competent,\" \"blameworthy\" vs. \"innocent\") (Teachman, Wilson et al. 2006), the selection of \"bad\" vs. \"good\" attributes was considered a more straightforward approach. Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 37 The IAT administered to study participants was preceded by a practice task, to introduce participants to the IAT interface and ensure adequate understanding of the instructions prior to commencing the actual test. A breakdown of IAT practice blocks and number of trials for each block is provided in Table A. A breakdown of IAT test blocks and number of trials for each block is provided in Table B (blocks 2, 3, 5 and 6 constitute the experimental data; blocks 1 and 4 serve as practice blocks within the actual test). Table A: IAT practice blocks Block Number of trials Function Items assigned to the left-key response Items assigned to the right -key response 1 10 Practice Flower Insect 2 10 Practice Good Bad 3 10 Practice Flower + Good Insect + Bad 4 10 Practice Insect Flower 5 10 Practice Insect + Good Flower + Bad Table B: IAT test blocks Block Number of trials Function Items assigned to the left-key response* Items assigned to the right -key response* 1 20 Practice Diabetes Schizophrenia 2 20 Test Diabetes + Good Schizophrenia + Bad 3 40 Test Diabetes + Good Schizophrenia + Bad 4 20 Practice Schizophrenia Diabetes 5 20 Test Schizophrenia + Good Diabetes + Bad 6 40 Test Schizophrenia + Good Diabetes + Bad * Participants were randomly assigned to begin with Diabetes on the left and Schizophrenia on the right (Schizophrenia paired first with Bad in block 3) or with Schizophrenia on the left and Di abetes on the right (Schizophrenia paired first with Good in block 3). Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 38 IAT results were computed according to the improved scoring algorithm des cribed by Greenwald and colleagues (2003), yielding a D-score for each respondent. The D measure is calculated by dividing the difference between test block means by the standard deviation of all the latencies in the two test blocks. Similar to Cohen's d, the D-score is derived from the division of a difference between means by a standard deviation; however, unlike Cohen's d, which is calculated using a pooled within-treatment standard deviation, the standard deviation in the denominator of D is computed from the scores in both conditions, ignoring the condition membership of each score. The D-score was found to be superior with respect to the magnitude of implicit -explicit correlation, resistance to contamination by response speed differences, and resistance to the IAT - score-reducing effect of prior experience with the IAT. The improved algorithm includes the use of practice-block data, error penalties, and individual-respondent standard deviations to provide the measure's scale unit (Greenwald, Nosek et al. 2003). Negative D scores indicate preference for diabetes over schizophrenia (more stigmatizing implicit attitudes), while positive scores indicate preference for schizophrenia over diabetes (less stigmatizing implicit attitudes). IAT D - scores between 0.15 and 0.35 indicate slight preference; between 0.35 and 0.65, moderate preference; and greater than 0.65, strong preference. Study design Consent to access electronic mailing lists was obtained from the participating organizations and all members were sent an e-mail invitation to participate in the study by visiting the website . Study invitations were bilingual, and respondents could complete the study in English or French. Study materials were translated by a qualified medical translator and proofread b y three Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 39 psychiatrists fluent in both languages and familiar with the content of the study. The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Jewish General Hospital (Montreal, Canada), and informed consent was obtained online from all participants. Participants who responded to the email invitation followed a link to the study site. After selecting the language in which they wished to complete the study, respondents were asked to provide informed consent (Appendix A), then demographic data (Appendix B). Participants were randomized either to complete the IAT first or to complete explicit measures first (for a graphical outline of the study design, see Appendix G) . To familiarize the participant with the IAT interface, the study IAT was preceded by a practice task consisting of a short IAT in which target categories \"insect\" and \"flower\" were paired with positive and negative attributes. Within the explicit measures, respondents were randomized either to complete the SDS in response to the schizophrenia vignette first, or the SDS in response to the diabetes vignette first. After completing both SDS, respondents were asked to complete the OMS -HC. After completing all sections of the survey, respondents were provided the opportunity to leave comments about the study and their contact information if they wished to receive information about its findings. They were also provided with a link to an accredited Canadian Medical Association (CMA) Continuing Medical Education (CME) module on \"Combating Stigma for Physicians and Other Health Professionals\" (cma.ca/stigma). The entire process of completing the study took 10 to 15 minutes. Data analysis Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 40 Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample. SDS and OMS-HC scores were computed, and IAT D-scores generated (using the improved scoring algorithm), as described above. Independent variables (including age, number of years in practice, level of residency training, and patient contact) and dependent variables (SDS, OMS -HC, and IAT scores) were assessed for normal distribution by visual inspection of their histograms and norma l Q-Q plots, and by Shapiro-Wilk's test. Cronbach's alpha was calculated for the SDS and OMS -HC scales (as well as OMS-HC subscales), to check for internal consistency. In order to examine associations between age, number of hours of direct patient care per week (hereafter referred to as \"patient contact\"), number of years in practice or number of years in training (for psychiatrists and residents, respectively), and the four outcome measures ( SDS- SCZ, SDS-DM, OMS-HC, and IAT parametric and Spearman's rho for nonparametric variables were used to examine the bivariate relationship between predictor and dependent variables. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to identify demographic and other predictors of the dependent measures of explicit (SDS, OMS-HC) and implicit (IAT) bias. Normality of residuals was assessed for each of the regressions by visual inspection of their histograms and normal P-P plots. SPSS Statistics version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for the analysis. Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 41 Results Participant demographics A total of 198 respondents (64 from the McGill University Department of Psychiatry, 134 from the membership of the Canadian Psychiatric Association) accessed the survey online. 126 consented to participate in the survey , and of these, 107 respondents completed the entire survey (41 from McGill, yielding a response rate of 12.1%; 66 from the CPA, yielding a response rate of 3.3%): 68 psychiatrists, 35 residents in psychiatry, 3 allied health professionals, and 1 medical student. Only data from respondents who completed the entire survey were considered for analysis. To preserve the homogeneity of the study sample, and because 2 of the se 4 respondents appeared to have categorized themselves incorrectly, data from the 3 allied health professionals and the 1 medical student were excluded from the analysis, resulting in a final N = 103 (38 from McGill, 65 from CPA). Demographic characteristics of the 10 3 respondents included in the analysis are summarized in Table 1. Age was normally distributed for psychiatrists but not for residents, as assessed by a Shapiro-Wilk's test (p > 0.05 for psychiatrists, p < 0.001 for residents). The number of hours of direct patient care per week was normally distributed for both psychiatrists and residents, as assessed by a Shapiro-Wilk's test (p > 0.05). The number of years in practice (psychiatrists only) was not normally distributed, nor was the number of years in training (residents only), as assessed by a Shapiro-Wilk's test (p < 0.05). Information on practice setting and primary population served was not collected from residents given the variable and time-limited nature of work settings during residency rotations. Mann-Whitney U test and Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 42 independent samples t test were conducted to determine, respectively, if there were differences in mean age and mean number of hours of direct patient care per week between residents and psychiatrists; Chi-square tests for association were conducted to assess for statistically significant associations between respondent type (resident vs. psychiatrists) and gender, sample source, mother tongue, language of study participation, province or territory, country of birth, and country of medical training. Demographic characteristics of the respondents are summarized in Table 1. Residents were significantly younger than psychiatrists (U = 2,304.00, z = 7.761, p < 0.001) and more likely to be from Quebec ( 2(1, N = 103) = 25.67, p < 0.001); gender distribution, country of medical training, and mean number of hours of direct patient contact per week (hereafter referred to as \"patient contact\") did not differ significantly between residents and psychiatrists. Participating psychiatrists were disproportionately based at university -affiliated teaching hospitals (52.9%, compared to 21.7% of participating psychiatrists in the National Physician Survey, 2013) (National Physician Survey. College of Family Physicians of Canada 2013) , and over three quarters (77.9%) reported serving an inner -city, urban, or suburban patient population. Information on practice setting and population served was not collected for residents, who were predominantly working in urban, university-affiliated teaching hospitals.

Mean scores and standard deviations on the social distance scale are reported in Table 2. SDS scores for the schizophrenia vignette were normally distributed for residents but not for psychiatrists, as assessed by a Shapiro-Wilk's test (p > 0.05 for residents, p < 0.001 for psychiatrists). SDS scores for the diabetes vignette were not normally distributed for either the resident or the psychiatrist respondent groups, as assessed by a Shapiro - Wilk's test (p < 0.001 for both). Mann-Whitney U tests were run to determine if there were differences between residents and psychiatrists in desired social distance from the schizophrenia patient and in desired social distance from the diabetes patient; no significant differences were found. SDS applied to schizophrenia vignette (hereafter referred to as SDS -SCZ) scores were significantly greater than SDS applied to diabetes vignette (hereafter referred to as SDS -DM) scores in both residents (z = -4.64, p < 0.001) and psychiatrists (z = -6.30, p < 0.001), as determined by a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC) Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 45 The OMS-HC had adequate internal consistency, as determined by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.720 in English and 0.776 in French. Mean scores and standard deviations on the OMS -HC and its subscales are reported in Table 2. OMS -HC scores were normally distributed for both residents and psychiatrists, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk's test (p > 0.05). An independent-samples t test was run to determine if there were differences between residents and psychiatrists in full -scale and subscale scores on the OMS-HC; no significant differences were found. Implicit Association Test IAT results were computed according to the improved scoring algorithm described by Greenwald and colleagues (2003), yielding a D-score for each respondent. Mean D-scores and standard deviations for each respondent group are presented in Table 2. D-scores were normally distributed for both residents and psychiatrists, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk's test (p > 0.05). An independent-samples t test was run to determine if there were differences between residents and psychiatrists on IAT D-scores; no difference was found. To assess whether the order of presentation of categories within the IAT (\"Schizophrenia + Good\" presented first vs. \"Schizophrenia + Bad\" presented first) and the order of presentation of implicit and explicit measures (IAT presented first vs. SDS and OMS -HC presented first) had any effect on the responses, a two-way ANOVA was conducted with the D-score as the dependent variable and the two order o f presentation variables as fixed factors. There were no significant effects on IAT D-scores in either the resident or the psychiatrist respondent groups. A hierarchical multiple regression was also run to predict D -scores from the two order of Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 46 presentation variables (order of presentation of categories within the IAT and order of presentation of implicit and explicit measures), controlling for age and sex. The order of presentation variables did not statistically significantly predict D-scores for residents, for psychiatrists, or for the two groups combined. Table 2.

Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 47 A positive correlation was found between SDS-SCZ and SDS-DM in residents (r = 0.56, p < 0.001) and in psychiatrists (r = 0.57, p < 0.001). SDS-SCZ and OMS-HC scores were also positively correlated in both resident ( r = 0.37, p = 0.03) and psychiatrist (r = 0.50, p < 0.001) samples; however, SDS-DM and OMS-HC scores were not correlated in either respondent group. For residents, the IAT D-score was not significantly correlated to any variable. For psychiatrists, the IAT D-score showed a small negative correlation with age (r = -0.29, p = 0.014) and a small positive correlation with patient contact (r = 0.27, p = 0.026) but no correlation to any explicit measures of stigma.

Demographic predictors under initial consideration included age, gender, and country of medical training. Because number of years in practice was very strongly correlated with age (psychiatrist respondents only), age alone was selected as a predictor in the regression models, to avoid issues of collinearity. Models incorporating country of medical Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 50 training as a predictor were ultimately discarded as this variable did not contribute to the variance for any of the dependent variables examined. A hierarchical multiple regression was run to determine if the addition of patient contact and IAT D-score improved the prediction of SDS-SCZ over and above age, gender, and employment type (resident vs. psychiatrist) alone (see Table 4.1). The full model of age, gender, employment type, patient contact, and IAT D -score to predict SDS scores was not statistically significant, R 2 = 0.032, F(5, 97) = 0.638, p = 0.671; adjusted R2 = -0.018.

Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 55 Discussion Explicit and implicit attitudes tow ard mental illness The current study reports on the explicit and implicit attitudes toward mental illness among a sample of Canadian psychiatrists and psychiatry residents . Although there is evidence supporting the existence of implicit biases against mental illness in studies of the general population and of professionals (Teachman, Wilson et al. 2006; Takahashi, Ideno Todd et al. 2010; Omori, Tateno et al. 2012), this study failed to support the hypothesis that psychiatrists and psychiatry residents harbour negative implicit associations to schizophrenia as compared to diabetes. Robust evidence of implicit biases was not established in either residents or psychiatrists. Although IAT scores were negative in an absolute sense, mean D scores (-0.028 for residents, -0.118 for psychiatrists) fell short of representing even a small effect size\u2014generally considered to be between -0.15 and -0.35\u2014reflective of greater negative associations to schizophrenia. Nonetheless, relatively negative attitudes were detected in explicit measures of stigma. Both residents and psychiatrists reported a significantly grea ter desire for social distance from the vignette depicting a patient with schizophrenia, even in the absence of any description of concerning behaviour (e.g. disorganization or hostility), and in spite of the patient's schizophrenia being described as well-controlled on medication. This finding is consistent with several published reports of mental health care professionals' attitudes toward mental illness (Kingdon, Sharma et al. 2004; Lauber, Anthony et al. 2004; Gr ausgruber, Meise et al. 2007; Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 56 Loch, Guarniero et al. 2013) and with two reviews of the literature around mental health care professionals and stigma (Schulze 2007; Wahl and Aroesty-Cohen 2010). Of note, desired social distance from the vignette patient with schizophrenia was moderately correlated with desired social distance from the vignette p atient with diabetes, suggesting that clinicians have different levels of comfort with engaging in social relationships with any person identified as a patient, irrespective of diagnosis. This finding of some explicit bias but no implicit bias may reflect limitations of the IAT measure devised for this study. Other studies have employed emotionally charged attribute pairs for the IAT task, for instance, \"blameworthy\" vs. \"innocent\" and \"helpless\" vs. \"competent\" 2006), vs. et al. 2012), and \"guilty\" vs. \"innocent\" (Rusch, Todd et al. 2010), which relate directly to commonly held stereotypes of mental illness . In this study, generic positive (e.g. \"peace,\" \"happy\") and negative (e.g. \"awful,\" \"horrible\") attributes were used, and their lesser emotional valence may have decreased the sensitivity of the IAT to implicit bias. The negative IAT results may also be explained by the small sample size. Given a paucity of published reports using the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Professionals (OMS-HC), a relatively new instrument (Kassam, Papish et al. 2012), and given that one of two published studies utilized the 20-item version of the questionnaire, rather than the 12-item version employed in this study, it is difficult to compare OMS-HC scores in this study to mean scores in other populations. The study that used the 20-item OMS-HC as a pre-post assessment tool in the context of a stigma reduction interventi on in pharmacy students reported Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 57 mean OMS-HC scores at intake of 46.5 and 47.8 in the two groups studied (out of a maximum possible score of 100) (Patten, Remillard et al. 2012). In Kassam and colleagues' (2012) original publication, the authors note that the mean total score for the 20 -item scale was 57.5 (out of a maximum possible score of 100), while the mean total score for the 12 -item scale was 27.0 (out of a maximum possible score of 60). In this study, mean total scores on the OMS-HC were somewhat lower: 24.4 (residents) and 22.9 (psychiatrists). This may reflect a bias in study participants, who may be more aware of the problem of stigma and hold less stigmatizing attitudes themselves. Interestingly, scores on SDS-SCZ and on the OMS-HC were significantly correlated, and SDS - SCZ was a predictor of OMS-HC scores, suggesting that the two instruments tap into related or overlapping constructs. This provides further evidence for the construct validity of the OMS -HC. This is of particular significance given the relative novelty of the OMS -HC and the fact that it was specifically conceived for health care professionals . The OMS-HC assesses negative stereotypes of mental illness that are considered salient to health care professionals (e.g. that patients with mental illness are not trying hard enough to get better, that there is little that health care professionals can do to help them, etc.), as well as attitudes toward self-disclosure of a mental illness. Here, the moderate to strong correlation between SDS -SCZ and OMS-HC scores suggests that labeling (inherent to the very notion of diagnosis), stereotyping (the association of negative characteristics to all patients labeled with mental illness), and separation (reflected both by greater desired social distance from persons with a mental illness, and greater reluctance to self-disclose a mental illness, which would effectively collapse the divide between \"us\"\u2014the Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 58 health care professionals \u2014and \"them\"\u2014the mentally ill) are powerful and closely inter-related components of stigma in mental health professionals . As hypothesized, implicit and explicit attitudes were not correlated for residents or psychiatrists. This finding is consistent with a number of other studies of explicit and implicit attitudes toward stigmatized conditions such as obesity (Bessenoff and Sherman 2000; Teachman, Gapinski et al. 2003) and mental illness (Teachman, al. 2006; Peris, Teachman et al. 2008; Tateno et al. 2012), and concordant with a meta-analysis on the correlation between the I AT and explicit self-report measures (Hofmann, Gawronski et al. 2005) and a review of explicit and implicit stigma against individuals with mental illness (Stier and Hinshaw 2007). The presence of a social desirability bias would predict neutral or positive explicit attitude scores (reflecting participants' efforts to provide answers that they deem to be sociall y acceptable) and negative implicit attitude scores (reflecting underlying negative associations that are presumably difficult to mask or manipulate). However, contrary to expectations, study participants reported greater explicit stigma toward a vignette patient with schizophrenia compared to a vignette patient with diabetes, while implicit measures revealed no bias in favour of diabetes over schizophrenia. Explicit stigma as measured by the OMS-HC appeared roughly comparable to, and even slightly lower than, mean scores in other health care professional groups (Kassam, Papish et al. 2012; Patten, Remillard et al. 2012). Theoretical explanations for low correlations between ex plicit and implicit measures include motivational biases in explicit self-reports and lack of introspective access to implicitly assessed representations (Hofmann, Gawronski et al. 2005). As mentioned, the presence of a social Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 59 desirability bias would predict findings opposite to those of this study (i.e. relatively negative implicit attitudes alongside neutral o r positive explicit attitudes); so would respondents' inability to access implicitly negative representations of mental illness. Hofmann and colleagues (Hofmann, Gawronski et al. 2005) note that correlations between explicit and implicit attitudinal measures increase as a function of increasing spontaneity of self -reports and increasing conceptual correspondence between measures ; explicit-implicit correlations are higher for affective as compared to cognitive self-report measures, and for relative as compared to absolute self-report measures. Although the OMS-HC is not a relative measure, the SDS could be considered a relative measure, analogous to the IAT, in that the same social distance scale is applied to two vignette patients identical in ever y respect except for diagnosis (thus allowing a relative assessment of desired social distance). Both the SDS-SCZ and OMS-HC are more cognitively oriented measures, assessing affective responses at best indirectly. Discordant explicit and implicit attitudes may also be explained by the fact that the underlying constructs being measured by the two approaches are in fact completely independent (Hofmann, Gawronski et al. 2005). In this study, hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that IAT scores predicted neither SDS-SCZ nor OMS-HC scores. No significant predictors were found for SDS-SCZ scores, while age negatively predicted, and SDS-SCZ scores positively predicted, OMS-HC scores. (SDS-SCZ scores were included as a potential predictor in the multiple regression model for OMS-HC scores in order to better elucidate the relationship between the OMS-HC, a new instrument, and a time-tested measure of stigma, the SDS-SCZ.) Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 60 Furthermore, patient contact (respondents' self-reported mean number of hours of direct patient contact per week) positively predicted IAT scores , but did not predict SDS-SCZ or OMS-HC scores. In other words, the more time a res pondent spent providing direct patient care each week, the more likely he or she was to display relatively more positive implicit attitudes, when age, gender, and employment type (resident vs. physician) were controlled ; no such effect was found for explicit attitudes. Age is a not a statistically significant predictor of IAT scores in a hierarchical multiple regression analysis ; however, age negatively predicted OMS-HC scores (i.e. the older the respondent, the less stigmatizing the explicit attitudes as m easured by the OMS-HC). This suggests that implicit and explicit measures are tapping into unrelated constructs in this study population. Why doesn't experience matter? Although comparing residents and psychiatrists was not a primary goal, this study found no difference in explicit or implicit attitudes between psychiatrists and psychiatry residents. If exposure to people with mental illness is theorized to decrease stigma, w hy doesn't experience matter? Peris and colleagues (2008) observed that study participants with clinical training and experience in mental health (psychologists, counselors, social workers, and other mental health professionals) had relatively more implicit positivity toward people with mental illness than did any of the other groups studied (comparison groups included the general public, undergraduates, and other health and social services professionals); at the same time, they noted that graduate students within the mental health clinician sample had somewhat more positive associations to mental illness than did fully trained mental health professionals, which ran counter to their study Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 61 hypothesis that greater exposure to mental illness would increase the positivity of implicit attitudes. The authors hypothesized that the nature of the contact between mental health professionals and people with mental illness, being \"unequal \" (Peris, Teachman et al. 2008), did not promote increasingly positive implicit attitudes over time. Several explanations for the absence of significant differences in explicit and implicit attitudes between psychiatrists and residents warrant consideration. First, residents (mean age: 31.8 years) and psychiatrists (mean age: 57.3 years) in this study represent different generations of practitioners. Although public attitudes toward mental illness may not have shifted substantially over the past several years (Pescosolido, Martin et al. 2010), contemporary psychiatry residents are coming of age in a very different, post-deinstitutionalization practice environment , in which patient rights, patient autonomy, and equal partnership in clinical decision -making are emphasized. The perception of interpersonal contact as cooperative vs. competitive was found to be one of the mediators of the relationship between contact and stigma reduction (Couture and Penn 2003). The theorized positive effect of greater cumulative patient exposure on psychiatrists' attitudes may therefore be counterbalanced by qualitative differences in the nature of residents' (perhaps more cooperative) contact with their patients , accounting for an overall lack of difference in attitudes between residents and psychiatrists. This hypothesis would need to be further explored via qualitative research methods, such as resident and psychiatrist focus groups or direct observation and analysis of resident-patient interactions and psychiatrist-patient interactions. Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 62 Other factors appear to mediate the relationship between interpersonal contact and stigma reduction: equal status, level of intimacy, voluntary nature of the contact, perception of the experience as pleasant, and perception of the experience as cooperative vs. competitive (Couture and Penn 2003). It is possible that residents' lower standing in the health care hierarchy contributes to a perception of more equal status with patients, resulting in more positive interpersonal contact and more positive attitudes. Additionally, residents are generally allotted more time with each patient, and may experience fewer time pressures and less associated stress than practicing psychiatrists, resulting in patient experiences that are more likely to be perceived as pleasant. Other potential demographic predictors of stigma, such as a personal or family history of a mental illness, were not measured in this study, and may also account for some of the variation between individual respondents and between residents and psychiatrist s as respondent groups. Finally, as discussed in the Limitations section, below, the residents who participated in this study were disproportionately drawn from a single training program, and the generalizability of any comparisons between residents and psychiatrists is invariably limited by the bias in the study sample; a broader study sample, comprised of an adequate number of trainees from multiple residency programs, would be needed to replicate and generalize this study's finding that explicit and implicit attitudes do not differ between residents and psychiatrists. Putting the contact hypothesis to the test Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 63 In this study, respondents' self-reported mean number of hours of direct patient contact per week significantly positively predicted IAT scores, when age, gender and employment type (resident vs. psychiatrist) were statistically controlled. In other words, the more time a respondent spent providing direct patient care each week, the more positive his or her IAT score, reflecting more positive associations to schizophrenia relative to diabetes . It is important to note that patient contact is not correlated with age or with number of years in practice, and n o statistically significant difference was found between mean number of hours of patient contact per week in residents vs. psychiatrists. In other words, the amount of time a clinician spent seeing patients on an average week was not determined by employme nt status (resident vs. psychiatrist), age, or number of years in practice. Given the cross -sectional nature of the data, cumulative patient contact is impossible to determine, as practice profiles change over the course of the professional lifespan, and residency rotations afford varying levels of patient contact. Moreover, the resident sample was too small to determine whether level of training was associated with patient contact. Nevertheless, the data suggest that patient contact is a variable that is independent of age, employment type, and years in practice, and that positively predicts IAT scores. The greater the amount of interpersonal contact, the greater the perceived variability among individuals of the stigmatized group (Couture and Penn 2003), supporting the notion that viewing members of a stigmatized group as individuals is key to fostering more positive attitudes. Conversely, there is experimental evidence suggesting that the implicit evaluation of individuals from a given group generalizes more rapidly to all individuals from the same group, whereas \"deliberative logic\" (i.e. the conscious recognition that individual group members are not necessarily the same) reduces the capacity for generalization of explicit attitudes (Ranganath Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 64 and Nosek 2008). This may help explain why patient contact predicted more positive implicit attitudes but did not predict explicit attitud es. The relationship between patient contact and implicit attitudes raises a causal priority question: do physicians develop more positive implicit associations because they see more patients, or do physicians with more positive implicit associations at baseline simply see more patients, perhaps because they find the work more enjoyable and less stressful? Putting the contact hypothesis to the test would require a larger and more diverse population of physicians with differing specialties and varying levels of contact with mentally ill patients would need to be studied. In the current study, while there was a range of reported mean weekly hours of patient contact, all participants were psychiatrists and psychiatry residents with high levels of contact with the mentally ill. Given the preponderance of mental health problems in primary care settings, an obvious next step would be to study family physicians' implicit and explicit attitudes toward the mentally ill as a function of their level of contact with mentally ill patients in their practice. In light of the \"chicken-and-egg\" question just raised, it would also be of interest to study the evolution of trainees' implicit and explicit attitudes over the course of resid ency training. Do incoming residents with more positive implicit associations at baseline tend to report a greater amount of patient contact? How do implicit and explicit attitudes evolve over the course of training? The same research methods could also be applied to medical students prior and subsequent to their core clinical clerkship in psychiatry, and to evaluating the effectiveness of contact-based, anti-stigma pedagogical interventions in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 65 Developing behavioural and psychophysiological measures of stigma A challenge inherent to the use of implicit attitudinal measures is the difficulty of interpreting their significance. Implicit measures may more reliably predict automatic, non -verbal behaviours, such as eye contact, verbal slips, and other subtle avoidance behaviours (Stone and Moskowitz 2011); in a study of attitudes toward obese persons, Bessenoff and Sherman (2000) noted that implicit attitudes predict ed how far participants chose to sit from an obese woman, whereas explicit attitudinal measures were not correlated with behavioural choices. Other innovative approaches to measuring unconscious attitudes have focused on psychophysiological changes in response to labels of mental illness (Graves, Cassisi et al. 2005), showing that increases in physiological reactivity predicted greater d esire for social distance. Clearly, a multimodal approach to the assessment of implicit attitudes, explicit attitudes, behavioural choices, and psychophysiological changes would provide the most coherent strategy for assessing stigma. Moreover, the incorporation of a behavioural outcome in any future research protocol would shed light on links between implicit stigma and clinical care, clarifying how implicit attitudes might play out in the clinical encounter. The choice of an appropriate behavioural o utcome may be challenging, however; for instance, physicians (especially psychiatrists) may choose to sit farther from a patient identified as having schizophrenia because of extensive safety training that reflects real and pragmatic concerns in hospital-based care in particular, where agitated patients are regularly encountered in emergency departments and inpatient settings. Other studies have focused on clinical decision -making as a behavioural outcome (Green, Carney et al. 2007; Haider, Sexton et al. 2011); clinical decision-Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 66 making appears to function well as a behavioural outcome when the decision in question is fairly stark (e.g. provision of a specific treatment, such as thrombolysis for myocardial infarction), and it is questionable whether typically complex psychiatric treatments might lend themselves to such a black-and-white assessment. We were unable to collect information about whether respondents followed the link to the CME module on stigma, but this could represent a meaningful behavioural outcome and future study direction. Limitations Several factors limit the generalizability of these data. First, response rates were very low, even for a web-based survey (12.1% with in the McGill sample and 3.3% with in the CPA sample), raising significant concerns about selection bias. Of note, although 198 respondents accessed the survey online, only 126 consented to participate (of whom 107 went on to complete the entire study, and data from 103 were considered for the analysis); it is not possible to determine whether \"consenters\" and \"completers\" systematically differ from initial respondents with respect to demographic or other determinants. We were unable to compare the demographics of respondents to non-respondents as neither participating organization could provide information about age and sex distribution of their membership. It is likely that the relatively small number of physicians who chose to participate in this study had a pre-existing interest in the issue of mental illness stigma, perhaps due to a greater capacity for self -reflection on their own attitudes toward patients, recognition of their colleagues' negative attitudes toward people with mental illness, heightened awareness of their patients' reports of stigma and discrimination within the health care system, a history of personal or family experiences with mental illness, or a pre-existing Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 67 academic or research interest in the manifestations and repercussions of stigma. Their attitudes may not be representative of Canadian psychiatrists and psychiatry residents at large; if anything, one might reasonably hypothesize that respondents' attitudes are on average more positive, in the context of a greater awareness of the problem posed by stigma and perhaps a greater interest in contributing to solutions. Second, the sample is not geographically representative of Canadian psychiatrists and psychiatry residents. Participating psychiatrists were disproportionately based at university-affiliated teaching hospitals (52.9%) and in inner-city (19.1%) or urban/suburban (58.8%) environments. According to the National Physician Survey, 2013 (National Physician Survey. College of Family Physicians of Canada 2013), 21.7% of participating psychiatrists reported working in an academic health sciences centre; the majority of psychiatrists reported being based in inner -city (14.7%) and urban/suburban (61%) environments. It is difficult to generalize the study's findings to psychiatrists working in private practices, community clinics, or community hospitals, or in rural or remote regions\u2014settings in which patient demographics, diagnoses, access to services, and severity of impairment may vary widely. Exposure to multidisciplinary teams and non - psychiatric medical colleagues, and participation in continuing medical education activities and postgraduate teaching activities , would also be expected to vary substantially in patient care settings outside of university-affiliated teaching hospitals. Participating psychiatry residents were overwhelmingly based in Quebec and enrolled in a single training program, McGill University (80.0%), and therefore disproportionately exposed to one residency curriculum and one set of mentors and supervisors. This may limit the generalizability Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 68 of their results to other psychiatry residents in Canada, as well as the ability to make direct comparisons between psychiatrists (66.2% these limitations, the participa nts in this study represent a diverse group of physicians, with a roughly equal gender distribution and a sizable minority (roughly 1 in 5) of international medical graduates. Third, although the study materials were translated professionally by a qualified medical translator and proofread by three psychiatrists fluent in both languages and famil iar with the content of the study, and although the translated scales showed good reliability in both English and French, there are subtleties of language that could theoretically limit comparisons between English- and French-language respondents, particularly with respect to the IAT. The reliability of IAT results in a participant whose mother tongue is neither English nor French is also unknown. Fourth, technical issues related to the Inquisit software's incompatibility with Mac operating systems limited the response rate and may have contributed to a bias in the study demographics ; however, the directionality of this potential bias is impossible to elucidate. Multiple would-be respondents contacted the first author after recruitment emails were dissemina ted, reporting that although they wished to participate, they were unable to do so because their personal or home computers were not Windows-based and they did not have the time or the ability to complete the study during work hours. Indeed, the length of the study (estimated at 10 to 15 minutes) may have proven a significant deterrent independent of the compatibility issue. Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 69 Moral experience and stigma in health care settings: conclusions and future directions Conversations about stigma too often neglect the moral dimensions of stigma and what one author has termed \"the contextual dynamics of labeling\" (Hill 2010). An ethnographic meta- analysis from three nursing units revealed that the tendency to stereotype, make moral judgments, and behave coercively increased in a group of nurses facing time pressures and limited resources, in keeping with an \"ideology of scarcity\" (Varcoe, Rodney et al. 2003). In this context, care is delivered to the deserving; labeling, stereotyping, and other elements of stigmatizing behaviour serve a moral function, to alleviate the \"moral distress\" experienced by health care professionals in the face of structural and interpersonal constraints in the workplace that prevent them from fulfilling their \"mora l intentions\" to provide adequate treatment to all patients (Varcoe, Rodney et al. 2003). Yang and colleagues (2007) expanded the discussion of stigma to include the concept of \"moral experience, or what is most at stake for acto rs in a local social world,\" hypothesizing that stigma \"exerts its core effects by threatening the loss or diminution of what is most at stake, or by actually diminishing or destroying that lived value.\" Stigma, the authors bluntly state, \"threatens moral standing\" (Yang, Kleinman et al. 2007); and nowhere is the threat more urgent than in physicians, including psychiatrists, struggling with their own mental health problems . Indeed, it is difficult to discuss the attitudes of physicians toward mental illness without addressing the problem of self-stigma amongst physicians and other health care professionals. Psychiatrists may be reluctant to seek appropriate care for mental health problems (Davis, Detre et al. 2003), may prefer to self-medicate their depression (Balon 2007), and may demonstrate a reluctance to take Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 70 the very psychotropic medications that they prescribe (Rettenbacher, Burns et al. 2004). As Kay Redfield Jamison (Jamison 2006) so eloquently quoted in an essay, published in The Lancet, about the repercussions of disclosing her bipolar disorder diagnosis: \"Yet why not say what happened?\" Future directions for stigma research in physicians must address the complex interplay between explicit attitudes, implicit attitudes, moral judgment, and self -stigma. Operationalizing stigma as an \"intersubjective\" phenomenon (Yang, Kleinman et al. 2007), studying the evolution of stigmatizing attitudes over the course of medical and psychiatric training, qualifying the impact of personal and family histories of mental illness on physician attitudes, deconstructing the relationship between patient contact and attitudinal measures, and incorporating meaningful behavioural outcome measures into the study of stigma, are essential steps in establishing a research base for the development of effective, evidence-based stigma reduction education for physicians. The ultimate goal of attention to stigma among health care providers is to create a health care system that is more welcoming, respectful, and humane to patients with a mental illness. Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 71 Appendix A: Consent Form SMBD - Jewish General Hospital Department of Psychiatry Principal investigator: Laurence Kirmayer, MD, FRCPC Student researcher: Layla Dabby, MD Dear physician, You are being invited to participate in a research study designed to look at Canadian physicians' attitudes towards people with mental illness. You have the right to know about the p urpose of this study and the procedures that are to be used, and to be informed about the potential benefits, risks, compensation and discomfort associated with participating. This study is being undertaken in partnership with the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC) and the Stigma-Discrimination Working Group of the Canadian Psychiatric Association, and under the supervision of Dr. Laurence Kirmayer, chair of the Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry at McGill University. The stigma of mental illness is a widespread social reality, and represents a significant public health challenge for all physicians involved in the care of people with mental health problems. Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 72 Because of stigma, people with mental health problems may delay seeking treatme nt or discontinue treatment; they may have difficulties securing housing and employment; and they may receive less adequate general medical care. Life expectancy for people with severe mental illness is decreased by as many as 15 years compared to the general population, and most excess mortality is due to coronary heart disease (both due to increased prevalence of risk factors and suboptimal preventive care and treatment). This study is the first of its kind in Canada and aims to assess the attitudes of family physicians, psychiatrists, pediatricians and emergency physicians toward people with mental illness. In this study, you will be asked to asked to read brief case vignettes and answer a few questions about the person described; you will also be asked to complete a short questionnaire assessing general attitudes and beliefs about mental illness. You will also be asked to complete an Implicit Association Test (IAT) which assesses the strength of association between mental illness and various positive and negative attributes. After providing some demographic information, you will be directed to complete the two sections described above. The survey is web-based, can be completed from any computer with Internet access, and should take 20 minutes to complete. Potential risks associated with this study are minimal. This survey is anonymous and confidential. However, the stigma of mental illness is a sensitive topic and some physicians may Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 73 feel discomfort at the notion that the society -wide problem of stigma could affect health professionals as well. The benefits of participating in this study are numerous. As stated previously, this is the first Canada-wide study of physicians' attitudes toward mental illness. It may inform future studies of health professionals' (including medical students' and residents') attitudes, as well as guide the development of educational initiatives designed to improve the health care received by people with mental illness. At the end of the survey, you may voluntarily choose to provide your contact information. Providing your contact information will allow the Mental Health Commission of Canada to contact you at a later date and invite you to participate in a Continuing Medical Education module on mental illness stigma. Providing your contact information is entirely optional. Your participation in this study is voluntary and you may choose to stop your participation at any time. If you withdraw (or are withdrawn) from this study, any information collected up to the point of withdrawal for the purpose of this research may still be used in order to protect the scientific integrity of the study. All information obtained about you during this research will be treated confidentially within the limits of the law. This information will be collected anonymously and encrypted. Any encrypted information can only be accessed by the principal investigator or a person authorized by the principal investigator.

If a person with a mental illness complains of physical symptoms (e.g. nausea, back pain or headache), I would likely attribute this to their mental illness. Despite my professional beliefs, I have negative reactions towards people who have mental illness. There is little I can do to help people with menta l illness. More than half of people with mental illness don't try hard enough to get better. Healthcare providers do not need to be advocates for people with mental illness. I struggle to feel compassion for a person with a mental illness. If I were under treatment for a mental illness I would not disclose this to any of my colleagues. Explicit and Implicit Attitudes of Canadian Psychiatrists Toward People With Mental Illness 83 I would be more inclined to seek help for a mental illness if my treating healthcare provider was not associated with my workplace. I would see myself as weak if I had a mental illness and could not fix it myself. I would be reluctant to seek help if I had a mental illness. If I had a mental illness, I would tell my friends.

The IAT measures implicit attitudes, based on the idea that the more strongly two concepts are associated, the faster you can sort them into paired categories. This IAT tests how quickly you can categorize schizophrenia with negative words, compared to how quickly you can categorize diabetes with negative words. Your result describes your implicit positivity or negativity toward schizophrenia as compared to diabetes; it also describes the strength of this positive or negative association. Implicit associations lie outside conscious control, and are thought to reflect personal experiences as well as the beliefs and attitudes prevalent in society. Unfortunately, the stigma around mental illness is a social reality, which represents a significant public health challenge for all physicians involved in the care of people with mental health problems.
