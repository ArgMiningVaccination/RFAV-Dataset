Are you saying YES to that? Are you standing still? Are you opening the gate to move forward? I started today early this morning sitting in my backyard with a lovely cup of coffee .. and built a fire and then remembered this: THIRTY TWO years ago today Haider, Reemy and I left (everything behind) Baghdad, Iraq, the cradle of civilization, and immigrated to America with only our spring clothes and $750 and no credit history! Being an immigrant is not for the faint of heart. There is much to adjust to. Here are the top 10 biggest cultural \"shocks\" - not what you would expect: #1. American homes don't have bidets. #2. Obesity. #3. Long nails with rhinestones. #4. Fat-free diet and iced water. #5. Single serving portions were and still are massive, can feed a family of four. #6. Friends had to schedule an event to get together. Only solicitors knocked at your door unexpectedly. #7. Americans work longer hours than they socialize. #8. Abortion was and is still a hot debate. #9. Football is not Soccer. #10. There is a bread isle with hundreds of different types of bread. TOP 10 things I loved about America that were taken for granted by every American I met: #1. Freedom of speech. #2. Freedom of choice. #3. Freedom of expression. #4. Freedom of the multitude of ways to live our lives. #5. Freedom of religion. #6. Freedom to travel without restrictions. #7. Freedom of bodily autonomy. #8. Freedom to disagree. #9. Freedom to bare arms. #10. Generosity of Spirit. What an incredible journey this has been. I am proud to be an American by choice. My family and I are grateful for friendships, opportunities, support and lots of love and beauty. This picture of me taken at Chaco Canyon sitting representing saying YES to a gateway. As a small business owner, I'm re-envisioning my 22 years of acupuncture practice and in the process of making this new vision a reality. A grand re-opening coming soon and I hope to see you. Stay tuned. In love and "}
