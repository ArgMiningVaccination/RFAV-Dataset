High uptake of the COVID -19 vaccine is among the most promising strategies to reduce the burden of disease and control the pandemic. However, misconceptions of the vaccine, mistrust in the health system, and lack of access to health services may impede confidence in the vaccine and ultimately uptake, particularly among underserved communities disproportionately affected by COVID -19. As community health workers, you play a critical role in mitigating the impact of disinformation and misinformation. Strong, r obust social mobilization and community engagement for vaccine promotion will contribute to building public trust. Together, skilled individuals , motivated organizations , and modern tools can mitigate the risks of rumors and negative information about vaccines. This toolkit is a compilation of highlights from the CDC messaging guidelines , the research we've already conducted in the community, and other resources to help yo u along the way. Please use this guide as a reference when needed and don't hesitate to contact us for additional support . Thank you so much for all that you do to keep our community healthy! Content Overview of communication Guidelines 2-4 Focus Group Results 5-6 Helpful Links 7 Contacts 8 Page | 2 Overview of C ommunication Guidelines In this section, we will cover the main guidelines for communicating vaccine information to the community. This has been adapted from the presentation from the training workshop and is meant as a quick reference to have on hand. (Source: Ad Council and COVID Collaborative: COVID -19 Vacc ine Education Initiative Messaging Recommendations) Lead with empathy Respect people's hesitancy and acknowledge that it's okay to have questions. Avoid condescension, lecturing, negativity and guilt -mongering. Facts about safety are important Don't just say \"the science is solid.\" Explain why vaccines are safe, despite the fast timeline of development. Information needs to be clear, honest and presented in plain language. Emotional triggers are important Highlight how vaccinations are a pathway to helping us get back to the moments of human connection that we are all yearning for. In the same vein, highlight that vaccinations will protect the ones we love and those most vulnerable in our community. Strategic Messaging Guidelines Your tone should be welcoming, personal, and authentic Provide a safe space that's focused on dialogue, not debate. Leverage emotional touchpoints to remind people about those moments of human connection once we get past COVID -19. Page | 3 Doesn't Resonate Negativity & Fear : People push back when reminded of how difficult a year it's been \u2014it tends to put them in a pessimistic, hopeless or frustrated frame of mind. Fear tactics are likely to backfire because this does little to generate trust or answer people's questions about vaccines Guilt :References to \"many people already stepping up\" can come off as pushy or accusatory. Those who are hesitant do not see themselves as \"free riders\" letting others take risks fi rst ; rather, they are worried about being \"guinea pigs\" for new COVID -19 vaccines. Overpromising : Avoid claims that are unproven. Being overly rosy may cause concern. Be clear about the facts without any sugarcoating. Most people understand that mass vaccination is a long -term process. Avoid messages that inadvertently imply that vaccine availability will \"flip the switch.\" \"Back to Normal\": Some just want things to \"get back to normal,\" but for others, post- pandemic life will never be \"the way it was.\" It's more about getting back to life rather than back to normal. Messages that focus on economic recovery \u2014rather than public health\u2014 do not perform well.Does Resonate Using a Positive Tone: Be inviting and respectful as opposed to demanding. Acknowledge that the \"choice is yours to make,\" which connects with the deeply rooted American value of liberty Emphasizing Protection: Emphasize \"protecting myself, loved ones and those in my community\" (rather than \"coming together as a nation\"). Validating Concerns & Answering Questions: Acknowledge people's hesitancy rather than challenge it. Provide scientifically -based, plain language answers. Moments Missed : Reference things the people miss most. With many feeling COVID -19 fatigue, missed moments (especially human connections that we took for granted like visiting family and friends) serve as a powerful reminder of the ultimate end goal: vaccination as a pathway to the possibility of regaining these moments. Making Your Message Resonate The following table outlines messaging approaches that will and will not likely resonate with your audience. Page | 4 Do not assume high levels of general health literacy and avoid scientific jargon . Use plain language, so information is clear and easy -to understand. Graphics plus text works better than text alone. Avoid language that makes it appear as if you're promoting or endorsing one manufacturer's drug. Do not talk about \"the vaccine\" or refer to a specific drug; instead, use the term \"vaccines\" in plural or refer to \"vaccinations\" inste ad. Present vaccines as one important option to fight the pandemic , e.g., \"vaccines are a key\" not \"the key .\" (For example: \"Everyone should continue to take all recommended actions to help stop the pandemic.\") Direct people to have conversations with their healthcare provider or doctor , (e.g., \"talk to your doctor\" or \"start a conversation\") instead of telling them to get vaccinated. Avoid giving medical advice. Avoid any mention of efficacy rates \u2014this points to specific brand name d rugs, which you should avoid promoting. Do not include any drug -specific disclaimers on side effects since that also points to specific drugs. If you are communicating about side effects, be transparent and up front about potential severe side effects in rare cases. Avoid discussing total elimination or eradication of COVID -19, as scientists are predicting that COVID- 19 will become endemic (like the flu). Talk about ending the pandemic, not about ending COVID -19 for good. Language Considerations Page | 5 Focus Group Results We conducted two focus groups with adults college -aged and olde r in South Carolina to gather information about the community we will be serving and how we can best reach them . The following charts are a synopsis of the results from those focus group discussions: Reasons Stated for Vaccine Hesitancy Concerns about sponsorships, partnerships, incentives, and programs being forms of coercion or bribery A belief that vaccination may be less effective than not receiving the vaccine Concerns about adverse effects of the vaccine Trauma and mistrust from th e historical/systemic mistreatment of Black people by the medical establishment Stigma of being \"guinea pigs\" (Tuskegee) Contraindications (fear that the vaccine will react negatively with their pre -existing allergies or health conditions) The vaccine was developed quickly and is still very new Informational barriers , especially on social media, including misinformation, misconception, inconsistent information (uncertainty of information), miseducation (limited comprehension), lack of transp arency, and conspiracy theory surrounding COVID -19 Concerns that politics are driving the process On social media, some people post conspiracy theories that vaccines cause cancer, or some believe that vaccinations are microchips injected into the body to t rack everything people do Reasons Stated for Getting the Vaccine Wanting to live longer For their own safety To prevent disease severity Family and friends getting vaccinated ( social norms ) Getting informed by credible sources Page | 6 Church Pastors (ensuring the pastor's values are pro-vaccination) Faculty Coaches Peers Student Leaders Community Leaders Trained Professionals Community Member Testimonials College Students Older Adults Both College Students' and Older Adults' Beliefs About the Best People to Speak about Vaccines Information tables or boot hs set up in organizations and companies to provide vaccination information to employees Involving churches Traditional news outlets and TV commercials Expert seminars Homecoming events, football games, and basketball games TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter HIV/STI conferences Pride festivals Offering incentives, providing accurate information about vaccination sites, and providing transportation Flyers in grocery stores such as Walmart and Target Open conversations with doctors College Students Older Adults Both College Students' and Older Adults' Beliefs About the Best ways to Reach the Community Page | 7 Helpful Links We thank you for your participation and look forward to a successful promotion!
