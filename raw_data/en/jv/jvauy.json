Let's explore this amazing flower. Dandelions are known as Pu Gong Ying in pinyin and are used frequently in Traditional Chinese Medicine. The name comes from the French \"dent-de-lioun,\" which translates into \"tooth of the lion\" due to its sharp leaves. They are known to aid the liver, kidneys and gallbladder in particular. In Chinese medicine herbs are used to heal, this includes flowers, bark, roots and seeds. For example, if an herb is considered \"warming,\" it is given for cold conditions. An herb that is bitter would clear heat and detoxify. If an herb is sour it benefits the liver. If an herb is red it benefits the heart and blood. TCM creates herbal formulas that use a combination of different herbs to balance the formula and keep it safe. Dandelion is considered a cold, bitter and slightly sweet herb. Its milky juice clears heat, detoxifies blood, reduces swelling and helps the early stages of a cold. Dandelion helps the liver and gallbladder by increasing bile production, and helping in cases of jaundice. Often dandelion is combined with licorice, milk thistle and fennel. Here are some other key benefits of this flower: - It is a diuretic and aids the kidneys, urinary disorders, and may prevent kidney stones - Lowers blood pressure (as a diuretic) - Weight loss (as a diuretic) - Helps digestion, promotes appetite, increases bile, is a mild laxative - Stimulates the production of insulin by the pancreas for diabetes - Has iron, vitamins and protein to help anemia Dandelion can be eaten, taken in a tea or as a supplement.
