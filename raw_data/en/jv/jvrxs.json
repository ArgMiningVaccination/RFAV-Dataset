Migraines are painful, throbbing headaches that last from 4 to 72 hours. When you have a migraine, it may be so painful that you aren't able to do your usual activities. But migraines can be treated. And even though they make you feel bad, they don't cause long-term damage. What causes them? Experts aren't sure what causes migraines. They believe that changes in the activity of brain cells may lead to inflammation in certain nerves, which causes pain. Migraines often run in families, so genetics may play a role for some people. Some things, called triggers, can cause a migraine to start. What can trigger a migraine headache? Triggers are things that can cause a [migraine headache](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stm159535#stm159535-sec) to start. They include changes in daily routine, foods, hormones, and medicines. They can also include lights, odors, changes in the weather, or other things in the environment.

The most common symptom of a migraine headache is a throbbing pain on [one side of your head](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.ax2017#ax2017-sec) or behind an eye.

Other symptoms of migraine include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light. How are they diagnosed? To diagnose migraines, your doctor will ask about your personal and family history and examine you. Your doctor will ask how many headaches you have, how long they last, and what symptoms you have.
