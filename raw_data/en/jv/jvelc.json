Conclusion ......................... 58 23 24 4 Introduction 1 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a b road term used to describe a chronic 2 inflammatory state that occurs mainly in the colon , although the other portions of the 3 intestinal tract were also concerned . IBD mainly encompasses two inflammatory conditions, 4 either ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn 's disease (CD). From an anatomical point of view, UC 5 patients mainly suffer from an inflammation of the rectal and sigmoid colon .1, 2 In contrast, 6 the ile o-caecal area remains the most affected region in CD ,3, 4 although many cases have also 7 been reported in the small intestine .5 Another aspect that characterizes CD is the skip lesions , 8 where the affected region altern ates between inflamed and non -inflamed segments .6 From a 9 histological point of view, UC is a superficial inflammation , wherea ses CD is transmural , 10 affecting all the layers of the colon , which makes the complications more severe .7, 8 11 Despite the tremendous efforts made to comprehen d the pathophysiological state 12 triggering the occurrence of IBD, the exact etiology remains unclear. Up to date, several 13 parameters are incriminated as potential causative factors . They can be classified as being 14 either endogenous or exogenous. Endogenous factors are mainly represented by genetic 15 predisposition or immunoregulatory disorder s. However, several studies suggest ed that 16 microbiome dysregulation could also have a considerable impact on the development of 17 IBD.9, 10 Exogenous facto rs, on the other hand , are linked to exposure to external stress .11 The 18 stress can be environmental (e.g., alcohol, chemicals, drugs, industrial diet style), 19 psychological (e.g., depression, anxiety) , or even microbial through the intestine invasion by 20 pathogenic bacteria . 21 With more than 6.8 million people suffering from the complications of IBD at a global 22 scale ,12 a curative tre atment of this pathology is still missing , and current treatment protocol 23 aims at relieving acute attacks (e.g., the combination of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and 24 corticosteroids , TNF - antibodies) or preventing relapse episodes (e.g., 5 -ASA therapy for 25 UC and corticosteroids for CD). However, the active pharmaceutical ingredients ( API) 26 delivery still rests on conventional drug delivery systems (DDS) such as tablets , capsules , 27 enemas, or solutions . These formulations have shown several limitation s as the yield of the 28 API in the colonic region is low .13, 14 Consequently, working on alternative therapeutic 29 approaches remains necessary to offer a better treatment protocol and reduce patient 30 discomfort while diminishing the multiple administrations of medications or the recurrence to 31 less hospitalization. 32 5 Over the last decade, many researchers have taken advantage of the rapid technological 1 advances in nanomedicine by designing novel DDS. The DDS aim at enhancing the drug 2 concentration in the targeted region through the control of API release or cell -specific 3 targeting strategies .15 However, many of these new approaches have failed to circumvent the 4 several hurdles of the gastro -intestinal (GI) tract microenvironment in IBD -suffering patients. 5 In this context, nanoparticles composed of polysaccharides showed promising results to 6 alleviate IBD. They combine the advantages of nanoparticulate systems with intrinsic 7 biological activities of polysaccharides . On one side, the nanoparticles offer different 8 functionalities such as mucoadhesion, mucopenetration, passive targeting of inflamed tissues 9 in the GI tract, and capture by the immune cells (For review articles on nanoparticles used for 10 IBD, see references16-22). On the other hand, polysaccharides exhibit intrinsic biological 11 activity such as anti -inflammatory, healing, immunomodulation, and regulation of the 12 intestinal microbiota (For a review article on polysaccharide -based DDS for IBD, see 13 reference23. 14 In this review, we will first discuss the up -to-date knowledge on pathophysiology of IBD 15 and its implication in the design of oral DDS . Physiological changes of the gastro -intestinal 16 tract durin g active IBD and their implications for designing oral DDS strategies will be 17 underscored. After that , we will analy ze the under going research strategies using 18 nanoparticles and polysaccharides for IBD. Finally, challenges and perspectives in the oral 19 delivery of nanoparticles and polysaccharides for IBD treatment will be discussed. 20 1. Overview of the anatomy and physiology of the colon 21 The colon , or large intestine , constitute s the final part of the GI tract. The colon is 22 approximately 150 cm in length and is divided into six main segments .24 The first segment is 23 the coecum , where the colon connects to the small intestine. Then comes the ascending colon, 24 the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and finally the rectum. The 25 appendix is another part of the colon connected to the coecum . Studies identified i t as a 26 component of the immune system .25 From a histological point of view, the colon comprises 27 four layers. The outermost layer that overlooks the intestinal lumen is the mucosa, then 28 comes the sub -mucosa, the muscularis , and finally the serosa .26 Above the colon tissue lays a 29 thick mucus layer involved in food digestion , immunity, and protects the GI tract from 30 virulent microbes for example . On the top of the mucus la yer lay millions of bacteria which 31 constitute the gut microbiota .27 32 6 Colon histology revealed that its epithelium is arranged in crypts, where different cells are 1 unequally distributed .28 In the basement of the crypts lays the stem cells that differentiate 2 while migrating up in the crypts to mainly four different types of functional cells (Figure 1) .29 3 Enterocytes represent the most abundant cell s in the colon epithelium (Figure 1) . They are 4 responsible for nutrient absorption. Goblet cells are responsible for mucus secretion. 5 Enteroendocrine cells are involved in the secretion of GI hormones. Paneth cells oversee the 6 secretion of antimicrobial peptide s in the colon's lumen. Antimicrobial peptides protect the 7 colon microenvironment from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and even cancerous cells. 8 Antimicrobia l peptides play a role in immunomodulation and actively participate in the 9 immune system .30 Microfol d cells ( M cells) are other types of cells . They are mainly 10 distributed in the small intestine but can be found in the colon in the gut -associated lymphoid 11 tissue (GALT) of the Peyer's patches . 12 13 Figure 1: Scheme summarizing the anatomy and physiology in the intestine during a homeostasic state . 14 7 2. Pathophysiology and complications of IBD 1 The pathophysiology of both UC and CD is not clearly elucidated. At the same time, 2 many gaps toward the comprehension of th ese diseases have been filled in the last years. 3 These fundamental findings opened new avenues for accelerat ing the race toward develop ing 4 new therapeutic protocols . One of the most studied areas in IBD relies on the factors 5 predisposing its development. These triggers could be either genetic or environmental , as it is 6 described in Table 1. Following an exposition to one of the previously described genetic or 7 environmental triggers , the microbial peptides that are typically secreted in the intestinal 8 lumen translocate in the lamina propria, either through dysfunction of M cells or because of 9 an impaired barrier function (Figure 2) . The barriers' function impairment also allows the 10 translocation of luminal bacteria into the lamina propria .31, 32 The translocated bacteria 11 activate the professional i mmune cells (e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages) that engulf the 12 pathogens and present their epitopes to CD4 T -cells. Once activated, both CD4 T -cells and 13 professional immune cells start releasing proinflammatory cytokines that trigger the local and 14 system ic complications of IBD (Figure 2). Each cytokine is involved in the inflammatory 15 response by modulating one or more specific functions. Table 2 briefly summarize s the 16 mechanism of action of the main cytokines implicated in IBD. 17 IBD can trigger both local and systemic complications. Local complications are a 18 consequence of the epithelial cells swelling and may differ according to the type of 19 pathology. UC and CD share some similar local complications such as blood or mucus in the 20 stool,33 perforation of the bowel,34 predisposition to colon cancer,35 and loss of body weight36 21 due to the disruption of reabsorption of water and nutrients by the intestine. However, t here 22 are some other complications that are typical for each pathology. During a CD episode, the 23 patient may also encounter an abscess formation,37 fistula,38 a lymph adenopathy,39 and 24 bowel wall obstruction.40 During a UC episode, one can observe a toxic megacolon41 as well 25 as a loss of haustra form.42 The high proinflammatory cytokines level in the blood during the 26 active phase of IBD is responsible for the various systemic complications such as 27 conjunctivitis,43 mouth ulcer ,44 the presence of an abscess in the liver ,45 portal vein 28 thrombosis ,46 large joint arthritis,47 and pyoderma gangrenosum.48 29 8 1 Figure 2: Pathophysiological process and cytokines productions during an IBD . 2 9 Table 1: Review of the genetic and environmental factor s implicated in IBD. 1 Factors Expression Pathophysiology Ref Genetic factors Autophagic dysfunction Many autophagy gene variants were linked to IBD , among which ATG16L1 (promote s autophagosome formation and participate s in suppress ing Paneth cells ) and IRGM (responsible for phagosome maturation ). 49 Cytokine imbalance Cytokines are essential in the modulation of the intestinal immune system. During an IBD episode, there is an imbalance between pro and anti -inflammatory cytokines, which favor the progress of the proinflammatory process. 50, 51 Bacterial imbalance During an IBD episode , bacterial dysbiosis occurs mainly in mucosal samples. In that regard , an increase in the abundance of certain types of bacteria (e.g ., Enterobacteriaceae ., Pasteurellacaea , and Veillonellaceae ) was noticed a decrease of other types (e.g., Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales , and Clostridiales). 52 Environmental factors Diet The dietary habits influence the gut fatty acids equilibrium, modifying many parameters such as the pro and anti- inflammatory cytokines balance, the gut microbiota, and the intestinal permeability. For example, a study highlighted that a Mediterranean diet is less likely to induce colitis than a western diet. 53, 54 Stress The role of the brain -gut axis in the induction of colitis was more recently studied than other factors . During a stress episode, hypothalamic secretion of corticotrophin -releasing factor (CRF) cortisol by the adrenal cortex. High cortisol levels are involved in IBD by disrupting the gut microbiota , damaging intestinal barrier funct ion. 11, 55 Non-steroids anti- inflammatory Prostaglandins play a crucial role in the mucosal and immune defenses in the colon. During the therapy, there is selective inhibition of COX1 and COX2 receptors . These two receptors are implicated in p rostaglandin production. Low levels of prostaglandins are correlated to the development or the exacerbation of colitis. 56, 57 Smoking Cigarette smoke plays an important ro le in colorectal neoplasia development in IBD patients. Furthermore, s moking significantly increases the risk of developing and worsens CD . 58-60 Antibiotic Antibiotics favor the development of IBD through several mechanisms. They can alter the gut microbiome balance, favoring the intestinal proinflammatory phenotype. Studies reported that developing IBD is antibiotic dose-dependent, with a higher prevalence while using board -spectrum antibiotics . From another standpoint, certain antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin or rifaximin a lso favor remission from an IBD by targeting specific bacteria linked with the progression of the inflammation. 61, 62 10 Table 2: Main cytokines involved during an IBD episode. 1 Cytokine Mechanism of action TNF - TNF - is a significant cytokine produced mainly by CD14+ macrophages. TNF - plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of both UC and CD. Binding to NTF -a receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2 ) activat ed the nuclear factor -B (NF-B) family , which plays a significant role in the regulation of genes invol ved in inflammation.63, 64 IL-6 IL-6 is secreted mainly by macrophages but can also be produced by CD4+ T cells .65, 66 Intestinal inflammation is induced following the interaction of IL -6 with membrane glycoprotein (gp130) on the surface of CD4 T -cells.67, 68 IL-6 also plays a homeostatic role as it promotes th e proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells .69 IL-1 During the active phase of IBD, lamina propria dendritic cells and macrophages, in addition to endothelial cells, increase the production of IL -1 cytokines. There are three subtypes of IL -1 cytokines, two agonistic proteins (IL -1, IL -1), which favor inflammation, and one antagonistic protein (IL1 -Ra) that reduces the inflammatory response .70 Although their mechanism of action is not clearly elucidated ; it was shown in several studies that this higher production of IL -1 cytokines during IBD induces an imbalance between IL -1 agonists and their natural antagonist ,71-73 which favors the progress of the inflammation in the colon. IL-12 IL-12 cytokine family is mainly produced by dendritic cells and macrophages. IL-12 participate s in the progress of inflammation after binding to its receptors ( IL- 12R-2). IL-12R-2 are overexpressed during inflammation by the T cells in the mucosa and the lamina propria. Accord ingly, their stimulation favors a Th1 immune response, thus promoting mucosal degradation and lamina propria expansion. In addition to Th1 activation, IL -12 stimulates innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) to produce IFN-, as recent studies demonstrated that inhib iting IL -12 results in a lower production of IFN- during a CD episode .74 IL-23 binds its receptor (a combination of IL -12R 1 and IL -23R75) and induces the formation of Th17 cells out of their na\u00efve CD4+ T counterparts .76 Th17 cells have both biochemical role by the further induction of proinflam matory cytokines (IL -17, TNF -, and IL -6),77 and an immunological role by promoting the activati on of CD8+ T ,78 natural killer (NK)79 and ILCs80 IFN- IFN- is mainly produced by T H1-cells of the lamina propria ,81, 82 but also by NK cells. Its level increase d during IBD .83, 84 Also, it stimulat es macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines .85 It was recently reported that IFN - worsen the pathogenesis of IBD by breaking down the vascular barrier while targeting adherents junction protein VE-cadherin .86 IL-4 IL-4 is a cytokine primarily produced by T H2 cells. Although lack of understanding of the activity of IL -4, it is known that IL -4 plays a role in promoting B -cells and T -cells. IL-4 also has a well -documented immunosuppressive effect in the intestine .50 Other studies depicted the role of IL -4 in the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor .87 IL-13 IL-13 is another T H2-related cytokine. During UC, IL -13 is implicated in the aggravation of the pathology as it impairs the epithelial barrier function while affecting the tight junctions and inducing epithelial apoptosis .88 It is also reported in another study th at tissue fibrosis occurrence is correlated to the binding of IL -13 with a novel 11 cell surface receptor IL -13.89 IL-17 IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine exclusively produced by T -lymphocytes (CD45RO+ cells) .90 During an inflammatory process, IL -17 further stimulate s the secretion of characteristic proinflammatory cytokines such as IL cells92, 93 (e.g., macrophages, fibroblast, e pithelial cells). It is synthesized in an inactive form which is activated after binding latency -associated peptides. TGF - plays a crucial regulatory role in the immune system while controlling the production of several immune systems. On the one hand, th ey promote the proliferation of regulatory T cells ( Treg ),94 favoring the production of anti -inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL -10). On the other hand, they participate in the neutralization of pathogens by promoting the generation and maturation of IgA produc ing B -cells95 and boosting the activity of dendritic cells and macrophages .96, 97 IL-10 IL-10 is an anti -inflammatory cytokine. It is produced primarily by monocytes. It monitors IBD by the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines production by T H1 cells. Other studies reported that , following a bacterial invasion, IL -10 express es an inhibitory effect on the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by Toll -like receptor - triggered myeloid lineage cells .98, 99 1 12 Table 3: Current therapeutic protocols for the monitoring of UC a nd CD. 1 UC CD Ref Active phase During an extensive UC: - Oral 5 -ASA - Oral corticosteroids During a severe UC: - Rehydration intravenous corticosteroids intravenous antibiotics - TNF - antagonist (anti - TNF -) - Surgery Adjusting diet: - A fibber rich meal - Avoiding excess proteins During a severe CD: - Corticosteroids - Immunosuppression - Surgery (less favorable due to the non-continuous character of CD) - TNF - antagonist for chronic patients 100 Cold phase Maintenance protocol consist s of: - Oral 5 -ASA therapy Maintenance protocol aims at reduc ing the immune response: - Thiopurine - Methotrexate 2 13 3. General overview of conventional therapeutic agents for IBD 1 and their shortcomings 2 The management of IBD aims to treat the acute attacks during the inflammatory process 3 or prevent it from recurring during the cold phase of the disease. Depending on the type of 4 IBD, the therapeutic protocol is different, as illustrated in table 3. For sev eral years, the 5 standard treatment consisted of administering steroids anti -inflammatory, immunomodulators 6 such as thiopurines and methotrexate, cyclosporine, aminosalicylates ( e.g., 5-ASA), and 7 surgery by remov ing the damaged section of the intestine. 8 5-ASA exert s its effect through antioxidant activity and modulation of inflammatory 9 mediators. Unfortunately, the use of 5 -ASA is linked to diverse side effects (e.g., fever, 10 nausea, diarrhea , cramping, headaches, rashes, and in some cases, hair loss, nephritis, 11 pancreatitis, and pancytopenia). 5-ASA is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine leading to 12 low local availability in the colon. It is thus necessary to formulate 5 -ASA in adequate DDS 13 to increase local bioavailability, lower applicable 5 -ASA doses , and decrease side effects. 14 Corticosteroids are another standard drug class used in IBD patients. Although 15 corticosteroids provide a robust anti-inflammatory response, their use is common ly related to 16 strong side effects that arise only a few weeks following the start of a topical or systemic 17 treatment.101-104 Those side effects (e.g. , Cushing's syndrome, infection, adrenal suppression, 18 sleep disorders, osteoporosis , and renal function impairment) limit their application in long - 19 term therapy. Recent endeavors suggest that using nanoparticles to deliver cort icosteroids 20 during an IBD allows keep ing their steroid anti -inflammatory response while minimizing the 21 systemic side effect s by targeted delivery of the API into the inflamed colon . From another 22 perspective, certain corticosteroids (e.g., budesonide) have a low mucus penetrating 23 capability, justifying the use of nanoparticles to enhance their penetrability.105 24 Immunosuppressants can target specific proteins in the body that induce inflammation. 25 Monoclonal antibodies targeting specific cytokines were used to monitor IBD. Indeed, anti - 26 TNF - (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab) constitute the mainstream of biological 27 treatment during the active phase of IBD and as maintenance therapy.106 Also, anti -IL-12 28 (e.g., ustekinumab) is used only in the case of CD.107 One major drawback of bio logics 29 protocol is the primary nonresponse or a loss of response during treatments. The best example 30 would be anti -TNF- based therapy, where 30% of the patients present a primary 31 nonresponse ,108 while 30 to 50% lost the response over time.109 Up to date, many biological - 32 14 based therapeutics are available in the market (e.g., certolizumab, infliximab, adalimumab, 1 natalizumab, vedolizumab). Nonetheless, the administration of biologics is commonly applied 2 by the parenteral routes ( e.g., subcutaneo us, intramuscular, or intravenous) , and their long - 3 lasting use is associated with numerous side effects such as immunosuppression,110-113 4 infection,114 cancer,115 and the formation of antibodies against biologics , reducing their 5 efficacy. Consequently, a novel drug delivery strategy relying on nanoparticles has been more 6 and more investigated in the last year to administrat e the API orally, besides reducing their 7 dose through a more targeted delivery to the inflamed region s.116-118 8 Using nanoparticles for the oral delivery of immunosuppressants to IBD patients is a 9 promising approach to reduce their side effects. Indeed, monitoring the aberrant balance of the 10 immune system during UC or CD relies on controlling vari ous immune cells, enzymes, and 11 cytokines through the administration of immunosuppressant s (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine 12 A, tacrolimus). However, their poor solubility often limits their performance ,119-121 urging to 13 increase the administered dose. Also, misus ing these therapeutic agents and systemic 14 administration led to off -target severe side effect s (e.g., immunodeficiency, allergies, a loss of 15 activity following a long systemic circulation). Nanoparticle development offers the 16 possibility of selectively targeting the colon's inflamed region and a controlled release of the 17 immunosuppressant .122 They also play a role in protectin g the drugs from degradation during 18 their journey in the GI tract.123, 124 Table 4 summarizes the significant works in designing 19 nanoparticle -based IBD therapy. 20 15 4. Implication of pathop hysiological changes of the GI tract 1 during active IBD for oral drug delivery strategies 2 Active IBD could induce several changes in the GI tract barriers that should be fully 3 understood and considered for developing efficient DDS and identify ing therapeutic 4 targets .125-127 Those changes concern the pH, degradative enzymes,127 mucus barrier function, 5 microbiota composition20, 128 and the permeability of the intestinal epithe lium.129 6 4.1. pH changes 7 In healthy subjects, the stomach pH ranges from 1.0 to 2.5 (fasted) . It rises from 6.6 to 7.5 8 in the small and the large intestine. More precisely, luminal pH in the proximal small bowel 9 ranges from and gradually rises to in the distal ileum . In the caecum , the 10 pH decrease s to and rises from 6.87 in the proximal colon to 7.2 in the distal colon. 11 In UC and CD patients, the pH of the stomach was found higher than in healthy subjects.130 12 This change was correlated to a decrease in the acidic secretions of the stomach. In UC and 13 CD patients , no significant changes in the pH of the small intestine w ere reported compared to 14 healthy subjects.130-132 Although the colonic pH of patients with IBD broadly fluctuates 15 depending on the individuals and the disease state , patients are generally subject to acid ic pH 16 in the colon .133, 134 The pH in UC and CD patients ranged from 5.5 to as low as 2.3.133, 135, 136 17 The decrease in the colonic pH is due to disruption of factors including intestinal volume, 18 transit time, microbial fermentation, bile acid metabolism of fatty acids, bicarbonate , and 19 lactate secretions.134 Changes in colonic pH in UC and CD patients could affect the 20 composition of the microbiome and consequently the colon ic transit. The residence time of 21 the drugs in the colon , drug release , and absorption are thus modified . Additionally, pH 22 changes could affect drug release from pH -sensitive formulations. 23 The pH change along the GI tract was exploited to design DDS able to disintegrate at a 24 specific pH range to release the API. A general strategy consists in coating the DDS with 25 polymer s that are pH-sensitive . Polymers used for colon delivery are methacrylic acid, 26 polymethacrylic acid, polyacrylic acid, and their derivati ves which respond to the high pH of 27 the colon ( ).19 So far, the most common pH -sensitive systems for oral drug delivery in 28 IBD treatment are composed of methacrylic acid co -polymers (Eudragit). Eudragit S100 29 (ES100) , which should dissolve in the distal intestine at a pH of 7, is the most used polymer 30 for colon drug delivery. ES100 -containing DDS exhibited pH -sensitive properties by limiting 31 the burst release at the gastric pH. Most of the drug was release d at pH higher than 7.137, 138 32 16 The pH at which the dr ug is released could be adjusted to lower values by mixing ES100 to 1 other methacrylic acid co -polymers that dissolve at low pH.139 Eudragit L100 is soluble at pH 2 6, while EL30 -D55 was used to manipulate the drug release within the desired pH range of 3 in the distal small intestine . The appropriate colon dissolution pH of delivery 4 system s can be controlled by optimizing the rat io of EL30 -D55 and ES100 for targeted drug 5 delivery to the inflamed colon.139 More recently, coating nanoparticulate DDS with Eudragit 6 FS 30D confe rred a release of the encapsulated drugs.140 Eudragit FS 30D 7 dissolves similarly to Eudragit S100 at pH 7 but in a more sustained and controlled mode . The 8 Eudragit -coated strategy of nanoparticulate DDS was applied for m any types of 9 nanostructures,19 including polymer,141 lipidic,142 polysaccharide -based ,143 or inorganic 10 nanoparticles .138 11 Other types of pH -sensitive materials were used for design ing nanoparticles that can target 12 and remain in the inflamed colonic tissue through multiple mechanisms . Hybrid nanoparticles 13 composed of pH and enzyme -sensitive polymers were designed by combining ES100 and 14 azopolyurethane polymers.144, 145 However, as mentioned above, the colonic pH in patients 15 with IBD could be more acidic than in healthy subjects. Consequently, the DDS coated with 16 Eudragit that dissolves at pH higher than 6 might not release the drug in vivo. Indeed, in most 17 investigations on Eudragit -based nanoparticles , the drug release was evaluated in vitro in 18 simulated colonic medi a without mimicking IBD disorders . In the next section, we will 19 discuss the interest of polysacchari des for design ing pH-sensitive DDS that could be a n 20 alternative to synthetic polymers. 21 4.2. Mucus 22 In healthy subjects, mucus is a viscoelastic mineral salts 25 lysozyme ) that contribute to the mucus elasticity.146, 147 The degree of mucus hydration Mucin fibers ( typically )148 are crosslinked and entangled macromolecules secreted by both 28 goblet cells and the seromucinous glands of the lamina propria at the apical by galactosamine and N-linked sulfate - 30 bearing glycans .150 Dense g lycan coverage of mucins represents up to 80% of the dry weight 31 of mucus . For 100 amino acid residues , carbohydrate chains represent ,151 and 32 contribute up to 80% of the dry wei ght of mucus (For review articles on mucus , see 33 17 references152-154). The glycocalyx that protects cell surfaces comprises cell-associated mucins and mucus gels formed by secreted gel -forming mucins.153 2 Significant changes in mucus composition, thickness, physical properties, and function 3 were reported in IBD. CD is characterized by goblet cell hypertrophy, while patients with UC 4 are characterized by a reduction and depletion of goblet cells. In this latte r case, mucus 5 production is significantly decreased, and the thickness of mucus layers was reduced in the 6 colon and the rectum.155, 156 In UC, t he substantial increase in mucus production leads to a 7 thicker mucus layer in the inflamed areas. Consequently, a higher amount of nanoparticle 8 adherence was reported for inflamed areas compared to healthy mucosa. Due to their small 9 size, nanoparticles were better retained in the intestinal tract than large particles. Smaller 10 nanoparticles are known to exhibit better mucoadhesion and mucopenetration compared to 11 larger particles.157, 158 Lamprecht et al. ,159 demonstrated an inverse relationship between 12 particle size and binding to the inflamed intestinal mucosa. They revealed that particles 13 smaller than 1 00 nm exhibited the highe st binding affinity to inflamed colonic tissue. The 14 reduction of the DDS size to the nanometer scale improve d colonic residence time in inflamed 15 regions of the intestine and provided benefit s for IBD treatment. Particles with a size larger 16 than 200 m are subjected to diarrhea symptoms, resulting in a decreased GI transit time and, 17 therefore, decreased efficiency .160, 161 18 PEGylation strategy improves m ucopenetration properties of nanoparticles . Being 19 hydrophilic and uncharged, the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) confers to 20 nanoparticulate DDS mucus penetrating properties.157, 162 -164 The behaviors of PEG nano - 21 delivery systems toward mucus are dependent on the molecular weight. Low PEG molecular 22 weight ( 2-5 kDa) provided a non -mucoadhesive coating on nanoparticles. Whereas coatings 23 using 10 kDa PEG resulted in strong particle mucoad hesion.163, 164 The surface charge of 24 PEGylated nanoparticles showed a significant impact on their accumulation in the inflamed 25 colon of a dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS)-induced mice model of acute UC.165 Nanoparticles 26 had a 100 -nm diameter and were composed of poly(ethylene glycol) glycol ic They were loaded with TNF - .165 In this study, 28 cationic PEGylated PLGA nanoparticles showed a higher accumulation in the colon and a 29 better silencing capacity than nanoparticles with a neutral charge . 30 In patients with active UC, the carbohydrate content of the epithelial glycan, including 31 mucus glycoproteins , is altered compared with healthy controls (For reviews on epithelial 32 glycans in IBD, see references166-168). Epithelial glycans are a major component of the 33 18 intestinal mucosa. Glycans typically form glycoconjugates (e.g., glycoproteins and 1 glycolipids ) by attaching to other molecules (e.g., cytosolic lipids or membrane -associated 2 lipids and proteins ). Thanks to their position at the interface between the epithelial cells and 3 the outer mucus layer , glycans serve as attachment sites for nutrients and ligand -binding 4 proteins (e.g., antibodies, lectins) . They also play an essential role in the interaction between 5 intestinal epithelia and the commensal flora in the mucus . The major class of glycan in the gut 6 (80 wt% of MUC2) is composed of m ucin-type O -glycans. 7 In patients with active disease , intestinal epithelial glycosylation i s disru pted.167-169 8 Alterations include truncated mucin -type O -glycans and a reduction of ol igosaccharide chain 9 length and sulfatation, conferring less negative charge to mucins.169, 170 Reduced sulfatation 10 was correlated to increased activity of mucin sulfatase. Structural and immunohistochemical 11 studies revealed that patients with active IBD were characterized by a simplified O - 12 glycome.171 The amount of smaller glycans was increased, while more complex structures 13 were lowered. Glycan disruption altered intestinal immunity , disrupted glycan -lectin and host - 14 microorganism interactions , and altered MUC2 synthesis168 and stability . Glycome 15 simplification makes mucins more accessible to host and bacterial proteases.172 The loss of 16 mucus viscoelasticity and redu ction of barrier properties lead to enhance d interactions of 17 bacteria and intestinal epithelia. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between 18 changes in glycosylation and the level of inflammation .169 19 Understanding the disorders of epithelial glycosylation in IBD patients with active disease 20 is fundamental for developing strategies for ' remodeling ' the disease -associated glyc an by 21 targeting intestinal epithelial glycosylation . Those approaches include direct methods (e.g., 22 inhibitors of glycosidases,173 or sulfatases174, 175) and indirect methods (e.g., normalizing the 23 gut microbiota by faecal transplantation or prebiotics, or by bacterial products). Inhibiting 24 protein -glycan interactions that contribute to recruiting pathogenic bacteria or inflammatory 25 cells seems to be a promising strategy to alleviate inflammation in IBD patients .168 For 26 example, galactose interferes with the interaction of Fusobacterium nucleatum (a Gram - 27 negative commensal bacteria) with the carbohydrate epitope galactose or N-acetyl- 28 galactosamine (Gal , GalNAc).176, 177 It was found that the interaction of F. nucleatum Fap-2 29 (fibroblast activation protein 2) , and Gal or GalNAc was implicated in numerous diseases, 30 including IBD and cancer.178 These findings should trigg er further investigations to design 31 DDS to block Fap-2/Gal or Fap-2/GalNAc interaction. Similarly, it was demonstrated that 32 blocking the interaction of Escherichia coli FimH lectin with epithelial glycan prevents 33 19 mucosal inflammation associated with CD.179 Knowing that mannose derivates are able to 1 interact with FimH, several research works were dedicated to developing mannose derivativ es 2 to alleviate inflammation. Interestingly, the FimH blocker Sibofimloc (EB8018/TAK -018) 3 derived from the patent WO2014100158A1 has entered the clinical trials for CD.180 Thanks to 4 safety and pharmacokinetic results obtained in 2020,180 the clinical development program is 5 continuing with a phase 2 t rial in patients with CD. 6 On the other hand, u lcerated tissues contain high concentrations of positively charged 7 proteins that increas e the affinity to negatively charged substances .181 In particular, inflamed 8 colon contains high concentrations of transferrin and eosinophil cationic protein.182-185 This 9 property was exploited in design ing negatively charged DDS that preferentially adhered 10 inflamed tissue in vivo through electrostatic interactions with positively charged proteins.159, 11 186, 187 However, conflicting results were obtained in t he literature on the impact of 12 nanoparticle charge on their accumulation in the inflamed colon since the net charge of mucus 13 remains negative due to the presence of mucins. Iqbal et al. ,165 revealed that cationic 14 nanoparticles exhibited remarkably higher accum ulation in the inflamed colon compared to 15 anionic nanoparticles .165 16 4.3. Enzymatic secretions 17 In CD patients, the enzymatic secretion was significantly modified in comparison with 18 healthy subjects. Indeed, f or digestive purposes, the lumen of the upper GI tract contains large 19 amounts of pancreatic proteases, but studies have also demonstrated increased proteolytic 20 activity into mucosal tissues (both in the upper and lower GI tract), associated with 21 pathological conditions such as IBD . This upregulation was correl ated with the degradation of 22 tight junctions.188 In that context, p rotease inhibition was used as a therapeutic approach in 23 IBD treatment.188 Additionally, increased fluid secretion can dilute the digestive enzymes 24 implicated in intestinal transit. 25 4.4. Epithelial barrier 26 As detailed above, i n IBD patients, the intestinal epithelium is characterized by epithelial 27 defects , including a loss of continuous epithelium ,189 TNF - mediated epithelial apoptosis in 28 the colon ,190 and damage of epithelial thigh junctions. In particular, abnormal expression of 29 tight junction proteins (e.g. , occluding, ZO -1 and claudins)191 is an essential characteristic in 30 IBD. They lead to increased permeability of col onic epithelial mucosa and a loss of the barrier 31 function of the mucosa toward microbes, toxic substances such as lipoproteins , causing 32 20 inflammatory response. A consequence of epithelial shedding and impaired paracellular 1 epithelial barrier in IBD was exploited by different research groups to passively target API 2 and nanoparticles to the inflamed tissue through the so -called epithelial enhanced 3 permeability and r etention (eEPR) effect. A study implied that the recurrence of budesonide - 4 loaded PLGA/Eudragit nanoparticles improved the anti -inflammatory effect of budesonide.192 5 The authors suggest that these observations could be linked to the high adhesion and uptake of 6 the nanoparticles mediated by the eEPR effect , which increased the levels of budesonides in 7 the inflamed site. 8 In a more recent investigation, Ahmad et al.193 used polycaprolactone ( PCL) covalently 9 grafted with aminocellulose used to prepa re nanoparticles loaded with anti 10 drugs (e.g. , glycyrrhizic acid, budesonide) . Nanoparticles designed by solvent evaporation had 11 a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 230 nm and positive zeta potential (24 to 29 mV). This 12 study revealed that nanoparticles had a preferential accumulation in the inflamed colon in 13 mice with DSS-induced colitis. Higher accumulation in the inflamed colon could be due to 14 passive targeting by eEPR since no accumulation of nanoparticles in a healthy colon was 15 reported .193 These nanoparticles improved disease activities like occult blood in the stool, 16 length of the colon , and fecal properties. Also, t he nanoparticles decreased colonic mast 17 cellular infiltration, significantly maintained mucin protection, improved histological features 18 of the colon , and ameliorate d the markers of inflammation (e.g., induced oxide ( NO) TNF -, and myeloperoxidase 20 (MPO )).193 21 4.5. Modifications of immune cell surface receptors 22 In inflamed tissues, the immune cells are subject to different modifications of the 23 expression of cell receptors. In the inflamed state of UC, the glycoprotein CD98 is 24 overexpressed by colonic epithelial cells and macrophages. CD44 receptor is another 25 glycoprotein overexpressed on the activated inflammatory cells in colitis tissues. Active 26 targeting by nano particulate DDS consist s of the intentional orientation of the localization of 27 nanoparticles to inflamed tissues.194, 195 This results from a high concentration of 28 nanoparticles in the disease site and consequently high therapeutic efficacy of a drug, while 29 the adverse effects on normal tissue are reduced.195, 196 30 Another strategy target s receptors naturally expressed by macrophages and dendritic cells . 31 Because macrophages and dendritic cells are abundant in inflamed tissues, targeting receptors 32 21 (e.g., dectin -1, galactose agglutinin , and mannose receptor ) 1 targeted nanoparticles in the inflamed tissues.197-201 The ligands that can target , or monoclonal antibodies. 4 4.6. Production of reactive oxygen species 5 In response to inflammatory stimuli through specialized enzyme complexes called 6 NADPH oxidase , reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be produced by epithelial cells and 7 innate immune cells, including resident monocytes/macrophages, den dritic cells , or infiltrated 8 neutrophils . Those cells are able to produce ROS into the mucus and intestinal lumen.202 The 9 intestinal mucosa of patients with IBD is characterized by severe disorders of antioxidants and 10 ROS overexpression by immune cells (e.g. , neutrophils and macrophages) , leading to 11 oxidative d amage. ROS concentration was up to 100 -fold higher than in control patients.203 In 12 this context, several researchers exploited this property to design ROS -scavenger DDS able to 13 reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Those strategies include colon -targeted 14 delivery of nanoparticles containing donors of NO radicals (e.g. , NO-nitrosothiols) or ginger, resveratrol ). 16 Table 4: Table summarizing the recent work on the use of nanoparticles for alleviating IBD. 22 API Materials composing the nanoparticles e (mice) Oral Comparing budesonide -loaded nanoparticles to the free drug revealed: - A better histological, biological , and endoscopic data regarding inflammation reduction while using nanoparticles . - Nanoparticles could be tuned into pH-responsive nanosystems allowing targeted delivery, considering the acidic pH environment of the inflamed area. 141 Corticosteroids -loaded nanospheres had a higher impact on the reduction of TNBS induced colitis. - The inflammation reduction could be linked to the inflamed mucosa's higher systemic availability and cellular uptake of nanospheres. eroids (Budesonide) Mannosylated nanostructured lipid Oxazolon e (mice) Oral The in vivo data following the administration of a budesonide -loaded Mn-NLCs and a budesonide suspension revealed: - A lower clinical, macroscopic, and microscopic scoring with the budesonide Mn -NLCs treated group. - A lower Caco -2 cells NA - A high inhibition of inflammation was observed at the cellular level. 205 Corticosteroids (Betamethasone) adhesion to inflamed tissue compared to plain nanoparticles, thus improving their therapeutic effect. 206 5-ASA (Mesalasine) Polycaprolactone TNBS (mice) Oral - A higher therapeutic effect of encapsulated 5-ASA was observed compared to the free drug. 207 5-ASA (Mesalasi ne) Silica TNBS (mice) Oral The use of silica nanoparticles to deliver mesalasine allowed to: - Selectively target the inflamed tissue to deliver the API and spare the healthy tissue. - A higher anti -inflammatory effect was obtained with a lower dose of the API. 208 23 5-ASA Silicon dioxide (SiO 2) DSS (mice) Oral - A lower inflammation score was observed with the groups treated by the nanoparticles or with high doses of 5-ASA. - Myeloperoxidase and cytokines (TNF - and IL -6) levels were also much lower with the 5 -ASA - nanoparticles treated group suggesting a higher colo -ASA -nanoparticles . or mesalamine -loaded nanoparticles reduced the inflammation strong ly compared with free tempol or mesalasine. - The nanosystems specifically accumulate d in the colon during a colitis episode. 210 Tempol Tempol ) block copolymer s DSS (mice) Oral - Following a DSS -induced inflammation, an increase of commensal bacteria ( Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus spp. ) was noticed. - The nanoparticle administration reduced the prevalence of these commensal bacteria. 211 Biologics (Anti -TNF -) Natural polyphenol tannic acid and poly(ethylene glycol) DSS (mice) Oral - The oral administration of anti - TNF - nanoparticles had a significant ly higher reduction of inflammation than free anti-TNF -. 212 Biologics (TNF - siRNA ) Thioketal DSS (mice) Oral - Using thioketal nanoparticles as a carrier to orally deliver siRNA against TNF - into the colon reduces the TNF - RNA level in the inflamed region, preventing the worsening of UC. 213 Biologics (TNF charge: carboxylate particles - charge: plain particles DSS (mice) Oral - Aminated nanoparticles expressed the highest accumulation in the colon, translated by increased inhibition of TNF - secretion and mRNA levels. - Animals treated with aminated nanoparticles had similar histological scores to healthy mice. - The results suggest the significant influence of surface charge on colonic accumulation. 165 Biologics (CD98 siRNA ) polyethyleneimine (PEI) DSS (mice) Oral - Significant r eduction of colitis occurs through CD98 downregulation in the intestinal 214 24 epithelial cells. Biologics (CD98 siRNA ) + Curcumin PLGA offer ed a tuneable platform to deliver CD98 siRNA and curcumin in the inflamed colon selectively . - This nanoparticle -based therapy showed promising results in the monitoring of IBD . 215 Curcumin PLGA/Eudragit S100 DSS (mice) Oral While compared to groups treated with non-encapsulated curcumin was used, it was noticed: - Decrease of immune cells infiltration. - Reduction of TNF - levels. 216 Curcumin + celecoxib Eudragit S100 TNBS (mice) Oral Eudragit nanoparticles showed the following events : - Targeted delivery to the colon. - Reduced body weight loss and diarrheic stool. - When delivered in a nanoparticulate form, much lower doses of API were needed to obtain the desired effect than a separate administration of drugs. 217 Peptides (Lysine-proline- valine) KPV Alginate and nanoparticles reduced the anti-inflammatory response in DSS pre - treated mice. KPV loaded into nanoparticles can be delivered at a concentration 12,000 -fold-lower than a free solution of KPV. 218 Immuno - modulator (Rolipram) PLGA TNBS (mice) Oral - The nanoparticle formulation expressed a similar anti - inflammatory effect to the drug in solution. - Five days post -treatment, the animals that received the nanoparticle formulation showed less relapse than those that received the drug solution . - The animals that received nanoparticle formulation suffered less from the adverse effect caused by rolipram . 219 Immuno - modulator (Tacrolimus) PLGA, Eudragit P Oral - Oral tacrolimus -loaded nanoparticles attenuated colitis more efficiently than oral tacrolimus solution. - Lower efficiency of oral tacrolimus - loaded nanoparticles was observed than the drug solution administered subcutaneous ly. - Encapsulating tacrolimus inside nanoparticle s reduced its adverse 220 25 effect. - Both nanoparticle s (PLGA and pH - sensitive Eudragit) showed similar data in reduc ing colon inflammation. Nonetheless, pH - sensitive nanoparticle s were slightly less nephrotoxic. Immuno - modulator (Cyclosporine A) CYA Lipids DSS (mice) Oral - While compared to an oral administration of a commercial solution of Sandimmun (Neoral\u00ae), CYA -loaded lipid nanoparticle s did not improve the therapeutic effect. 221 PLGA DSS (mice) Oral Compared to drug -free particles formulation Sandimmun (Neoral\u00ae), CYA -loaded PLGA nanoparticle exhibited: - weight. - The concentration of proinflammatory cytokine in the plasma was undetectable . The a uthors concluded that CYA - loaded PLGA nanoparticles yielded a similar reduction of inflammation at a half dose of the commercial product. 222 Immuno - modulator (Methotrexate) Grapefruit -derived nanovesicles (GDNs) After selective internalization by macrophages, GDNs decrease TNF - production - Loading methotrexate in GDNs further enhance d their anti - inflammatory property while maintaining the homeostasis of intestinal macrophages. 223 Immuno - modulator (Azathioprine) Chitosan beads Acetic acid (rabbit) Oral Azathioprine has numerous side effects , such as hepatotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, and allergic reaction. The oral administration of Azathioprine - chitosan beads allowed to: - Reduce the systemic side effects of azathioprine. - Decrease the levels of myeloperoxidase and proinflammatory cytokines to the levels of healthy animals. - Restore the microscopic structure of the colon. 224 Antibiotics (Rifaximin) Chitosan In vitro NA Encapsulating the drug into chitosan nanoparticle s expressed the following 225 26 1 5. Polysaccharide -based drug delivery systems for IBD 2 Polysaccharides are naturally produced by animals, plants, microorganisms, fungus, and 3 algae. Among the polysaccharides' diverse intrinsic biological activities (e.g., 4 data: - Improved the solubility of rifaximin. - Expressed high stability of the formulation. - The formulation offers the possibility of a c ontrolled release of the drug in the targeted region. Nevertheless, in vivo investigation still lacks to confirm these observations. Probiotic extract Chitosan -coated PLGA TNBS (rats) Oral - The administration of probiotic extract and nanoparticles significantly mitigated colitis . - The medium dose of probiotic extract -loaded nanoparticles reduced the inflammation more efficient ly than the high dose of its free administered counterpart. 226 Prohibitin Ply(lactic acid) (PLA) DSS (mice) Oral - Prohibitin has an anti -inflammatory property, but its levels decrease during an IBD episode. - Oral prohibitin -loaded PLA particle s or rectal prohibitin -loaded adenovirus increased the prohibitin levels in the inflamed colonic region. - Increased prohibitin levels correlated with decreased inflammation intensity translated by lower clinical and histological scores, reduced myeloperoxidase activity, proinflammatory cytokines, and protein DSS Oral Oral delivery of 6 -shogaol loaded into nanoparticles reduced the virulence of the colitis by: - Diminishing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF -, IL-6, IL -1) - Increasing the level of anti - inflammatory factors such as the nuclear factor (erythroid -derived 2) - like 2 (Nrf -2) and HO-1. - Accelerating wound repair 228 27 immunomodulatory, anti -inflammatory, regulation of intestinal flora imbalance , and healing 1 properties ), their use to alleviate IBD has gained significant interest over the last years.23, 229 2 Table 5 summarizes the main polysaccharides studied for their role in IBD modulation. 3 Polysaccharides manage IBD by different mechanisms. From one side, they can regulate the 4 different proinflammatory signa lling pathways such as T protein factor (NF -B), and G -protein coupled 6 receptors . On the other side, p olysaccharides play a crucial role in the intestinal flora balance . 7 They increase the symbiotic bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus ) and decreas e the pathogenic 8 bacteria (e.g., Facklamia , Clostridium , and Enterococcus species) known as short -chain fatty acids (SCFAs) ; can also modulate the homeostasis of 10 the GI tract as several described their role in the inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms.232-11 234 Acetic acid, propionic acid , and butyric acid are the main SCFAs . Lactic acid and valer ic 12 acid are also metabolites produced by microbial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates and 13 dietary fibers .235-237 SCFAs decrease the pH of the intestine . They improve the homeostasis of 14 the intestinal flora by inhibit ing the growth of pathogenic bacteria and enabling the 15 proliferation of beneficial bacteria.238 SCFAs also have direct antimicrobial activity against 16 bacterial pathogens by diffusi ng across the bacterial membrane and reduci ng the intracellular 17 pH. In particular, b utyrate has a positive effect on epithelial integrity and tight junction 18 permeability .229, 239 Butyrate enhances the intestinal barrier by facilitating tight junction 19 assembly via activation of AMP -activated protein kinase240 and up-regulati ng the tight 20 junction protein Claudin -1 transcription .241 Additionally, butyrate increased mRNA 21 expression and protein abundance of claudins -3 and 4 and influenced intracellular ATP 22 concentration in a dose -dependent manner. 23 From another perspective, it is well documented that several polysaccharides (e.g., 24 dextran, inulin, chondroitin sulfate, cyclodextrin, and hyaluronan) are stable within the 25 stomach and intestinal environment but are degraded in the colon by the colonic bacterial 26 flora.242, 243 These characteristics ha ve driven scientists to investigate the possibility of using 27 them as drug carrier s to deliver API in the inflamed region of the colon selectively . 28 Accordingly, many studies have flourished while formulating different p olysaccharide - 29 micro/nanocarriers .244-248 30 The main polysaccharides used for design ing nanoparticle s for IBD treatment are 31 chitosan, hyaluronic aci d, pectin s, alginate s, and inulin (Table 5) .249 Other polysaccharides for 32 IBD have also been reported , such as xanthan gum and guar gum .250, 251 Hereafter, 33 28 polysaccharide nanoparticles for IBD are summarized, and the structure -activity relationship 1 is discussed. 2 5.1. Chitosan 3 Chitosan is obtained by the partial deacetylation of chitin which is mainly derived from 4 the shells of crustaceans such as lobster, shrimp , or crab . It can also be found in fungi and 5 insects. Chitin is the second largest and most abundant polysaccharide in nature after 6 cellulose. It is responsible for mainta ining the fungal shape, strength, and cell's structural 7 integrity. Chitosan is a linear heteropolymer composed of -(1-4) linked N-acetyl -D- 8 glucosamine and D-glucosamine. The molecular weight and the degree of acetylation (DA) 9 are essential characteristics of chitosan. The DA of chitosan ( ) represent s the fraction 10 of N-acetyl -D- glucosamine relative to the total number of units. Contrary to chitin ( 11 ), which is insoluble in aqueous and many organic solvents, chitosan is hydrophilic and 12 soluble in acidic solutions , while the amine groups present on the macromolecule are 13 protonated . Chitosan with low DA and low molecular weight has increased solubility in 14 water. 15 However, the physi cochemical properties of chitosan derived from the deacetylation of 16 chitin from crustaceans are heterogeneous , depending o n the raw material source.252 More 17 recently, chitosan was produced from chitin contained in selected fungi' cell walls and septa. Chitosan from fungi is 19 characterized by low molecular weight (e.g. , 45 kDa)253 can be directly extracted from the raw 20 material without need ing thermal or chemical depolymerization. 21 Due to its intrinsic anti -inflammatory, healing, and immunomodulatory activity , chitosan 22 is the most cited polysaccharide in develop ing nanoparticulate DDS for IBD.249 It is the only 23 cationic polysaccharide used to develop positively charged nanoparticulate DDS. The net 24 positive charge of chitosan nanoparticle s confers mucoadhesive properties through the 25 electrostatic interactions with negatively charged mucins.254 Chitosan interacts with 26 negatively charge d proteoglycan on the cell surface . It increases cell permeability by 27 reversibly acting on paracellular and intracellular pathways of epithelial cells .255, 256 28 Nanoparticle intrinsic activity was further improved by functionalizing chitosan to natural 29 molecules such as gingerol, used for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.257 The 30 s composed of chitosan covalently linked to gingerol , -21 mV) 31 were successfully used for the encapsulation and the controlled release of 5 -ASA. Although in 32 29 vivo evaluations were not yet performed using those nanoparticle s, size and charge properties , 1 as well as drug release control , could be favorable in vivo for the treatment of IBD.257 2 Due to its solubility in acidi c media, chitosan -based nanoparticle s could exhibit a 3 premature release of the drug before reaching the colon . Different strategies were thus 4 envisioned to improve colon -specific drug delivery in IBD. Chemical crosslinking tripolyphosphate (TPP) ) are the most commonly 6 used method s to make chitosan nanoparticle s insoluble in acidic medi a.258, 259 7 Hybrid multifunctional nanoparticle s composed of a blend of chitosan and anionic 8 polysaccharide s such or 9 carboxymethyl starch269 showed promise to deliver the drug to the colon and to control its 10 release . Ahmed et al. ,258 demonstrated that the administration of taurine encapsulated in 11 chitosan/pectin nanoparticle s exerted beneficial effects in induced colitis in rats thanks to their 12 anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The nanoparticle s ( , 48 mV) were 13 prepared by ionic gelation and crosslinked with sodium TPP. However, at pH 6.4, a burst 14 release was observed after the first 30 min follow ed by a slower release over 4 h.258 Coating 15 of nanoparticle s composed of chitosan/TPP with Eudragit (FS30D ),140 confers a sustained 16 release and a pH stimulated delivery of the encapsulated active drug in addition to a good 17 accumulation in the colonic region of UC-induced rats .140 Nanoparticle s composed of chitosan oligosaccharide, alginate , and Eudragit S100 demonstrated pH - 19 dependent release of dexamethasone with a limited initial burst release in acidic pH. The 20 nanoparticle s exhibited significant therapeutic activity in a colitis -induced mouse model.270 21 The chemical grafting of recognition ligands on chitosan nanoparticle s further improve d 22 the targeting of the immune cells in the inflamed colon . Galactosylated chitosan nanoparticle s 23 were mainly encapsulation of TNF - siRNA or Map4k4 siRNA to increase the 24 cellular uptake by activated macrophages through the galactose -mediated receptor.201, 271, 272 25 Major results revealed that galactosylated nanoparticle s that have a high binding affinity for 26 siRNA showed enhanced in vivo anti -inflammatory efficacy in a mouse model of UC.201, 271 27 To learn more about chitosan nanoparticle -mediated gene therapy strategies for mitigating 28 IBD, see the review of Verma et al.16 29 5.2. Hyaluronan 30 Hyaluronan (HA), a nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan , is an essential component of the 31 vertebrate extracellular matrix, where it is naturally present at relatively high concentrations 32 30 in the extracellular matrix, especially of soft connective tissues (e.g., skin, vitreous humor, 1 synovial fluid, umbilical cord). Viruses and bacteria also produced HA.273 HA is a linear 2 heteropolysaccharide composed of repeating -1,4 bond disaccharide units of D-glucuronic 3 acid and N-acetyl -D-glucosamine linked together through -1,3 glycosidic bonds. HA is a 4 polyanionic polysaccharide. The HA molecule is negatively charged when the pH is higher 5 than the pKa of HA carboxyl groups ( ). 6 HA is implicated in various physiological functions in the intercellular matrix (e.g. , 7 homeostasis of water and plasma protein ). HA is either anchored firmly in the plasma 8 membrane or bond via HA-specific binding proteins. Among those receptors, called 9 hyaldherins, CD44 is a transme mbrane receptor known to play a critical role in 10 inflammati on.274 11 HA has a variable molecular weight depending on the source of production. It is highly 12 polydisperse and varies from 2 kDa to . The rheological properties of HA are 13 dependent on the HA molecular weight. In water, HA has a semi -flexible structure adopting a 14 worm -like random coil. The radius of gyration, depends on the molecular weight of HA as 15 follows .275 HA has intrinsic healing and anti -inflammatory properties 16 that rely on the HA molecular weight. While high molecular weight HA (HMw -HA) has anti- 17 inflammatory activity , low molecular weight HA (LMw -HA) activat es an innate immune 18 response. Also, the affinity toward hyaldherins such as CD44 and RHAMM (receptor for HA - 19 mediated motility, designated as CD168) was controlled by the Mw of HA in solution or 20 grafted on the particle surface.276, 277 Surface plasmon resonance experiments revea led that 21 low molecular weight HA nanoparticle s (6.4 kDa) exhibited low binding to CD44 receptor, 22 while high molecular weight HA nanoparticle s (1500 kDa) had a high binding affinity .276 23 Intensive research investigations were focused on designing HA functionalized 24 nanoparticle s as a vehicle for active drugs to alleviate IBD (e.g., bilirubin,278 Lysine The drug is either 26 encapsulated or covalently linked to HA nanoparticle s. It was demonstrated that CD44 27 overexpress ion on the surface of inflamed intestinal epithelial cells281 and proinflammatory 28 macrophages278 contributed to the accumulation of HA nanoparticle s in the inflamed colonic 29 tissue in DSS-induced colitis mice .278 In addition to the eEPR effect, the glycoside cluster 30 provided by dense HA on nanoparticle surface contributes to higher receptor -mediated 31 interaction with cells.282 This property was exploited for the intracellular delivery of nucleic 32 31 acids . CD44 targeting HA nanoparticle s can selectively deliver siRNA (silencing TNF - or 1 CD98 ) to peritoneal leading to downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines.215 2 HA nanoparticles act on the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin -1, which are tight 3 junction -associated proteins that play pivotal roles in gut homeostasis .279 DSS-colitis mice 4 orally administered with HA nanoparticles covalently linked to bilirubin normalized the 5 expression patterns and messenger RNA levels of ZO -1 and occludin -1, while other control 6 groups, including free HA, and the association of HA and bilirubin had minimal impact.278 7 Furthermore, the same study reported the role of HA nanoparticles conjugated to bilirubin in 8 restoring intestinal barrier functions and reduc ing the level of apoptosis in the colonic 9 epithelium. This formulation significantly reduced the local levels of proinflammatory 10 cytokines, such as IL -1, TNF -, and IL -6, while increasing the levels of anti -inflammatory 11 IL-10 and TGF - cytokines.278 12 HA nanopartic les also modulate the gut microbiota, increasing the overall richness and 13 diversity. HA nanoparticle s covalently linked to bilirubin markedly increased the abundance 14 of Akkermansia muciniphila (known to be associated with protective intestinal barrier 15 functions283) and Clostridium XIV, which are microorganisms with crucial role s in gut 16 homeostasis. 17 5.3. Pectin s 18 Pectins are a class of complex polysaccharides extracted from most terrestrial plants' cell 19 walls, where they exert a function of controlling the movement of water and cementing for the 20 cellulosic network .284 They are known for their ability to form gel s in the presence of calcium 21 ions, solutes , or at low pH . Pectin s are mainly composed of a linea r chain of a homopolymer 22 of -(1,4) -D-galacturonic acid . The carboxylic acid groups on the backbone are methyl 23 esterified at various degrees , thus controlling the gelling properties of pectin s.285 Pectins are a 24 class of block copolymers because t he linear chain termed 'smooth region' is occasionally 25 interrupted by side chains composed of rhamnogalactomannan. This heteropolymer alternates 26 (1,2)--L-rhamnosyl -(1-4)--D-galacturonic acid disaccharide units . These neutral chains tend 27 to be gathered into particular areas of the pectin molecule are called 'hairy regions' . There 28 may be different branched blocks in pectins from one cell wall or even within a single pectin 29 molecule. Notably, pectins with high hairy regions are less stable at low pH than pectins with 30 smooth re gions. 31 32 Pectins possess intrinsic anti -inflammatory activity depending on the degree of 1 methylesterification.286 Low methylesterification pectin s would be a more efficient anti - 2 inflammatory agent than high methyleste rification pectin s upon oral administration.286 Low 3 methylesterification pectin inhibit ed local and systemic inflammation, whereas high 4 methylesterification pectin s prevent ed intestinal inflammation.286 When administered orally, 5 pectin s are subject to biodegradation by colonic bacteria . This property makes it ideal for 6 targeted drug delivery to the colon .287 In particular, pectins with low hairy regions and low 7 methylesterification are more subject to degradation in the colon have been widely used to 8 design colon -specific nanoparticulate DDS for the treatment of IBD . In addition to these 9 advantages, pectins are known for their mucoadhesive properties ,288 making them ideal 10 candidates to design colon -specific nanoparticulate DDS to alleviate IBD. 11 In a recent work conducted by Yener et al .,289 pectin -based nanoparticle ameliorate colonic fibrosis, 13 oxidative stress , and inflammatory parameters of the colon. Melatonin was used as an 14 antioxidant, anti -inflammatory , and radical scavenger drug. The nanoparticle s formed by the 15 polyelectrolyte complexation method us ing CaCl 2 had a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 75 16 nm and zeta potential of 24 mV. The same study revealed that pectin nanoparticle s were 40 17 times more adherent to the inflamed rat's colon than the healthy colon mucosa , where the 18 drug is released .289 19 The efficacy of pectin nanoparticle s was further improved by adding HA in the 20 formulation. The resulting hybrid particles (284 nm in size) were used to encapsulat e Rhein as 21 a natural anti -inflammatory ingredient.290 According to physicochemical characterizations, the 22 HA is located on the nanoparticle s' outer shell that actively target s macrophages through 23 CD44 -mediated endocytosis . Biological evaluations revealed that the nanoparticle s 24 accumulated in the inflamed area of the colon of a DSS -induced UC mouse model . The 25 nanoparticle s protected the intestinal barrier of UC m ice by acting on tight junction proteins. 26 5.4. Inulin 27 Inulin is a natural fructose polymer mainly derived from plants . Examples of plants that 28 contain large quantities of inulin are Jerusalem artichoke , chicory root, asparagus root . It can 29 also be found in consumed vegetables such as onion, banana, leek, garlic, rye, barley, and 30 wheat. Inulin consists of linear chains of D-fructose units ( ) linked by -(2,1)- 31 glycosidic bonds and a terminal glucose residue (For rev iew article on inulin structure and 32 33 physicochemical properties see reference291). Inulin containing a maximum 10 fructose units 1 is also referred to as oligofructose. Inulin had several intrinsic biological properties , such as 2 anti-inflammatory activity . It can promote the proliferation of beneficial intestinal bac teria 3 (e.g., Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus ) and maintain intestinal micro -ecological balance 4 and host health.292, 293 In a pilo t study, inulin -type fructans orally administered to patients with 5 active UC induced functional but not compositional shifts of the gut microbiota. High dose 6 administration of inulin -type fructans increased and ed SCFA levels.294 8 Inulin is a potential candidate for drug delivery to the colon because the presence of - 9 (2,1)-glycosidic bonds prevents its degradation in the upper part of the GI tract, while it gets 10 degraded in the colon by colonic enzymes (e.g. , ptyalin and amylase, which are adapted to 11 digesting starch)295 and bacteria ( Bifidobacteria ).296 12 Inulin has in which decreases with 14 hydroxyls present inulin backbone to deliver hydrophobic drugs like 15 glucocorticoids (e.g. budesonide) or nitroimidazole (e.g. , ornidazole)300 -loaded carboxymethyl inulin nanoparticles 17 accumulate in inflamed colon tissue. Th ose systems showed enzyme - redox - and/or pH- 18 sensitive properties allowing a specific drug release into the inflamed colon .298, 299 19 It has been reported that apremilast -loaded inulin nanoparticle s can be coupled as a macrophage -targeting ligand .197 Apremi last was used as a model anti - 21 inflammatory drug for the treatment of IBD.301 Mannosylated nanoparticle s showed greater 22 uptake in inflamed macrophage s than the untreated macrophage and mannose receptor - 23 negative cell lines. In vivo biodistribution exhibited 60% of mannosylated nanoparticle s 24 accumulated in the inflamed colon of UC mice. In addition to the colon -targeting property and 25 anti-inflammatory activity of inulin, macrophage -targeted drug delivery could have promise 26 for the treatment of IBD.197 27 Table 5: A list of significant polysaccharides used to monitor IBD . 28 Polysaccharides Origin Role in IBD Chitosan Exoskeleton of crustaceans302, 303 The c ell wall of Different aspects of chitosan were explored for the monitoring of IBD: 1- As a carrier of conventional drugs due to its upper GI tract resistance properties306 34 fungi304, 305 2- As a drug, where it can regulate d ifferent mechanisms: - Increasing the number of probiotics that regenerate the microbiota balance307, 308 - Protecting the intestinal integrity by modulating the inflammation and oxidative stress309 - Down -regulat ing the levels of macrophage - inflammatory protein (MIP) -2 in the serum. - Up-regulat ing the frequency of FoxP3+ T cells, which prevent the auto -immune attacks. Hyaluronan (HA) Various origins Traditionally: extraction from rooster combs Nowadays: streptococcal fermentation HA is one of the glycosaminoglycans that is a significant component of the extracellular matrix of the intestinal mucosa,310 where it has a crucial function of maintaining the translocation of luminal content into the general circulation. Although its mechanism of action is not yet fully understood, HA plays a significant role in immuno -inflammatory process due to its high affinity to the CD44 receptors that are overexpressed by the endothelial cells of the inflamed colonic segments. These receptors are crucial for infiltrati ng immune cells (e.g., monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils) in the inflamed tissues to aggravate the inflammation. Accordingly, the selective binding of HA to endothelial CD44 receptors during an inflammatory process will hamper the recruitment of immune cells.311-313 In another study, Chen et al., explored the anti-inflammatory potential of high molecular HA (HM W-HA) in reducing inflammation through a Toll -like receptor 4 (TLR4) modulation.314 Indeed, TLR4 are widely distributed in the colon ,315 and they play a pivotal role in the colonic defense system. Their results confirmed their th eory as HM w-HA reduced the TNBS induced colitis in wild -type mice but not in TLR4/ mice. Pectin s Various origins (e.g., orange, citrus, apple) According to the origin of the extracted pectin s, their role in IBD was reported to be different. Indeed, in one study, authors reported that pre -feeding mice with a side chain content of orange -extracted pectin s had a protective effect of a TNBS - induced inflammation, whereas the pre -feeding with citrus - extracted pectin s did not improve the clinical symptoms.316 Pectin s have a powerful impact on the downregulation of nuclear factor (NF) -B p65 that is directly implicated in the (e.g., wheat, garlic, leeks, artichokes, is reported to protect the intestinal mucosa due to its ability to enrich the mucosal intestine with probiotics. Indeed, Hino et al., suggest ed that a TNBS -induced colitis healing in rats could be a consequence of an increase in the number of lactic acid -producing bacteria following the ingestion of short - chain inulin -like fructan.319 More recently, similar data were obtained at the clinical level, where inulin -type fructan show ed 35 clinical benefits in UC, as 77% of the patients showed a clinical response.294 Guar gum Guar beans251 Guar gum participates in prevent ing and reduc ing UC by promoting the production of SCFAs. In a TNBS colitis model, it was demonstrated that partially hydro lyzed guar hum participated in the reduction of proinflammatory -cytokines, immune cells infiltration in the intestinal mucosa, and myeloperoxidase activity. Furthermore, another study reflected the wound healing of colonic epithelial cells and the repair o f intestinal mucosa following the administration of partially hydroly zed guar gum. The authors suggested that these observations would be a consequence of an up -regulation of extracellular signal -regulated kinases 1 and 2. 1 36 7. Challenges and future directions 1 Nowadays, monitoring IBD rel ies on conventional drugs to prevent inflammation, 2 alleviat e the active phase , o r modulat e the immune response while using 3 immunosuppressant s. Nonetheless, using these drugs is often limited by either poor clinical 4 efficiency or numerous side effects. Although the new biological therapies relying on the 5 administration of monoclonal antibodies offer better management of the disease, their cost 6 remains an obstacle for their ubiquitous use. Technological advances in desi gning 7 nanoparticle -based therapies permitted the oral delivery of various drugs that would have 8 found hurdles to reach the inflamed segment of the intestine after an oral administration. 9 Nanoparticles exhibited many properties that make them suitable for the oral delivery of 10 active drugs to alleviate IBD (e.g., ability to diffuse through mucus layer, mucoadhesi ve 11 properties , passive targeting of the inflamed colon , and cell penetrability ). 12 Polysaccharides, initially used for colon -specific drug delivery due to their 13 biodegradability by bacterial enzymes , appear to be promising materials for designing 14 nanoparticula te DDS for IBD treatment. The biocompatibility and the intrinsic activity of the 15 polysaccharides, together with the advantages of the nanoparticulate systems, offer 16 exceptional results in alleviating IBD. The most cited polysaccharides for IBD a re chitosan 17 and alginates. More recently , other polysaccharides were also investigated to alleviate IBD , 18 such as hyaluronan, pectins , and those polysaccharides in combination (e.g. , 19 pectin and HA) is particularly interesting because it leads to multifunctional nanosystems with 20 controlled properties such as drug release and rec eptor -mediated targeting. Furthermore, the 21 synergism between the drug and the polysaccharide that have an intrinsic biological activity 22 should be further explored in the future. Cui et al.,126 recently reviewed this synergism 23 between the drugs and polysaccharide -based carriers . 24 Overall, the results depicted from the numerous studies which investigated the use of 25 polysaccharides as delivery systems are encouraging. Nonetheless, several hurdles need to be 26 tackled. Most of the polysaccharides are both polymolecular and polydisperse . Their 27 composition varies with the source and conditions of extraction, location, and other 28 environmental factors . Thanks to fungi and bacteria fermentation processes, the sources of 29 polysaccharides production have been diversified over recent years. Additional efforts should 30 be made in this area to produce polysac charides in reproducible and controlled manners. 31 37 A significant area of concern is to develop standardized methods for the in vitro 1 evaluation of drug behaviors in simulated media of disease patients. Indeed, the simulated 2 media usually used for in vitro i nvestigations rather mimic healthy patients than patients 3 suffering from IBD. IBD patients suffer from several physiological changes compared to 4 healthy subjects. Those changes include pH in the GI tract, gut microbiota alteration , and 5 variations in the colonic enzymes. This standardization should allow a better comparison 6 between different research groups and a better correlation between in vitro and in vivo 7 situations in humans. Furthermore, the models used to evaluate the mucoadh esion and the 8 mucopenetration of nano -drug delivery were usually performed on mucus from healthy 9 animals . In contrast, several changes in mucus, structure, composition, and viscoelastic 10 properties were reported with the mucus of patients suffering from IBD . Alternative methods 11 to evaluat e the behaviors of nanoparticle s toward mucus from animal models with induced 12 inflammation should be developed. 13 Due to the complexity of IBD pathophysiology, the DSS and TNBS colitis models are far 14 from mimicking the disease in humans. Passive targeting using eEPR was found to be weaker 15 in humans compared to animal models. It has been increasingly clear that the intestinal 16 microbiome is different in mice and humans. The pH in the mouse stomach varies from pH 17 2.7 to 4.1, while in humans , it can go down to pH 1 .320 However, the intestinal pH in mice 18 was lower than in humans. Transit time, the mucus growth rate, and thickness are also 19 different in mice and humans .321 Mice mucus show s different levels of glycan profiles than 20 humans. For a review article see reference 322. Furthermore, only a few percent of the 21 bacterial gene are shared between mice and humans.322 Some receptors expressed by cells in 22 mice are different from those in humans. Accurate animal model s that mimic human IBD 23 disease need to be developed in the future . Efforts were recently stressed on developing 24 humanized mouse model s,323-325 or using large mammal ian models such as pigs.326 25 Over the recent years, r eceptor -mediated targeting of immune cells showed promising 26 preclinical results compared to non -targeted nanoparticulate DDS. However, the analysis of 27 research articles in this field revealed that targeting strategies mainly focus on mannose 28 receptor, CD44 , and galactose agglutinin , while there ar e various receptors or cell adhesion 29 molecules that are upregulated in the colon tissues of IBD .327-330 Those receptors and cell 30 adhesion molecules are still not applied to design targeted nanoparticle s. Also, efforts should 31 be devoted to understanding additional molecules implicated in the pathological process of 32 IBD. 33 38 Another hurdle is related to the low encapsulation efficiency and the premature drug 1 release of the encapsulated drug . Low encapsulation efficiency and p remature drug relea se 2 were tackled through the covalent linkage of the drug to the polysaccharide .331-334 Compared 3 with physical encapsulation, t he prod rug strategy was explored for developing smart - 4 responsive drug -polysaccharides conjugates.331 In these systems, the drug was released under 5 stimulus (e.g., pH , ROS , enzymes ) for specific drug delivery at the site of inflammation.298, 6 331, 335 However, the prodrug strategy could be limited by the availab ility of the appropriate 7 functional groups of the drugs to be conjugated to the polysaccharide. 8 Finally, from a technological point of view, there are several well -known hurdles related 9 to complex manufacturing processes of nanoparticles , the difficulty of scalability , and poor 10 reproducibility.336 These issues should be addressed by taking advantage of the considerable 11 progress in the nanomedicine field these two last years. T he psychological barrier to the 12 clinical development of nanomedicines has been broken with the planetary commercialization 13 of COVID vaccines composed of lipidic nanoparticles. The latest advances in lipid 14 nanoparticles will undoubtedly orient future research works in the nanotechnology field. 15 Today , we can rapidly overcome the technological and regulatory issues related to 16 nanoparticle preparation and treatment processes after their preparations . 17 8. Conclusion 18 IBD remains one of the most challenging and less understandable diseases of the 21st 19 century. Over the last couple of years, numerous medical and technological advances have 20 allowed a better comprehension of the pathophysiology of IBD. Understanding 21 immunological and proinflammatory signa lling cascades has opened new avenues in 22 monitoring the disease. Developing biological treatments relying on administrating 23 monoclonal a ntibodies or siRNA targeting proinflammatory cytokines has gained much 24 interest. Nonetheless, biologics are associated with some shortcomings , such as their 25 expensive treatment or their reported loss of efficacy , partly because of the formation of anti- 26 drug antibodies (ADAbs). Within these circumstances, new strategies are under investigation 27 to develop new management protocols for IBD symptoms. Such strategies include 28 nanotechnology or polysaccharide -based therapies. The principal target behind usi ng 29 engineered nanoparticles is to deliver a lower drug dosage to reach a higher therapeutic 30 response. This strategy is possible because nanoparticle s can target the API directly to the 31 inflamed region of the colon, allowing to avoid the numerous systemic s ide effects of the 32 39 current medicines. Another characteristic of nanoparticle s is their ability to protect fragile 1 drugs from degradation in the harsh GI tract environments, allowing them to reach their site 2 of action. More recently, polysaccharide -based therapies are gaining more interest as potential 3 molecules for the monitoring of IBD. In fact, in addition to their high safety and low systemic 4 side effects, polysaccharides were reported in numerous studies to play a prime role in 5 regulating the inflammatory cytokines, the intestinal microbiome, and the immune system. 6 These characteristics put polysaccharides on the spot of being a n exciting alternative for 7 currently available drugs. 8 9.
