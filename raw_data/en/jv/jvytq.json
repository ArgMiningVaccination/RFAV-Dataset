Ranked sixth among medical schools in the nation, the School takes pride in being an inclusive community of outstanding learners, investigators, clinicians, and staff where interdisciplinary collaboration is embraced and great ideas accelerate translation of fundamental scientific discoveries to improve human health locally and around the globe. Composed of more than 2,500 faculty physicians and researchers, more than 1,300 students, and more than 6,000 staff, the Duke University School of Medicine along with the Duke University School of Nursing, Duke University Health System and the Private Diagnostic Clinic (PDC) comprise Duke Health. a world-class academic medical center. The Health System encompasses Duke University Hospital, Duke Regional Hospital, Duke Raleigh Hospital, Duke Primary Care, Duke Home and Hospice, Duke Health and Wellness, and multiple affiliations. The Duke Toxicology Program at the Occupational and Environmental Medicine Division (OEM) provides toxicological evaluations and risk assessments for potentially hazardous substances in consumer and commercial arts and craft product formulations. Evaluations include an assessment for regulatory compliance against federal, state, and international laws regulating consumer product hazard labeling and worker hazard communication. In addition to expert toxicological judgment, the evaluation process includes the application of a Toxicology Data Base Management System (DMS). The DMS is an internally-developed computerized expert system that applies toxicological risk assessment paradigms to produce confidential reports to clients. The DMS requires accurate input of qualitative and quantitative product information. Constituent data are acquired from laboratory analytical reports, published articles, proprietary research, and regulatory sources. The staff that supports the program require specific skill sets and the ability to work with the DMS. JOB RESPONSIBILITIES: The Research Scientist will learn using the DMS to review and evaluate product formulations and technical materials. This activity requires training in order to provide toxicological assessment of consumer products in accordance with US Federal consumer product regulations such as FHSA/LHAMA/CPSA, Canadian Consumer Product regulations, and specific European Union consumer product regulations. More specifically: - Learn to utilize the DMS for evaluating and interpreting chemical formulations and product descriptions. - Convert and use information regarding analytical concentration data. - Learn to utilize information provided in research reports regarding toxicological evaluations and risk assessments. - Learn to use a risk assessment approach for toxicological evaluations and establishing threshold levels for exposure. - Maintain confidentiality regarding topics of proprietary origin and impact. - Learn to utilize the computer data management system effectively. - Communicate effectively and amicably with group members, data suppliers and clients. - Establish professional interaction with several consumer product certifying organizations including their staff, technical committees and boards of directors. - Interact in an efficient manner with toxicology, technical, and administrative staff. MINIUMUM REQUIREMENTS OF POSITION: A. Minimum Education and Training: - Ph.D. in Toxicology, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Physiology or a related field. B. Minimum experience, length of years and type: - This is an entry level position for an Early Career Ph.D. toxicologist - Will consider a recent Ph.D. graduate with no postdoctoral experience, but some post-doctoral experience is preferred, particularly in applied toxicology, new approach toxicity-testing methodologies, dose-response analysis, and human health chemical risk assessment C. Special knowledge, abilities, skills, physical requirements or other factors: - Knowledge of toxicological principles and mechanisms (chemical and biological), dose determinants, and laboratory testing methods. - Experience in the application of new computational toxicology methods for evaluating product safety - Experience with working in a technical/administrative team environment is a plus. D. Licenses, certificates or registration required: None is required.
