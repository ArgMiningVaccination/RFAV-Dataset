We are accomplishing this through two avenues. BAES Infrastructure is a diversified energy company created by Buckeye to focus on the development, construction, and operation of energy transition projects. Additionally, we are working to reduce the carbon impact of our operations and, where it makes sense, to adapt our existing liquid petroleum products infrastructure to facilitate the needs of our customers and end-users as they transition to cleaner energy alternatives. Our Alternative Energy Strategy in Action BAES Infrastructure BAES Infrastructure is a diversified energy company focused on developing early-stage, technology-ready energy transition projects across a variety of end products, energy value chains, and investment structures. It was created by Buckeye to pursue new energy transition-related opportunities, with its seed assets being Swift Current Energy, OneH2, Bear Head Energy, a low carbon hydrogen and ammonia project under development in South Texas, and other advanced-stage solar development projects. It leverages the operating expertise, reputation, customer base, asset footprint, and global industry network of Buckeye and other stakeholders to develop and invest in the infrastructure solutions enabling the global energy transition.

Facilitating the Movement of Cleaner Fuels Buckeye Partners is adapting and repurposing existing infrastructure at our Perth Amboy terminal in New Jersey to enable the aggregation, storage, blending, and distribution of biofuels and bio-blendstocks. Upon completion of this project, our Perth Amboy terminal is expected to be the single largest distribution point for biomass-based diesel in the region. Through these efforts, we are facilitating the needs of one of our key customers, enabling them to become one of the largest suppliers of biomass-based diesel in the Northeast U.S. We are also repurposing our existing infrastructure and capabilities to deliver sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to customers and end users in the Northeast. The utilization of SAF, a low-emission jet fuel made from sustainable and renewable sources, will be a key driver in the reduction of aviation emissions, and we are committed to facilitating its growing use. In June 2022, in partnership with Neste, Colonial Pipeline Company, and Delta Air Lines, we played a critical role in a milestone delivery of SAF to New York's LaGuardia Airport for the first time. Leveraging our infrastructure and capabilities to increase the accessibility of SAF stems from our commitment to supporting partners, like these, who are at the forefront of the energy industry's evolution.
