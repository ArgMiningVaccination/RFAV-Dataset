How to make DIY bug spray with hydrosols Sometimes, you might not want to use essential oils in your natural bug spray. Maybe the essential oils are too strong for your nose, or you're going to blend for children or pets and don't want something so highly concentrated. (We'll talk more about that below, in the Essential Oil Safety section.) For now, allow us to introduce you to hydrosols! [What's a hydrosol?](/en-gb/blogs/wellness/what-is-a-hydrosol) When an aromatic plant is steam distilled, it's placed in a still with water. Then the still is heated. The heat releases the plant's essential oil . . . and the water itself becomes infused with therapeutic, aromatic properties. The steam becomes the hydrosol! Hydrosols are very gentle, and yet rich with therapeutic properties. They are just right when we don't want to use essential oils! Here are a few hydrosols we love for natural bug repellent recipes! hydrosols in your natural bug repellent: - Mix a couple of hydrosols from the list above in a (PET) plastic or glass bottle with an atomizer for a repellent spray that can go with you. - Boost your hydrosol with a few drops of essential oil.

Shop Essential Oils for Bugs When we need to protect ourselves from itchy bites, stings, and insect-borne illnesses, natural bug repellent offers a safer alternative to the chemical-laden bug repellents on the market. [Shop this collection of essential oils](https://aromatics-oils.myshopify.com/collections/essential-oils-for-bugs) for bugs, and take back your summer! Essential oil safety This part is important! Let's go over a few safety considerations for using essential oils on your skin, for children, and for pets. Skin Some essential oils might cause skin irritation, sensitization, or phototoxic reactions. Look for dilution recommendations, potential phototoxicity, and medication contraindications when you're purchasing your oils. - Use oils that may cause skin irritation or sensitization in low dilutions. 6 drops in 1 oz. of carrier is a 1% dilution, and that's a good place to start. - Phototoxic oils should be highly diluted if applied to skin exposed to sunlight. A \"phototoxic\" oil can cause skin reactions if it's applied topically, and then that skin is exposed to sunlight or a tanning bed. Many citrus essential oils are phototoxic. You can find safe dilution ratios in the \"Safety & Shelf Life\" sections of the product pages. For easy reference, here are some safe drop counts for the following phototoxic oils: - [Lemon Oil](/en-gb/products/lemon-essential-oil)(Citrus limon) \u2014 Use 12 drops or less per 1 oz of carrier - [Bergamot Oil](/en-gb/products/bergamot-essential-oil)(Citrus bergamia) \u2014 Use 1 or 2 drops or less per 1 oz of carrier (Bergamot is VERY phototoxic!) - [Grapefruit Oil](/en-gb/products/grapefruit-rose-essential-oil)(Citrus paradisi) \u2014 Use 24 drops or less per 1 oz of carrier - [Lime Oil](/en-gb/products/lime-essential-oil)(cold-pressed) (Citrus aurantifolia) \u2014 Use 4 drops or less per 1 oz of carrier. (Please note that only cold-pressed lime is phototoxic. Our lime essential oil is steam distilled, which removes the phototoxic components. But be sure to check the production method of your lime oil, and be careful with any lime essential oil that has been cold pressed!) Using essential oils for children Little kids are . . . well . . . little! Their systems are smaller and more responsive than grown-ups'. When we're using essential oils for children, we like to be very selective about using gentle essential oils. We also reduce the dilution ratios, so kids don't get overwhelmed with too much essential oil. We suggest using essential oils for children who are at least five years old. For younger kids and babies, we like to stick with hydrosols. A few of our favorite essential oils to reduce bug bites for children are: - [Tea 1% dilution, which is 6 drops of essential oil in 1 oz. of carrier. Protect your pets from bugs! [Backcountry Bug Repellent Spray](https://www.aromatics.com/blogs/recipes/backcountry-bug-repellent-spray) We all want to protect our furry friends from pests! However, we can't recommend using essential oils for animals. Research is still ongoing in that area. But there's good news! You can use hydrosols for dogs and cats! When using hydrosols for your beloved pets, less is more. Use them in low dilutions, as animals are far more sensitive to their effects than humans. Here are a few tips! Tips for using hydrosols for pets: - Use hydrosols with caution. Some animals react differently than others. - Let your dog or cat choose the hydrosols by smelling them first. If they pull away and react like they do not like the smell, choose a different hydrosol. - Start small! Use just a few sprays, and observe your pet's behavior to ensure they don't have any adverse reactions. - Try using the hydrosols around the animal (instead of on the animal) to give your pet the ability to get away from the hydrosol if it is bothering them. - Making a natural bug repellent diffuser blend or a homemade citronella candle is an excellent option if your pet doesn't like the hydrosols. Again, be sure your pet is free to leave the area if the scent gets overwhelming for them. Which hydrosols are safe for pets? We like these hydrosols to help repel mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks for our dogs and cats: - [Catnip Hydrosol](/en-gb/products/catnip-hydrosol)(Nepeta cataria) (Cats LOVE this hydrosol!
