This includes dietary, lifestyle and mindset changes to help you be the best version of yourself. Why Did You Make The Decision To Become A Wahls Certified Health Professional? My main reason for becoming a Wahls Certified Health Professional was personal, my wife started developing M.S symptoms and was diagnosed with M.S. I had already read The Wahls Protocol\u00ae and I have been following Dr.Wahls' work for many years so I had no hesitation to start the training and get an in-depth knowledge of the Wahls Protocol\u00ae to help with my wife's recovery. How Has What You Learned Benefited Your Practice? The training has changed the way I work with many clients, especially clients with chronic health issues like autoimmune conditions and neurological conditions as the Wahls protocol can help a wide range of people and not just people with M.S - it's not just the nutrient-dense diet but the techniques to help people be more motivated to make the changes necessary to succeed.
