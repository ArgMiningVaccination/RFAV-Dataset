Idaho Medicaid administers comprehensive healthcare coverage for eligible Idahoans. Medicaid contracts with individual healthcare providers, agencies, institutions, and managed care entities to provide healthcare services for low -income people and families , including children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Medicaid participants have access to covered benefits through three plans that align with health needs: The Basic Plan is designed to meet the health needs of people in generally good health, without disabilities or special health needs. This plan provides health , prevention, and wellness benefits . Most participants will be in this benefit plan. The Enhanced Plan is for people with more complex needs and medical conditions, disabilities or special health needs , and people over the age of 65 . This plan has all the benefits of the Basic Plan, plus developmental disability services, children's service coordination, and long -term service s and supports . The Medicare -Medicaid Coordinated Plan is for people who are eligible and enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid , also known as dual eligibles. This plan has all the benefits of the Enhanced Plan , plus allows people to enroll in a managed c are plan to help coordinate Medicare and Medicaid benefits. There are many advantages to enrolling in managed care, one of the most valuable is access to a care coordinator who assists people with complex medical conditions to achieve better health. Heal th and Welfare has partnered with insurance companies to administer and provide coordinated health coverage between Medicare Part A (hospital insurance), Part B (medical insurance), Part D (drug coverage), and Medicaid through Medicare Advantage plans . There is no cost to you when you follow the plan rules and requirements. For more information you can visit Medicare at the links below: - Part A https://www.medicare.gov/wh -health -plans/medicare -advantage -plans 8 vs. Medicare People sometimes confuse Medicaid and Medicare . They are not the same, but they do work together to provide benefits for some Idaho r esidents who qualify for both.

You are an adult with an eligible child. You are blind or disabled (based on Social Security criteria). You are age 65 or older . If you or someone in your family needs healthcare, you should apply for Medicaid even if you are not sure you qualify. Some income and resources are not counted when determining your eligibility. For example, owning your home might not prevent you from getting Medicaid. Medicare Medicare is a federal program you might qualify for if : You are age 65 or older. You are age 18 or older with ESRD (End -Stage Renal Disease , permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant). You ha ve ALS ( Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, also called Lou Gehrig's disease). You are a younger person with a permanent disability. Some people qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare. If you are eligible for both, you may also be able to enroll in the Medicare -Medicaid Coordinated Plan. See page 19 for more information. Some people who do not qualify for full Medicaid benefits are eli gible for Qualified Medicare Beneficiary programs https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/6177 , where Medicaid helps pay for Medicare costs including: Monthly Medicare premiums. Co-insurance. Deductibles.

The Medicaid estate recovery program impacts two groups of people receiving Med icaid benefits: Anyone over the age of 55 who has received Medicaid assistance, and Anyone who is permanently institutionalized and has received Medicaid assistance, regardless of age. The estate recovery program may collect money from the estate of a de ceased Medicaid recipient as repayment for any medical care services that were provided to the recipient and paid for by Medicaid, while the recipient was over 55 years of age, or permanently institutionalized, regardless of age. Medical care includes a wide range of services, including nursing home and community based in -home care services. It also includes any hospital and prescription drug services the participant received while in a nursing home, or while receiving in -home care. Medi cal care also includes capitation payments to Medicaid contracted health insurance companies or medical providers administering a defined package of benefits. The federal government directs states to pursue Medicaid estate recovery for these services. 35 Federal law recognizes that the needs of certain relatives can take precedence over the state's interest in recovering assets from the deceased. For this reason, states are not allowed to pursue Medicaid estate recovery under the following circ umstances: During the lifetime of the surviving spouse, regardless of where he or she lives. From a surviving child who is under age 21 years or is blind or permanently disabled (based on Social Security criteria), regardless of where he or she lives. As individual circumstances vary, and for more information, please call the Estate Recovery Office at 866 -849-3843. 36 Who Can I Call If I Have Questions or Need Information?
