Greiner, PhD](/greinerlab/), and [David M. Harlan, MD](/harlanlab/), the goal of the UMass Diabetes Center of Excellence (DCOE) at UMass Chan Medical School is to prevent and cure diabetes. Our [DCOE research faculty](/dcoe/diabetes-research/diabetes-research-labs/) is gaining new knowledge of the disease by studying human tissues and human cells inside of our unique biological models, which mimic the human immune system. Understanding what causes diabetes will allow us to develop effective therapies, and ultimately find the cure.

During his first six months working with a diabetes coach, his A1c dropped from 8.5% to 7.8%. He credits his new continuous glucose monitor & weekly coaching calls with keeping him on track. [Michael's Story](/dcoe/diabetes-care/success-stories/2022/06/michael-orourke/) Jason Winters has been living with type 1 diabetes since he was 21 years old. After 10 years of uncontrolled blood sugars, his primary care physician referred him to the UMass Memorial Diabetes Center of Excellence. He arrived with a dangerously high A1c of 12.3% and today it's below 7%. His journey wasn't easy, but working with his care team and using the latest technology, Jason's diabetes is finally under control and his health "}
