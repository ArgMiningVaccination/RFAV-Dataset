Hi there! Have you been healthy these past few days? I hope you do, as habits will certainly create what kind of health you'll have in the future. As you know, the issue of the Osteopathic Doctor treating President Trump of Covid-19 was such big news. However, many doctors will contest that issue as osteopathic doctors are licensed physicians and surgeons in the US as well, similar to medical doctors and naturopaths. So, what is the difference between them? These are just three types of medicine: 1) Allopathic \"Allopathic medicine\" is a term used for modern or mainstream medicine. Other names for allopathic medicine include: - conventional medicine - mainstream medicine - Western medicine - orthodox medicine - biomedicine Allopathic medicine or mainstream medicine is a system of healthcare. It has had the most evidence-based scientific research, data collection, and drug testing. It's also the most regulated by a neutral party like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the American Medical Association. 2) Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), or integrative medicine. Alternative approaches by definition require stopping of all western medicine. Complementary and integrative medicine are commonly used along with mainstream medicine. These include: - homeopathy - naturopathy - chiropractic care - Chinese medicine - Ayurveda The term \"allopathic\" is most commonly used by CAM professionals to separate their type of medicine from mainstream medical practice. Homeopathic \"Homeopathic medicine\" is also known as homeopathy and is often added to mainstream medicine, used as a complementary/integrative approach. \"Homeo\" means \"similar to\" or \"like.\" This type of healthcare is often considered to be the opposite of allopathic medicine. Homeopathic practitioners aren't licensed medical doctors. Most homeopathy medicines are natural substances that come from plants or minerals Homeopathic treatments aren't prescription medications. Additionally, homeopathy medicines usually aren't regulated or tested like medications used in allopathic or mainstream medicine. Treatments and doses are different from person to person. There is some research emerging on the effectiveness of some remedies. Naturopathy is a system of complementary medicine that is based on the principle that the body has the inherent ability to heal itself. Combining evidence-based research with traditional healing methods, naturopaths utilize a variety of modalities such as herbal medicine, nutrition, and lifestyle changes to treat a wide range of conditions. Looking at each person as a whole, naturopaths aim to identify and treat the underlying cause of a condition, and not merely the symptoms. This means that treatment protocols are extremely unique to each different person; it is individualized healthcare. Ailments that respond particularly well to naturopathy include digestive disorders, hormone conditions, skin ailments, stress, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep disorders. 3) Osteopathic \"Osteopaths\" treat conditions with medical treatments as well as manipulation and massage of muscles, bones, and joints. A DO might recommend complementary treatments along with standard medications or procedures. In summary: No healthcare system is perfect. Combining homeopathic and other alternative medicine with allopathic or mainstream medicine might work in treating people with some types of illnesses or ailments. Any kind of medical treatment should be tailored to the individual and treat the whole person, not symptoms alone. Be sure your primary care healthcare practitioner is aware of all treatments you are "}
