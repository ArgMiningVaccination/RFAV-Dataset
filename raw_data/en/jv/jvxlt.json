This easy plan will cleanse you\u2014without driving you crazy. August 7, 2023 If you're looking for a vegan-friendly detox, the beginning of a new week is the perfect time to get started. Detoxing does not have to be extreme. There is no need to subject your body to harsh cleansing programs that leave you exhausted and unable to go about your day. Detoxing should leave you feeling energized, refreshed, and glowing! This simple three-day detox plan will start you off on the right foot to feeling and looking your best. What is a detox? A full-body detox or cleanse typically entails following a short-term diet or plan to help eliminate toxins from the body. Mikhail Nilov/Pexels It's important to note that our bodies already have mechanisms in place to help clean out harmful toxins naturally. In fact, detoxing is a part of regular organ function. The liver, kidneys, digestive system, lungs, and skin are all a part of the body's natural detoxing system and help eliminate any dangerous toxins; however, there are ways to support your body's natural detoxing. Are detox diets safe? If you're looking for a detox plan that best suits your lifestyle, it's always advised to consult your primary care physician first and foremost. After you're given the green light, it's best to avoid any cleanses that call for an excessive amount of \"detox supplements\" or \"detox products.\" This is largely due to the lack of regulations surrounding supplements. Cottonbro Studio/Pexels In the US, supplements do not have to undergo approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means that ingredients or benefits touted on supplement labels are not required to undergo official verification. In most cases, detox supplements are unlikely to deliver any results; however, there is a possibility they can lead to serious, damaging effects. According to medical professionals at the [University of Chicago Medicine](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/gastrointestinal-articles/do-detoxes-work), the best way to detox the body is to simply incorporate healthy habits that help the body detox itself naturally. Exercising regularly, eating healthy, and limiting alcohol are all ways to support the body's natural detoxing functions. The three-day detox plan anyone can do The Basics For the next three days, eliminate all sugars, alcohol, soda, processed food, grains, [gluten](https://vegnews.com/vegan-health-wellness/what-is-gluten-free-vegan-diet), and animal products from your diet. In their place, enjoy green juices, smoothies, and plant-based meals. The only sweetener recommended for use is [liquid stevia](https://amzn.to/3OJV7uE), which is all-natural, comes from a plant, and has zero glycemic impact. It is also very important to stay well hydrated by drinking water. Water is essential to help your body release toxins. The key is not to deprive your body but instead to flood it with nutrients to help it clean house. Upon Rising Take a high-quality [probiotic](https://vegnews.com/vegan-health-wellness/what-are-vegan-probiotics) supplement on an empty stomach with a glass of water, which will help replenish the beneficial bacteria in your gut and aid in digestion. [Dr. Ohhira's Probiotics](https://amzn.to/3Qr8pNJ) is a great brand and does not need to be refrigerated. Follow the probiotic with a glass of water with lemon juice. Lemon juice is highly alkalizing in the body and helps get your digestion going for the day. Breakfast Start your day with a green juice. The [chlorophyll](https://vegnews.com/vegan-health-wellness/chlorophyll-health-benefits-what-is-it) in greens oxygenates the body, which enables us to release stored toxins. Ideally this juice will be all greens, vegetables, and no fruit (except lemon). You can either make your own green juice at home or get one from your local pressed juice bar. A favorite combination is kale, cucumber, celery, lemon, and ginger, but if you feel like you need more for breakfast, have a little low sugar fruit such as apple or blueberries. Lunch Instead of a large lunch that takes tons of energy to digest, try having a nutrient-dense green smoothie instead. Green smoothies are an excellent way to pack a ton of nutrition into one glass. Your body can digest a smoothie much faster than a large meal, giving it plenty of time to focus on internal housekeeping! Here are three delicious ideas for nutrient-dense green smoothies. Simply combine all of the ingredients in a [high-powered blender](https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/shop/blenders?COUPON=06-094&cjevent=2343fa9b354a11ee82ad71e50a1cb82b&CID=aff&cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww), adjust the sweetness to taste, [Coconut-Pineapple Smoothie](http://vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=5687&catId=11) [Vegan Cherry Avocado Smoothie](https://vegnews.com/vegan-recipes/vegan-cherry-avocado-smoothie) Snack If you find yourself hungry between lunch and dinner, try snacking on cut up raw vegetables such as cucumber slices, celery, bell peppers, or carrots. If you are very hungry, a quarter to a half of an avocado mashed with sea salt and lemon is also a delicious option. Dinner Dinner should not be the largest, most dense meal of the day. At the end of the day, your body does not need as much energy to run around, allowing it to focus more on digesting. Also, the fast between dinner and the next day's breakfast is long enough to give your body time to process the meal. Begin each dinner with a [large green salad](https://vegnews.com/vegan-recipes/vegan-tahini-caesar-salad-with-smoked-chickpeas). This can be as simple as mixed greens topped with herbs and raw vegetables. You can also add a quarter of an avocado for density. For a dressing, toss the salad with avocado, lemon juice, and liquid stevia, and it will form a nice creamy dressing without the need for oil.

Then massage the kale with a quarter of an avocado, some lemon juice, and liquid stevia until the kale is soft and wilted. Top the salad with any raw vegetables you like. Keep your main course simple and satisfying. Have a [baked sweet potato](https://vegnews.com/2021/12/vegan-stuffed-sweet-potatoes) or squash such as butternut or acorn. You could also have some cooked non-starchy vegetables such as lightly saut\u00e9ed greens (use water not oil), roasted broccoli, or cauliflower. Be kind to your body while you detox. Get plenty of sleep, drink lots of water, and treat yourself to a massage. You will feel refreshed and glowing!
