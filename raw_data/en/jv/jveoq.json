Additional information Benefits At ANTHC we believe we achieve great things when our diverse workforce pulls together, unified in excellence. We also recognize that, in order to accomplish this, we must set up the workforce for success. Over the last year, we have had honest conversations about how we can ensure a high-quality work environment, so we can recruit and retain talent who are committed to providing high-quality care. This has led to making improvements to employee benefits and related policies. As we continue these conversations, we anticipate expanding on improvements to better meet the needs of our employees. New Compensation Philosophy Compensation is a key driver of employee satisfaction, and our compensation program holds market competitiveness and equity as important factors to attract and retain a high-performing and valued workforce. In support of this philosophy, ANTHC has developed a compensation program that will allow the organization to: - Pay competitive rates that are within an established range based on the midpoint of market, when compared to peers of a comparable industry, company size and/or location. - Compete for labor externally, while recognizing and reflecting internal relationships between jobs and departments. - Demonstrate commitment to an annual review of compensation structure and labor market to deliver continuous competitive and equitable compensation to our employees. - Value the whole person with a generous total-rewards strategy encompassing Compensation, Benefits, Work Life Effectiveness, Performance Management, Talent Development and Recognition. The implementation of the compensation program has translated to a pay increase for many employees currently with ANTHC. Prospective employees can also be assured that their offer is competitive, and compensation will continue to be competitive while employed at ANTHC. Benefits include: - Generous Paid Time Off (PTO) and holiday schedule. Four weeks paid vacation per year to start and 12 paid holidays. - Updated PTO policy: For employees who are returning to ANTHC and accrued eight or more hours of PTO per pay period previously can continue accruing eight hours of PTO per pay period instead of starting at six hours. - New!

This leave is paid out for two weeks and does not take away from paid parental leave should that also be needed. - Flexible work and schedule arrangements, including remote work for some job families. - More than 19 Federal health-care plans.
