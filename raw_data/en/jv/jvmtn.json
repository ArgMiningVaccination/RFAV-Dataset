Simon Sutherland Reiki Attunements - Quantum Healing - Bikram Yoga Formerly successfully worked in the fast pace London corporate world until a recurring dream in his early 30's lead to transformation both physically and spiritually. This transformation guided him to learn new fascinating techniques that cleared the fog in his brain which catapulted him to Thailand. His major awakening came in the physical form of a road traffic accident which attracted a hospital super bug infection, MRSA, in his tibia bone. Surgeons were keen to amputate his left leg on numerous occasion but Simon resisted this as he was convinced the healing modalities he had learnt would work. After 4yrs of battling with superbug and surgeons requesting to amputate his leg, he saved his leg and again defied the surgeons 100% prediction that he would never walk unaided again. Not only can he walk and run unaided, he can stand on the one leg for sustained periods of time which motivated him to certify as a Bikram teacher. PRIVATE QUANTUM HEALING SESSION These powerful healing sessions incorporate all of the modalities Simon learnt and used during his motionless years in hospital. He used Reiki energy, ho'opono healing technique and mindfulness meditation which he has proven to be successful in his own healing journey. PRIVATE SOULVANNA SESSION In this unique energy session not only experience the effectiveness of Reiki, simultaneously the Power and intelligence of the Soulvanna symbol will also be channeled.
