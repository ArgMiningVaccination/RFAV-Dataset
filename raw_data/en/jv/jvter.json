Then work on improving posture to reduce pain through hands-on practice. Being able to work effectively on a person's physical body is essential to restoring their overall balance and addressing blockages throughout their body. We cover balances for fascial trains, cranial, jaw, pelvis, neck, and the 7 primary movements. Body Psychology Discover a comprehensive system for unpacking the meaning of specific symptoms and their link to major psychological patterns, a person's behaviour and their body. Graduates are then empowered to use a world-renowned approach to work with clients on a deep psychological or psycho spiritual level, enabling them to make the changes they need to be well. Counselling & Practitioner Development We believe that the interaction between client and therapist is crucial to the outcome. We teach client-centred counselling techniques and have a unique practitioner development program so that you become the best practitioner you can be. Chinese Medicine Theory A unique inclusion to our mind body course, we draw from the 2,500-year strong wisdom of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Facilitating Change In a majority of cases, client problems stem from a common root. Through Mind Body Medicine, you can help people discover these root drivers and give them the motivation to change. You become a facilitator, helping them understand and recognize the deep-seated motivations behind the lifestyle patterns that are affecting their health and wellness. This unit integrates a very powerful counselling approach of bodywork and acupressure for resolving these patterns.
