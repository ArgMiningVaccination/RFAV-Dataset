Palliative care for children represents a special field of palliative care. WHO's definition of palliative care that is appropriate for children and their families is: - Palliative care for children is the active total care of the child's body, mind and spirit, and also involves giving support to the family. - It begins when illness is diagnosed, and continues regardless of whether or not a child receives treatment directed at the disease. - Health providers must evaluate and alleviate a child's physical, psychological, and social distress. - Effective palliative care requires a broad multidisciplinary approach that includes the family and makes use of available community resources; it can be successfully implemented even if resources are limited. - It can be provided in tertiary care facilities, in community health centers and even in children's homes. At Cincinnati Children's, palliative care is provided by two teams who work together to care for families, no matter where they are located. The [Pediatric Palliative and Comfort Care Team (PACT)](/service/p/palliative-care/pact) is a team of doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners and social workers who see patients in the hospital and in clinics. [StarShine Hospice and Palliative Care](/service/p/palliative-care/starshine-hospice) is a team of nurses, social workers, child life specialists, music therapists, holistic health therapists, and the PACT doctors who care for children and their families at home.
