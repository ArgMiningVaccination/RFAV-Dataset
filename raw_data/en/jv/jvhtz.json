Results from multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that CHM use was signicantly associated with better survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.77). In addition, the CHM formulae Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, Zhi Bah Di Huang Wan, Ping Wei San, and Qui Pi Tang were signicantly associated with better survival. In conclusion, ndings from this retrospective cohort study indicated that integrated CHM and Western medicine could improve survival in patients with colorectal cancer. Additional research on integrating TCM with Western medicine to improve cancer survival is warranted. 1.Introduction Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwideandisthethirdleadingcauseofcancermortalityin Taiwan [1]. While the overall ve-year survival rate ofcolorectal cancer has exceeded 65% in most auentcountries [2], it is only 9-12% for patients with stage IVcolorectalcancer[3,4].Currently,themainstreamtreatmentof colorectal cancer is laparoscopic surgical resection forprimary disease, and chemotherapy areoften required for metastatic disease [5]. In addition toWestern medical treatments, Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) has been used in the treatment of patients withcancer [6]. TCM has been reported to be able to alleviatechemotherapy nausea [7], reduce pain [8], improve thecurative eect of cancer treatment, enhance quality of life,and reduce adverse events [9]. Research indicated thatcertain Chinese herbal medicines (CHM), such as Salviamiltiorrhiza, could inhibit the proliferation of colorectal cancercellsbyapoptosis[10],therebyeectivelyprolongingsurvival [11-14]. A secondary analysis of the Taiwan's National Health Information Research Database (NHIRD), a nationwide,population-based medical claim records database, showed thatXiangShaLiuJunZiTang(7.1%),BuZhongYiQiTang (4.3%), and Jia Wei Xiao Yao San (4.1%) were the top threemost commonly prescribed single Chinese herbal medicine(CHM) formulae prescribed for postsurgery colon cancerpatients[11].However,thestudydidnotanalyzetheeectoftheseformulaeonsurvivalrates.Inaddition,theNHIRDdidnot contain information on cancer stage, chemotherapy,radiotherapy, and surgery [15], and hence their potentialconfounding eects could not be controlled. Alternatively,the use of the Taiwan Cancer Registry (TCR) could over-come this data limitation [16]. ,/_he aim of this retrospective cohortstudywastoinvestigatetheeectofCHMcombined with Western medicine compared with Western medicinealoneonthesurvivalofpatientswithcolorectalcancer,usinglocal hospital medical record data linked with the TCR. Inaddition, the eectiveness of the 10 most commonly usedCHM formulae with dierent dosages on survival wasinvestigated. 2.Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Source. ,/_he data sources of this study comprised theTCRofDalinTzuChiHospital[16]andmedicalrecordsdatabase of the study hospital from 2004 to 2014. First, weused TCR to identify patients with newly diagnosed colo- rectal cancer. ,/_heir treatment, clinical stage, and cause of death were also obtained from the TCR. Only deaths due tocolorectal cancer were considered as the mortality outcomeinthisstudy.Diagnosiscodesforcancertypeswerebasedonthe ICD for Oncology, 3rd edition (ICD-O-3), from 2002.,/_he medical records of the study hospital were used toascertainbasicandclinicalcharacteristicsofthepatientsandalso the type, dosage, frequency, and treatment duration ofCHM used. Disease diagnoses were based on the Interna-tional Classication of Diseases, Ninth Revision, ClinicalModication (ICD-9-CM). Study participants had to be treated for at least 30 days at Dalin Tzu Chi Hospital to be eligible for the study. ,/_he study protocol was approved bythe institutional review board of Dalin Tzu Chi Hospital,BuddhistTzuChiMedicalFoundation(IRBno.B10503013). 2.2.StudyDesignandExposureAssessment. Weconducteda retrospective cohort study to examine the association of CHM use and survival rates in patients with colorectalcancer. To avoid immortal time bias, patients were followedstarting from 3 months after their rst colorectal cancerdiagnosis [17] to the date of death or the end of the studyperiod, whichever came rst. A total of 1209 patients withcolorectal cancer (ICD-9-CM: 153-154.8 and ICD-O-3:C18.0-C21.8) between 2004 and 2014 were identied fromtheTCR.Weexcludedpatientswhose(1)survivalstatuswasunclear or death reason was unknown (code number: 7777or 7798), or (2) cancer stage unknown or stage 0. A total of535 eligible patients were included. Study patients were classied as either CHM users or CHM nonusers based on whether their cumulative days ofCHM use were more than 30 days during the rst yearfollowing the rst diagnosis date of their colorectal cancer. CHM use was considered as interrupted when the interval between two consecutive CHM treatments exceeded sixweeks. 2.3.OutcomeAssessment. ,/_heprimaryoutcomeofthisstudy was colorectal cancer-specic survival. Survival time was calculated in months from the rst date of colorectal cancerdiagnosis to either death or the end of the study period. Potential confounding variables included age, sex, comor- biditiesatbaseline,clinicalstageofcancer,andtreatmentofcolorectal cancer (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemother-apy).AccordingtotheNationalHealthInsurance(NHI),themortality rate of colorectal cancer increases considerablyafter the age of 45 years. ,/_herefore, the patients werestratied into three subgroups by age (45 years, 46-65years, and>65 years) in all the analyses. Based on individual medical records one year before initial cohort entry, the Charlson-Deyo comorbidity indexwas used to assess the presence of comorbidity [18]. Fol-lowing the classication system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC 7th edition), clinical stage was assigned I, II, III, or IV. Uncertain information(code number: 888 or 999) was regarded as an unknownstage. Metastasis was recorded as yes or no. For a specic CHM, the total dosage taken by each patient was calculated by multiplying days, doses, and fre-quencies of treatments. Based on the overall dose of med-ication, we obtained the top 10 commonly used CHM. Foreachofthe10CHMformulae,patientstakingdosagehigherthan the median were classied as the high-dose group,otherwise as the low-dose group. 2.4. Statistical Analysis. We used Chi-squared tests to compare the proportions of demographic variables, clinical stage of cancer, comorbidity variables, and treatmentmethods (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) in thetwo groups. ,/_he Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log-ranktest were used to compare survival curves. Univariate andmultivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to examine the hazard ratio (HR) of survival for CHM use and for dosage used. ,/_he multivariate-adjustedmodel was developed using backward elimination based onthe likelihood ratio test. All Pvalues less than 0.05 were considered statistically signicant. 3.Results 3.1. Characteristics of Patients with Colorectal Cancer. identied 535 colorectal cancer patients; 388 wereCHM nonusers, and 147 were CHM users. Table 1 shows acomparison of age and sex distribution of the source pop-ulation (1,209 patients) with our nal study sample (5352 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicinepatients). ,/_he distribution of sex and age group was not signicantly dierent between the source population and our nal sample. Table 2 indicates that clinical stage, age, sex, treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy), distant metas- tases, comorbidity score 2, and comorbidity score 6 did notdier signicantly between CHM users and nonusers.However, the proportion of comorbidity score 1 in CHMusers is considerably higher than that in CHM nonusers(P0.010). 535patientswas36.0months(SD 22.8).,/_hemeanfollow- 35.2 months (SD23.9),rangingbetween3.0and90.9months;themean follow-up period for the CHM users was 38.1 months (SD19.7), ranging between 3.5 and 91.4 months. Overall, 197 deaths (36.8%) occurred during the study period. ,/_heCHMnonusersgrouphad156deaths(40.2%),andtheCHMusers group had 41 deaths (27.9%). ,/_he log-rank test for Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed a statistically signicant dierence between thesurvival of the two groups (P 0.006) (Figure 1). ,/_he survival rates of the rst, third, and fth years for CHMnonusers were 80%, 62%, and 54%, while for CHM users were 92%, 75%, and 63%. Further analyses revealed that there were no signicant dierences in the survival curves of stages I (P 0.966) and II(P 0.581)cancer(Figures2(a)and2(b)),buttherewere signicant dierences in the survival curves of stages III (P0.027)andIV(P 0.003)cancer(Figures2(c)and2(d)). 3.3. Cox Regression Analysis of Patients with ColorectalCancer.,/_he univariate Cox regression analysis showed a signicant association between the use of CHM and in-creased survival (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44-0.87, P0.007) 3). adjusting for potential confounders, the useof CHM remained signicantly associated with better HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.77, P0.001). Results of 1.44to6.18, 17.49;95%CI 8.90to34.38; P<0.001).Inaddition, surgery and chemotherapy were associated withbetter survival with adjusted HRs of 0.29 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.65; P<0.001), 3.4.Top10CommonlyUsedCHMonSurvival.

Previous research also showed that the use ofCHM could prolong the survival time of patients with co-lorectal cancer [11, 19]. Among the top 10 commonly used CHM, high doses of Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, Zhi Bah Di Huang Wan, Ping WeiSan,andQuiPiTangwereassociatedwithbettersurvival.Toinduce the therapeutic eect, daily dosages ranged between2.92and4.68g,andtreatmentdurationof25to63dayswasrequired.First,JiaWeiXiaoYaoSanisgenerallytheprimary herb for treating cancers. It features emotional regulation, evacuation of Qi depression, and relief of gastrointestinaldistress.,/_hetherapeuticeectofthisherbcouldbethroughthe alleviation of psychosomatic stress as a result of coloncancer treatment [20]. With reasonable doses, Jia Wei XiaoYao San is safe and does not interact with 5-FU in con-ventional treatment [21].

First, the research only chooses to conrm the diagnosis ofWesternmedicineatasingleregionalhospital,aswellasthepatients who also receive the CHM treatment in outpatientand consultation. Alternative therapies are common in theUnited States 32] and this study; in con-trast, only 12-20% of colon cancer patients in the NHIRDdatabase receive CHM treatment [34]. However, our re-search ndings are in line with prior studies, showing ahighersurvivalrateandlongersurvivaltimeforCHMusers. ,/_hus, the dierence would be reasonably overlooked. Second,thepossibilityofselectionbiascouldnotentirely be ruled out because 674 (55.7%) out of 1,209 patients identiedfromtheTCRwereexcludedfromtheanalysisdueto missing information on survival status or cancer stage.Nevertheless, comparison of the age and sex distributionbetweenthesourcepopulationandthestudysampledidnotreveal any signicant ,/_hird, CHM use corresponds to dif- ferentiation, yet the treatment by Chinese medicinepractitioners is highly individualized. Practically,according to the syndrome types of patients, the pre- scriptionsandtheherbalformulaemightdier.Syndrome dierentiation is diagnosed by Chinese medicine practi-tioners, lacking a scientic system to provide more del-icate cluster analysis. Consequently, it is urgent to applyarticial intelligence to develop automatic TCM syn-drome dierentiation system [35]. As such, \"syndrometype\" can be classied by the system, and more accurateCHM use can be obtained for TCM patients. In this case,we could expect to dig deeper into the eectiveness ofCHM use. Fourth, we focused on colorectal cancer-specic mor- tality as the outcome of this study. Cause of death due tocomplications, such as cardiac arrest, at the end-stage ofcolorectal cancer would not be included in the survivalanalysis. Nevertheless, dierential misclassication, ifpresent, in the cause of death due to complications shouldnotbedierentbetweentheCHMusersandCHMnonusersgroups. In addition, since the use of chemotherapy wasmarginally higher in the CHM users group compared withthe CHM nonuser group (P 0.069), it might increase the mortality due to cardiac events in the CHM users group.However,thepotential confoundingeect ofchemotherapy wasadjustedinthenalmultivariateCoxmodel.,/_herefore, the use of colorectal cancer-specic mortality should notaect our conclusion. Despite these limitations, this study has several strengths. ,/_he data source of this study was based on acombination of the TCR and hospital clinical data. ,/_here-fore, the survival time and the cause of death could beaccurately ascertained. In addition, CHM use patients'information, and comorbidities from themedicalrecorddatabaseatasingleregionalhospital,therebyminimizing coding and misclassication errors. 5.Conclusions ,/_hisretrospectivecohortstudyshowedthatintegratedCHMand Western medicine was able to signicantly improvesurvival in patients with colorectal cancer. In particular, JiaWei Xiao Yao San, Zhi Bah Di Huang Wan, Ping Wei San,and Qui Pi Tang were signicantly associated with bettersurvival in patients with colorectal cancer.
