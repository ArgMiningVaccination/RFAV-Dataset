Naturopathy helps to improve health by looking at a person as a whole and incorporating diet and life style changes, herbal medicine and nutritional supplementation. I am passionate about health and wellness of women approaching middle age and beyond. As a Mother of three young adults I am also concerned about the health and well-being of teenagers and those in their early twenties. I believe that small changes to diet and lifestyle can make huge changes to health, when built upon these become lifetime habits. The addition of targeted supplements and herbal medicine and Aromatherapy massage can be very powerful. I named my Company Homeostasis health & Well-being, because homeostasis is a process by which the body maintains a stable environment. When we are in poor health this can become our new homeostatic point, & is particularly true in chronic health conditions. The body has many biochemical pathways, many of which rely on feedback systems, so when one element is out of balance it can throw the whole body out. Peri-Menopause and Menopause is a time when the body homeostasis and biochemistry changes, and this can lead to problems such as hot flushes, weight gain, insomnia, Brain fog and forgetfulness, osteopenia, osteoporosis and possibly cardiovascular disease. Not all women suffer as they make the transition through to menopause and women should not suffer. Changes to diet and lifestyle can help tremendously, whilst herbal medicine and nutritional supplements can support the metabolic pathways during this time of adjustment. Preparing you for health in the long term. Why Naturopathy? Naturopathy blends Nutritional medicine, herbal medicine, diet and lifestyle to help you achieve your long term health goals. Menopausal Symptoms Not all women suffer menopausal symptoms can include hot flushes, irregular heavy periods, insomnia, anxiety & depression, weight gain and forgetfulness. Not all women suffer all symptoms and these can be a reflection of your overall health as well as fluctuating hormones, dealing with underlying problems such as stress, poor diet, poor liver health, excess weight often indirectly helps your menopausal symptoms. Insominia Insomnia and poor sleep is quite common during perimenopause and menopause. This can be due to hot flushes and fluctuating temperature, anxiety, waking with racing thoughts, or just an inability to sleep. This can lead to fatigue and low mood. In the long term it is detrimental to long term health. The good news is, that it can often be resolved by tweaking a few things and the use of correct Supplements or herbal medicine. Digestive Health The gut microbiome is important, but digestive health also includes how well your stomach, liver and intestines function. How often do you pass a stool, do you suffer constipation, flatulence, burping or diarrhea, these are all signs that digestive system is not as it should be, and may prevent the proper absorption of nutrients, leading to a myriad of problems. Mental Health and emotions Most of us will suffer from anxiety, depression, brain fog, lack of motivation etc at some point in our life, and is quite common during menopause and adolescence. This may be due to a changes in hormone levels, lack of sleep, poor digestion, poor nutrition Nutritional support can help make a difference. Healthy aging Diet and Lifestyle are important as you age. Inflammation is the leading cause of many of the chronic conditions of aging from osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, and even Dementia. It is important to start caring and investing in your health as you age, as many of the biochemical processes become less effective. This way you can enjoy your health instead of living with the burden of disease. Weight Loss Being overweight is a leading cause of inflammation in the body, and can lead to chronic health conditions such as cardio vascular disease, metabolic syndrome and even cancer. Fad diets don't work, due to our body trying to maintain metabolic set point. To lose weight successfully is to recognise the cause of the gain and modify things through the use of diet and exercise. Menopause Menopause, does not define you, it is merely a time of transition.

Nutrition & Herbal medicine The food we eat plays an important role, not just in providing us with energy, but in making hormones, neurotransmitters, keeping our muscles strong, and boosting our immune system. Sometimes we can be deficient in nutrients, and require supplementation, understanding the biochemical pathways means that supplementation can be targeted at therapeutic doses. Herbal medicines can be very powerful, and very often nutritional supplements are blended with a herbs to achieve the desired effect.
