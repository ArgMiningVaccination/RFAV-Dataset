The School has increas- ingly received national attention for our outstanding research, and we continue to graduate exceptional new physicians and scientists. Despite the unsettled economic land- scape, Boston University School of Medicine's fiscal health remains sound. We have continued to carefully man- age our budgets to optimally support our missions, and our many generous donors are often very involved in advancing our educational and research programs. This issue of Campus & Alumni News honors our donors, highlights some of our new endowed professorships and assistant professorships, and features some of our Dean's Advisory Board leaders who have advanced the School's priorities and fundraising initiatives. A new professorship in pediatrics was established this year; longtime faculty member Deborah Frank, MD, is the first to hold this endowed chair. We highlight her impressive work, which includes lifesaving care to malnourished children in the Boston area. Her research under - scores the need for greater resources for at-risk children. Supporting early career researchers is another of our most important investments; the Department of Dermatology has established two new assistant professorships for depart - ment faculty. Our faculty continues to compete at a very high level for shrinking public research funding, demonstrating the high quality and vital importance of the scientific work being carried out on the Medical Campus. With this issue of Campus & Alumni News , our students, faculty, and staff would like especially to recognize and thank our many generous benefactors who contributed to the School in the 2010-2011 academic year. Best regards, Karen Antman, MD Provost, Medical Campus Dean, School of Medicine3 2 campus & alumni news | BOSTON UNIVERSITY School of MedicineNewscampus Fall 2011 | www.bumc.bu.edu Being a Doctor Is the Best Job on the Planet Gray skies sprinkling raindrops did not deter the 173 first-year students as they wound their way along the paths of the T albot Green. Ducking into a large white tent, they were met with enthusias- tic applause and shouts of encouragement from more than 400 friends and family. The annual White Coat Ceremony, held on August 8 for the Class of 2015, marked the formal induction of medical students into their chosen profession. T ours of the campus and a luncheon hosted by BUSM Dean and Provost of the Boston University Medical Campus Karen Antman preceded the cer - emony, which was followed by a reception spon- sored by the BUSM Alumni Association. The program opened with greetings from Phyllis Carr, MD, BUSM associate dean for stu-dent affairs, who explained that the White Coat Ceremony connects the Class of 2015 with those who have come before them and those who have yet to join the profession. Noting that the ceremony is a remarkable moment and that students remember and trea-sure it, Robert Witzburg, MD'77, BUSM associate dean and director of admissions, formally turned over the Class of 2015 to the School of Medicine. He noted, \"In cultural, social, economic, racial, ethnic, educational, and linguistic terms, and in life experiences, your class defines the pluralism that is valued in society. Y ou hail from 32 states and 19 different countries of birth. T ogether as a class, you speak 26 languages.\" Witzburg continued, \"Academically you are among the most accomplished classes BUSM has matriculated and are also among the most diverse. We received more than 11,400 applications for the 173 seats in your class, the Class of 2015.\" Antman accepted the entering class on behalf of the faculty and said, \"Y ou have embarked on a great adventure with a steep learning curve. Y ou will be strongly supported by more than 2,000 Winandy n amed first b ucher a ssistant Professor The Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine is pleased to announce Susan Winandy, PhD, as the first Nancy L.

Y ou both wear white coats. Y ou are now part of the profession. Thus you must behave as a physician from the start of your educa-tion,\" Antman concluded. Before the students donned their white coats and recited the Hippocratic Oath, guest speaker Kitt Shaffer, MD, PhD, BUSM professor of radiology and vice chair for education in the Boston Medical Center Department of Radiology, said, \"Being a doc-tor is the best job on the planet . . .

The nine-story, $33 million structure was designed by Beacon Architectural Associates with a brick-and-limestone fa\u00e7ade. Its 104 two-bedroom suites\u2014which include bath, kitchenette, and living spaces\u2014will accommodate 208 students, each with individual bedrooms, the standard for graduate student housing. student residence construction Progresses alumni share their memories of living in the south end I was there a long time ago. We lived the first year at Franklin Square house (women under 21 were required to live in approved housing), which is now apartments or condominiums. Groups of medical students used to walk along Washington Street. A favorite restaurant was the Red Fez\u2014I don't know if it is the same restaurant/ owner that was there in the 1960s. I have been back for a few reunions, and I walked along Washing-ton Street with my husband last time because we stayed in a downtown hotel. the neighborhood seems more alive (artists, street fairs) and safer for walk - ing than it did when I was a student. It also seems smaller, but the whole city seems smaller viewed in perspective of years of moves and travels. [Editor's note: The Red Fez is still here!] \u2014sHirley Klein '68 I had to live in a five-dollar-a-week room in a brownstone on Worcester Court when I was at BUSM. A prostitute lived on the first floor, two old drunks on the second floor, and I lived in the bowling alley-like room on the third floor. now that was an experience the new students will not get! \u2014Walter M clean '60 My South end in the 1950s looked like none of your pictures. I lived for a time on the fourth floor of a dilapidated apart - ment building with another medical stu-dent and a scrawny, somewhat mean cat. It was across the street from the Boston City hospital entrance in a run-down and unsafe section of the city. I saw very little of the neighborhood since I quickly zipped from my apartment entrance right into the hospital, where I spent most of my time. now, however, I have been back and seen the tremendous improvement in the area that looked so bad when I was there. I hope the present medical students are aware of how lucky they are to have the current scenario around their medical school. Actually, medical school was so interesting and so busy for me that the city surroundings didn't figure very importantly to me in actual-ity; at least it didn't seem so to me when I was there. \u2014david JacKson '58 1.

The award recognizes the development of an infor - mation technology tool that helps physicians practice medicine, teach medicine, or pursue clinical research. After receiving a Doris Duke Charitable Foundation fellow - ship last fall, Ostrovsky spent a year working as a health policy researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, where he helped build the first web-based evaluation system for the California Department of Public Health. Launched this fall, the San Francisco Community Vital Signs website will serve to stream-line health system assessment and collaboration by fusing public health with social media. The site, designed by Ostrovsky, will detail the status of all programs and institutions involved in health care and disease prevention in the San Francisco area and serve as a tool for public and private health care affiliates to collaborate, consult, and pool resources with greater ease. The once time-consuming process of collecting data and information from any number of public health care sites will be made easier through features such as an events calendar, links to educational resources and statistics, and a real- time discussion forum. Upon his return to medical school, Ostrovsky once again cranked into overdrive, writing a series of five speeches on health disparities for U.S. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, which the senator then delivered to Congress. T o top it off, Ostrovsky is currently working with several web-based companies as a consultant for customer development. With just one year left of medical school, this young high achiever is choosing to complete his residency in medicine and pediatrics and anticipates a future in primary care medicine as well as continued work in health policy and social entrepreneurship. andrey ostrovsky GROUNDBReAkING PHOTO B y veRNON DOUCeTTe. ex TeRIOR SHeATHING PHOTO B y jOHN BARTON1 2 43 5daniel p . alford, md '92, mph '86, associate professor of medicine and an addic-tion expert, has been chosen to participate in President Obama's Champions of Change program, which hosts weekly White House visits for innova- tors in various fields.

An ophthalmolo-gist, Friedman was recruited to BUSM to serve as profes- sor and chair of the Department of Ophthalmology, a position he held for six years before becoming dean of the School of Medicine in 1971. During his three-year tenure as dean, Friedman oversaw the development of a variety of new pathways to a medical degree at BUSM and the historic decision by the city of Boston to grant BU sole responsibility for professional staffing at Boston City Hospital, a job BU had previously shared with Harvard and T ufts medical schools. Friedman earned his undergraduate degree in zoology from UCLA and his medical degree from UC-San Francisco. He completed his internship at San Francisco City and County Hospital, a resi- dency in ophthalmology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, and a fellowship in ophthalmol-ogy at Hebrew University School of Medicine. He served as a captain in the U.S. Air Force. After leaving BUSM, he served as dean of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New Y ork City and president of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston. He was also an accomplished sculptor. He is survived by his wife, Dagmar Beniof, two sons, two daughters, and nine grandchildren. William B. Kannel, md, BUSM professor emeritus of medicine and public health, on August 20, 2011, at the age of 88, after deciding to refuse medical interventions for cancer and choos-ing to die with dignity with the help of a hospice, family, and friends. A 1949 graduate of the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, Kannel trained in internal medicine in the U.S. Public Health Service on Staten Island, New Y ork. He was active in the field of cardiovascular epidemiology for more than 60 years and led the way for the world-famous Framingham Heart Study to become the leader in cardiovascular epidemiologic research that it is today. Kannel joined the Framingham Heart Study in 1950, and in 1966 became the National Institutes of Health director of the study, serving in this capacity until 1979. Between 1979 and 1987, as BUSM professor of medicine, he served as the principal investigator of the Framingham Heart Study. Subsequently, he continued work as the senior-most investigator at the Framingham Heart Study until his recent illness curtailed those efforts. He was also a past chief of the Section of Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology in the Department of Medicine at BUSM. He was a fellow of the American Heart Association (AHA) and a past chair of the Council of Epidemiology of the AHA. He was also a fellow of the American College of Cardiology, the American Epidemiology Society, the American College of Epidemiology, and the American College of Preventive Medicine. He was a recipient of numerous national and international awards and honorary degrees, notably the AHA Distinguished Scientist Award (2006), the Lifetime Achievement Award from the New Y ork Academy of Medicine (2006), and the Joseph Stokes Award from the Board of the American Society for Preventive Cardiology (2011). He served on the editorial board of numerous scien- tific journals, including Hypertension, the American Journal of Cardiology, and American Heart Journal. Kannel published more than 600 medi- cal articles and numerous editorials and book chapters. His work at the Framingham Heart Study established the utility of population-based research for seeking out correctable predispos-ing conditions for cardiovascular disease (CVD), putting prevention at the forefront of cardiol- ogy. He coined the medical term \"risk factor\" in 1961 in a landmark publication in the Annals of Internal Medicine and promoted the concept that CVD is multifactorial. He pioneered the idea of combining information about multiple risk fac-tors mathematically to estimate risk of CVD (the Framingham Risk Score). His research estab- lished the importance of distinguishing between usual (average in the population) and optimal risk factor levels. He described the risk factors for both heart attacks and stroke, identified the importance of atrial fibrillation as a precursor of stroke, and identified diabetes as a risk factor for CVD. His research stimulated national campaigns against smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and obesity. Kannel's research highlighted the lethal nature of congestive heart failure and a thick left ventricular wall, the frequent occurrence of clinically silent myocardial infarction, and the fac- tors predisposing to sudden death, which until then had been underappreciated. His research warned in 1985 of the lack of efficacy and danger of estrogen replacement for preventing CVD. In 2008, along with his colleagues, he formulated the Framingham Risk Score, a profile that enables primary care physicians to pull together risk fac-tor information to assess the global risk of heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. He is survived by his wife, four children, 12 grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren. The William B. Kannel Legacy Fund has been estab- lished to honor his leadership at the Framingham Heart Study and contributions to cardiovascular medicine.

They surveyed 340 women and 252 men who had returned from deployment within the previous year, quizzing them about any symptoms of depression, substance abuse, posttrau- matic stress disorder, and other mental health impairment. \"While women are still officially barred from direct ground combat positions in the U.S. military, they serve in a variety of positions that put them at risk for combat exposure,\" the researchers write in their paper, which appears online in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology. \"Women's risk for combat is compounded by the enemy's increased use of guerrilla warfare tactics in recent wars. As of 2009, more than 750 women had been wounded or killed in action during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, which includes the Afghanistan war and some other antiterrorism efforts.\" Previous research has looked at the effects of \"all types of poten- tially traumatic events\" on women, such as sexual assault and car acci-dents, says study lead author Dawne Vogt, BUSM associate professor of psychiatry and a researcher at the National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in the VA Boston Healthcare System. In such noncom- bat traumas, Vogt says, \"there's kind of this consistent finding that women are worse off\" than men. Y et her study found no such disparity in trauma from combat. Vogt and her colleagues cite speculation by others that the threat from combat is so persistent and overwhelming that it affects both genders equally. Female soldiers also have received improved training in recent years, according to the study. \"Regardless of the cause,\" the study concludes, \"these findings have substantial implications for military policy, as they call into question the commonly held belief that women may be more vulnerable to the nega- tive effects of combat exposure than men.\" A congressionally created commission has recommended ending the ban on women in combat. The study asked subjects about other stressors besides combat exposure: post-battle experiences such as handling human remains, fear for one's safety and other pressures from living in a war zone, sexual harassment or assault during deployment, and pre-deployment expo- sure to stress. While the women reported slightly less exposure to most combat-related stressors, they recounted greater exposure to sexual harassment and pre-deployment stress. Conceding several uncertainties in their work, the researchers sug- gest follow-up studies. Post-deployment symptoms may increase over time, they write, and future surveys should include veterans who are more than a year out from returning from deployment. Vogt says she will follow up on the study with data she expects to collect on the men- tal health of veterans two to three years after their deployment ends. The researchers write that they're unaware of any similar study measuring combat stress effects between men and women. Among the study coauthors are School of Public Health researchers Mark Glickman, Susan Eisen, Rani Elway, and Mari-Lynn Drainoni.

The research team connected pharmacologi- cal properties of the Novartis Pharma AG drug called balicatib to the skin disorder for the first time after investigating adverse reactions suffered by patients participating in a clinical trial for the treatment of osteoporosis. These findings appear online in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. Balicatib was developed as an osteoporosis drug to inhibit cathepsin K (CTSK), an enzyme involved with bone degradation. In a recent trial, several patients on balicatib experienced hardening of the skin, most fre-quently around the neck, chest, and abdomen. After examining the cases, the investigators determined that the changes were a direct effect of the drug. This marks the first time that skin hardening can be convinc- ingly linked to the pharmacologic properties of a drug. Thomas Ruenger, MD, PhD, BUSM professor and vice chair of dermatology, is the study leader. [Disclaimer: Ruenger served on the independent data safety moni- toring board that monitored the clinical trial in which the described observations were made.] Increasing the number of Family physicians r educes hospital r eadmissions BUSM and BMC researchers have found that add-ing one family physician per 1,000 population, or 100 per 100,000, could reduce hospital readmission costs by $579 million per year, or 83 percent of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) tar - get. These findings appear on the website of the Robert Graham Center, a primary care think tank. One provision of PPACA tar - gets a decrease in hospital readmis- sions to save $710 million annually. It is believed that timely management of fragile patients in primary care after discharge may reduce readmission. The researchers used data from the Hospital Compare database\u2014which included readmission rates for pneumonia, heart attack, and heart failure\u2014for \"This study uncovers a potential new approach aimed at controlling and treating myelofibrosis,\" says senior author Ravid. \"This discovery will allow additional research in the field of leukemia to follow a new avenue with the potential of finding new treatments against the disease.\" Funding for this study was provided by the National Institutes of Health's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. herbal medicine t reatment Found to reduce Inflammation in allergen-Induced asthma A BUSM study using So-Cheong-Ryong-T ang (SCRT), a traditional Korean medicine that has long been used for the treatment of allergic diseases in Asia, found that SCRT treatment alleviates asthma-like pulmonary inflammation via suppression of specific chemokines or proteins. These findings appear online in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Asthma represents one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases, affecting an estimated 300 million people worldwide with an expected increase to 400 million by 2025. \"In order to elucidate the mecha- nism of how SCRT modulates the allergic response, we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of SCRT in a murine model of asthma induced by a house dust extract containing cockroach allergens and endotoxin,\" explains Jiyoun Kim, PhD, BUSM research assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine. The researchers found SCRT treatment significantly reduced airway hyper-reactivity as measured by both whole body plethysmography and direct measurement of airway resistance. The researchers report that the immune response of pulmonary inflammation was significantly inhibited by SCRT treatment as demonstrated by reduced plasma IgE antibody levels and improved lung histology. SCRT significantly reduced the number of neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar (BAL) 4,459 hospitals as well as the area source file that con-tains data for physicians per population at the county level. \"Using these data, we found that 30-day readmis- sion rates for all three diagnoses decrease as the number of family physicians increases,\" says senior author Brian Jack, MD, BUSM associate professor of family medicine and vice chair for academic affairs in the Department of Family Medicine at Boston Medical Center. \"Conversely, increased numbers of physicians in all other major spe- cialties, including general internal medicine, is associated with increased risk of readmission,\" he adds. new p otential approaches to t reat myelofibrosis A new BUSM study sheds light on a possible new approach to treat the bone marrow disease known as myelofibrosis by inhibiting an enzyme that connects extracellular fibers. The study, published online in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, was directed by Katya Ravid, PhD, BUSM profes- sor of medicine and biochemistry and director of the Evans Center for Interdisciplinary Biomedical Research at BUSM. Myelofibrosis, which currently affects between 16,000 and 18,500 Americans, occurs when bone mar - row is replaced by scar tissue, resulting in a disruption in blood cell production. Blood cells originate from precursor stem cells, which typically reside in the bone marrow. Red and white blood cells are categorized as cells with a myeloid lineage, which also includes megakaryocytic cells that give rise to blood-clotting platelets. An excess prolif - eration of myeloid cells causes a surplus production of fibers outside of the cell, which forms a dense matrix within the bone marrow that disrupts the formation of these blood cells. Previous research has shown that the enzyme lysyl oxidase links and stabilizes the extracellular fibers, but as of yet, a treatment aimed at inhibiting the formation of these fibers has not been successful. Ravid's team demonstrated that inhibiting that enzyme using pharma- cologic agents resulted in a significant decrease in the burden of myelofibrosis.fluid and also significantly reduced the BAL levels of CXC chemokines, both expressed as part of the immune response, providing a potential mechanism for the reduced inflammation. This study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Oriental Medicine R&D Project of the Ministry of Health & Welfare of the Republic of Korea. answers for t reating obesity-r elated diseases may r eside in Fat t issue BUSM and BMC researchers have shown that the quality\u2014not just the quantity\u2014of adipose tissue, or fat, is a sig-nificant contributing factor in the devel- opment of inflam-mation and vascular disease in obese individuals. The study, which is a special feature on the iPad version of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, provides evidence that the answer to treat - ing cardiovascular disease and other obesity-related disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and cancer, might be found in the adipose tissue itself. Led by Noyan Gokce, MD, BUSM associate profes- sor of medicine and BMC cardiologist, the research- ers examined adipose tissue samples from both lean and obese individuals. After obtaining the samples, the researchers biopsied the tissue and evaluated the amount of inflammation present in the tissue. They then performed a vascular ultrasound on the forearm artery to examine blood vessel function. The research- ers found that lean individuals exhibited no adipose inflammation and normal vascular function whereas the obese individuals exhibited significant inflammation and poor vascular function. While these study findings are consistent with other epidemiological obesity studies, this research team identified that 30 percent of the obese subjects demonstrated reduced fat inflammation and less insulin resistance, and their vascular function was similar to a lean person's, despite severe obesity. The study sug- gests that humans prone to inflammation in researchIn BrIeF continued Balicatib was devel-oped as an osteo- porosis drug to inhibit cathepsin K (CtSK), an enzyme involved with bone degradation. the researchers found that lean individuals exhibited no adipose inflammation and normal vascular function whereas the obese indi- viduals exhibited signifi-cant inflammation and poor vascular function.

The study, which appears online in Human Genetics, is believed to be the first to comprehensively assess the association between genetic vari- ants in the MHC region and risk of lupus in African American women. The findings were based on the ongoing Black Women's Health Study, a prospective study of the health of 59,000 African American women conducted by the researchers since 1995. African American women have a higher risk of lupus compared with white U.S. women. It has been known that the MHC region in chromosome 6 carries genetic factors associated with several autoimmune diseases, and recent studies have reported several genetic variants in the MHC region associated with risk of lupus. However, these previous studies were carried out in populations with European and Asian ancestry. The researchers genotyped more than 1,500 genetic variants of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 400 lupus cases and 800 controls. They found four independent SNPs associated with higher risk of lupus. Through the construction of a genetic score consisting of those four SNPs, the researchers found that risk of lupus increased by almost 70 per - cent for each extra high-risk allele. One of the SNPs reported in the present study was also found in a study in Chinese women, and the researchers were also able to replicate some previous findings from a study in women of European ancestry. \"T aken together, our results and previous genome- wide association studies in European and east Asian ancestry populations show that women of different ancestral origins may share some genetic compo-nents for the risk of lupus,\" says lead author Edward A. Ruiz-Narvaez, ScD, BUSM assistant professor of epidemiology. The researchers point out that the identified genetic variants are not necessarily the ones directly involved in the pathogenesis of lupus, and further research is needed to identify the true causal genetic variants. Identification of the true causal genetic vari- ants should lead to a better understanding of the biol-ogy of lupus. This study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Center for Research Resources. Gout p revalence s wells in u.s. over Last two decades A new study shows the prevalence of gout in the United States has risen over the last 20 years, and the condition now affects 8.3 million Americans (4 per - cent). Prevalence of increased uric acid levels (hyper - uricemia) also rose, affecting 43.3 million adults in the United States (21 percent). Greater frequency of obesity and hypertension may be associated with the jump in prevalence rates, according to a study by senior investigator Hyon Choi, PhD, professor of medicine in the Section of Rheumatology and the Clinical Epidemiology Research & T raining Unit at BUSM. The findings were published in Arthritis & Rheumatism, a journal of the American College of Rheumatology. Evidence suggests that gout is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome\u2014a group of health conditions characterized by central obesity, insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and blood lipid issues\u2014and may lead to heart attack, diabetes, and premature death. Prior research found that gout incidence in the United States more than doubled from the 1960s to 1990s. Researchers analyzed data from the latest U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which was conducted in 2007 and 2008, comparing the data with those from previous NHANESs (1988-1994). \"We found that the prevalences of gout and hyperuricemia continue to be substantial in the U.S. adult population,\" says Choi. \"Improvements in manag-ing modifiable risk factors, such as obesity and hyper - tension, could help prevent further escalation of gout and hyperuricemia among Americans.\" risk Factor p athways for ptss in Female and male v eterans Identified Researchers have found that risk factors for post-traumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS) among Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) male veterans were relatively simi-lar to what was observed in a prior group of Vietnam veterans. The findings, which appear online in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, suggest there are key pathways through which risk factors contribute to PTSS across different male veteran cohorts. In addition, the researchers also identified a number of novel mechanisms of risk for OEF/OIF female veterans. A growing body of research indicates that cer - tain individuals are at higher risk for mental health problems following exposure to traumatic events. Prior research on risk factors for PTSS in war-exposed veterans has revealed both direct and indi- rect mechanisms of risk that span pre-deployment, deployment, and post-deployment timeframes. Consistent with the conservation of resources theory, the findings indicated that PTSS was accounted for by multiple chains of risk, many origi-nating in pre-deployment experiences that placed both female and male veterans at risk for addi- tional stress exposure. In addition, the researchers observed that family relationships during deploy - ment appeared to play a more prominent role in explaining female veterans'\u2014compared to male vet - erans'\u2014post-deployment readjustment. \"These findings provide support for the general- izing of mechanisms of risk for PTSS across veteran groups, and suggest that there may be some key pathways through which risk factors contribute to PTSS that generalize across different veteran popula- tions,\" explains lead author Dawne Vogt, PhD, BUSM associate professor of psychiatry and a researcher at the National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in the VA Boston Healthcare System. While PTSS risk factors for male OEF/OIF veter - ans were fairly similar to what was observed among Vietnam veterans, mechanisms of risk for female OEF/OIF veterans were more similar to those of their male counterparts than to those of female Vietnam veterans, underscoring women's expanding roles in the military and their increased exposure to combat-related stressors. This research was supported, in part, by a Department of Veterans Affairs Health Sciences Research and Development Service grant and the National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

Anderson will investigate the vaginal use of human monoclonal antibodies manu-factured transiently in tobacco plants (called \"plantibodies\") to prevent sexually transmit - ted infections caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The production of human monoclonal antibodies and other proteins in plants is intended to provide a low-cost and large-capacity manufacturing system that could ensure an affordable supply of antibodies, vaccines, and other biopharmaceuticals for at-risk populations throughout the world, including developing countries. The research team will develop ring, film, and barrier formulations to deliver the anti-bodies and conduct preclinical testing in vitro and in vivo using animal models to evaluate safety and antimicrobial (HSV, HIV) efficacy. The plantibodies will be tested for safety and duration of activity in a human pre-phase I clinical trial as a first step toward their use as vaginal microbicides to prevent HSV and HIV infections in women. \"We hope that this research will lead to novel ways of preventing sexually transmit - ted diseases, which are epidemic in the U.S. and worldwide and have far-reaching health, social, and economic consequences,\" says Anderson. \"In addition, we will be breaking ground for the potential use of plantibodies to prevent other diseases caused by pathogens that cross mucosal membranes, such as rhi-noviruses (common cold) and influenza (flu), as well as dangerous emerging pathogens like the Ebola virus (hemorrhagic fever).\" The grant was awarded through the NIAID-funded Integrated Preclinical/Clinical Program for HIV T opical Microbicides. Kevin Whaley, PhD, at Mapp Biopharmaceutical in San Diego, and Thomas Moench, MD, at ReProtect Inc. in Baltimore, are the main col-laborators on this research study.

BUSM researchers have been awarded a five- year, $9 million grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to mass-produce sickle cell anemia-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Under the direction of prin-cipal investigators Martin H. Steinberg, MD, BUSM professor of medicine and director of the Center of Excellence in Sickle Cell Disease at BUSM and Boston Medical Center, and George Murphy, PhD, BUSM assistant profes-sor of medicine and hematology and oncology and codirector of the Center for Regenerative Medicine, the researchers propose making iPS cells from the blood of patients with sickle cell disease to better understand how certain genes are involved in the disease. Sickle cell anemia, an orphan dis- ease common among African Americans, is noted for its extensive morbidity and high mortality. Only one Food and Drug Administration-approved drug is available for its pathophysiologically based treatment. This agent, hydroxyurea, works through its ability to induce fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression, which thwarts sickle hemoglobin polymeriza-tion. Not all patients respond to this treatment, so additional HbF-inducing drugs are needed. \"This funding will allow us to create the largest library of sickle cell disease-specific iPS cell lines in the world,\" says Murphy. \"It enables the creation of an in vitro system for the study of sickle cell anemia in the exact genetic context of the patients.\" Using a novel excisable reprogramming vector, the researchers will generate clini-cal grade human iPS cells free of any residual reprogramming transgenes. These directly dif - ferentiated sickle iPS cells will be used to pro- duce an unlimited supply of erythroid-lineage cells to better understand HbF genetic regula-tion and perform preclinical small molecule drug screens. \"Ultimately, we hope to translate these findings into clinically efficacious treatments,\" said Steinberg, also a professor of pediatrics and pathology and laboratory medicine at BUSM.

Researchers from BUSM and Boston Medical Center (BMC) were awarded a $3.5 million grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to improve upon the \"seek, test, treat, and retain\" paradigm in Eastern Europe among HIV-infected Russian and Eastern European injection drug users (IDUs) in narcology (addiction) care. The project will be known as LINC: Linking Infectious and Narcology Care. Russia and Eastern Europe have one of the fastest-growing HIV epidemics in the world, with transmission risk primarily from injection drug use. Russia, Ukraine, and other countries in the region have implemented routine HIV testing within established addic-tion treatment systems (narcology hospitals). $13.3m $3.5mmaJor research Grants The narcology system of care, however, works largely independent of other medical care sys-tems and hence has not adopted strategies to link HIV-infected patients to HIV care. The research will be conducted under the direction of Jeffrey H. Samet, MD, professor of medicine and community health sciences at BUSM and BUSPH and chief of the Section of General Internal Medicine at BMC. Samet was recently selected as a NIDA International Program 2011 Awards of Excellence winner. As in the United States in the 1990s, delayed or non-receipt of HIV medical care, particularly among IDUs, is common in Russia. According to Samet, the principal investigator of the study, this is a missed opportunity since up to 45 percent of Russian IDUs in narcology treatment are infected with HIV, yet as few as 20 percent of those are in care. \"The objective of this study is to imple- ment and assess a behavioral and structural intervention in Russia designed to support and motivate HIV-infected heroin-dependent narcology patients to engage in HIV medical care and ultimately improve their HIV out - comes,\" says Samet. LINC is a clinical model designed to coor - dinate narcology and HIV systems of care using an intervention inclusive of staff from both systems and composed of elements shown to facilitate engagement in medical care: HIV case management and nurse home visits. The central hypothesis is that an inter - vention that involves coordination between the narcology and HIV systems will lead to increased engagement in HIV medical care. \"Coordination will involve HIV case manage-ment delivered by a peer to help motivate and reduce barriers to HIV care engagement and enhanced outpatient narcology treat - ment delivered by an addiction nurse with communication between these providers,\" Samet adds. The project will be undertaken by an international research team experienced in addressing HIV, substance use, and clinical interventions in Russia.aetna foundation suPPorts study of obesity among african american Women As part of a $1 million funding program, the Aetna Foundation has provided a $233,000 grant to Boston University's Slone Epidemiology Center for a two-year study of factors that influence obesity among African American women\u2014including both individual and neighborhood-level factors\u2014and the identification of the most effective small changes individuals can make to decrease obesity rates among African American women. Researchers will examine data from more than 20,000 participants in the ongoing Black Women's Health Study, including diet and exercise patterns, psychosocial stressors, and the neighborhood environment in which the women live. Researchers led by Julie Palmer, PhD, professor of epidemiology, senior epidemiologist at the Slone Epidemiology Center, and principal investigator for the Black Women's Health Study, hope to identify small, actionable changes women can take to reduce weight gain. They also hope to acquire evidence that will lead to policy and institutional-level changes that can impact weight gain and obesity, such as neighborhood safety and walkability and grocery store accessibility. more onLIne: www.bu.edu/bwhs 19 Fall 2011 | www.bumc.bu.edu 18 campus & alumni news | BOSTON UNIVERSITY School of MedicineDeborah A. Frank, MD, BUSM professor of pediatrics, was installed as the first incumbent of a new chair in Child Health and Well-Being in the Department of Pediatrics on May 31. Generous donors, who wish to remain anonymous, established the endowed chair honoring Frank's many years of service to impoverished children who suffer from hunger and hardship. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, more than 17 million children in the United States lived in food-insecure households in 2009 (the most recent year for which data are available). In a 2010 report, the Feeding America/ Second Harvest emergency food network reported that 37 million Americans, including 14 million children, received food aid, a 46 percent increase over 2006. Compared to chil- dren who live in food-secure households, these children are at a much higher risk of poor health and hospitalization and are more likely to have developmental delays with long-term negative consequences for a healthy maturation.

Berry Brazelton at Boston Children's Hospital from 1979 to 1981, Frank has dedicated her practice to researching and mitigating the effects of child hunger and hardship locally and nationally and to advocating for funding and programs to address children's needs. In 1981, she established the Failure to Thrive Program at Boston City Hospital, now known as the Grow Clinic for Children at Boston Medical Center (BMC). She currently serves as the clinic's direc-tor. Her work focuses on breastfeeding promotion, nutrition among homeless pregnant women and children, failure to thrive, and the \"heat or eat\" choice many low-income families face each winter. Frank is also the founder and principal investigator of Children's HealthWatch, a network of pediatric and public health research- ers working to improve child health. A highly respected national authority, she has testified before both the United States and Massachusetts legislatures on the growing national problem of hunger and its effects on children. \"This chair in Child Health and Well-Being is in recognition of the person who exemplifies our Department of Pediatrics, and she fits the title of the chair as well,\" says Barry Zuckerman, MD, pro- fessor and chair of the BUSM Department of Pediatrics. Frank also leads research funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse on the effects of intrauterine exposure to cocaine and other substances on children's long-term development. She advo- cates at hearings and in the media against criminalizing addicted mothers or stigmatizing their children.She has served on numerous committees and advisory boards including the Mayor's Hunger Commission, the Massachusetts Child Hunger Initiative, and the Physicians T ask Force on Childhood Hunger in Massachusetts. She has received awards including the 2004 Standing Ovation Award, Massachusetts Human Services Coalition; the 2007 Woman of Valor Award, Jewish Funds for Justice; and the 2008 Woman of Justice Award, Massachusetts Lawyer's Weekly. In 2010, Frank received the Massachusetts Health Council Outstanding Leadership Award and the Physician Advocacy Merit Award from the Institute on Medicine as a Profession at Columbia University. Frank is the author of more than 50 papers and articles. A summa cum laude graduate of Radcliffe College and Harvard Medical School, she did her residency at Children's Orthopedic Hospital in Seattle. \"An endowed professorship is one of the most significant honors BUSM offers for its most esteemed teachers and research-ers,\" says BUSM Dean Karen Antman, MD. \"Many people support organizations that address hungry children around the world. The anonymous donors recognized that we have plenty of hungry and malnourished children right here in Boston and thus supported Dr. Frank and her work.\" \"No words can express my sincere gratitude to the donor, to Boston University School of Medicine, and to the Department of Pediatrics,\" says Frank. \"I will always strive to deserve this honor.\" When funding became available to endow a teaching position in the Department of Dermatology, Professor and Chair of Dermatology Rhoda Alani, MD, decided that supporting junior faculty was the high-est priority for the department and for BUSM. \"Endowing any faculty position allows faculty to have the freedom to choose what they can pursue academically,\" says Alani. \"For the most part, senior academics already have that freedom, but few junior faculty have the resources or the protected time to cultivate creative and untested ideas early in their careers. Assistant pro- fessorships provide these opportunities.\" Alani also stresses that having endowed positions is a tremendous incen- tive to attract new, gifted faculty to the institution: \"Benefits accrue to students and current faculty as well as to the whole School as these young scientists and teach-ers create opportunities for innovative research and intellectually rigorous training and collaboration.\" The appointments, one designated for clinical research and the other for basic science, are for three years. Alani hopes that additional funding sources and generous contributions will allow the department to build on this auspi-cious start. \"We look forward to expanding our resources in order to give our faculty the time and support necessary to carry their new ideas, forward-thinking pursuits, and groundbreaking scientific research to fruition.\"tHe Freedo M to cHoose FiRst ENDo WED Assist ANt PRoFEsso RsHiPs Est AbLis HED iN DEPAR tMENt dr. frank examines patients shauna trotman (below , far left) and patrick kenney (below , center and right ) sitting on the lap of his mother , jill hynes . tHe groW clinic NouRis HiNg CHiLDREN FoR 27 yEARs Started in 1984, the Grow Clinic for Children in BUSM's Department of Pediatrics at Boston Medical Center provides comprehensive spe-cialty medical, nutritional, developmental and social services, and dietary assistance to children whose weight or height is significantly below that which is expected for their age. These children range from moderately to severely malnourished and have shortened attention spans, impaired fine and gross motor skills, and increased risk of illness, emotional problems, and delayed learning and language skills. The Grow Clinic serves a diverse population of mostly low-income families from some of Greater Boston's poorest communities. The clinic provides a food prescription and links to Boston Medical Center's food pantry, baby food, vitamins and specialized nutritional supplements including special formulas for children with severe allergies that families cannot afford. Multilingual outreach workers visit homes and daycare sites to plan children's nutrition and provide transportation to the clinic, intensive social work, developmental assessment, mental health support, and links to commu- nity resources and programs including educational resources. \"We treat malnourished children who are our neighbors,\" says Deborah Frank, BUSM professor of pediatrics and director of the Grow Clinic. \"The children's average age is 16 months and 30 percent are infants under a year. We have experienced a 40 percent increase in new patients from 2009 to 2010.\" In addition to providing clinical services, the Grow Clinic advocates for policies to decrease the number of children in need. The clinic's intensive educational efforts and outreach to community health centers result in earlier intervention for such children, greatly increasing their chances of reaching their full growth potential and reducing their risk of hospitalization. According to Frank, without the Grow Clinic, many of these children would be hospitalized at great expense and many would relapse after dis-charge without specialized outpatient care. \"Some might die of complications. Most would be left physically and developmentally stunted throughout their lives, and some would end up in the foster care system,\" she adds. 23 Fall 2011 | www.bumc.bu.edu 22 campus & alumni news | BOSTON UNIVERSITY School of MedicineTHANk you, DoNorsGiving the chester s.

He has contributed to medical training, care, and administration as close to home as New Hampshire and as far away as Nepal and other countries. He brought his tremendous expertise to advancing BUSM as a member and then as chair of the BUSM Dean's Advisory Board (DAB) from 2005 to 2011. He recently converted a long-established student revolv - ing loan fund at the School to an endowed scholarship fund to better meet the financial aid needs of current BUSM students. Also a member of the BU Board of Overseers, Bagan cites his gratitude for his BUSM medical education as the primary reason for his involvement in and contributions to the School of Medicine. \"All of the things I have done in my professional life would not have been possible without my medical education at Boston University,\" he says. \"Merwyn Bagan is an outstanding physician who has used his tremendous abilities to advance the field of neu-rosurgery. Instead of retiring, he then studied for an MPH and used his experience and new skills to bring the ben- efits of quality health care to patients across the country and around the world,\" says Dean Karen Antman, MD. \"We are extremely fortunate to have him in a leadership role and I very much appreciate his willingness to share his expertise and counsel during my first six years at the School of Medicine.\" Bagan served as president of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the New Hampshire Medical Society. He co-founded Healthsource New Hampshire and Healthsource, Inc., state and national health maintenance organizations, and served as president and chair of Healthsource New Hampshire and chair of Healthsource, Inc. From 1995 to 2000, he lived in Nepal at the T ribhuvan University T eaching Hospital, where he helped establish a neurosurgery training program in the Department of Surgery, which remains self-sustaining and without for - eign aid. He also helped the hospital obtain $1 million of medical equipment. He is the recipient of the Distinguished Service Award from the Congress of Neurological Surgeons, the Humanitarian Award from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, the BUSM Distinguished Alumnus Award and the BU Alumni Award, and the Suprabal Gorkha Dakshina Bahu Award from King Birendra of Nepal. His current interests include an online professional networking site where neurosurgeons from around the world can discuss clinical and academic issues and offer case presentations. sherry l eventhal, Jd , is new chair of dean's advisory board Sherry Leventhal, JD, the new chair of the BUSM Dean's Advisory Board (DAB) as of June 2011, recognizes the high level of intellectual and organizational expertise the mem-bers of the DAB share and wants to more fully leverage their expertise to generate innovative ideas for advancing the mission of the School of Medicine. The DAB exists to counsel the dean of the School of Medicine and to actively participate in strategic planning, external rela- tions, and fundraising initiatives to better position BUSM. \"My focus is to have the group more involved in dis- secting issues that are of concern to Dean Antman,\" says Leventhal, \"to really use this board that is made up of people from all different walks of life, not just physicians. They offer many good ideas, and I want to integrate them and have the board helping plan strategy, or seeding ideas for new strategies.\" Leventhal's interest in BUSM stems from the excep- tional experience her two daughters had as medical stu-dents at the School. \"Both of my daughters, who are very different in personality and had very different plans for what they wanted to do when they graduated from medi- cal school, had an extraordinary experience there,\" she says. \"It was even more evident after they graduated and became residents, when they realized that this School had prepared them so well for the fields they went into.\"dean's advIsory Board * Mr. Menachem Abraham * Mr. Gerald Ajemian * Max M.

One is the School's high tuition; the other is the need to raise the profile of the School. \"T uition is too expensive, and these students are graduating with too much debt,\" she says. \"BU also needs to get out in the community, to be recognized for all of the excellent work it is doing.\" A trustee and past chair of the Board of T rustees of the Neighborhood House Charter School in Dorchester, Massachusetts, Leventhal serves on the Board of Administrators of T ulane University and served on the Board of T rustees of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. She is a graduate of Northwestern University and received her JD from T ulane University Law School. She was a partner at the New Orleans law firm of Lemle & Kelleher LLP until 1997, when she moved to the Boston area. DAB members are selected for three-year renew - able terms by the dean of the School of Medicine. The members of the DAB bring a rich diversity of experi- ence in medicine, research, disease areas, business, education, and other related professions that provides valuable expertise and support to the School and its educational programs. Board members' roles include acting as ambassa- dors to constituent groups, including alumni, industry, and the medical profession; communicating the School's vision and priorities; developing a culture of philanthropy; fostering active participation in building the DAB and recruiting other DAB members; and helping to secure philanthropic gifts for the School. 1 2 2.

Warner class of 2011 class gift The Class of 2011 voted to designate their class gift to the Babur Khalique Award Fund in memory of their classmate, Babur Khalique. The award will be given annually to one student to support a summer research scholarship for the study of traditional and non-traditional medical curricula, such as medical advocacy, health disparities, and art in medicine. Khalique, an MD-PhD graduate student in biomedi- cal engineering and medicine, died tragically in his third year of medical school. He touched so many lives across both the Medical Campus and the Charles River Campus. In that spirit, this class gift is unique in that it includes not only the mem- bers of the MD Class of 2011, but it also includes current students and graduating students and represents those in the master of arts, master of science, doctoral, and medicine programs. It also includes graduates from the School of Law and College of Engineering. Collectively this group raised $3,067. The Babur Khalique Award will be administered by the Medical Student Summer Research Program based in the Enrichment Office, and the first scholar - ship will be awarded in spring 2012. 2006 $325 donated 3 donors 2.5% participation x Katherine e.

Many students and their parents sent us condolence notes. We are very much thankful and appreciative of their efforts. Our special thanks go to the students who established the fund (and the website) in honor of our son's memory and also to the students, parents, and staff of BU and BUSM who made contributions to the memorial fund. We could not have survived without all this support from so many people during the most difficult period of our lives. We wish everyone in the class the best of luck in their careers. Their effort, help, and support will always be in our thoughts and memories. Hopefully, they will continue to contribute to the Babur Khalique Award Fund in the future and honor our son's memory. \u2014Abdul Khalique, Farhat Khalique, and Family Dean's Executive | Dean's Inner Circle | Dean's Council | Dean's Club Member | Anniversary Club Century Club Patron | x Century Club Member | Y oung Physicians Club | Lifetime Dean's Club39 Fall 2011 | www.bumc.bu.edu 38 campus & alumni news | BOSTON UNIVERSITY School of MedicineAluMNI NEWs dear alumni friends, The annual listing of alumni who con- tributed to the School during the pre- ceding fiscal year may appear to be simply page after page of names of graduates who have made gifts to the School. It is some- thing much more than that, though. The report of alumni donors represents the voices of many of our colleagues who are saying in a very tangi- ble way that BUSM is a worthy and valuable investment. And the very real return on this investment is the outstanding education the School pro-vides, which results in highly prepared graduates who compassionately care for patients and, in some cases, become leaders in our profession. We are deeply grateful for this demonstration of loyalty and commitment to the mission of the School. All alumni are invited to celebrate Alumni Weekend May 4 and 5, and those who graduated in years end-ing in 2 and 7, mark your calendars now for your upcoming reunion dinner on May 4! We'll be gathering on the Medical Campus and at the T aj Boston Hotel for a variety of events to help you connect with classmates and the School. Best regards, Jean E. Ramsey, MD '90, MPH '08 Assistant Dean for Alumni Affairs Associate Professor of Ophthalmology2011 r eunion classes r aise funds for n ew student r esidence Do you remember the Medical Campus? Do you recall the lack of creature comforts and trying to find rides back and forth to school? Imagine what life would be like living on campus. Imagine being able to study late at night there in a convenient, safe place. Knowing that teamwork is critical to modern medical care, Dean Karen Antman has led the effort to build a facility where students can live, study, and socialize together on campus. With the University's support, she has secured funding to build on-campus housing. The new medical school student residence that will become home to 208 first- and second-year medical students will be open to incoming students in the summer of 2012. The residence will feature apartment-style living spaces, both small and large group study rooms, a lounge with a television and a piano, mailboxes, and an exercise room. More than $1 million has been raised to date from School of Medicine alumni demonstrating support for this initia- tive. Reunion planning and fundraising started early for the Classes of 1961, 1981, and 1986. Members of the 50th Reunion Committee for the Class of 1961\u2014Phil Andrews, Phil Arena, Jeanne Arnold, Jack Evjy, George Garcia, Simon Parisier, and Burt White\u2014worked together to make their reunion a memorable event and committed to raising a reunion gift that would create a legacy to be appreciated by future generations of medical students. By rais- ing more than $121,000, they became the first class to name a suite in the new medical student residence. Richard Cavell led the giving with a donation of $50,000, with half of the class adding to the gift. Led by the efforts of M. Elizabeth Oates, members of the Class of 1981 raised more than $75,000 in gifts and pledges in honor of their 30th reunion. Oates was aided by 30th Reunion Committee members Jay Bachicha, Corey Langer, Mindy Langer, and Dan Romm, who encouraged their classmates to come back and give back. Alumni Association President N. Stephen Ober led the 25th reunion of his Class of 1986. By invoking the memories of Dean of Students Bill McNary, members of the 25th Reunion Committee\u2014including Joshua Feder, Neal Mandell, and Michael Singer\u2014encouraged their fellow classmates and were successful in raising $48,000 in gifts and pledges. Classes celebrating reunions in 2012 (class years ending in 2 and 7) are invited to partici- pate in the medical student residence opportunity.
