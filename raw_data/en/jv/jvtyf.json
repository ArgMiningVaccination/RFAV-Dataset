Cooper (Founder and Editor inChief of eCAM). Afterword by Amedeo Colleges of MDs andDentists, FNOMCeO) Introduction When one first discovers a book such as this, the naturallyspontaneous and optimistic impression that arises is that aserious, top-level cooperation among non-conventionalmedicine experts and university researchers is finallygetting under way in Italy, far from any sort of conflictof interests. And if one further considers that the results of this work have been acclaimed by a leading NCM/CAM journal, such as eCAM , and by the official journal of the Italian National Federation of Colleges of MDs andDentists (FNOMCeO), it is clear that a milestone hasbeen reached in CAM publications in Italy. Born from the Permanent Committee of Consensus and Coordination for Non-Conventional Medicines in Italy The origin of this book lies in the historic workshop at the Italian National Committee for Bioethics on 18 June2004 held by a delegation of the 'Permanent Committeeof Consensus and Coordination for Non ConventionalMedicines in Italy'. On that day a group of members of the Italian National Committee for Bioethics (among whom Prof. Carlo Flamigni andProf. Luisella Battaglia) came together leaded by Prof. Bruno Silvestrini, all open-minded and aware of the need for a dialog based on fairness, mutual listening and new scientific knowledge expertise. The dialog concentrated on the nine most reliable and representative CAMs disciplines, as acknowledged by Italian National Federation of Colleges of MDs and Dentists(FNOMCeO) in the Docume nt on Non-Conventional Medicines signed on 2002, which now falls under the exclusive competence, practice and respo nsibility of MDs (chiropractic, osteopathy, phytotherapy, In this respectthe recent Deontological Code of MDs and Dentists, approved on 16 December 2006, confirming the statement adopted on 2002, establishes as follows: 'physicians must not collaborate in any way with, or promote the activities of any person who is not a physician in the professional practice of Non-ConventionalMedicines (in Italy)'. The 43rd National Congress of the Italian Society of Psychiatry, held in October 2003, witnessed the foundation of the Consensus Conference on Non-Conventional Medicines in Italy, which has produced a document signed by 41 associations till now, among them many NCM/CAM patientassociations and the 'Tribunal for Patient Rights of Emilia- Romagna Region'. On 5 December 2003, the 'Permanent Committee of Consensus and Coordination for Non- Conventional Medicines in Italy' was founded, a non-profit organization which, since then, has become the point of referenceconcerning NCM/CAM for many institutions, whether on a national, regional, or local level. Currently, the Committee is made up of 23 associations: medical and scientific societies, federations and associations of patients, representing close to 12,000 medical doctors, dentists and veterinarians.

Theauthoritative presence of many distinguished scientists andresearchers, all reliable representatives of the CAMacademic community, is one of the many qualifying aspectsof the book. The book is the result of a challenging newparadigm of health, which the most open-minded eCAMMedical expert researcher should consider an opportunityto renew medicine as a person-oriented discipline com-mitted to human health and well-being. The first part of the publication deals with many 'open questions' regarding the request for NCM/CAM on behalf of individuals: both public and private offers, their different organization and professional character-istics; the role of the political system, on both nationaland local levels, according to NCM/CAM regulation; thechallenges facing EBM and research, including methodsof verifying the efficacy and effectiveness of CAMs; newpaths in university education; ethical principles implied ofcorrect and safe CAM practice and the new world-view that they represent. In the second part of the volume, some of the most qualified representatives of the various CAM currentlypracticed in Italy show the state of the disciplines in ourcountry, recent history and CAM's instruments foreducation, professional practice and research, concluding with a consideration of the main problems involved in integrating CAMs in the Italian National Health System. The overall result is a rich and varied overview of CAM without precedent, reflecting the trend toward atrue pluralism in health, whose strong potentialitiesinclude all necessary elements and conditions for a deeprenewal of our culture and systems in the field of health. This book is a useful instrument for all those, from the medical researcher to common people, who wish to become acquainted with their understanding of CAMs.Due to its easy, clear and complete layout, this book isbound to become a book of reference on CAMs in Italy. We strongly hope that the publication of this book will herald the legislation to which the government hascommitted itself and which we have been awaiting fornearly 20 years.492 Book reviewSubmit your manuscripts at http://www.hindawi.com Stem Cells International Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume 2014 Hindawi Publishing Corporation 2014M Publishing Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume 2014Disease Markers Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume 2014BioMed Research International OncologyJournal of Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume 2014 Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume 2014Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume 2014PPAR Research The Scientific World Journal Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume 2014 Immunology Research Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume 2014Journal of ObesityJournal of Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume 2014 Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume 2014 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine OphthalmologyJournal of Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume 2014 Diabetes ResearchJournal of Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume 2014 Hindawi Publishing http://www.hindawi.com 2014Research and TreatmentAIDS Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume Research Practice Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com Volume 2014Parkinson's Disease Evidence-Based Complementary and "}
