Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the pancreas. The [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a [gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side. The wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail. The pancreas lies between the [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the [spine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=415914&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The pancreas has two main jobs in the body: The [digestive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46446&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) juices are made by [exocrine pancreas cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270856&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the hormones are made by [endocrine pancreas cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270854&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). About 95% of [pancreatic cancers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44521&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270856&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This summary about exocrine pancreatic cancer. For information on endocrine pancreatic cancer, see the summary on [Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (Islet Cell Tumors) Treatment](/types/pancreatic/patient/pnet-treatment-pdq). Smoking and health history can affect the risk of pancreatic cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include the following: - Smoking. - Being very overweight. - Having a personal history of [diabetes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44911&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or [chronic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45641&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [pancreatitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45106&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Having a [family - Having certain [hereditary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45983&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as: Signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, pain, and weight loss. Pancreatic cancer may not cause early [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Signs and symptoms may be caused by pancreatic cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose early. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect and [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for the following reasons: - There aren't any noticeable signs or symptoms in the early [stages](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)of pancreatic cancer. - The signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer, when present, are like the signs and symptoms of many other illnesses. - The pancreas is hidden behind other [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)such as the stomach, [small intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [gallbladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46395&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [spleen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46593&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [bile ducts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Tests that examine the pancreas are used to diagnose and stage pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed with tests and procedures that make pictures of the pancreas and the area around it. The process used to find out if [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have spread within and around the pancreas is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time. In order to plan treatment, it is important to know the stage of the disease and whether or not the pancreatic cancer can be removed by [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The following tests and procedures may be used: [Physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798522&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. [Blood chemistry studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as [bilirubin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44518&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), released into the blood by organs and [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. [Tumor marker test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=732562&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A procedure in which a sample of blood, [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as [CA 19-9](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=633729&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [carcinoembryonic antigen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=357558&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(CEA), made by organs, tissues, or [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called [tumor markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). [CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)machine. A dye may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized CT](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44460&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)makes a series of very detailed pictures of areas inside the body using an x-ray machine that scans the body in a spiral path. [PET scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46140&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)cells in the body. A small amount of [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a [PET-CT](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=742485&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Abdominal [ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46157&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): An ultrasound exam used to make pictures of the inside of the abdomen. The [ultrasound transducer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=367430&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is pressed against the skin of the abdomen and directs high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) into the abdomen. The sound waves bounce off the internal tissues and organs and make echoes. The transducer receives the echoes and sends them to a computer, which uses the echoes to make pictures called [sonograms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The picture can be printed to be looked at later. - [Endoscopic ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46602&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(EUS): A procedure in which an [endoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46428&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is inserted into the body, usually through the mouth or [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)for viewing. A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. This procedure is also called endosonography. [Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46429&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(ERCP): A procedure used to x-ray the [ducts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46441&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(tubes) that carry [bile](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46508&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Sometimes pancreatic cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing jaundice. An endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is passed through the mouth, [esophagus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46408&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and stomach into the first part of the small intestine. A [catheter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45637&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(a smaller tube) is then inserted through the endoscope into the pancreatic ducts. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is injected through the catheter into the ducts and an x-ray is taken. If the ducts are blocked by a tumor, a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it. This tube (or [stent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44903&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) may be left in place to keep the duct open. Tissue samples may also be taken. [Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46238&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(PTC): A procedure used to x-ray the liver and bile ducts. A thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver. Dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an x-ray is taken. If a blockage is found, a thin, flexible tube called a stent is sometimes left in the liver to [drain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407759&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body. This test is done only if [ERCP](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46424&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)cannot be done. [Laparoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A [surgical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease. Small [incisions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a [laparoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44360&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. The laparoscope may have an ultrasound probe at the end in order to bounce high-energy sound waves off internal organs, such as the pancreas. This is called laparoscopic ultrasound. Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as taking tissue samples from the pancreas or a sample of [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)from the abdomen to check for cancer. - Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)by a [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to check for signs of cancer. There are several ways to do a biopsy for pancreatic cancer. A [fine needle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45691&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or a [core needle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641799&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)may be inserted into the pancreas during an x-ray or ultrasound to remove cells. Tissue may also be removed during a laparoscopy or surgery to remove the tumor. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment options depend on the following: - Whether or not the tumor can be removed by surgery. - The stage of the cancer (the size of the tumor and whether the cancer has spread outside the pancreas to nearby tissues or [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or to other places in the body). - The patient's general health. - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(come back). Pancreatic cancer can be controlled only if it is found before it has spread, when it can be completely removed by surgery. If the cancer has spread, [palliative treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45815&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can improve the patient's [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by controlling the symptoms and [complications](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463706&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of this disease. Stages of Pancreatic Cancer Key Points - Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer: - Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - The following groups are used to plan treatment: - Resectable pancreatic cancer - Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer - Locally advanced pancreatic cancer - Metastatic pancreatic cancer - Recurrent pancreatic cancer Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis. The process used to find out if [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread within the [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to other parts of the body is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The information gathered from the staging process determines the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of some of the tests used to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [pancreatic cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44521&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are often also used to stage the disease. See the [General Information](/types/pancreatic/patient/pancreatic-treatment-pdq#_110) section for more information. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to other parts of the body. - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) break away from where they began (the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and travel through the lymph system or blood. - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)( [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)tumor) in another part of the body. - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if pancreatic cancer spreads to the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the cancer cells in the liver are actually pancreatic cancer cells. The disease is metastatic pancreatic cancer, not liver cancer. The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer: Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) In [stage 0](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=535776&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are found in the lining of the [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These abnormal cells may become [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and spread into nearby normal [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Stage 0 is also called [carcinoma in situ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46488&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Stage I In [stage I](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45482&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has formed and is found in the [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) only. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB, depending on the size of the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Stage IA: The [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is 2 [centimeters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or smaller. - Stage IB: The [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is larger than 2 [centimeters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)but not larger than 4 centimeters. Stage II [Stage II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45490&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is divided into stages IIA and IIB, depending on the size of the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and where the [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread. - Stage IIA: The [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is larger than 4 [centimeters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Stage IIB: The [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is any size and [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)has spread to 1 to 3 nearby [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Stage III In [stage III](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45497&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is any size and [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread to: - four or more nearby [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); or - the major [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)near the [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Stage IV In [stage IV](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45511&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is any size and [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread to other parts of the body, such as the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [peritoneal cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the body cavity that contains most of the [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). The following groups are used to plan treatment: Resectable pancreatic cancer [Resectable](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44568&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) pancreatic cancer can be removed by [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) because it has not grown into important blood vessels near the tumor. Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer has grown into a major blood vessel or nearby tissue or organs. It may be possible to remove the tumor, but there is a high risk that all of the cancer cells will not be removed with surgery. Locally advanced pancreatic cancer [Locally advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45955&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) pancreatic cancer has grown into or close to nearby lymph nodes or blood vessels, so surgery cannot completely remove the cancer. Metastatic pancreatic cancer [Metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) pancreatic cancer has spread to other organs, so surgery cannot completely remove the cancer. Recurrent pancreatic cancer [Recurrent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45862&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [pancreatic cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44521&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or in other parts of the body. Treatment Option Overview Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. - The following types of treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Chemoradiation therapy - Targeted therapy - There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. - Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Treatment for pancreatic cancer may cause side effects. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. Different types of treatment are available for patients with [pancreatic cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44521&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. The following types of treatment are used: Surgery One of the following types of [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used to take out the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): [Whipple procedure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46653&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A surgical procedure in which the head of the [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [gallbladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46395&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), part of the [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), part of the [small intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [bile duct](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)are removed. Enough of the is left to produce [digestive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46446&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [juices](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46239&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [insulin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46187&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Total pancreatectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46694&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): This operation removes the whole pancreas, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, the [common bile duct](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46466&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [Distal pancreatectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44519&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the body and the tail of the pancreas. The spleen may also be removed if cancer has spread to the spleen. If the cancer has spread and cannot be removed, the following types of [palliative surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45815&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be done to relieve [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and improve [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): [Biliary bypass](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=775967&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): If cancer is blocking the bile duct and [bile](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46508&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is building up in the gallbladder, a biliary bypass may be done. During this operation, the doctor will cut the gallbladder or bile duct in the area before the blockage and sew it to the small intestine to create a new pathway around the blocked area. [Endoscopic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46428&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [stent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44903&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)placement: If the tumor is blocking the bile duct, surgery may be done to put in a stent (a thin tube) to [drain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407759&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)bile that has built up in the area. The doctor may place the stent through a [catheter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45637&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that drains the bile into a bag on the outside of the body or the stent may go around the blocked area and drain the bile into the small intestine. [Gastric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46770&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)bypass: If the tumor is blocking the flow of food from the stomach, the stomach may be sewn directly to the small intestine so the patient can continue to eat normally. Radiation therapy [Radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or keep them from growing. [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Chemotherapy [Chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( [systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). [Combination chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is treatment using more anticancer drug. See [Drugs Approved for Pancreatic Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/pancreatic) for more information. Chemoradiation therapy [Chemoradiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306495&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) combines chemotherapy and radiation therapy to increase the effects of both. Targeted therapy [Targeted therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. [Tyrosine kinase inhibitors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44833&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (TKIs) are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow. [Erlotinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=508929&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of TKI used to treat pancreatic cancer. See [Drugs Approved for Pancreatic Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/pancreatic) for more information. There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer. Pain can occur when the tumor presses on [nerves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other organs near the pancreas. When pain [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is not enough, there are treatments that act on nerves in the abdomen to relieve the pain. The doctor may inject medicine into the area around affected nerves or may cut the nerves to block the feeling of pain. Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy can also help relieve pain by shrinking the tumor. See the [PDQ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) summary on [Cancer Pain](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/pain/pain-pdq) for more information. Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs. Surgery to remove the pancreas may affect its ability to make [pancreatic enzymes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46704&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that help to [digest](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463707&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) food. As a result, patients may have problems digesting food and absorbing [nutrients](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44697&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into the body. To prevent [malnutrition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46014&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the doctor may prescribe medicines that replace these enzymes. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). Treatment for pancreatic cancer may cause side effects. For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, see our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects) page. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from [recurring](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI's [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search) webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) website. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer or to find out the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has changed or if the cancer has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back). These tests are sometimes called [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tests or check-ups.

To Learn More About Pancreatic Cancer For more information from the [National Cancer Institute](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44266&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) about pancreatic cancer, see the following: For general [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) information and other resources from the National Cancer Institute, see the following: About This PDQ Summary About PDQ Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq). PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of adult pancreatic cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment). Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials).
