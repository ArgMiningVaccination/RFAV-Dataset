It also has many groupings of asanas. Vinyasa Yoga: A vinyasa is a smooth transition between asanas in modern yoga exercises such as Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, Bikram Yoga and Vinyasa Krama Yoga, especially when movement is paired with the breath. Hatha Yoga: When you think of yoga in general terms, this branch of yoga typically comes to mind. The practise involves body, mind and breath, and classes are usually of breathing and meditation.

YOGA FOR DISEASES AND POSTURAL ISSUES YOGA FOR ARTHRITIS Here are a few yoga poses and techniques by Ms Namita Piparaiya, Yoga and Ayurveda Lifestyle Specialist, Founder - Yoganama that are good for Arthritis. Sukshama Vyvayama: These are gentle joint rotation exercises that can be done while sitting on a chair, and most of them can also be done lying down. Regularly doing these joint activation movements keeps the joint lubricated and prevents stiffness and pain. Breathing Exercises: Breathing exercises should be done both before and after the yoga session. In the beginning, more heating practices like Kapalabhati or Bhastrika can be done as they assist in warming up the body and increasing circulation. More cooling and meditative pranayama practices like Equal Breathing or Alternate nostril breathing can be done after the session. Sun Salutations: These are invigorating and refreshing; however, care should be taken to modify the sequence suitably for your specific condition. For instance, forward bends can aggravate lower back pain. In this case, it is wiser to place your hands on a chair instead of forcing the hands to reach for the ground. Holding Poses: Postures should be held for 5 to 9 breaths each to build strength and stability. When holding poses, it is essential to get the alignment right, so we are strong and stable. Repeatedly doing postures with incorrect form is not suitable for the joints. Bridge Pose is good for the lower back. Warrior Poses are ideal for the knees and legs. Tree Pose helps improve balance. The cat-cow pose is excellent for finding fluidity in the spine. Corpse Pose is perfect for complete relaxation and recovery. YOGA FOR BACK PAIN Back pain has become one of the most common ailments that most of us face lately. The causes for back pain are plenty, and they range from lifestyle defects to more severe conditions like scoliosis or spondylitis. Back pain can also be muscular or have to do with the spine and nerves. The most common reason for back pain, especially among students, working professionals and homemakers is postural defects. Our spine has 4 natural curves that help with shock absorption and load-bearing. When you deviate from those curves, (due to bad posture, bad sleeping habits etc.) your muscles try to bring the spine back to those natural curves. This continuous stress on the strengths and spine causes back pain. Some of the most common postural defects by Jahnavi Patwardhan (Yoga Instructor, Sarva Yoga) are- A hunch back: this usually occurs due to working on a laptop for too long, hunching over books or looking at the phone for too long. This causes the upper back to round and the upper back and neck muscles to tighten. This stiffness can cause pain. One of the most effective upper back stretches the puppy pose. Mastyasana can help relieve tension in the upper back as well. Bhujangasana: Exaggerated lumbar curve. This, along with weak lower back muscles, can cause tremendous lower back pain. An exaggerated lower back curve is usually seen in women, especially during and after pregnancy. This pain can be relieved with some lower back stretches like bhujangasana, sphinx pose, reclined pigeon pose. Some poses to relax the lower back are Childs pose, reclined spinal twist. Navasana: And lastly, one of the most important things to do is to strengthen the back. Your back pain can be simply due to weak back muscles. Some poses to strengthen the back and core muscles are navasana, vashishtasana, shalabhasana and setubandhasana.
