(JF) Administrative aspectsof educational planning Contributions to a seminarheld at the International Institutefor Educational Planning23 June - 4 July 1969 Organized by Raymond Lyons Unesco: International Institute for OFFICIALOFFICE OF EDUCATION POSITIONOR POLICY Produced and printed in France by theInternational Institute for Educational Planning9 rue Eugene-Delacroix ,75 Paris-16October 1970 2 PREFACE Every country, whether industrialized or developing, is faced today with the same necessity:that of ensuring, by suitable policies, a continuous , balanced, andif possible accelerated socialand economic development.In most countries the method chosen for this purpose has been socialand economic planning; and even in those countries where the word 'plan' itself is avoided, govern-ment policies are founded on the study and forecasting of future social and economic development.The development of educational systems tends ,consequently, to be woven more and moreclosely into the general economic and social pattern; and the goals of educational planning becomeintegrated in the general plan with which they are associated, not merely as one of the basic finan-cial options but also as both ends and means in national planning itself.In most countries, however ,the introduction of planning into the existing administrativeframework, and the setting-up of a new and active 'Ministry of Planning' or similar organism,have brought difficult problems of adaptation and change.On the one hand, the introduction of a new and specialized Ministry, to inaugurate and co-ordinate the preparation and execution of a social and economic plan, is an enterprise fraught withhazards of many kinds. From a structural point of view, how will this new entity be fitted in amongthe traditional ministries and integrate its activities with theirs? How can its arduous but essentialwork of initiating and co-ordinating - and, at times ,of directing - be made acceptable to the otherministries, and particularly to the all-powerful Ministry of Finance? The multiplicity of solutionsto these problems that have been tried demonstrates the great variety of structures and adminis-trative methods in different countries and, at the same time, the strength of the resistance whichthe new institutions have encountered.On the other hand, whatever the degree of authority conferred on the Planning Ministry,the extension of planning to the entire range of economic and social activity - education included -necessarily implies wide participation by all ministries within their respective fields of compe-tence, in the preparation and elaboration of the plan. This participation, which must be extendedin various ways to the regional and local levels of administration, presupposes a fundamental trans-formation of administrative mentalities and methods. The 'pioneering' spirit of planning must re-place the routine of annual budgeting; to the criterion of economy, engraved on the heart of everyadministrator of the old school, must now be joined the new criteria of efficiency and rate ofreturn in financial and administrative direction. The organisation of planning operations willlead, in no small measure ,to a radical re-appraisal of the structures , the means and the methodsof traditional administrations , so as to adapt them to their new, difficult, but inspiring tasks. Preface The same is true regarding the planning of the quantitative and qualitative development ofsystems of instruction and training. In every country the introduction of the idea of planning, thecreation of a Planning Ministry, the starting of the planning process , have brought before Minis-tries of Education problems for which they were, at the outset, manifestly ill-prepared.Administrative and technical machinery has to be set up , for a start ,as much in the frame-work of the Ministry of Planning as in that of the Ministry of Education, based on a logical divisionof responsibilities - machinery that can undertake, in close liaison with research organisations, areasoned study of the possible and desirable future of the educational system , and can proceed topolicy decisions and their effective implementation. At the same time, the personnel of the sec-tions responsible for the preparation and execution of the plan must be given new, or additional,training, essential if they are to be fully capable of undertaking these new tasks. It is to these tworelated fields that the Seminar on the Administrative Aspects of Educational Planning, held by IIEPin June-July 1969 for the directors and professors of Unesco Regional Centres for Planning andAdministration and representatives of national training centres (University or other), directed itsattention.Papers presented by various participants, and a report of the Seminar prepared byRaymond Lyons , are offered in this volume in the hope that they will provide help and inspirationto all those - politicians, administrators, experts and others - who are continually seeking theright solutions in a field in which the coming years will see no lessening of either importance orurgencyThe Institute expresses its appreciation to all those who participated in this seminar , andespecially to the authors whose papers are reproduced here.

Lyons The task of educational administration in the next decade is to develop, change and adapteducational services in a period of unprecedented change. Knowledge is growing more rapidlythan ever before in human history. New jobs and the techniques of the old ones are evolvingso swiftly that the mastery of them is not a once-and-for-all process but involves continuousstudy and re-learning throughout professional life. A rising demand for education, for socialand professional advancement, is associated with a searching and critical attitude to educationby students, teachers, parents, and employers and a desire to participate in its operation andimprovement.The experience of recent years and the demands for education which must be met inthe future have given new force to the call to examine the ways in which planning can helpeducational administrators carry out the task of developing educational services as efficientlyas possible.It is necessary to examine not only how planning can help administrators, buthow educational administration itself must change in order to cope with problems and tasks ofa size and character with which earlier administrative structures, attitudes and procedureswere not designed to cope.This was the aim of the Seminar on the Administrative Aspects ofEducational Planning which met in Paris from 23 June to 4 July 1969. This group of peoplerepresented teachers and research workers drawn from government departments, UnescoRegional Training Centres and universities. The participants came from countries with awide variety of situations as far as the part of planning in national administration was con-cerned.The aim of this report is not to outline a consensus, since no formal consensus wasreached, but to give the impression of one participant in a very rich and interesting meeting.The deliberations of the seminar resulted in generalizations, and it is always difficultto avoid the traps into which general statements made at conferences invite one to fall. Whatis true of one country may be manifestly false of another, and every report on this subjectinevitably includes a plea for more country case studies in order to find out how administration 118 e\\clministration aspects or educational planning can best employ planning.It is perhaps necessary to mention that this conference did not pre-tend to make an analysis of the needs of countries for education and of how administration couldhest organize education to meet those needs. The undertaking of such an analysis in eachcountry is implicit in the subject of the seminar; its main aim was to examine how arrange-ments for the development of education, from policy-making to the implementation of policies,could be made more effective.In making this examination, it seemed to be common ground that both education and itsadministration are ill-suited to cope with today's problems. The task, therefore, is twofold :first, to make education more internally effective, that is to obtain 'better' returns in the formof educated people from the resources put into it; second, to adapt education to the needs ofsociety.To achieve these aims, the people who guide education must undertake new tasks andaccept new responsibilities. Planning is at the heart of the problem of meeting the new responsi-bilities of education.But the reform of administration to make planning meaningful in terms ofwhat is done is equally important. Discussion of these propositions put the different problemsinvolved in establishing improved administration into perspective : decision-making in relationto planning, converting decisions into action, and the use of new methods and the training ofpeople to do so.The following represents the main impressions of the debate. The difficulty of adequate decision-makingPlanning was seen to provide a firm element in enabling decision-makers to make changes,many of which cover a time span extending over a number of years. At present, when allaspects of life are evolving quickly, it is necessary that the educational policy-maker shouldhave access to the best possible appreciation of the situation based on the facts, and that un-certainty regarding the future should be reduced by informed and relatively reliable projections.These are the pre-conditions for reaching a judgment of an optimizing nature, as between theadvantages of different alternatives, and of thus establishing a firm claim in the competition forscarce resources.The crucial question was whether, in fact, judgments were reached on thebasis of diagnosis and projections established by the planning services, or whether they weremud.- by rule of thumb, by an intuitive feeling on the part of policy-makers that, on the basis ofpast experience, a certain course of action would seem right and acceptable. Clearly this'intuitive' approach to decision-making can never be dispensed with. The advantages of wellprepared diagnosis and proposals for the future, as a supplement to it, would however seemevident.It was stated that planning was most useful when firmly linked with action. In this senseits usefulness may be assessed in relation both to the formulation of major targets for educa-tional development and also to its contribution to the determination and regulation of the norms 12 Report of the seminar which govern educational provision, and to the improvement of the functional performance ofthe resources involved in educational provision. It is relatively easy, technically, to producea plan.It is more difficult to give detailed effect to it, administratively and technically. Mereit was seen that decisions must be based on previous assessment of the feasibility of carryingthem out.There must also be means by which control can be exercised, in terms of time,space, resources and people in implementing decisions. Consequently the integration of plan-ning into administration requires that there should be a team of administrators managing thesystem who are linked, as the players in an orchestra are linked, with all those who play apart in its development.As a participant remarked, 'The orchestra must be good or the musicwon't be'. The levels of decisionThis concept of an orchestra, to be meaningful, implies that the government and its subordinatebodies are committed to be guided by and to implement planning, and that the appropriate insti,tutions and personnel have been created or made available to undertake it usefully. 1/ Theapproach to this concept was eclectic. There was no implicit model of the ideal relationshipbetween the central government and the regional and local bodies. Some countries, for historicaland political reasons, had centralized systems with control of education from the centre, othershad de-centralized systems with a large measure of regional and local autonomy. The problemwas for each country to examine how educational planning can be organized, and assist admini-stration 'get the necessary things done' ,given the traditional ways (which were not immutable)in which education is organized and controlled.As far as centrally controlled systems are concerned, it seemed to be that the centralgovernment should exercise a decisive role in determining the future development of educationand that the ministry of education should have prime responsibility in drawing up and implement-ing the educational plan.Three prerequisites were thought essential. First, a board or nationalcouncil of education which would exercise the main advisory role to the minister on the goals ofeducation itself.Second, a planning commission which would have the responsibility in consulta-tion with educational and other planning personnel for drawing up proposals for the developmentof education over the long term and also in the plan period. Third, a team of administrators whowould manage the operation of the system in relation to the objectives which had been decided. Indrawing up plan proposals co- operation between these three groups ..;ould be close.Examples provided by the participants showed considerable variety as far as precisearrangements were concerned. The essential point was that ministers and national representa-tive bodies should have available for political decision a firm guide for education in terms of the 1/See A. W. P. Cluruge, 'Functional analysis of educational planning'. 13 Administrative aspects of educational planning aims of education itself and the needs of the economy and society. This guidance would beshaped by estimates of the needs of the economy for trained personnel, demographic trends,the form and content of education and on the other hand by financial, human and other resourceavailabilities.Examples provided from the experience of France and Romania showed how educa-tional planning (which in both cases was imperative) was undertaken, as part of economic andsocial planning respectively of an indicative and an imperative character. The first draft ex-ploration of the future was undertaken by the planning commission in close consultation withthe central planning agency. It was then submitted to the various representative bodies anddiscussed widely, with those who want something from education and those who want educationto do something for society, before being revised. After further consultation with the centralplanning agency it was submitted by the agency to the government who finally presented it toparliament which adopted it after discussion. The plan thereafter served as a guide to actionfor the financial and administrative services in education. In both these cases,it may benoted that educational provision is centrally controlled and operated through officials at theregional and local levels who participate in the drawing-up of the plan by providing the basisof knowledge and consensus which are essential for its feasibility. Once the plan has beenpolitically determined, the ministry of education in liaison with the office of the plan and theministry of finance possesses the technical means at the central, regional and local levels forimplementing it. 1/In developing countries which, before independence, had been associated with theBritish system it was pointed out that an important role of central government still obtained,although the instruments through which it was exercised had to operate in a structure of welldeveloped regional, local and institutional independence. Financial contributions by thecentral government and central advice concerning educational structure, standards, teachersupply, school design, etc. ,represented the main form of guidance. The example of Englandand Wales itself showed that the authorities were to an increasing extent, at the central andregional levels, using the advice of planning officers in assessing the basis for the total grantto education, its distribution, and the efficient development of educational services.The cases of India and Brazil highlighted some of the difficulties of planning in largefederal countries where central decisions based upon planning advice had only a limited effecton what was done in the individual states, districts and localities. In India the economic pro-jections on which the plans were based had proved over-optimistic, whereas educationalprovision by the states had greatly exceeded, at all levels, the targets included in the educa-tional plans.Partly, though not mainly, this was due to the difficulty of influencing the1/See Raymond Poignant, 'Functional analysis and administrativeorganization :the case of France'. 1411 Report of the seminar development of private education. There were also problems of language or of regionalaspirations.There had been a deterioration in the efficiency of education in the sense thatthe number of pupils had grown more rapidly than the volume of real resources necessaryto deal adequately with them. It was necessary,if planning was to be useful, that improvedmethods of co-ordination and information should be worked out between the federal, stateand district levels.In Brazil there was discussion as to whether it would be useful to unify the admini-stration of education in the country so that it might be planned, controlled and developedunder central finance and guidance. Only one state, Sao Paulo, was in a position to plan itseducation under existing circumstances. In the remaining states resources were scarce,there was multiplicity of controlling agencies and the efficiency of educational servicestended to Le rather low.The federal responsibility fur education might include not only theplanning of capital development in consultation with the states but resources for currentexpenditure alsolA this was clearly a highly controversial issue and no clear conclusionemerged.While the role of central government was thought to be important, there was strongemphasis also on the need for a polycentric approach in plan preparation and execution. Incountries where planning had made little progress it was found that the regional, local andinstitutional links with the centre were not strong enough to allow the preparation andexecution of the plan.It was desirable that, at each of these levels, administrators shouldhave the time and the capability to undertake planning tasks. The government's commitmentto planning should include specific provision for the necessary institutional arrangementswhereby, without undue proliferation of personnel, administrators in the planning services,line and service directorates at central and regional levels, could work effectively in plan-ning.Plans are goals, and become reality only when the budgetary and other resources aredeployed in the respective component programmes and projects. There was a critical levelof feasibility, determined by pre-planning and negotiation at the central and subordinatelevels, below which the plan itself was not. feasible. Plans should be realisable admistratively. Participation in planningParticipation was essential in drawing up the plan and, in the widest sense, in aiding its imple-mentation.Considerable stress was laid on the importance of personal communication : theminister should talk to his professional advisers and to his colleagues, there should be fulldiscussions of the work of the mixed commissions at national level, with the planning unit 1/See also Claude Tibi, 'The administrative relationship betweeneconomic planning and educational planning'. 1512 Administrative aspects of educational planning playing a secretarial role.The proposals of the planning commission should be discussedregionally and locally and should reflect the needs and possibilities for educational develop-ment of those levels.Mass media and research and experiment should both make their con-tribution to the plan.In participation, prior to the approval of the plan the voice of all those concernedwith education should be taken account of through competent delegates. The people on thestreets should be consulted about proposed changes in education through their political dele-gates, and the students and teachers through their professional delegates. The credit ofplanning in the mind of the people would be a function of the thoroughness of this process andof the extent to which approved objectives benefited from their active support.But the existence of reactionary pressure groups might mean that mass participa-tion, in the anarchist sense, resulted only in mass reaction that political opposition mightmobilize opinion in favour of tradition and immobility rather than change. Though thisdanger existed, the balance of evidence suggested that the views of the man in the streettended to favour progress rather than retard it. Examples were given of mass consultationin connection with educational reform; in the Soviet Union two million questionnaires werecompleted and there was wide discussion through the press, radio and in meetings on therecent reform of secondary education. Educational services would, like other publicservices, have to be provided by the power apparatus. But it was desirable that this powershould be exercised in a manner which permitted lively opposition to and discussion of theobjectives of plans.Planning was, in itself, an objective process. The centre must decide, or in de-centralized systems suggest, what can be done in the light of the limit of possibilities. Butits decisions must be based on a sincere relationship between politics and planning (at pre-sent,it was argued, there was a divorce in many countries) and between political and pro-fessional representatives and the public. This relationship involved careful attention tolocal and regional suggestions.Participation should also be related to action, whereas it was frequently onlyidentified with consultation. At the village level discussion might show that the villagersattached first priority to the provision of electricity rather than a new school, and there-fore the new school would not necessarily represent the first priority for action. In plan-ning change teachers should be encouraged to experiment in new :methods and approachesas part of the elaboration of educational reform, since they would be responsible for imple-mentation.Students at different levels could contribute from their out-of-school backgrounds,and teaching methods should take these possibilities into account. The contribution ofregional and local administrators, heads of institutions and inspectors was vital for ensuring 1613. Report of the seminar effective action in implementing programmes and projects, and this must be secured. Plan-making and implementation, and the diversity of decisions involved, was partly a problem ofinitiating the appropriate group dynamics. The qualitative improvement of educational provisionThe underlying premise which dominated the discussion was that it was not enough to attemptto make the existing system work a little better. It was necessary to seek to reflect the needsof society, in an era of unprecedented change in the educational system. It was important toexamine and make changes in formal arrangements and structures, but the real issue was whatwas happening in dynamic activity inside the structures. This involves a new type of processfor getting things clone;political consciousness, informed energies, new approaches to socialfactors.Planning helped to get this job clone.It was suggested that two sets of distinctions concerning education and administration,respectively, might be useful in approaching the problem of qualitative improvement ofeducation. 1/A static approach to education was confined to making useful changes in educationthrough improving and enriching inputs while maintaining the traditional means of education:for example, reducing numbers per class or improving the qualifications of the teaching force.A dynamic approach started from the assumption that the existing status quo was unsatisfactory,fitted neither to the new cultural requirements nor to the lives of the children. The same dis-tinction was made in respect of efficiency and change. Efficiency involved taking a specificlearning objective and achieving it at least cost in terms of economic and pedagogical resources.Change included rethinking what is taught to make it more relevant to the needs of the economy,society and the student.Administration could also be static or dynamic. The static concept involved keepingthe existing system operating in the same way. Administration was frequently wedded to astatic model.Administrators were taught the 'tricks of the trade' and did not acquire ananalytical basis with which to examine the system's performance and validity. Many administra-tors lost their personal identity and did not develop an independent critical thinking capacity.They should be trained to judge the system and prepare new designs for the sub-systems whichcomposed it.This required the best brains and the realized possibility within administrationfor independent critical thought. Plann:ng was a matter not merely of making the existingsystem larger and entrenching its archaic aspects, but of altering it and adding new dimensions.The problem was to start with what we have and progressively introduce change in the old model.This required a breed of administrators trained for change.1/See Philip H. Coombs,' The world educational crisis : a systems analysis', New York, London, Toronto, Oxford University Press, 1968. 17l'1 Administrative aspects of educational planning It was agreed that reform of what is taught and how it is taught is a long and difficulttask.Changes could not be effected too rapidly or too frequently. Socratic pedagogy was stillbasically unchanged, although the increase in numbers rendered it less effective. In manycountries which had experienced fundamental political changes the main elements of curriculum,methods and structure had survived. It was suggested, for example, that in one country success-ful qualitative change could only be achieved when 'every school had been burnt down and everyteacher over thirty was dead in a ditch'. Without necessarily endorsing such extremes, theparticipants noted the difficulty of organizing and achieving basic progress in changing education.Radical changes were more easily effected in a country like the United States, with prevailinganti-traditionalist attitudes, massive resources, decentralization of educational control and animportant private system, than in countries with centralized state-operated systems. This wasan argument for widespread independence, experiment and decentralization, and posed the prob-lem of how a centralized system could build in the necessary flexibility to achieve desirablechange.It was suggested that in all systems the centre had a guiding or a useful advisory roleto play.It was desirable that the goals and methods of education itself should be reviewedcentrally by some type of board of education or national commission for education, and thatchange should be planned in the light of information, research and experiment and consultationat the regional and local levels. In many developing countries reform had involved merely put-ting the same educational content into new structural boxes. It was necessary to take stock ofthe needs, and of the results of research and experiment, in order to guide change effectively.The review of the fitness of education required that the board of education should bereceptive to suggestions from those connected with science and technology, employers, parentsand students.It should also be in close contact with university research. It should encouragediscussion, study and experiments by heads of institutions, teachers and inspectors. The educa-tional budget should include adequate provision for research. There was no contradiction betweenquantitative and qualitative planning (i. e. the planning of change) since they were inextricablylinked;but the latter tended to be neglected. The planning of change required research, consulta-tion and careful preparation if its results were to be accepted and implemented.Participants felt that the acceptance of the 'change' dimension in planning and administeringeducation was a corollary to, and not a replacement of, an intense effort to improve the inter-nal efficiency of educational operation. In most developing countries quality had been sacrificedto quantity and administrators were most anxious to improve the qualifications of teachers and theconditions under which education was provided. This involved the establishment of minimum stan-dards for efficiencies.Cost-effectiveness studies were still at their inception and there werecertain conceptual and technical difficulties involved. These studies should be pursued, standardizedand widely employed, Large benefits could be expected also to follow from improved 'profiting 18 Report of the seminar of the education of specialists in relation to employment; that is, ensuring that education fittedthe needs of employers more closely. This would involve new measures during study, improvedguidance, and attention to part-time education after study. The balance between full-time educa-tion, work experience and out-of-school study was felt to be an important area in which largegains in the efficiency of education should be sought also. The efficiency of educational admini-stration was a prerequisite to improving the efficiency of education, and new management tech-niques, which had proved their worth in industry and other public services, could have fruitfulapplications to education. New administrative and budgetary techniquesThe difficulty of educational planning resides in its relatively long-term nature and the fact thatit depends, both in plan formulation and plan execution, on programme and project implementa-tion.Drawing up a plan involves reviewing existing programmes and preparing a costed 'package'of revised and new programmes to be executed over a period, which is often five years. It is noteasy to obtain information to do this. It is even less easy to obtain decisions from policy-makersconcerning the dropping or curtailing of programmes which, judged by results (a difficult opera-tion in education), require such action. Moreover, once a plan has been accepted at the politicallevel there remains the problem of ensuring that annual budgets will 'respect' the plan, and thatother ministries and subordinate bodies in the regions will play their part in executing it. Thecomplexity of planning, administration and budget procedures, and the fact that they must mesheffectively together, lie behind the growing interest which those responsible for educationaladministration are showing in new administrative and budgetary techniques.It was suggested by participants that new administrative techniques involve the moder-nizing of the system of educational administration. They embody the essentials of educationalplanning in that they bring together the use of information in order to prepare choices and themeans of measurement and control, whereby the component programmes and projects involvedin educational development may be carried out. They facilitate informed choices, but do not andcannot replace policy judgments regarding educational objectives themselves (should the emphasisof educational objectives be on educating the gifted or the less gifted?) or regarding the differentchoices which must be made in programming and project-making. The quality of the men whomake decisions was therefore decisive, and new 'gimmicks' could not replace the need forempirical and pragmatic study of what has succeeded in improving decision-making by admini-strators and efficient implementation of their decisions.The new techniques, as Mr. Ta Ngoc Chau observed, represent the results of applyingthe spirit of planning to the military and business sectors. Their application to the public sectorhas become relevant in most countries for three reasons. First is the continuous and rapid ex-pansion of government activities and the importance of the programmes being undertaken; this 19 Administrative aspects of educational planning has led naturally to greater awareness of the need to make choices concerning resource alloca-tion as wisely as possible.Secondly, these methods of programme planning and control repre-sent the contribution of mathematicians, statisticians and economists to problems of decisionand evaluation of decisions which were previously the exclusive domain of the traditional admini-strator.This means that the administrator now can have at his disposal a new type of scientificanalysis of concrete problems by which, when he makes his decisions, he can see operationallywhat his objectives should be, the alternative ways of achieving them and the resource implica-tions of doing so.Third is the fact that the development of computers, which process and pro-vide information rapidly, has increased the speed with which programme choices may be guidedby sufficient and relevant information and progress of implementation of programmes may becontrolled.The role of the budget, and improving that role, was clearly central to educationalplanning and administration. The budget was a reflection of whether the plan was meaningfuland articulated in terms of positive programmes and projects to which resources could be com-mitted, or whether it represented a global financial target which was hard to achieve in terms ofprecise annual allocations. 1/ Clearly there was advantage if, as in the case of France, the bud-get branch of the finance ministry was closely associated from the outset in the preparation ofthe educational plan.Thus, while the budget should be 'the faithful servant of the plan', this wasonly possible if there was firm government commitment in terms of over-all spending prioritiesto its objectives, and if the articulation of those objectives was sufficiently precise, in terms ofthe scheduling of the investment and recurrent costs of the component programmes and projects,for their execution to be feasible.The participants deliberated on the advantages offered by PPBS (Planning, Programming,Budgeting Systems).Basically this means the presentation of the budget in terms of programmeswith defined objectives extending over a number of years and with the relevant segment of theirtotal cost.The drawing-up of these programmes as part of PPBS is normally accompanied by theuse of cost-effectiveness analysis in order that informed choices may be made as between alterna-tive courses of action.These procedures thus imply a review of total programmes which goesbeyond the annual budget period and a close connection between objectives and budgetary imple-mentation.Political choices nevertheless still have to be made and are hard to make.These techniques were attractive in that they incorporated into the system of budgetaryallocation, the strategic objectives to be achieved, the programming of inputs required for theirachievement based on selection criteria of return, and the annual budgetary allocations involved.But while it was agreed that PPBS represented a greater degree of rationalization'of decisionsand their implementation, it was suggested that its application to education posed many problems.1/See J. Hallak, 'The role of budgets in educational planning'. 20 Report of the seminar Nine-tenths of the education budget was committed as a result of past decisions, and the appli-cation of PPI3S would require the restructuring of the total educational effort in budget terms.There were numerous centres of decision, central, regional, local and institutional, whichwould have to be incorporated. A high degree of co-operation would be required as betweenadministrators, planning and budget personnel. Applications of PPBS on a wide scale had beenundertaken in the United States, where objectives had been of first national priority, financewas not usually a major problem (except in education) and highly qualified personnel were avail-able, but this federal effort when applied to education had covered only about 3 per cent of totaleducational expenditures in that country.PPBS was thought useful since it stimulated the thought of decision-makers throughanalysis of problems involved in selecting as between alternative courses of action. Manygovernments were examining the question of introducing it since, with its multi-year horizon,it might enable them to test the administrative and financial repercussions of action over time.It was also pointed out that the basic procedures, in simpler form, were involved in nationaleducational plans and budget negotiations in developing countries. PPBS represented the spiritof planning;the question was whether the many substantive decisions involved in it, includingthose relating to the definition of the aims of educational programmes, could be made.This question underlay the discussion of other new administrative techniques withimportant operational implications. 1/ In principle, the timing, sequence of operations, andresponsibilities for carrying out a programme or a project were matters of the greatestinterest in education.It was frequently the case that, in making provision for the implementa-tion of key programmes, for example for the expansion of primary education, some problemsresulting from the interaction of the programme on the system (teacher supply, buildings,books) tended to be inadequately resolved or provision for resolving them insufficiently deter-mined in advance.Consequently techniques such as PERT (Programme Evaluation and ReviewTechnique), involving the establishment of a critical path of determined and related actions toachieve a defined objective in the most economic way, could be rewarding. This is also, in amore general way, the concern of operations research, the aim of which is the systematicsearch for the 'optimum' solution. Simulation and model-building techniques, through theexploration of all the consequences of various courses of action, may also prove useful in thedecision-making process.These techniques were expensive, difficult to introduce and required major changes inthe control system.They were not a substitute for policy choice. They were an adjunct toplanning and implementation. They merited growing attention. The successful application of 1/See Ta Ngoc Chau, 'New management techniques and educationalplanning'.21 Administrative aspects of educational planning the new techniques would involve a revolution in administrative attitudes, procedures and struc-tures, and methods of communication. Since a revolution is not normally feasible, attitudesand people being given, a humble and pragmatic approach was desirable. It was necessary tobuild up from what existed.In some countries it would amount to a revolution even if letterswere promptly attended to and competently filed, and if adequate communicationu could beestablished between the centre, regions and localities. The use of new techniques requiredprior improvements in attitudes and arrangements for planning. This was the responsibility ofthe administrative leadership.In this connection the participants noted the role of job identification and organizationand methods techniques (0 and M) in educational administration. 1/ These were to be recom-mended as an aid in improving the efficiency of educational administration. Their main benefitwas in the form of work simplification and in the resultant increase in efficiency. Their opera-tion might involve some initial conflict as between the centres and individual institutions andlocalities, but there was a balance of advantage in the centralized control of a number of opera-tions and in centralized study of work simplification. Of course, this should be conducted withthe co-operation of institutions and localities. Training and researchThe crucial question involved in discussion of the new management techniques was to find outwhat really went on when planning was incorporated into administration. In some countries theresult had been temporary defeat, while in others planning had worked. What caused defeat inthe first situation and success in the second? This was a matter of politics, people and techni-cal efficiency.How could those who have to plan, decide about and administer education bebetter trained so that they could reshape and use the structures needed for planning which works?How can research provide the knowledge of what is needed to improve the administration ofeducation and how can these findings be tried out developmentally?The Seminar established two working groups, on 'teaching the administrative aspectsof educational planning' and 'research needs of the administrative aspects of educational planning'respectively.Their reports are in Appendixes A and Y3 to this document.The Seminar reviewed the training of educational administrators in Unesco RegionalCentres and certain university institutions. 2/ It agreed that reinforcement of the dutiesof the personnel divisions in the educational system was essential in order that the right 1/See R. W. Silversides, 'Job identification and 0 and M techniquesin educational administration'.2/See the papers by M. A. Abdel Dayem (Beirut) and John Hartley(Reading University).22 Report of the seminar people should be made available to perform defined tasks. Administrators should be selected,their work should be evaluated and they should receive in-service training in a way moreclosely and directly related to their tasks than hitherto. There should be greater continuity ofservice in a planning capacity, and training should be part of career development. A structureof training for all the different types of personnel who must undertake planning or know aboutplanning should be set up in each country, although the precise nature of the structure wouldvary according to the size of the country and the nature of the control of education.Directors of personnel and high-level officials of the ministries of education shouldmeet and discuss these questions in order that selection and training of the 'new-minded' peopleshould be established on an adequate basis.Governments should specifically devote a proportion of their educational budgets toresearch and development.While it was, in general, desirable that more attention should bedevoted to pedagogical research in order to find out how people learn, it was particularlyrelevant to know how educational administrators and planning personnel learn to do their jobs.Study should be undertaken of the detailed 'know-how' of planning and administration, so thatthe practitioners could be provided with usable guides with which to perform their tasks better.The Seminar heard a number of participants speak on the relationship between policydecisions and research results. Frequently, it was stated, policy-makers could not wait forthe results of study.Policy-makers should influence the broad lines which research affectingeducation and its administration should follow. The ministry should guide and encourageresearch by universities and other bodies, and within the educational system, so that it madea useful contribution to policy. Policy decision without preliminary study and consultation wasthe negation of planning. ConclusionInescapably, therefore, we were driven to the conclusion that, in order to improve the efficiencyof educational administration in the coming decade, planning must be more closely and usefullyemployed in administration.This implied that the arrangements for the formulation of proposals for decision-makerson education should be considerably improved in many countries so as to ensure rational andoptimizing judgment on the development of education. While quantitative planning requires re-inforcement, a major new effort is imperative to improve the efficiency and the fitness of educa-tional services; these twin objectives of planning cannot be seen in isolation, since each involvesthe other.To achieve this, political leadership must ensure that improvement in existingarrangements, and new methods of work and co-operation, are created, adequate for the task ofbringing full-time and out-of-school education into line with the needs of the economy and ofsociety. 23'20 Administrative aspects of educational planning Planning is useful in so far as the plan !proposals, based on adequate information, arefeasible and are subsequently translated into reality through administrative action. To achieveuseful planning means that, at the central, regional, local and institutional levels, team-workand wide consultation takes place whereby plan proposals, and the work of planning personnel,can embody this basis of reality and feasibility. The precise methods of communication,decision and control will vary according to the nature of the educational system and the type ofeconomic and social planning undertaken.In this connection, the use of new budgetary and administrative techniques representsthe spirit of planning;their progressive adaptation to national circumstances and introductionprovides the technical means for modernizing administration. But in developing countries anumber of more elementary but fundamental steps need to be taken before the new techniquescan be adapted.These concern improved flows of statistical data, better communications,operations research and more effective procedures for the control of personnel.The quality of the personnel who plan and administer education remains decisive.Close attention should be given to the selection, promotion and training of personnel, so thatthose capable of planning (and understanding and favouring it) accede to the key positions.Research and development represent the other vital element for improving the effectiveness ofplanning in educational development. Adequate financial provision, participation of the univer-sity, the ministry of education, and the educational system, are important for greater under-standing of how planning may help administration do a better job for all those who seek to study. 2421 Part IStudy of the theoretical aspects ofthe relationship between planning and administration THE ADMINISTRATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMICPLANNINC; AND ED LiCAT1 ()NAT. PLANNING by Claude Tibi IntroductionThe great economic crisis of 1929 and its aftermath, followed by the problems of economic recon-struction and reorientation which a great many countries had to face on the morrow of the SecondWorld War, have led to the general recognition of the need for consistent, steady and continuouseconomic growth.In the Socialist countries, moreover, the State has centralized all economic res-ponsibilities in its own hands, in order to achieve, in addition to rapid growth, the reforms of struc-ture and redistribution required by Marxist principles. Finally, the accession to political indepen-dence of a large number of formerly colonized countries has led them to seek ways and means ofeconomic development.Another fundamental factor in the development of the planning mentality, and one which isfound in most countries, is the extremely important part played by the State in the economy. TheState is in practice responsible for nearly all the infrastructures, and a great part of the investments,education and scientific research; its running expenses represent a by no means negligible proportionof the gross national product. The State has this become the main economic transactor and hastherefore been led to play a decisive part in the orientation of the economy and ultimately of society.It is in this context that the concept of planning has very rapidly loomed so large.Notwithstanding the diversity of initial conditions and of means, a great part of the aims arecommon to all countries. The real object is to achieve the highest growth (linked with variable socialand political imperatives), depending on the disposable resources (physical and human), and in thelight of constraints of all kinds (technica.t, economic, administrative, political and social). It istherefore essential to organize and co-ordinate, and all the more so, the more complex and the moredeveloped the economy (Masse's phrase could be cited, treating the plan as 'a means of reducing un-certainty', a 'generalized market substitute1).But the means adopted, and therefore the forms of planning, in the last analysis, differvery widely. 2723 Administrative aspects of educational planning At one extreme, there are certain countries (United States of America, Federal Republic ofGermany), which remain attached to freedom of enterprise and the limitation of State intervention ineconomic life. They nevertheless make over-all forecasts (economic projections) which do not havethe backing of the authorities and do not constitute plans. The fact remains that there is ultimately anincreasii.gly close co-ordination between the decisions of the State and of private business.At the other extreme, in the Socialist countries, planning is imperative and the State, asbeing responsible for economic development, controls the execution of the plan. Within this categorydistinctions can be drawn according to the extent to which the plan is centralized.Between these two methods it is possible to define (a) indicative planning, in which the Stateindicates what should be done to achieve the targets set, but exerts relatively little influence on eco-nomic transactors. It is hoped that in this way the plan will be carried out spontaneously (c f. Frenchplanning). The snag is the existence of enterprises with relatively autonomous powers of decision onwhom the plan is not legally binding. The value of a plan of this kind is none the less obvious; it hasan educative value (national development targets, 'concerted economy') and an operational value (a)gigantic market survey which orients business policy and determines State action ; and (b) incentiveplanning; the State does not itself arrange for the achievement of targets, but gives advantages, suchas tax benefits, to units which carry out the plan, and penalizes those which do not achieve the targets(cf. Yugoslav planning).In reality, all existing planning partakes of all these different types, French planning, forexample, is indicative only in those sectors in which the State lacks basic data (agriculture) or meansof action. In certain cases, it becomes incentive planning, through the use of tax benefits, while inthe administrative sphere it is, in principle, imperative.In any event, and in the developed countries, the plan, while allowing the achievement ofpriority targets, is increasingly aimed at ensuring the balanced growth of a more and more compli-cated whole.In the developing countries, moreover, the need has been rapidly recognized to master andpromote economic and social development. But in this case planning has a quite different significance.It mainly constitutes (or should constitute) a war on want and therefore a total mobilization of re-sources and energies. The real problems here are, structurally, the economic disarticulations andthe dominations which shatter the unity and weaken the drive of the country, as well as the sociologi-cal forces which, in many fields, are opposed to progress. It is therefore necessary to determine theactions and structural reforms to be undertaken to make the economy sounder and less dependent, andto devise precise and realistic projects along the desired lines.In most cases, in any event, there can be no question of arriving in this way at economicequilibrium, but only at the least damaging disequilibrium. This leads us to stress the fact that theformulation of a development plan must not be confused with planning proper, that is to say executionand the mastery of the economic and social future. The real problem in practice too often lies at the 282,1 Economic planning and educational plannirg level of action, and the preparation of a document, often very precise, cannot, in some instances,make up for the shortcomings of the political and administrative authorities in surmounting the con-straints wnich stand in the way of achieving the targets set.It is important to stress from the outset the differences in character, and even in kind, bet-ween planning in the developed countries and in the developing countries, since the functions assumedand the constraints encountered will unquestionably take somewhat different forms.We propose to analyse here the integration of the planning agency in the administrative set-up, and the functions it must assume, going on to consider the administrative links between economicplanning and educational planning. Part II is devoted to considering the problems and constraintswhich hamper the effective preparation and execution of the plan. 292 Administrative aspects of educational planning PART IChapter I.Central planning agencies , their functions, their relations withpolitical authorities and the administrative environmentIn analysing the administrative setting of planning, it is important to study the following points:- the agency responsible for the plan, its powers , its relations with the political authorities ,the administration as a whole and economic andsocial groups;- the administrative procedures for the preparation and approval of the plan;- the agency responsible for execution and the procedures for evaluatingresults.There is a very wide choice of alternatives in organizing the framework of these functions;the success or failure of the plan largely depends on the choice made. Furthermore, the planningfunction forms part of the whole duties of organization and management normally discharged by theadministration. It is therefore important to study the interactions which may result from it invarious respects:- the compatibility of the projects of the various Ministries with the targetsof the plan;- the allocation of resources between the present and the future (consumption-investment);- the distribution of responsibilities between the central and the regionallevel, and the participation of the regions in the formulation and executionof the plan;- relations between plan and administration at the stage of supervision ofexecution.In so far as the plan involves the participation of all economic transactors , it is also impor-tant to study the relations between the planning agency and economic and social groups.In theory, the political authorities should determine the major options , while the administra-tion should prepare the decisions and present the government with a range of choice. The governmentis in principle responsible for the execution (partial) and supervision of the plan.In practice these frontiers are very often challenged. In some cases the administration mayensure the execution of a plan in spite of political changes; in other cases , on the contrary, it willresist the execution of the plan; it may find itself disarmed in the face of private interests hostile tothe plan, or it may even be dominated by such interests.We thus find a whole range of interrelations , the analysisof which, for each country, ishighly significant, and determines the precise powers of the planning agency and the real effect ofthe plan.Finally, planning may be regarded as a decision-making process; the role of the adminis-tration is to prepare and partially execute the plan in the political, economic and social context. 30 Economic planning and educational planning The preparation of decisions requires the establishment of communications for the exchangeof written and oral information between administrative departments and with the political authorities.If it is to be profitable, this exchange must be two-way and complete so that all the agencies involvedin the planning process take an effective part. At this stage, human and personal factors play acapital role.The approval of the plan constitutes a legal act of a Special and novel character. In thefirst place it is a final decision which is merely the culmination of a series of choices and judge-ments at all levels. Secondly, the plan is merely the starting-point for a whole series of subsequentdecisions; but while it is imperative for all the actions to be taken by the administration, it is ingeneral merely indicative or incentive for the private sector. This is what distinguishes it from anordinary law.But the main problem lies in the transition from decision to action, complicated by the factthat it is a long-term process which therefore demands a certain continuity, but also flexibility in sofar as adjustments may prove necessary.Execution is not a matter for the administration alone; it calls for the participation of thewhole population, and there is therefore a capital role of leadership and mobilization which must beplayed by the administration.This relatively new task may be assigned to specialized services (agric..ultural advisory ser-vices, rural leadership, etc.) or to local institutions of a political or occupational character. If it isto succeed, however, it demands the total support of those responsible; on its success, moreover,largely depends the success of the plan.Finally, it should be pointed out that, at ale stage of preparation and execution, the adminis-tration must act as an intermediary between the political authorities and the economic and socialenvironment. It must be capable of organizing dialogue, of ensuring the balance between ends andmeans, between the desirable and the possible.This calls in particular for human resources (in qualified officials, for example) and thusmeans, in the first place, the integration of economic and social aims in the plan, and secondly,the adaptation of the aims to the administrative capacity for preparation and execution.We now turn to the analysis of the central planning agency, the body to which it is respon-sible, its functions and the administi ative procedures connected with preparation and execution. The central planning agencyThe appearance in the administration of this new function constituted by planning calls for the crea-tion of a new agency, which often provokes a hostile reaction on the part of the administration. Inspite of this,it is essential to ensure close co-operation and it is therefore important to study theplacing of the planning agency. 31 Administrative aspects of educational planning There are three possibilities:- an inter-ministerial agency;an agency attached to the Ministry for Economic Affairs andFinance;- a planning ministry with no predominance over other ministries.The advantages and disadvantages of these three possibilities are discussed below, but itshould be clear that none of them is inherently preferable to the others. The choice must depend onpolitical, economic, technical and social factOrs, but most particularly on the nature of the plan(limited or over-all, indicative or imperative) and on the qualified personnel available.In general, the placing of the planning agency should:- ensure it sufficient authority;allow it fairly wide autonomy;integrate it in the administrative set-up so that it can influenceit and at the same time benefit from its co-operation.1.The creation of an inter-ministerial agency is very common; this character is derived fromits attachment either direct to the head of the executive (Portugal, Presidency of the Council) or,indirectly, through a minister-delegate of the Prime Minister (France) or a minister with certainpredominance over the others (USSR, the President of Gosplan is Vice-Prime Minister, Poland, etc).This type of attachment should ensure the driving force and arbitration which the plan re-quires in relation to other ministers. It nevertheless assumes that the head of the executive is per-sonally interested in planning and desires its execution. The same applies to the minister for theplan, and these factors are at least equally important with legislative factors.2.Attachment to the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance is also fairly frequent; itenables responsibility for the whole of short, medium- and long-term economic policy to be con-centrated in his hands. In principle this should allow a better link between conception and execution,but very often the short-term problems (because of their urgency) overshadow the long-term impera-tives and there is then a danger of sacrificing the main objectives of the plan. Furthermore, theremay be difficulties of integration resulting from divergences of outlook and attitude; the FinanceMinistry is mainly interested in the budget, while the plan is concerned with the whole of theeconomy and with the private sector. Treasury officials are readier to restrain expenditure than totake measures to encourage development.In any event, it is essential for the Finance Ministry to take part in all the bodies whichprepare the plan, and for the closest links to be established.3.The creation of an autonomous ministry responsible for the plan with the same powers andauthority at3 other ministries, is an unrealistic solution. The possibilities of control and super-vision are then almost non-existent; furthermore, an organization of this kind often means short-circuiting the plan, ministers going direct to the Ministry of Finance for funds, thus ruling outall possibility of co-ordination. 3228 Economic planning and educational planning The relations of the planning agency with the political, administrative,economic and social environment. The planning agency and thepolitical authoritiesIn theory, the political authorities must determine the major options (first, because it is their role,and secondly, because the plan must reflect the aspirations of the nation), while the planning agencyis responsible for the technical part of the work and the administration responsible for execution,directly or indirectly. In practice there may be hostility or inertia on one side or the other.The implications of the plan and of a development policy take various forms:- from the political angle, the plan means setting prioritiesamong economic and social aims;- administratively, these choices must be translated into thetechniques applied;this also means that administrative activity must be oriented inthe light of the long-term aims;finally, at economic and social level, transactors must adapt theirdecisions in the light of the general orientation, and the publicmust understand the significance of the plan and participate in it.Relations with the executive may be organized in different ways:the creation of a council to supervise the work of the plan,including government representatives, but in this case caremust be taken to distinguish political and economic criteria,and clearly to separate responsibilities;the creation of an inter-ministerial committee to supervise andco-ordinate at top level.It must be noted that, in any event, the role of technicians in preparing the plan is very great and itis impossible to be certain that their views, criteria and methods will always fit in with the desiresof the political authorities.That is why it is necessary to provide for permanent government control over the successivestages of the technical preparation of the plan, as well as for Parliamentary control. It is importantthat the technicians of the plan should not have the power of decision, but should merely makesuggestions.Finally, with regard to the chances of realizing the plan (and this applies principally to thedeveloping countries), it must be settled who gives approval and the corresponding procedures mustbe analysed, since the situations may differ widely according to countries and political systems.According as to whether the plan requires the approval of Parliament, or merely of theCouncil of Ministers (which sometimes comes down to that of the Head of State), the authoritiesmay feel themselves more or less committed to its implementation. The form of approval (statuteor simple directive) also has a certain importance. 33 Administrative aspects of educational planning The planning agency and the administration(general aspects of relationships)We shall briefly consider here a single aspect of this question; how can the planning agency be inte-grated in the administration as a whole and organize its links with the central and regional levels?The participation of the traditional administration in the new functions entailed by planningmeans:- a permanent link, which allows the exchange of information,associates the administration with the preparation of the plan,and keeps it informed of its execution;- that this link must be sufficiently close, but flexible, so thatcommissions are not multiplied to the point of preventing allpossibility of work.Most frequently, the planning agency creates specialized commissions (the members ofwhich, moreover, are not necessarily drawn from its own personnel), in which the responsibleofficials of the different ministries take part.Relations with the regional level may be organized through local correspondents for theplan, enabling the regions to participate in defining their specific targets. The functions of the planThese will be discussed at the stages of (1) preparation, (2) execution and control.1. PreparationWhatever the form of planning, there are certain tasks which must be performed; the collection ofthe necessary information, definition of possible lines of development, setting detailed targets, andapproving the plan. a. Compiling statisticsNo sound economic analysis can be made without a minimum of statistical information. But it isimportant to determine the quantity and quality of statistics needed and to arrange their presentationin the light of the needs of the plan. The question may then arise of relations between the planningagency and the statistics services.The volume of data needed, their scope and diversity, depend on the form and type of plan-ning (indicative or imperative, global or sectoral, national or regional). Their compilation shouldmake it possible to draw up economic accounts, to estimate sectoral and regional characteristics,and to evaluate the econometric relations which appear in aggregate economic models.In many developing countries such data are non-existent or insufficient. This does not meanthat planning must be held up until the necessary information is compiled; most frequently, much ofthe action to be taken is evident and, in the first stage, one can be satisfied with a partial planlimited to sectoral programmes.3430 Economic planning and educational planning Data may be compiled from other authorities (statistics then constitute a by-product ofadministrative activity, such as taxation, finance, foreign trade etc. ), but in this event the planningagency must have adequate powers to call for certain information.They can also be obtained by direct compilation (surveys, censuses, etc.) through thestatistics service; this means that the needs must be defined and ranked in order of priority underthe control of the planning agency (which sometimes creates conflicts of competence) and thatadequate resources (personnel, credits) must be available.Finally, the available data are often partial, irrelevant or presented in such a way thatcomparisons are impossible (problems of nomenclature, for example) and considerable work mustthen be done'to standardize and co-ordinate them. b. Exploring possible lines of developmentThe priorities set by the political authorities are often somewhat varied and relate to the develop-ment of production (certain sectors may be given preferential treatment, according to the linechosen), foreign trade, the importance to be attached to the private sector, reducing inequalities ofincome, redistribution, the replacement of foreign cadres by nationals and so forth.The planning agency must then bring to light the implications of these options. In thedeveloped countries the most common technique is to sketch a broad picture of the economy at agiven term, arguing from a few sectors, and thus strike a first balance, then introducing certainvariants (growth rate, improved productivity, hours of work, manpower) so as to give the politicalauthorities a range of choice. A more detailed outline is then made on the basis of the results ofthe first approach. The general balance is established by successive approximations, modifying thetargets each time that inconsistencies appear. This is done first on the physical plane and then onthe financial plane. The different variants are then submitted to the government, which makes thechoice and gives directives which enable the commissions to work out detailed targets by sector.For the developed countries, therefore, the starting point is a general equilibrium basedon the fundamental interdependences which characterize advanced economies. Such procedures areneither realistic nor feasible in developing countries.In this case, in practice,it is important to start from a balance sheet covering the economicand social structures, the resources (human, financial, administrative), the fundamental needs to bemet and the constraints, sociological or others. The long-term (15-20 years) prospects are thendetermined in the light of the major options and defining the structural reforms to be introduced,after which the action is broken down into periods of 3 to 7 years, each of which will be covered bya plan. 35 31 Administrative aspects of educational planning c. Setting detailed targetsDetailed targets must be prepared in two phases:a phase of discussion which should allow all parties concerned(administrations, representatives of economic and social groups,technicians, etc.) to participate in the common task by expressingtheir preferences and their views;a phase of arbitration and decision which will ensure that thetargets thus set in the different sectors are compatible with eachother and with the resources available.In general, specialized vertical commissions are established for the major sectors ofactivity. Horizontal commissions are sometimes added to study the fundamental equilibria (employ-ment, finance, etc. ) and the consistency of sectoral targets and their compatibility with the availableresources (by the establishment of physical and financial equilibria; the supply and use of goods andservices, exports-imports, saving, investment, etc. ). In the developing countries it is wiser torestrain the multiplication of these commissions, owing to the lack of qualified personnel and toavoid the dispersal of effort.d. Approving the planThe plan is generally submitted by the government for the approval of Parliament. Where there isno Parliament, it is the government or the head of the executive himself who approves it officially.The scope of the plan is generally very wide and it cannot give details of all the specificactions to be undertaken; it cannot therefore be compared to an ordinary law. In fact the governmentcommits itself to conforming its action to the targets of the plan but the operative force of the planis rarely clearly defined.It may be added that, in many developing countries, uncertainty about foreign aid andforeign trade makes the approval of the plan purely formal.Finally, the private sector is not generally bound by this decision.The commitment therefore mainly affects the government, which must allocate public in-vestments and orient economic, financial and social policy in conformity with the plan. 2. Execution and supervisionThe conditions of execution depend on political, administrative and technical factors.Sometimes the plan is launched purely in order to benefit from foreign aid. The prioritiesset by the plan may, moreover, be called into question by shifts in policy. Short-term problems(budget, external finance) may momentarily take precedence over the long-term imperatives.Finally, economic or social pressure groups may resist the execution of the plan.The administration, for its part, intervenes mainly at two levels: 363') Economic planning and educational planning financing the projects included in the plan;taking administrative action to allow their execution.Questions of finance arise in the following ways:Which is the ministry responsible for financing the plan andwhat are its relations with the planning agency?- What are its relations with the rest of the administration?- What are the administrative procedures for the inclusion inan annual budget of programmes extending over several years?Capital equipment budgets are usually prepared alongside the current working budget; in some casesthey include the assignment of certain resources (foreign aid, import taxes, revenue of certainmonopolies) to finance capital investments. A capital equipment budget is also more suitable forcarrying out programmes extending over several years.The importance which the government attaches to the plan can be measured, up to a certainpoint, by comparing the sources of finance recorded and the corresponding revenue with the massof State-financed capital investments.Furthermore, all capital expenditure has an influence on current expenditure and it is im-portant to analyse methods of establishing the current working budget in its relations with thecapital equipment plan.The implementation of the plan also calls for the adaptation of administrative procedures.Thus it is important to define the ministries responsible for executing each programme and to set upeffective co-ordination between them and the planning agency. This can be done either by making useof existing structures or by creating new structures, but the main problem is to establish the closestpossible links between the plan and the ministries responsible for execution.With regard to execution proper, it is important to arrange for the allocation of responsibi-lities between the plan and the executive ministries, and the co-ordination of the action of ministriesinvolved in the same programme. This should be done both at central and at regional level.Many activities or programmes included in the plan call for action by different ministries.This therefore implies inter-ministerial co-ordination and the possibility of intervention by theplanning agency to ensure the unity of the plan.Action at regional level can be grouped in two categories:- investments in the modern sector of the economy, raisingproblems mainly of a technical character;programmes for the conversion of the traditional sector,which are much more complicated to apply.The execution of the plan therefore calls for the satisfaction of a number of conditions:the directives from the centre must be communicated to the regionallevel and means of execution must be available; 373,3 Administrative aspects of educational planning the executive agencies should be in a position to implement theprogrammes, adapting them if necessary to local conditions;the action of the technicians and local administrative staff shouldbe co-ordinated with that of the local authorities. The plan and social and economic researchThe progressive and regular pursuit in depth of planning work calls for the continuous developmentof research into the techniques used, econometric models and the estimation of their parameters,the behaviour of economic transactors, resistance to change, etc.The central planning agency must then take steps to ensure that this research function iscarried out; in some cases it will take part in the creation of specialized bodies (the GosplanResearch Institute in USSR, CORDES in France, etc.); in other cases research may be contractedout to public or private institutions.The preparation and execution of the plan therefore necessitate a profound modification ofadministrative procedures and their internal links. But that is not enough, since it is also essentialto have qualified personnel available at all levels; this observation leads us on to the second part,dealing with educational planning and its administrative relationship with economic planning. Chapter II.Educational planning and its administrative relationshipswith economic planningThe aims of educational planning have both economic aspects (training needs and costs, cost-benefitanalysis, opportunity cost) and social aspects (literacy, school enrolment, etc.). One of the majorproblems nevertheless continuesto be whether the available resources should be used as effectivelyas possible or applied to reducing the most blatant inequalities.The term adopted for educational planning is generally much longer (15 to 20 years) thanfor economic planning. The efforts to be made are so great and the cost so high that they must bespread over a sufficiently long period. Furthermore, the training of senior cadres generally takes15 to 20 years and it is much more lengthy and more difficult to change men than to change things.Training can therefore be adapted to the needs of the economy only over a long period.This leads us to the integration of educational planning in economic planning, arising out ofthe fact that the economic and social aspects of development cannot be separated. Resources, humanand financial, must be drawn from the national stock and assigned to education, that is to say, tohuman investment. In so far as education programmes are established in the long term it is importantthat their execution should be broken down into periods, each of which corresponds to the period ofan economic plan, and that the necessary cost should be expressed in the same way as the cost ofeconomic projects. 3834 Economic planning and educational planning This most frequently calls for arbitration procedures, which should be undertaken first atadministrative level and then at political level so that there is a genuine integration of plans and co-ordination of aims. In any event, medium-term education programmes cannot be formulated with-out some indication, if only global, of the appropriations assigned to that sector.Most frequently the assignment of resources to education is not based on theoretical criteriabut on international comparisons. The basis thus is the implied assumption that development musttake place on the same model in all countries and that the advanced countries afford a sound model.We have considered above the financial aspect of the integration of economic planning inoverall planning. But there is a second aspect relating to the training of qualified personnel whichoften constitutes a limiting factor on development. Once the needs are forecast (allowing for all theeconomic programmes included in the plan), they can be compared with the possibilities of the sys-tem and efforts can then be made to adapt the system accordingly. Educational planning thus emergesas one of the essential constituents of overall planning.These two types of integration should ensure the compatibility of aims and thus improve thechances of achieving them. The administrative framework for educational planningThe distribution of responsibilities between the central planning agency and the Ministry of Educationis an important question. The type of organization chosen should allow:the setting of the targets for the education plan in line withthe economic targets;the effective participation of the responsible chiefs of allinterested services of the Ministry of Education in the preparationof the education plan;the allocation of resources between the education sector and othersectors on the basis of priorities defined by the politicalauthorities.The soundest way of achieving these aims seems to be to entrust the education plan to a specificcommission created for the purpose within the central planning agency, in which the variousspecialists of the Ministry of Education would participate. This is indeed the only way of ensuringthe genuine integration of educational planning in economic and social planning and the allocation ofresources on clear political and economic criteria.The role of the Ministry of Education at the level of the plan should be to provide all thedata and information for the establishment of the plan, to define all the qualitative aspects of educa-tion (especially teaching) and to draw the inferences (e. g. in the matter of standards) and finally toensure the execution of the plan through its regional offices. Administrative aspects of educational planning In some countries the Ministry of Education itself is responsible for establishing the educa-tion plan. This solution is not likely to be very satisfactory, since integration in the overall plan willnot generally be achieved under good conditions. There are a whole series of factors which will haveto be taken into account:- the concordance of targets;the possibility of allotting resources to the education sector(equipment and running);the standardization of the presentation of forecasts and projectswith that used in the plan;procedure for arbitration with other sectors at administrativeand political level. 4036 Economic planning and educational planning PART IIChapter I.The administrative problems and constraintsAdministrative structures and the attitude of officials towards the plan operate in practice as con-straints and generally lessen the effectiveness both of the preparation and of the execution of theplan. It is therefore important to analyse these two points and study the special factors which makethe situation even worse in the developing countries.The inflexibilities of the administration and its compartmentation are major obstacleswhich must be overcome if the plan is to be prepared and subsequently executed under sound condi-tions. A number of studies have been devoted to the working of the various administrative systems.It is enough to cite as an example some of the conclusions of an article by Monsieur Crozier on theFrench administration emerge relate, of course, to a particular countryand are open to debate, but a certain number of lessons can be drawn from them. The author thusassets that the French system can be characterized by the following features: (i) very markedcentralization (which tends to erect a screen between those who make the decisions and those whoare effected by them). The consequence at the centre is faulty information and lack of contact leadingto insufficiently well informed decisions; (ii) stratification along functional, and above all hierarchicallines and poor communications between different categories, resulting in a rigid and hidebound sys-tem. These two factors, which result in the administration's poor capacity to communicate or partici-pate, lead to an inefficient use of human and material resources and slow and painful adjustment tochange.Capacity to communicate is essential to the smooth working of any system of modern organi-zation. It is essential in practice for the responsible chiefs to be rapidly and precisely informed of allthe data which govern their decisions and to transmit to their subordinates the objectives, means andconditions for implementing these decisions. Stratification and centralization are, in general, inimicalto the proper diffusion of relevant information.Capacity to participate is also under-developed. Every modern organization depends more anand more on the good will of its members, their adaptability and innovating capacity and spirit of co-operation. The more complex an organization, the less it can operate merely by rote and the moreit must rely on the co-operation of its personnel. But the administrative style does not facilitateparticipation, in so far as it is founded on rigid hierarchical principles, one of the consenuences ofwhich is to weaken the link between a career and the successful discharge of functions or duties.A study of the future evolution of the administration and its adaptation to new tasks showsthat a number of problems must be settled.1.The hierarchical relations between the centre and the outstations. The separation betweenthe organ of conception and the organ of execution resulting from centralisation and stratification,militates against efforts at renewal. These centres are generally incapable of modifying the relations 41 Administrative aspects of educational planning which have been established between the outlying services and the environment. The change of ob-jectives and the introduction of rational economic calculation therefore demand a remodelling of thesystem of internal relations.2.The problem of difficulties of communication between administrative fiefs which are op-posed to any attempt to modify the internal system. The compartmentation of administrative pyramids(resulting in particular from fear of possible competition) impedes the development of a great manynew functions which cannot be integrated in the traditional pyramids. In practice, progress oftenmanifests itself at the frontiers of different disciplines and ways of thought and thus clashes withthe compartmentation and imperviousness of the language and mental processes of the different ad-ministrative groupings. The Plan should play a very important role in this respect by introducing acommon language and a synoptic approach. But in spite of a certain accession of officials to thesenew methods on the intellectual plane, the possible progress is in danger of being limited by thetraditional tensions and compartmentation which are the expression of conflicts of competence andthe determination of each fief to protect its own future. The administration in the face of the planIt is interesting to analyse the attitude of the administration towards the working methods of the planand the gro.ing place it tends to take. In this connecion, while recognising its limited and specificcharacter, we may cite a survey made by sociologists in a Directorate of a French Ministry (cf.'Conflits internes et units d'action' Sociologie du travail No. 3-66). One of the sets of questionsput to officials related to their reactions to the Commission for the Plan.It should be made clear at the outset that the chiefs of the Directorate had made seriousefforts to introduce a new spirit and to favour relations with the Plan.General reactionOf the officials questions:53 per cent regarded the Plan as little more than an accounting docu-ment, 20 per cent reserved judgment, and 27 per cent assigned it a role of prospection and prepara-tion for the future.It should, however, be made clear that, for many of these officials, their dutiesdid not require them to work on the preparation of the Plan and it may be thought that this is a problemof information rather than a genuine attitude. The survey should really be extended to all the officialsworking on the Plan. Method of participating in the Planr-gi CommissionsA number of officials of the Directorate take part in the Commissions of the Plan. But the assign-ment of duties within the Directorate does not coincide with the assignment of studies under the Plan.Officials thus fail to find the distribution of functions to which they are accustomed and are temptedto participate only so far as they can derive something from it. It is, however, doubtful whethertheir attitude is based solely on questions of the organization chart. 4238 Economic planning and educational planning For the Commissions which cover sectors corresponding to the responsibilities of the ser-vices of the Directorate in question, the judgments are as follows:unreservedly in favour of the Planconsider the Plan dangerousscientifically inadequatevaluelessopenly unfavourableregret that the Plan does not concern theiractivitiesno opinionParticipation in the work of the Plan in this field is judged as follows:the Plan wastes our timewe have always participated loyallythe Plan is our doingwe do not participate enoughwe are making progress towards betterparticipationno opinion29 per cent18 per cent7 per per per 2 cent16 cent15 per cent28 per cent27 per centA cross-check between the two sets of judgments shows that the unfavourable judgments are passedby those who claim that the Plan, in this sphere, is the work of their Directorate, which indicatesthe small extent to which their authors are involved.On the other hand, the judgment 'scientifically inadequate' is passed by those who desire toparticipate more fully, which indicates their high degree of involvement. It thus clearly appearsthat the Directorate is handicapped in developing fruitful contacts with the Plan by the absence ofagreement and scientific comprehension. Assessment of the contribution of the PlanThe answers to a question on the assessment of the functions of the Plan can be grouped in threesets:IThe Plan makes it possible to renovate the activities of theDirectorate and conceive a new policy.- It facilitates co-ordination within the administration.- It raises new problems.II- The Plan enables us to meet management and labour.- It improves information.- It is a weapon against the tyranny of finance.It teaches us. 433;i Administrative aspects of educational planning IIIThe Plan dispossesses us.- It creates disorder.Other adverse judgmentsA cross-check with the judgments passed above shows that the Group I answers come almost exclu-sively from officials who are deeply involved and keen on innovation. Group II answers come indis-criminately from officials who are very attached to co-operation and those who are not. Finally, inGroup III, the fear of dispossession is manifested by 20 per cent of officials most of whom aredeeply involved; it does not therefore represent basic hostility on their part, but precisely the re-cognition of the positive and innovating character of work on the Plan.In conclusion, and as a partial explanation of the insufficient contact between the Directorateand the Plan, the authors of the survey assert that '... The gulf is the absence of a common language.So long as the Directorate cannot formulate, if not its concerns, at least their economic consequences,in calculable terms, the solicitude of the planners will be no great help'.It must, however, be emphasized that the example studied is somewhat special and by nomeans representative of the attitude of the whole of the French administration. But it has the valueof bringing out some of the attitudes and reactions which can be encountered in every administrationand which represent an obstacle to the more effective implementation of planning. The aggravation of the difficulties in the developing countriesMost of the difficulties to which we have referred are to be found again in the administrations of thedeveloping countries, but with additional factors which make the situation worse.The obstacles most frequently encountered can be classified in four main categories:problems of organisation, of personnel, political problems, social and cultural problems. 1. Problems of organisationIn genera], co-ordination is bad, and at two levels:- Co-ordination in setting the targets for the different Ministerialdepartments during the preparation of the Plan.- Co-ordination in the execution phase between the Ministriesconcerned (Plan, finances, responsible ministry).In the first case, it is mainly a question of relationships and the effective distribution of powers bet-ween the Plan and the other ministries. If a planning department is found to be isolated from the restof the administration, the result will most frequently be a non-functional plan; the actions andmeasures to be taken to implement it will not be provided for, owing to the poor links with the minis-tries concerned and the limitation of their participation to the setting of targets and the preparationof projects. 4440 Economic planning and educational planning Whatever the place of the planning agency, the real problem is the mobilization of politicalpower in the nation. That is why, most of the time, the plan will merely have an advisory influence,but no real force.Anothermajor problem is the excessive centralisation to be found in the administrations inmost developing countries. It is reflected in:- the very great difficulty of the centre in delegating powers todifferent levels;difficulty in deconcentrating at regional and local level.Both in the preparation and the execution of the Plan very severe constraints are then encountered.This situation arises either from the technical inadequacy of the cadres (often recruitedimmediately after independence) at high levels in the hierarchy at the centre, or from their fear ofthe often better trained young people coming into the administration, or, finally, from the weaknessof the local levels. In practice, able young cadres are usually extremely reluctant to work at theregional level.The structures for approval and decision-making then become very clumsy bottlenecksappear at the centre, the chiefs waste their time on minor issues and responsibility very soon be-comes diluted. In the last analysis the system shows itself unable to make proper use of the quali-fications of officials.Finally, budget procedures most frequently operate as constraints. The attitude of theTreasury officials, whose duty is to control expenditure and adjust it to income, tends to slow downthe process of execution of the Plan, while the rules for approval do not allow a sound functionalcheck on the funds assigned to a project or the quality of the project itself. 2. Personnel problemsThe shortage of qualified personnel (and the faulty use of existing personnel), obviously constitutesthe major problem at every step in the pyramid, but above all for intermediate and junior executives.It is frequently found that training is not adjusted to the duties to be discharged. Thecurricula of schools and faculties are generally copied from those of developed countries, withoutregard to the essential adaptation and re-formulation. Cadres are not trained for the jobs they willhave to do.Another manifestation of the insufficiency of qualified personnel is the very rapid turnoverof senior officials. This leads at individual level to insufficient knowledge of the field of responsibilityand lack of accumulated experience, and in the aggregate, to a loss of productivity, which is some-times considerable (in addition to the 'running-in' period for the chief in his new sphere, there isalso the period of marking time and adjustment which always follows the arrival of a new chief). Administration aspects of educational planning With regard to the accumulation of experience, substantial losses are also found whenforeign technical assistances are called in without local officials being assigned to work with them(this is very frequente. g. the Plan in Morocco).In some cases, moreover, it has been thought that the standards of the personnel employedwere too low to enable them to collect taxes properly, with a consequent loss of revenue to the State.Finally, the lack of qualified cadres is reflected in statistical information (data fragmentary,unreliable or unsuited to the needs), thus raising serious problems both in the preparation and theexecution of the Plan. 3. Political problemsThe main difficulty here is the interference of politics with administration. Personnel are too oftenrecruited on political considerations rather than because of real abilities. The criteria for the in-clusion of projects in the plan are often far from being purely economic and social.Relations between Ministers are greatly affected by their origins and political backing. Asindividuals, few of them would be prepared to take responsibility for the great risks involved in agenuine development policy. Planning then becomes much more apparent than real.Political instability, and the consequent changes of minister, is another aspect of the sameproblem. It tends to enhance the attitude of 'wait and see' and to introduce frequent changes oforientation which are prejudicial to consistent development.In general, the administration itself tends to become politically committed and to turn intoa de facto power. Very often it constitutes in practice the only organised body capable of formulatingpolitical and social aims, and may therefore become conscious of its power when the executive isweak or divided. 4. Social and cultural problemsThe maladjustment of the administration to development tasks also results, to a very considerableextent, from its fundamental conservatism and preference for stability and continuity.In practice, the administrative structures are usually inherited from the colonising powerwhose interest was to maintain the status quo and whose main tasks were to preserve order andcollect the taxes.Another extremely important constraint is constituted by feudal structures and clans. Theindividual does not reason in the light of the general interest but in that of the interest of his clan,the group to which he is attached, and to which he often owes everything. Individual motivations arethus in danger of becoming inconsistent with national aims. 46 Economic planning and educational planning ConclusionTo sum up,it is quite apparent that the administrative requirements for planning are still far frombeing satisfied in most countries and that action is needed along these lines. Instead of refining theeconomic techniques used in planning, it would be much more effective at the present stage toimprove administrative liaison and co-ordination by keeping the personnel informed, making themparticipate at all levels and improving communications. This naturally requires, on the part of thispersonnel, an awareness of the problems which arise and a desire to participate, but there can onlybe awareness so far as the responsible leaders themselves spread a certain number of ideas andcreate conditions which allow each official to be one element in the whole. It should be added that, ina great many cases, the first bottleneck is the training of qualified administrative staff in sufficientnumbers.The problem of administrative deconcentration is also of the utmost importance; far toomany plans are still prepared by a central echelon with little contact with the local administrations.The result is documents which take insufficient account of the true local facts, and are therefore un-realistic; it is not astonishing that major difficulties then appear at the level of execution, but it isalso obvious that serious progress can be made only at the cost of a certain number of conditions:- reinforcement of local personnel- delegation of powers from the centre- improved liaisonIt must, moreover, be recognised that the same problems arise in educational*planning andin its integration in overall planning. In practice, the development of human resources is one of theconditions for economic development, but one of the major problems is to establish a sound link bet-ween the targets of educational planning and those of economic planning. This can be done, in parti-cular, by establishing the needs for qualified manpower and by estimating the way in which theseneeds can be met in the light of the available resources of the education sector. This work calls forthe contribution of services attached to different ministerial departments, and therefore their co-operation in achieving a given target defined by common consent. 474,3 FUNCTIONAL ANALYSTS OF EDUCATIONAL PLANNING -THE INTERNAL DIVISION OF FUNCTIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVEORGANIZATION WITHIN TEE MINISTRY OF EDUCATICN by A .W .P. Gurug0 1.Introduction1. 1Y. Dror's definition of 'planning' as:'the process of preparing -a set of decisions -for action in the future -directed at achieving goals -by optimal means 'embodies a functional analysis of the process of planning, plan formulation and implementation.Tt is important, at the very outset, to differentiate between economic planning and educationalplanning. Though they are linked in the ultimate objective of national development, each hasits own particular sets of targets and specific strategies. To the educational planner, theprocess of economic planning would appear less complicated, for despite its inherent problemsof both ideology and technology, its goal in the form of increased growth in national income ismore easily demonstrated through a system of national accounts and its major methods ofaccomplishment ,such as investments, savings, controls, taxation, subsidies , licensing havelong been accepted as standard administrative tools. Besides, much thought has been given tothis aspect of planning and a consensus of opinion has been reached in many areas. In compari-son, educational planning is still a new field and its objectives, approaches and strategies arestill being discussed inconclusively. But Dror 's definition is as valid in principle for educa-tional planning as it is for economic planning.1.9The purpose of this paper is:(a) to examine the manner in which educational administrators ofthe Ministry of Education approach the key functions of decidingon goals, means and actions in the process of preparing andputting into effect a plan for educational development;(b) to evaluate the effectiveness of the administrative organizationfor planning and plan implementation;(c) to assess the adequacy, relevance and efficacy of administrativemeasures and procedures resorted to by the Ministry; 4'1 Administrative aspects of educational planning (d) to suggest improvements in educational administration to meetthe demands of planned development.; and(e) to explore ways and means of extending the planning processbeyond the narrow limits of the bureaucratic machinery byensuring the participation of all interested parties (i.e. parents ,I eachers, pupils and, in short the entire society) .Within the limited space of this paper, however, only the salient issues pertaining to theseproblems can be raised and those, too, quite briefly.2. Power to plan9IContrary to the wishful thinking of most administrators and planning technicians, thepower to plan is a basic political power vested in the supreme governing authority of thecountry and is exercised always, by the chief executive (i.e. President or Prime Minister)through the legislative and executive machinery, Even where a separate Ministry of Planningis in existence the final decisions are taken at the highest level, for decisions on prioritiesand alternatives can best, be taken by an authority who has an over-all control over everyoneconcerned. Where the planning machinery is in the form of a Commission, its Chairman isoften the chief executive, or else, its chairman works in close liaison with and under thedirect supervision of the chief executive.2.2The authority to plan education is not always vested in the Ministry of Education.In most countries , major decisions on education are taken by the chief executive himself orby the cabinet as a whole in view of their 'inflammatory' nature and, consequently, theMinister of Education is either a junior politician given an opportunity to gain experience formore important functions in the future or an old party hand rewarded with a seat in theCabinet for his past services. Where the Minister 's political standing and enthusiasm are ata low ebb, the strength of the Ministry diminishes proportionately. The power to plan becomesa hotly contested issue and the Ministry of Education is often reduced to an advisory role ina planning function, actually operated by the Central Planning Organization.2,3The role of the Central Planning Organization (a) as the final co-odinating agencyamong different ministries, competing for the scarce resources in men, money and material,and (b) as the appropriate authority to find ways and means to secure and increase suchresources ,cannot be disputed. But its involvement in the detailed planning of specificactivities such as agriculture, health, land development , education or transportation isneither practical nor conducive to efficiency. The dictum that a plan foisted on administratorsby an alien or outside agency generates no enthusiasm and is most likely to be shelvedunimplemented applies with equal force to one prepared by the Central Planning Organization.This remains the strongest argument in fay our of empowering the Minister of Education to planeducation and giving the Ministry the administrative organization required to assist himeffectively in that task. 5 01,) Functional analysis of educational planning 3.Objectives3.1The definition of)als is fundamental to planning. In education, a set of perennial anduniversally applicable objectives have been in existence; namely:(a) the physical, mental and emotional adjustment of the individualto the social unit in which he is brought up;(b) the economic viability of the individual and the social unit; and(c) the preservation of the cultural identity of the social unit.These encompass all possible objectives in education.3 . 2When a political party in its election manifesto, or a government in its programme ,announces its educational objectives , all it does is to decide on(a) the order of priority it assigns to personal adjustments , economicviability and cultural identity;(b) the means by which the chosen goal or goals are achieved; and(c) the rate at which the modern sector in education is extended totake over the functions of the traditional system (see Annex I).Thus one finds these objectives states in such terms as:integrating education with national development;correlating education to national economic , social and culturalneedsdeveloping a vocational and technical bias in education;improving the quality of secondary and higher education;introducing uniN-ersal primary education;ensuring equality of educational opportunity.Couched obviously in the most general terms , they are by themselves in the realm of pioushopes , and many an administrat, has been exasperated by their lack of precision as well astheir demagogic flavour. The impatience of the professional administrator is understandable,even though it cannot be justified. The politician, both by inclination and by the pressure ofhis particular working climate, prefers targets which fire popular imagination. Reducing themto workable propositions is a professional function which has to be undertaken by the seniorstaff of the Ministry, operating close to the vortex of political power.3 . 3The interpretation of political targets in terms of practical educational objectivesisby far,the most important function of the Ministry. In this function, the professionaladministrators have many advantages over the politician-Minister:(a) They know the background to every problem and the limitationsand constraints which are and have been in the way of theirsolution.(b) They are adequately safe-guarded from public criticism andintervention so that they can take a detached view on every issue.(c) They need not be motivated by either parochial interests or thedesire for quick, short-term results, which govern politicaldecisions.But an impulsive Minister may, at times, choose to disregard professional experience andreduce his senior staff to a position of unquestioning yes-men, or begin operating through acoterie of sycophants, who are not too rare in any establishment. Apart from the fact that 516v Administrative aspects of educational planning such situations are usually short-lived, the administrator has with him an effective solution.With the complexity of administrative organizations and the multiplicity of laws , regulations,precedents and conventions which govern administrative action, power and authority in anybureaucracy tends to flow into the hands of those with the highest knowledge and the greatestcapacity for work. The indispensability of the administrator, achieved through knowledge andefficiency, has always been the stabilizing factor, and this type of stability is essential to theMinistry of Education before it begins to define objectives and undertake planning.4.Central planning organization4.1The Ministry of Education can quite effectively, prepare an educational plan in theabsence of any national or central planning and depend for finances on its special powers ofpersuasion and intimidation and the annual budget. Of course, in such instances the Ministryof Finance or the Treasury performs, though not formally , the function of a Central PlanningOrganization in estimating and allocating resources to various governmental activities.4.2But the existence of a Central Planning Organization is a tremendous advantage.First and foremost, its creation is an eloquent commitment of a country to planned develop-ment. Second, the allocation of resources is more logical and consistent when done through acentral plan than when it is done on an ad hoc basis. Third, it helps to co-ordinate activitiesof cognate or similar objectives undertaken by different agencies and cuts down overlappingand duplication. Lastly it provides an opportunity to take an over-all view of different develop-mental activities as they affect the nation as a whole.4 .3But the Central Planning Organization should have its functions clearly defined.If it undertakes functions which are legitimately of other Ministries or which can be donebetter by the technical and professional personnel in those Ministries , not only can itsusefulness be reduced but it can also prove to be a hindrance to progress. As far as ed.ica-tional planning is concerned, the Central Planning Organization would have served its purposefully ,if it:(a) prepares a macro-economic plan, which will indicate:(i )the allocation of resources (i.e. annual provisions, foreignexchange quotas, foreign aid etc.) available to educationduring the plan period,(ii) )investment objectives,(iii)recurrent implications ,(iv)the development in other fields which have a direct bearing oneducation (i.e. expansion of agriculture and industries indica-ting patterns of employment opportunities , the opening and the development of new areas and the likely impact on populationmovement) ,(v)the claims that will be made by different sectors on the publicand private organizations for the construction of buildings ,roads , playgrounds etc. , and their capacity to meet them , 524 Functional analysis of educational planning (vi) the claims that will he made by different sectors on industriesmaking furniture, fittings and apparatus and their capacity tomeet them,(vii) the type of import-export restrictions anticipated and theirlikely effect on the importation of educational materials(b) sees to the preparation by a competent: body of specialists a comprehensivereport on the national manpower requirements, containing:(i) long-term as well as medium and short-term forecasts ofnational and, if possible, regional manpower requirements,(ii) a survey of employment opportuniti s with indications as to thenature of skills and specializations demanded,(iii) an examination of the imbalances between the current. 'mix' ofthe educational output and the needs of the labour market ,(iv) broad guide-lines for job analysis, with tentative indications onthe minimum educational qualifications anticipated for varioustypes of employment ,(c) urges the government to take policy decisions relating to:(i). the employment of expatriate personnel,(ii) the trend of replacing expatriate personnel with nationals ,(iii) emigration of trained personnel (i.e. brain-drain),(d) makes itself available to educational planners for consultation and ensures theco-ordination of the educational plan with those of other sectors.5.Planning for planning5 .1The Ministry of Education has necessarily to begin by planning the very process ofplanning. Three matters demand its immediate attention:(a) the organization available or desirable to handle the planningoperation,(h) the administrative limitations to planning and plan-implementation,(c) the gathering and processing of basic data required for planning.Simple and obvious as they may appear to he, most of the problems of educationalplanning arise right at the commencement due to inadequate attention paid to these details.Whether a government is seriously interested in and committed to educational planning can beeasily judged from:(a) the extent to which the Minister and his senior staff are involvedin the planning process,(h) the emphasis laid on staffing the planning organization with themost competent and energetic officers,(c) the degree to which the planning personnel is given administrativeauthority and responsibility,(d) the attention given to, and facilities provided for, the specializedservices of the Ministry, responsible for educational research,statistics and data processing. Adininistrative aspects of educational planning A simple test can be designed to determine this e.g. :(i) Does the Minister fulfil conscientiously his legitimate roleas the chief educational planner?(ii) Does the senior staff of the Ministry share the responsibility forthe plan as well as the planning and plan-implementation processes?(iii) Is the head of the planning organization near enough in status to theMinister and his senior staff so that lie has direct access to them?(iv) Is the planning organization one of the last units from which staffis 'pinched' to meet shortages elsewhere or to handle emergencyduties?Not many countries are in a position to answer these questions in the affirmative.5.9The Ministry often experiences three major problems:(a) the total absence or paucity of qualified officers to fill positionsof technocrats in the planning organization,(b) the incompetence or indifference of the existing administrativestaff to reorganize itself and the inadaptability of the adminis-trative machinery to meet demands of planning,(c) the absence ,inadequacy or inaccuracy of data available both fromoutside and within the Ministry.Among thorn, (a) is the least difficult to solve, for a judicious use of foreign technical assis-tance and training programmes will produce the men needed for specialized functions. Asregards (b), positive remedial steps to reorganize and modernize administration should begiven priority in the preparations for planning. While (c) causes much inconvenience , it isnot always a deterrent to planning. A little ingenuity on the part or the planner, coupled withan understanding of the main trends of development in a country and a first-hand knowledge ofa-few areas, enables him to prepare a tolerably acceptable plan which can be revised andPerfected, as research and data gathering improves. from an administrative point of viewthis is less problematic than (b) ,which really is the most serious impediment to plannedclovelopmen1. 6.ucal ion Mini sI ry Planning Organ i za ion(3.1; \\s Ihe concept of planning began lo influence educational administration a decade orlwo ago, Some sort of planning organization was considered necessary either within theCentral Planning Organization or within the Ministry of Education. The central Planning()ganizations, oy often, had a Sub-Commission on education, comprising, among others,representatives of the Ministry of Education and serviced by an administrative unit. which was,theoretically, expected to maintain liaison with the educational administration. When PlanningVnils were established in 'Ministries of Educaliiin they tended to be no different tronn any otheradministrative unit and were staffed usuall% by statistical, building construction and accountingpersonnel. Sometimes, they were located in the lluclget Section of the Ministry as the prepara-tion of the annual budget was the main planning exercise of the Ministry. 1 (;.Functional analysis of educational planning The Planning Unit of the Ministry, merely as an administrative branch, couldexercise no control or authority over other branches, which, actually, carried out thefunctions of implementation. An 'over-arching' organization was thus found necessary andout of that need evolved the high-powered commission or Committee, appointed to be incharge of educational planning, railed by the Minister himself or his permanent secretary,serviced by specialists and supported by the specialized services of the Ministry.6.3An examination of the relative merits of a Planning Unit and a Commission orCommittee as administrative organizations fm planning will show the special advantages ofthe latter more vividly. (See Table f)6.4The ideal administrative organization for educational planning within the :\\linistry ofVducation is an Educational Planning Commission or Committee:(a) headed by the Minister or his permanent secretary (i.e. theseniormost civil servant in the Ministy),(b) comprising senior officers of the Alinistry of Education andother Ministries associated with the national educational effortas well as representatives of professional bodies, teachers,parents etc. ,() with the Planning -Unit of the Ministry as its Secretariat and thehead of that unit as the General Secretary,(d) supported by the documentation, statistical ,research, financial and building construction divisions of the :\\linistry ,(e) maintaining liaison with the rest of the Ministry,(f) associated closely with the Central Planning Organization andother Ministries,(g) handling, through the Planning --nit , the preparation of the Annual Budget of the Ministy..6.5A question can he raised about its location. Should such a commission necessarilybe in the Ministry of Education? Would it not be more efficient if it was within the Central'Planning Organization or even between it and the :\\linistv of Education? While answers tothese questions are very heavily dependent on the political ideology and the traditional adminis-trati\\ e patterns of each country, an important principle of administrative science favours thedirect involvement of the Ministry of F.ducation in educational planning: an administrativeorganization generates greater momentum when it is vested with policy and decision-makingauthority.6.6\"lhere are, of course, othe problems created by special constitutional and politicalfactors, such as the dig ision of authority and responsibility between Federal and State Goven-ments or between the Central Government and local authorities. -\\s planning, to be effecti\\ e,should take place at e\\ ey level of policy and decision-making ,a hierarchy of administrativeorganizations t\u00bb planning, with clearly defined limits of authority and responsibility, isabsolutely necessary. Such a system of planning organizations should extend right down to thegrass-roots level, namely ,the school.

Functional analysis of educational planning 6.7The creation of planning organizations at each level and each institution is by far themost effective way of allowing for the participation of the society, as a whle, in the planningprocess. But this is more easily said than done. The further we go from the Central PlanningOrganization, the greater is the tendency to lose sight of the over-all picture and be caught upin parochial and local considerations which, due to their proximity to us, naturally appearlarger and more important. The outcome of the situation is made more complicated by thefact that local and institutional administrators are often less qualified, less experienced andless able and are without any concept of even the rudiments of planned national developmentThe involvement of local interests in educational planning without disrupting it and creatingproblems of unrest, agitation and sabotage calls for a four-pronged attack:(a) Careful definition of functions, authority and responsibilityof each planning organization,(b) Preparation and issue of clear-cut terms of reference andunambiguous guide-lines ,especially in relation to nationalobjectives and limitations of resources ,(c) familiarizing all administrators in concepts and techniquesof planning,(d) a programme of public education, using every available massmedia. 7.Re-organization and modernization of administration7.1Administrative impediments to planned development are not peculiar to education,but no other aspect of national activity is as hampered by administrative complexities aseducation. The multi-faceted control pattern of educational administration (see Annex I) ,imposed by tradition, convention and even constitution, is further complicated by problemsof centralization, decentralization and recentralization of authority. Decades of in-breeding,as a result of which educational administrators were produced from within the system withlittle or no specialized training in administration (each successive generation perpetuatingits inheritance of conventional practices) have in most countries, left a legacy of prejudicesand stereotyped attitudes and standards. Moreover, the psychological reaction of the existingpersonnel, who invariably consider changes and ,innovations as challenges to personalsecurity and well-being, is not conducive to self-renewal or development of efficiency.7.2Operational barriers in educational administration arise from several factors:(a) Personnel, i.e. understaffing; dearth of administrative talent;inadequacy of leadership; want of training and retraining;(b) Material, i.e. limitations in physical plant; inadequacy of up-to-date machinery and equipment; limitations in mobility and communi-cations;(c) foradministrative stream-lining;(c1) Informational, i.e. the absence, inadequacy or inaccuracy of informa-tion and data available or retrievable for decision-making purposes; Administrative aspects of educational planning (e) Legal, i .e. antiquated Legislation; multiplicity of rules andregulations; rigidity in the devolution of authority and res-ponsibility;(f) Political, i.e. inadequacies in political Leadership, inexperienceand expediency;(g) Public relations ,i.e. E-.bsence or inadequacy of direct contact withthe public and the resulting alienation of the administration frontthe sociological forces at work in the nation.When faced with these problems the usual reaction of the educational administrationhas been in restrict its field of operation to:(i) routine maintenance rd. services;(ii) rigid personnel administration, particularly through transfersand disciplinary control;(iii) divorcing administration from the technical aspects of theservices administered:(iv) avoidance of controversial issues.7.3The re-organization and modernization of educational administration is a process ofeliminating the above operational barriers and creating an atmosphere of change and innovationin which the administrators would undertake and handle challenging tasks. A talent hunt accom-panied by a substantial investment in material requirements would, in itself, sc.tive the majorportion of its problems. The search for new techniques of administration would be facilitatedby borrowing discriminatingly from management principles which hay e shown spectacularresults in streamlining industrial and commercial enterprises. They would show how rules andregulations could be utilized to enhance efficiency and promote individual ive7 .4The more difficult problem is to overcome the political barriers, because a country,as the saying goes, gets the government. it deser\\ es and little can be done to vary it. But nogovernment worthy of its name is without the enlightened leadership which is capable ofminimising the detrimental effects of' parochial, party or local interests and political expediencyon administration. The integrity and impartiality of the administration (especially when loyaltyto the government is combined with a wideloyali:\\ to the people and a deep sense of patriotism)certainly has a great influence on reducing undue political interference to a minimum. Sosuch constitutional safeguards as judicial review of administrative actions, writs of certiorariand quo waranto and the institution of ombudsmen.7.5Although we consider administrative reorganization and modernization as a step inplanning for planning, the complex tasks involved in it cannot all be completed before theMinistry begins to plan education. ft would be necessay to include in the plan measures forthe improvement. of administration and continue to give them as much attention as otheraspects of educational development , if' not mare. Jd Functional analysis of educational planning 8.Data-gathering and processing8.1As a preparation for planning, the Ministry requires as much information andmaterial as it can find in the form of:(a) data obtained from outside sources , e.g.:(i) the information regarding the macro-economic plan, the alloca-tion of resources and manpower requirements supplied by theCentral Planning Organization (see paragraphs 4.3);(ii) demographic data from the census authorities;(iii) information on traditional values ,social and cultural prejudices and preferences and political awareness and ideologies, as theyaffect education, gathered through researches of social andpolitical scientists;(iv) information relevant to the expansion of education facilities , such as the availability of land for buildings, the capacity ofthe building trade to handle educational buildings industrial and trade limitations which pertain to the supply of equipment,etc;(b) data prepared and available in the Ministry, e.g. statistics on:(i) pupils;(ii) classes;(iii) schools and other educational institutions;(iv) teachers;(v) administrators;(vi) physical plant and facilities;(vii) costs;(c) data to be worked out from (a) and (b) above for specific requirements ofplanning ,e.g.:(i) enrolment, dropout ,repetition , promotion and rates and age-grade analysis of pupils;(ii) qualifications, distribution, shortages and excesses and trainingand retaining facilities of teachers;(iii) distribution, adequacy and actual condition of school plant andfacilities;(iv) interpretation of manpower forecasts in terms of educationalqualifications and relating manpower ne9ds to educationaloutput;(v) unit costs and analyses of educational expenditure.8 . 2The gathering and the processing of the above data do not constitute planning; noreven the projection of enrolment and retention figures over a period of years a valid planningoperation. These are only the tools for planning and the time and energy spent on theiracquisition is justified only to the degree they are useful in making decisions realistically.This fact has to be constantly borne in mind, especially when research units , entrusted withtheir collection and preparation, often show a predilection for amassing a vast quantity ofdata of little use to planning, though extremely valuable for history. 59 Administrative aspects of educational planning 9.Planning9 .1Planning begins when decisions are taken for action and the means of achieving goals areworked out. Decision-making is fundamentally an administrative action, and an administratorby training,as well as clue to the pressure under which he works ,seeks for the better course ofaction (i.e. what, under given circumstances, is immediately feasible to take him nearer tothe accomplishment of his goal). He is rarely allowed the luxury of waiting for inspiration oruntil all factors and alternatives are examined, so that he can choose the best course ofaction. But he cannot work purely on rules of thumb or hunches. Decision-making has inrecent years received much attention from specialists in administration and ways and meansof equipping the administrator to make better decisions have been worked out. Needless tosay, they are not only applicable to educational planning but also essential in view of thecomplexity of problems, alternative solutions and political, cultural and social constraintsand prejudices.9.2If the educational administrator proposes to utilize the techniques of decision-makingadopted by industry or commercial establishments he should at the very start distinguishbetween the aims of education and those of industry and commerce. Educational aims are notmeasurable in such tangible forms as higher profits, lower cost of production, expansion ofmarket, economies of scale, etc. Such approaches as have become popular among educationalplanners (i.e. cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness approach and manpower requirementsapproach) smack of the industrial and commercial practice of reducing everything to a balance-sheet and striking a surplus or a deficit balance to measure success or failure. Not only thenovelty of these techniques and approaches , but also the important national and personal as-pirations, which are generally not taken into consideration by them, make the average adminis-trator in the Ministry of Education suspicious of , if not hostile to, them. That explains why theMinistry of Education in most countries prefer the social demand approach to any other andalso why even when imbalances in the educational output, its incongruencies with job oppor-tunities and educated unemployment are observed , the Ministry makes little effort on its ownto change or improve the situation. The solution is not one of making economists out of educa-tional administrators or educational administrators out of economists, as is suggested bysome investigators.9.3What appears to be necessary is an over-all approach to educational planning whichwill take into consideration all aspects of character-building, citizenship-training, individualaspirations , manpower' requirements , costs and national development. Such an approach canmore effectively be evolved from within the Ministry of Education than through a CentralPlanning Organization or any other agency. It is important to note here that no two countries- not even those failing within the same typologies - can have the same approach , as the 6() 5:J :4) Functional analysis of educational planning relative importance assigned to each aspect is governed by the level of development, thepolitical and cultural maturity of the people, the predominance of tradition and a host ofother factors peculiar to each country and, very often, to each region within a country.9.4Whatever the approach adopted by each country, planning involves a preliminaryassessment of objectives, resources and means in terms of 'constants' and 'variables' .Though it would appear at the outset that school plant ,facilities and teachers are all'constants ' ,there is, in the field of education, only one main 'constant ' , namely,financialresources. All other factors, perhaps with exceptions like the optimum capacity of thebuilding trade, are variable ,in the sense that adjustments and modifications can be made inthem to the extent that funds are available. The principal 'variables' , are:(a) Pupils (b) Teachers (c) 'rime (d) Content (e) tit ruct tire(i) number of pupils to be enrolled in different levels of education;(ii) age of admission;(iii) the compulsory school-going age;(iv) distribution of pupils into different types of education andinstitutions. (i) number of teachers to be employed;(ii) distribution of teachers into different specialities, levels andtypes of education by means of recruitment and pre-servicetraining;(iii) proficiency of teachers for different specialities , levels andtypes of education by means of retraining;(iv) conditions of service;(v) teacher/pupil ratio. (i) length of courses;(ii) number of working days;(iii) number of working hours;(iv) allocation of periods in the time-table;(-)length and distribution of vacations. (i) 3\u00abbjects and subject-groupings;( planning (i)instructional methodology;(ii) course guides;(iii) textbooks;(iv) teaching aids;(v) machines, radio, television and other media. (i) units and credits;(ii) scholastic and aptitude tests;(iii) vocational and educational guidance;(iv) examination system.(h) Physical plant and facilities(i) location of schools and institutions;(ii) optimum use of plant and facilities;(iii) school architecture and building materials;(iv) cost of building and equipping;(v) improvization of equipment and apparatus.(i) Additional financial resources(i) community participation (e.g. self-help);(ii) productive educational activities (e.g. school farms,bakeries, repair-shops);(iii) cultural role of the school (i.e. community entertainment);(iv) industrial problem-solving and research (e.g. universitiesundertaking research for the industry);(v) extension services.Out of all these 'variables' at the disposal of the educational planner, rarely doeshe use anything other than;(1) number of pupils to be enrolled ,adjusting the number according to the availability of funds;(2) number of Leachers to be employed;(3) teache /pupil ratio, it as a means of reducing costof teachers;(4) number of working hours and allocation of periods, organizingdouble sessions to avoid congestion.These are important for the arithmetic of planning. Apart from the facility with which theycan be worked out ,they are easily demonstrated to higher levels of policy- making as wellas to the public. These fac, ws are especially favoured by the economist in educationalplanning, for they centre round problems of economics.9.5The main justification for entrusting educational planning to the Ministry of Educationis that it is functionally better equipped to explore ways and means of modifying all these'variables' for the achievement of optimum results. That is the fundamental approach toutilizing 'optimal means'. So it is important that this function he assigned the highestpriority among the duties of the Ministry. But it is not a function to be entrusted to an (i2r0/ Functional analysis of educational planning ad hoc agency like the Planning Unit. While the Planning Unit may direct the operations fromthe centre, the fourfold functions connected with them ,namely:(a) research - particularly action research;(b) experimentation;(e) consultation with experts ,practising teachers and informedpublic opinion;(d) pe-testing in pilot projects.should be undertaken by each of the branches concerned with these 'variables ' with theactive co-operation of the educational field staff. The inspiration and inducement for changesand innovations should emanate from the highest authority in the Ministry, while incentivesshould he provided for every member in the Ministry to put forward suggestions. Regularconferences and discussions, similar to the 'brainstorming sessions' of industry ,helpto capture sparks of inspiration which can, in due course, be developed into new lines ofapproach. Similarly, an arrangement to collect and process ideas, which may arise outsidethe Ministry, should be put into operation. The public must be encouraged to think andcomm T1 en t on how the 'variables ' in educational planning can be adjusted and modified to bringabout the desired results. As no one holds a monopoly for new and brilliant ideas ,no sectionof the public should be kept out.9.6But ideas do not arise in a vacuum. The Ministry has to take the lead. Problemsshould be identified and 'constants' and constraints lucidly explained. For this purpose, aswell as to receive and develop promising ideas ,the Ministry should provide for a body ofcompetent persons with open minds ,free of prejudices and conservative notions and tempera-mentally inclined to try out changes and innovations.9.7To adapt the administrative machinery of the Ministry to such a concept of planning,a complete re-organization will be necessary. But it is not the type of re-organization whichis effected by tinkering with the organizatiOnal chart or organigram of the Ministry. It is nota case of fitting individuals into a number of 'slots but of finding the correct type of personfor the kind of challenging functions that planning involves.9.8An educational planner, right at the commencement of his work, discovers two dis-concerting facts:(a) 80-90 per cent of the Educational Budget is already committedfor recurrent and continuing projects and functions, and only10-20 per cent of it is available for new projects which go intothe plan,(b) 80-90 per cent of the administrative time is already committedfor functions of a maintenance nature, and when it comes tothe senior officers, whose involvement is indispensable toplanning, the percentage of time taken up by supervisory,ceremonial, political and public relations functions is evengreater. 63 Administrative aspects of educational planning mr1Hrg .noro administrati\\ e time for planning is thus another. of tire (ty nrtrynt rimer runs of aplanner. The solution may appear to lie in increasing the staff of the Ministry; but this in factis not a S01111 :on, for the type of person whose time is required for planning is not voile edby merely increasing the number of his assistants. Vat. more important is an in\\ est igat ioninto prionems of (a) devolution and delegation of authority; (b) controlling and approvingmechanisms; (c) time-consuming routine procedures and recod-keeping and (d) administra-tive ho'llenecks. What is necessary is an Organization and 'Methods Review for the specificpurpose of relieving the higher echelons of routine functions. It may call for drastic steps inthe form of amending legislation, revising instructions and breaking down the lines ofauthority which, especially in ex-colonial countries, had inherited the tendency to centralizepower of decision-making close to the metropolitan power. Here again the Ministry calllearn a few lessons from the success achieved by industrial. and mercantile management:(1) by the delegation of both authority and responsibility to different operational levels;(.)) by minimizing record-keeping and (3) by working out time and energy-conseying jobo'(,as .9 . 9Once the Ministry, by giving planning as much of the administrative time and talentas possible and carrying out a full range of consultations at all le., els has decided uponstrategies as regards the modification of 'variables' to suit targets of the plan, the majorfunction of planning is almost fully accomplished. The approval of the strategies and theformulation of guidelines by the Educational Planning Commission or Committee completesthis function. The arithmetical formulation of the plan is a routine exercise of givingexpression to decisions made on a much wider' coverage of data than educational statistics.titich a difficult. and complicated process is called for here, as educational planning demandsas much a philosophical, psychological and socioloOr.al approach as a mathematical one andinvolves as much immeasurable conceptual values ti.s quantifiable targets. 10.plan formulation10.1The first Draft of the Plan, which the Planning Unit as the Secretariat of the Fduca-Ilona! Planning Commission or Committee prepares ,will he nothing more than the elaborationand logical arrangement of decisions made by (he Commission or the Committee. Its mainohjecti\\ es will be tor(a) achieve a measure of internal consistency among differentprogrammes and projects;(h) indicate the adequacy or ofhewise of the resources madeavailable to education by the C'entr'al Planning Cganization;(c) suggest an order of priority and a pattern of phasing for variousactivities, particularly those such as building, equipping andleacher-training which precede the inauguration of an educa-tional programme; Functional analysis of educational planning (d) establish the feasibility of the Plan as a whole as well asof specific projects included in it.Being a document primarily meant for the Commission/Committee as a basis for therevision of their targets, strategies and policies in the light of the over-all picture itpresents will, naturally, be confidential and limited in circulation.10.2It is presumed that the Planning Unit will not only pinpoint the issues to be decidedby the Commission/Committee but also suggest alternative approaches in matters which needreconsideration due to problems of feasibility, inadequacy of resources etc. The SecondDraft, which will embody the revised strategies and policies, will be the basis for:(a) professional criticism by statutory, advisory or operationalboards within the Ministry of Education;(b) discussions with agencies controlling various aspects ofeducation (e.g. Regional Departments of Education, LocalGovernment Authorities, Local Education Authorities, SchoolBoards, Religious and Private School Managements etc.);(c) consultations with representatives of institutional admini-strators, parents ,teachers, educational trade unions andstudent movements;(d) negotiations with the Central Planning Organization, theMinistry of Finance, the Treasury and other governmentalagencies connected with the Plan (e.g. Public Works Departmentre buildings , Land Department re expropriation of land) , as well as private agencies (e.g. textbook publishers , printers , manufacturers , importers and distributors of teaching aidsand science equipment);(e) assessment of political reaction.To reach the wide network of organizations and individuals envisaged above, theSecond Draft should be a detailed presentation of all relevant data. Meticulous care shouldbe taken in its preparation:(i)to ensure that it is in plain language with little or no technicaljargon and 'mystifying magic ';(ii)to make it both readable and convincing as a document meantto win the support of the people rather than baffle them;(iii) to emphasize that everything contained in it is for examinationand criticism and is bound to be amended in the light ofcomments made by the people.Needless to say, the psychological climate created by throwing the document opento public criticism would become fruitful only if an adequately efficient machinery is estab-lished at the Ministry to receive and process the comments with the seriousness they deserve.Newspapers , public meetings ,seminars, interviews , memoranda are among the main meansby which public opinion will be normally expressed. If the machinery handling criticism isreasonably receptive and considerate there will be no need for the public or any sectionaffected by the Plan to resort to any disorderly or violent forms of expressing its disapprovalof any proposals. 65 Administrative aspects of educational planning 10.3Lest any idealistic administrator become disappointed with the public and losefaith in I.he efficacy of consultation, he should be warned that a fair proportion of the criti-cism will come from:(a) uninformed quarters who are carried away more often byslogans than by sense and more inclined to impute dis-honourable motives f o anything;(h) parochial vested interes's whose self-interest is placedabove public or general good;(c) political 'rabble - rousers' for whom any issue is goodenough if it can be twisted and slanted to embarrass thegovernment in power;(d) self-appointed critics who see something wrong with every-thing but have no constructive suggestions to offer.lie would soon learn to sift the chaff of such comments and identify those which are valid anduseful for the revision of the Plan.10 .4 .The assessment of the political reaction to the Plan is a more complex operation.Ina Parliamentary system two alternatives are available:(1) presenting in Parliament the m'sjor policies, embodied inthe Plan, in the form of a White Paper for a full-scaledebate(2) discussing the Second Draft at a meeting of !he Go,. ernmen;Parliamentary Group.The first method has an advantage in that members of the Opposition too are given anopportunity to express their views and, where the leaders adopt a statesmanlike attitude, thediscussion can be above ihe petty and parochial bickerings of party politics. in socialiststates the same function is performed by organs such as the central committee of thepolitical party.10.5A question often asked by administrator's and planner's is whether- they are obligedin these discussions, consultations and debates to 'defend' the Plan. A clear exposition ofwhy a particular alternative is chosen in preference to others and what prevents the adoptionof a proposal which on the face of it appears attractive, is expected of them at everydiscussion whether in Parliament. or outside. Further, there is always the need to clarifycertain aspects of the Plan, clear misunderstandings, remove incorrect impressions, rectifyerrors in data and supply further information. All these functions throw on the Planning Unita tremendous responsibility for marshalling the resources of the Ministry in 'defence' ofthe Man. Such a responsibility demands that a co-equal authority be vested in it.10.6.The preparation of the Third Draft will need a fresh set of guidelines from theCommission/Committee in the light of the opinions expressed by various persons, organiza-tions and political agencies. To obtain these decisions, the Planning Unit should identify theprincipal points of controversy, suggest alternative solutions and indicate limitations imposedby resources, feasibility and the need for consistency. The period of preparing the Third Draft fiG Functional analysis of educational planning will he marked by feverish activity in the form of informal consultations with the CentralPlanning Organization, the Ministry of Finance, the Treasury and, above all the head ofthe government. In fact, the most important part of the planning operation is carried outthrough these consultations in which the administrators and planners play the role of'bargainers '. Once the Third Draft is approved by the Commission/Committee, it hasthe authority of a technically as well as politically acceptable document for which the priorconcurrence of everyone concerned has been informally obtained. Under such circumstances,the final approval of the Plan by Government and its incorporation in the legislative enact-ments of the country (as done in some places) are purely formal.10.7The next function of the Ministry of Education is about the most significant, as thesuccessful implementation of the Plan depends very heavily on it. That is the organizationof the public education and information service to ensure public co-operation for the Plan.A well planned use of all forms of mass media is called for here. It is at this stage thatlocal and institutional organizations, discussed above (see paragraph 6 .7) have a specialfunction to perform. H.Plan implementationThe Plan should have included the administrative implications of implementatingit, e.g.:(a) enactment of new laws;(b) issue of subsidiary legislation on the authority of existing laws;(c) re-organization in administration;(d) changes in procedure.Where some of the agencies controlling education are private and autonomous, the mannerinwhith their anti\\ ities are in,:opoated in plan-implementation (e.g. legislative compulsion,grants, incentives), too, should have received due attention. Where more than one govern-mental or non-governmental agency plays a special role in the achievement of plan targets,the lines of communication and the machinery for co-ordination and liaison among themshould be worked out and where their participation is complex, such techniques as PERTor CPA should he employed to establish their interaction on a time - priority basis.11.2Elaborating the Plan and reducing it to programmes and projects is administrativelya function of delegating the implementation to branches, regional organizations and institu-tions. Each such delegation of function has to be accompanied by a delegation of authority andresponsibility which , for effective functioning of an administrative organism , should be co-equal and co-terminus. Thus is set in motion, as illustrated by the diagram on page 69a two-way spiral where (i) instructions and directives are passed from the higher levelto the lower; (ii) information and data are obtained from the lower in the form of reports; Administrative aspects of educational planning (iii) instructions and directives are evaluated in the light of such reports and (iv) revisedinstructions and directives are issued to the lower level. The process once set, in motiongoes on and on without: interruption. Every level of administration which receives a directivefrom the higher level is autonomous within the limits specified by such directive and if iswithin this sphere of autonomy that an administrative level performs best. While thisprinciple applies with equal force to all offices and branches of a bureaucracy, it is particu-larly important as a means of galvanizing institutions such as universities, colleges andschools into action. With powerful informal organizations which, as in the case of students'and parents' organizations, are not bound by official regulations ,these institutions workmore efficiently when the control exercised over them is minimum. The speed with which thehigher level solves the problems reported by the lower level is the key-note to administrativeeffectiveness in pla-implementation, and this requires the organization of problem-solvingservices at every level of the administrative machinery.11.3The faithful servant of the Plan is the annual budget , hence theneed for assigning itspreparation to the Planning Unit. The budget is an effective instrument of delegating functionsand responsibilities to various levels. Apart from the legal force it has ,it specifies opera-tional limits in terms of money, allowing the administration to stretch it to the utmost accordingto the capacity and the ingenuity of decision-makers. Even if the Parliament approves abudget in outline, indicating only broad divisions of expenditure, it is advantageous for planimplementation if the budget is further analysed into programmes and projects and sub-divided according to different levels of administration right clown to that of the school.11.4Plan implementation calls for a continuous: (i) review of progress; (ii) evaluationof the effectiveness of methods; (iii) revision and adjustment of targets and strategies and(iv) measures to meet unforeseen contingencies. Equally important is to extract out of theexperiences gained by the implementation of one plan, guidelines which will be useful in thepreparation of the next plan, as the implementation of the current plan and the preparationof the next have to be a simultaneous and closely intertwined process. 12 .Conclusions12.1The functional analysis of educational planning from the point of view of theMinistry of Education leads us to several conclusions:(a) the Ministry of Education is the most desirable administrativeorganization to undertake educational planning;(b) the ideal machinery for planning is an Educational PlanningCommission/Committee headed by the Minister himself or thePermanent Secretary with the Planning Unit as its Secretariat;(c) the Planning Unit should be entrusted with the preparation ofthe budget and the head of that Unit should be near: enough instatus and official standing to the highest echelons of the Ministryto be able to exercise the requisite authority; 68 Report 64 Administrative aspects of educational planning (d) the Central Planning (tganization would have served itspurpose in relation to educational planning when it preparesa mao-economic plan, sees lo the preparation of a manpowerrequirements report. and makes itself available to educationaladministrators for consultation;(e) the process of planning to plan requires, besides data gatheringand processing, the e-organization and modernization of theadministrative machinery;(I)planning in education calls for the identification of 'variables'in educational processes and practices and modifying them tosuit the demands of targets and constraints of resources;(g) the plan formulation is a function of extensive consultations forwhich an efficient and psychologically conditioned machinery isa vital necessity;(h) plan implementation, which embraces the entire administration,is immensely facilitated by a well-defined delegation of authority,and responsibility, with a measure of autonomy guaranteed toeach level, and particularly to the universities, colleges, schoolsetc.;(i) the budget is the faithful servant of the Plan and it can be utilizedfor more purposes than purely specifying financial provisions;(j)the implementation, evaluation and revision of the currentPlan and the preparation of the next have to be a simultaneousprocess.

Lyons IntroductionThe paradox which lies at the basis of this paper is that in some countries there are educational'plans' but little seems to be done about them, while in other countries there are apparently no'plans' but education seems to be developing in an impressive way. The aim of this paper is to showthat this paradox can be explained in terms of the degree to which planning makes a useful contribu-tion to administration in changing education and increasing the provision of education. It will besuggested that the conventional concept of educational planning is too narrow in terms of the typesof plan, the levels of administration which are involved in the different phases of the planning pro-cess and the communication and co-ordination which exists between them and which varies in formaccording to the nature of the control of education. Expertise and training for it will be shown to beimportant factors in successful planning. The paper will examine some practical arrangementswhich are desirable if planning is to be firmly integrated within administration. 1/ What types of plans are required in educational administration?The planning process may be equated with 'good' administration; planning is part of administration.Every administrator is, of course, convinced that he provides 'good' administration. But we willassume that good administration is change- and development-oriented, i, e.it adapts what is doneto what is needed as a result of changing circumstances. Bad administration does not.A definition of planning and the planning process as they relate to administration maybe seen in the main document prepared for the Unesco International Conference on EducationalPlanning (Paris, 6-14 August, 1968). We note 2/ that 'Educational planning is ... the application1/ We shall equate management and education as they mean the samething.2/ Unesco, Educational planning: A survey of problems and prospects,Working Paper for International Conference on Educational Planning,Paris, August, 1968, pp. 10 and 11. 75 Administrative aspects of educational planning to education itself of a rational, scientific approach to examining one's alternatives, choosing wise-ly among them, then proceeding systematically to implement the choices thus made'. In this pers-pective, educational planning is much more than the drafting of a blueprint; it is a continuous pro-cess. The process entails the following succession of interdependent actions:clarification of educational objectives;diagnosis of present conditions and recent trends;assessment of alternatives;translation of plans into action;evaluation and adjustment.This definition of the planning process covers the essential elements of good administration in thatit includes not only the elaboration of blueprints but also their translation into action subject to con-trol and subequent adjustment. The conventional view of planning is that it is confined to the elabora-tion of blueprints and, hopefully, to their evaluation. Analytically, planning should be seen as dis-tinct from implementation. It should include evaluation. It is a matter of preparing, and subsequentlyevaluating, a set of decisions for future action aimed at achieving a specific set of goals. 1/ But theemphasis by Unesco on the planning process, the identity between planning and administration, isjustified precisely because much administration is bad administration in that it is not able to beforward-looking in its organization and operation.Administration uses several different types of plans, and the national plan for educationrepresents a complex structure of such plans. In order to look more deeply into the nature of plan-ning and its role in administration we may refer to the concepts as they affect the private sector andas set out by Professor William H. Newman in his book Administrative Action. 2/ His work isfocused on the problems of administrative action in the individual firm, where profit based on ef-ficient operation and dismissal of executives if it is not achieved are essential criteria. His analy-sis has considerable relevance to the public sector, where the satisfaction of political and tradi-tional demands is the objective and dismissal of either politicians or civil servants is often a mostdifficult business, seldom directly related to the criterion of efficient operation.Newman defines administration as the'guidance, leadership and control of the effort of agroup of individuals towards some common goal'. He distinguishes five basic processes inadministration. 1/ H. S. Parnes, Manpower in economic and social growth, AID, 1967.2/ W. H. Newman, Administrative Action, London, Pitman, 1963,second edition. 76 The nature of the educational planning process First, planning, which is 'determining what shall be done'. Thiscovers a wide range of actions: clarification of goals, establish-ment of policies, mapping-out of programmes and campaigns,determining specific methods of procedures and fixing day-to-dayschedules.Second, organizing: grouping into administrative units the activitiesnecessary to draw up and carry out the plan and defining the relation-ships among the executives and workers in such units.Third, assembling resources: arranging the use of executive person-nel, capital, facilities and other things or services needed to executethe plan.Fourth, supervising: day-to-day guidance of operations. Thisincludes issuing instructions, co-ordinating detailed work, cultivatinggood personal relationships by the boss with his subordinates.Fifth, controlling: seeing that the operating results conform as nearlyas possible to the plans. This involves establishment of standards,comparison of actual results against the standard and undertaking thenecessary corrective action where performance deviates from the plan.In addition to these five processes, there are non-delegated activities such as outside contacts,public relations and so on. But we can observe that administration is closely tied to actual opera-tions, and if planning is to be meaningful it must be inextricably tied to this process of transform-ing plans into reality.We can also look at administration in terms of defined areas or subjects. In a firm it canbe sales, purchasing, production, accounting, finance, personnel and so on. In a ministry of educa-tion it may be in terms of levels of education, building, books and equipment, purchases, transport,finance and so on. The nub of the problem is how to use planning in this process so that the elementsof time, space, functional structure and human behaviour are co-ordinated to get defined jobs inthe different areas of the educational system well done.We can observe close identity between the Unesco definition of the planning process andNewman's definition of the processes of administration. Planning, as he defines it, is much widerthan the concept of a plan which ends up in a pigeon-hole: It is firmly linked in all its elements withthe processes by which plans are translated into action. It covers the entire range of plans neededfor good administration. These include goals, single-use plans, standing plans and policies. Theyrange from formulations of broad objectives down to detailed plans for the activity of a single indi-vidual on une day.Goals are the expression of the results to be achieved. If planning is to be meaningfulthere must be clear official recognition, on an appropriately durable basis, of the goals. Inthe public service, recognition of goals is a political act and it is frequently difficult to ensurethat decisions are taken on the basis of the facts, the balance of advantage and the participationand agreement of the public. When we examine existing educational plans we can observe that someof them are goals which cannot be maintained, followed through and used as a basis for action by 7771 Administrative aspects of educational planning the administration. One reason for this is political instability. Governments may change frequently,and higher civil servants also, and the views of the new men may be at variance with those of theirpredecessors. But even when relative political stability obtains, the existance of political pressures,for example for secondary education, may be such as to prevent the maintenance of goals.Public organization is public precisely because the community has decided that the interestsinvolved are such as to be beyond the proper scope of private profit. Whether we consider defence,health or education, we see, in the development of the public sector, a history of gradual movementtowards public control and of subsequent difficulty in defining the goals necessary for administeringpublic organizations in the light of new factors and pressures which are continually coming intobeing. Therefore one of the reasons why educational administration may be less effective then thatof a private concern is that, in establishing goals and realizing them, its operation, staffing, rela-tionships with the government are subject to a continuous, delicate and involved process of negotia-tion with and adaptation to a cumulative series of pressures.A clear recognition of goals to be achieved is essential if planning is to mean anything.Each executive, from the permanent head of the ministry to the teacher, should, in principle, knowthe aim of his particular activities. The difficulty is that, in many cases, these aims are not con-stant. They are not adapted to change and development for the simple reason that the problem of de-fining and maintaining goals is beyond the administrative and political capacity of the ministry ofeducation at a given time.We can also examine the relevance of goals to planning by seeing to what extent goals arereflected by the relevant plans. Educational plans in many countries represent a series of goals foreducation over the long and medium term. They may take account of, or pay lip-service to, thetwo major restraints on educational development, namely job possibilities and what education shoulddo about them, and the amount of money which is likely to be available for education. They sometimescontain general proposals for making the provision of education more relevant to the child's needsand more efficient. But their usefulness as goals is immensely increased when they are supportedby a structure of single-use plans and standing plans through which they can be realized. This isat the heart of the problem of modernizing educational administration through due attention to plan-ning. If the first task is to define and maintain goals using information and analysis, the secondtask is to map out a course of action to realize goals, taking account of budgetary possibilities. Inplotting such action and building up a structure of plans, the administrator can make use of single-use plans which lay out the course of action to fit a specific situation and are finished when thegoals are reached, and standing plans which are designed to be used again and again. 1/Single-use plans include major programmes, projects and special programmes. 1/ W. H. Newman, op. cit. 78 The nature of the educational planning process A major programme outlines the principal steps or individual projects needed to accom-plish an important objective. It indicates who will be accountable for each step and the approximatetiming of each.To take one example, let us suppose that an educational plan contains, among its variousprogrammes, a major programme for the establishment of improved large-scale arrangements forthe full-time training of technicians at post-secondary level. We may distinguish the following sevenelements in such a major programme:(a)an employment survey to determine job possibilitiesand the necessary scope of the programme;(b)location and preparation of detailed projects for thebuilding of training centres;(c)construction of the building schedules;(d) training and recruitment of teachers;(e)supply of books, material and equipment;(f)provision for capital and recurrent finance;(g) ensuring the co-operation of teachers, parents and pupils.Major programmes have been carried out effectively, with all the basic preliminary work of prepara-tion, communication, schedules and responsibility for implementation, in countries where there isno over-all plan. Where there is an over-all plan they sometimes have not been carried out becausethey have not been articulated and prepared for implementation within the administration. It may benoted that major programmes which are scheduled and followed through are the iron rule in privateenterprise but not always in educational administration. It would be valuable in this connection toexamine how programmes for the training of teachers (a key to effective educational planning) havebeen drawn up and carried through in a number of countries with different political and administra-tive situations.Major programmes consist of a number of projects. These are clear-cut and distinct ele-ments of the programme, or individual pieces of work, e. g. the replacement of an inadequateschool building.To take an example, the administration of a large organization for private educa-tion decides that, as part of its major programme for developing secondary education, salaryadministration should be based on job evaluation. The initial planning is assigned as a separate pro-ject. The following steps are involved:(a)organizing and staffing of the project;(b)setting policies for the project;(c) preparing job descriptions of the teaching staff;(d)evaluating the jobs;(e) making market surveys of wage rates for comparable positions; 797 (i Administrative aspects of educational planning (f)developing a wage structure;(g)installing the plan;(h) informing and negotiating with the teaching staff.Special programmes are the third type of single-use plan. They deal with one phase ofoperations. Unlike projects they contain no clear completion date or point; they cover a continuingproblem. For example, the replacement of high-level personnel in the ministry of education. Howshould this exceptional problem be dealt with? The director-general is 58, retirement age is 60.The chief educational officer is 54, suffers from ulcers and alcoholism; is not very useful. The headof the planning office is 52 and technically very weak. The finance officer is 54; he is competent butunco-operative. The requirement is to develop a programme for replacement and training. This isthe work of the personnel division of the ministry. It is a delicate task.Business planning pays considerable attention to standing plans, i. e. arrangements forcontinued actions which can be used again and again. These include the time and motion aspects ofthe man on the job doing a defined task, i. e. the review of production methods and disposal of thelabour force in production. Standing plans of education represent the day-to-day organization of allthe operations which count as far as education is concerned. One example is the time-table of a de-fined level and grade of education. Another is the method of teaching. Another is the way an inspec-tor undertakes his duties. The legal structure represents a series of standing plans for the operationof education. The structure of education in terms of levels and types is the framework within whichstanding plans are implemented.When we consider the reform of education we can see it as a matter of formulating and im-plementing new standing plans and policies. Policy is a general plan of action that guides membersof an enterprise in the conduct of its operation, e. g. policy in respect of hiring teachers accordingto their qualifications. The reform of standing plans and policies is a central task for modernizingeducation and its administration.We should remember the importance of the budget as an instrument for co-ordinatingdifferent types of plans. It supplements and acts as a control for purposeful and integrated planning.It can help to show where unproductive and diverging work can be avoided. It can be a guide byindicating blockages in achieving programmes. It is a mirror in money terms of what has to be done.If the first task is to define goals in the light of analysis, the second task is to map out the single-use, standing plans and policies taking into account budgetary possibilities.Newman's model of planning in business administration provides a tool with which toapproach the educational planning process or 'good' educational administration. We see that the pre-paration of a structure of interdependent plans and policies and adequate arrangements for their im-plementation is necessary if identity between the planning process and good administration is to bereached. This is not just the task of a planning office, though its task is essential. It involves poli-tician, administrator, inspector, headmaster and teacher, all of whom divide their time between 80 The nature of the educational planning process planning, organizing, assembling resources, supervising and controlling. The essential point isthat the success of 'the plan' will depend on the large numbers of people who have fitted their dif-ferent types of planning into it so that it represents a realistic blueprint of what shall be done, andwho have, or have not, transformed it into what has been done. This is a question of levels of plan-ning and of administration, of administrative structures and functions, of trained people andpolitical determination. The division of labour in planningA striking feature of recent discussion of and writing about the educational planning process hasbeen the emphasis placed on the 'macro' or systems approach. This stress upon educational plan-ning as an aggregative process 'in which a large number of different units interact... and similarchanges in the output can be achieved through many alternative variations in the components' 1/has been of considerable service in the 'diagnosis' of education. On the other hand, and in a dynamicas opposed to a static sense, the aggregate systems approach requires to be supplemented by in-creased attention to the problems of sub-systems planning in order that it should be, in fact, anaggregative process.This point is implicit in Dror's comment on the possible weakness in the systemsapproach 2/' A less optimistic implication of the systems view of public policy-making is that im-provements must reach a critical mass in order to influence the aggregative workings of the 'system'.Improvements which do not reach the relevant impact thresholds will, at best, be neutralized bycountervailing adjustments of other components (e.g. a new planning method may be reacted to in away making it an empty ritual), or at worst may in fact reduce the quality of aggregate policies(e. g. through possible boomerang effect, reducing belief in human intelligence with possible retreatto some types of mysticism, leader-ideology, etc., or by making and implementing wrong decisionsmore 'efficiently', thus abolishing a basic social protective mechanism - inefficiency as reducingthe dangers of foolish decisions and permitting slow and tacit learning).That the whole view may be dissociated from the parts which give it validity is a dangerimplied in the definition of educational planning given by Dr. C. E. Beeby 3/ : 1/ Y. Dror, Some normative implications of a systems view ofpolicy-making, Rand Corporation, 19682/ Y. Dror, Ibid3/ C. E. Beeby, Planning and the educational administrator, Paris,Unesco/IIEP, 1967 (Fundamentals of Educational Planning, 4). 817;) Administrative aspects of educational planning 'Educational planning is the exercise of foresight in determining the policy, priorities and costs ofan educational system, having due regard for economic and political realities, for the system'spotential for growth and for the needs of the country and of the pupils served by the system' (ourunderlining).The author notes that this definition differs from other recent definitions in several res-pects: (a) while stressing the importance of the new economic dimension to planning, it still coversprocesses that went on long before the economists became actively interested in the planning of educa-tion; (b) it draws no sharp line of distinction between the making of a plan, the adoption of a plan, andits implementation; (c) it lays stress on the political realities, on the balance of forces affectingthe adoption of a plan; (d) it mentions the needs both of the country and of the children; (e) it givesspecial consideration to an educational system's capacity for growth.This definition emphasizes the over-all view of planning the educational system. It identifiesplanning (see (c) above) with the planning process and hence with administration. It implies that it ispossible and desirable to determine the aggregate movement of education from a central position.Its validity depends on whether planning at this level can be supported by the administrative pro-cesses required to produce and implement relevant plans. This is a matter of the scope of aggre-gate planning, its technical quality, of the institutional arrangements, reporting and co-ordinationrequired to draw it up and decide on it, the structure of individual plans contained in it, the organiza-tion, controls and budgeting arrangements required to transform it into reality. The definition isacceptable and useful as an approach to planning at the central level. It requires modification in thatit is necessary to place greater emphasis on the different stages of development of the planning pro-cess and on the need to work towards a structure of plans adapted to the different circumstances ofcontrol of education.The case for aggregate planning of education rests mainly on the benefits which can accruein using resources wisely and obtaining sufficient investment and recurrent resources when educa-tion is part of short-term and perspective plans for economic and social development. These plans,imperative or indicative, provide a valuable series of goals in respect of certain key areas:investment, enrolment in relation to employment possibilities, flow of budgetary funds. But it is ofdecisive importance, in view of the social role of education, that the goals of education itself shouldbe equally clearly defined in terms of reform of structure and content. This is frequently not thecase.If we accept that perhaps as much as nine-tenths of available money, resources andadministrative skills in education are devoted to meeting unavoidable obligations arising frompast decisions, the field of manoeuvre for change and development in response to new economic cir-cumstances is circumscribed. The major problem is how to recast the disposition of the total effortover time, including the commitment of the marginal increments arising from growth. This is first 827'6 The nature of the educational planning process and foremost an educational problem. It has explosive social and political implications. This isapparent if we examine, to take two examples, the effects of the movement for the reform of secon-dary and higher education in France on the fulfilment of the French plan, or the introduction of com-prehensive secondary education in England as it affects central/local goal-setting. The planning ofreform should be a determinant factor in the aggregate planning of education. It is a much moredelicate and complex operation than the planning of resources in response to economic criteria. Itshouldinvolve the widest consultation and careful planning, before political decisions are taken andgoals are set as part of the national economic and social plan or the central establishment ofnational objectives. This is an argument for improved formulation of, and greater emphasis on, newstanding plans for education within educational planning at all levels.Planning an educational system must take into account the dispersion of the sub-systemswhich compose it.It is difficult and sometimes undesirable or impossible to plan every element ofthe system centrally. Diagnosis at the central aggregative level provides a most important tool withwhich to assess the performance of the different sub-systems and on which to base proposals forimproved and changed performance. But the realization of these goals is a matter of using thevariety of instruments available to administration, ranging from direct control and operation tobudgetary pressures and advice. For example, in the Soviet Union primary education is a local res-ponsibility. In many countries private education has only a tenuous connection with public policy.Universities are frequently worlds unto themselves. Non-formal education, which is potentially asimportant for national, social, and economic development as formal education, is widely diffusedunder many different ministries and bodies and its over-all goals are generally not examined inaggregate as part of systems diagnosis. Mass media are separately controlled and organized.Though all the above types of educational effort are part of the educational system in the widersense they are frequently not included in its aggregative diagnosis.The difference between the plan at the central level which comes to nothing and the success-ful plan can be seen as the outcome of the incorporation of planning into administration at four levels:the political, central professional, regional and local, and the institutional or 'on-the-job' levels.These levels are indicated in the chart on page 84 which represents one of many possible administra-tive solutions.The political level determines the goals of education, provides the directives for plans,decides what proposals to approve, provides general supervision of the implementation of plans.These functions are normally vested in the minister of education, who is responsible to theprime minister and the cabinet. He is advised by the director-general of education and the board ofeducation which represent the professional basis of administration as well as the complex structureof political, professional and social interests involved in education, respectively. It is rare for aminister to have the possibility of examining and determining a strategy for the development of the 837 Administrative aspects of educational planning Chart 1.The place of the Planning Unit within the educational system Minister of FinancePrime Minister/Cabinet textbooks,legal advisor, etc.,2J Primary, secondary, technical, higher, adult. 8478 The nature of the educational planning process entire educational system in the sense discussed above. It is more common that he can do so for thesystem of public formal edu:ation. His field of decision should include both quantitative and qualita-tive planning (reform etc.); the first, which deals with real resources is made easier when nationaleconomic and social planning is functioning, the second is frequently the subject of decisions with-out planning in response to political pressures. The decisive question is whether his decisions arebased on the prepared advice of the professional central level and, in turn, whether effective linksexist between that level and the two subordinate levels which ensure 'feasible' advice and subse-quent implementation of decisions.The goals of education are reflected in the perspective plan, the five-year plan, annualbudgets for education and in the laws, policies and instructions which govern the day-to-day opera-tion of education. The second level of planning is one at which the professional work at the centralnational level takes place and where the central responsibility for planning and implementation re-sides. Planning in the sense of quantitative change or of reform of standing plans is undertaken byall the senior officers of the ministry but quantitative planning is better articulated than qualitativeplanning.Thus the line directors are responsible for preparing programmes for the respective levelsand types of education and ensuring that these programmes are feasible in that they rest, at regionaland local levels, on a structure of feasible projects. This is true for major programmes whetherthey concern teacher training, the supply and use of new text books or the introduction or use of newmedia. They control, or are in close contact with, the administration at regional and local levelsand institutions through administrative staffs, inspectors and school directors. The formulation andimplementation of plans depends on these ,?irectors and on the quality of their linkage with the twosubordinate levels. It is clear that senior administrators in the line directorates must understandplanning and be able to do it. The services directors and the director of the budget work closelywith the line directors and integrate their planning with them.If all directorates and administration at its four levels are involved in planning, what arethe functions of the planning unit at the central professional level in the ministry of education?Four major functions may be distinguished in relation to the preparation and evaluation ofaggregate plans:(a)the quantitative and qualitative diagnosis of educational servicesand the identification of the resource implications, and of alterna-tives involved in giving effect to defined goals (e. g. raising of theage of compulsory school attendance by one year);(b)calculation of total educational expenditure on the basis of politicaldirectives and formulating alternatives for educational enrolmentprogrammes within the plan or budget period. This means thecosting of total educati,Inal enrolment programmes in terms of in-vestment and recur! (.1it expenditure, and discussion of proposals 8 5 Administrative aspects of educational planning with the ministry of economic planning and other bodies in orderthat they should be consistent with availabilities of finance, ofreal resources, and with national employment needs andpossibilities;(c)ensuring the consistency in terms of finance, real resources andphasing of the programmes to meet the resource requirementsimplied by the enrolment programmes or by changes in the qualityof education: teacher supply, building, equipment, materials andbooks, food and health facilities, transport;(d)following through the implementation of programmes which havebeen decided.Three conditions for successful work may be mentioned. First, in undertaking aggregate diagnosisand plan formulation, that the planning unit should have access to regular information flows fromthe regional and local levels of the educational system, other directorates, the national statisticaloffice, universities and other bodies; this information concerns pupils, teachers, buildings, financeand all the other matters necessary for planning. Second, that the planning unit should co-operatewith the line and service directorates in helping them to draw up programmes which are feasible,having regard to (i) the over-all manpower and financial constraints; (ii) the necessary preliminarywork at the project level undertaken regionally and locally and by institutions. Third, that the direc-tor of the planning unit should have adequate communication with all directorates 1/ within theministry and with the relevant bodies outside the ministry.If the central level is primarily concerned with macro-planning and administration, theregional and local levels are equally important in the formulation of plans and more important intheir implementation on the ground. In England, for example, 146 local education authorities withresponsibilities for populations ranging from 30 thousand to 4 million draw up the detailed plans foreducation under the supervision of the locally-elected bodies. Planning at the central (ministry ofeducation and science) level is concerned with such matters as total finance for the school and uni-versity system, teacher supply, national programmes for change in education, improvement ofeducational standards, research. In France, which has a greater degree of direct control by thecentral government, work by the regional authorities on the carte scolaire, and in a number of otherinstitutional forms, is vital in preparing the aggregate proposals for investment in new educationalinstitutions and in implementing them once the plan has been adopted at the national level and moneyhas been made available. 1/ In the chart, the director of planning works to the director-generalof education but is hierarchically equal to the other directors in theministry. This is a sensitive question and many solutions are adoptedin practice. 8680 The nature of the educational planning process The regional and local authorities provide the 'bricks and mortar' for the central planningof programmes by their planning of projects and carrying them out. Here is the Achilles heel ofaggregate educational planning. If the national plan is not directly and realistically related to thetotal of regional and local requirements for change it will be impossible to implement. In otherwords, regional and local educational administrators must have undertaken a great deal of prelimin-ary work and discussion, in co-operation with all those responsible for the different practical stepsof organizing new institutions or changing existing ones, in order that lots of feasible projects canadd up at national level to a feasible programme. The machinery must also be adequate so thatfinance is promptly available and contracts made and carried out once the green light shines fromthe capital.Administrators at the regional and local levels require planning skill. Project identification,costing and detailed organization require experience and training. It is not only technical skill indefining detailed educational objectives, assembling data, preparing projects; it is also politicalskill, since the location and character of educational institutions is a matter of intense interest formany different groups. Thus while the total financial and resource limits and a variety of educationalcriteria for regional and local development will be indicated by the central authorities, the detailedworking out of development will be undertaken regionally and locally. This is a difficult and time-consuming task.When it comes to implementation of programmes, speed, money flows and a structure ofregional and local agreement (a political function) are essential. The improved techniques for pro-gramme implementation, programmed budgeting and critical path analysis depend on this structureof preliminary regional and local work. It is a matter of project preparation, arriving at the appro-priate decisions and implementing them.The fourth or institutional/on-the-job level concerns the headmasters, teachers, pupils andinspectors, who are the link between the centre and the educational institution. At this level thestanding plans concerning what is taught, and how it is taught (time-tables, methods, books) areapplied and reforms introduced. Here is a major repository of wisdom, of teachers, directors,inspectors, pupils and parents in relation to reform; the administrative problem is to mobilize it.It is the place where all educational administration, in both its quantitative and qualitative aspects,is focused.In some countries there is more freedom available for headmasters and teachers to innovate,amend their standing plans, than in others. Since the main question underlying education and its plan-ning is to determine the purposes of education in the light of the needs of society, here at the 'grassroots' is the level where proposals for change may be discussed and tested.If, as we have seen, planning is done by administrators, together with their other tasks(organizing, assembling resources, supervising, controlling) it is an expertise the use of which isnot confined to the planning unit at the central level, where four or five key persons are normally 8781 Administrative aspects of educational planning identified (planning officer, assistant planning officer, statistician, accountant, architect). The linedirectorates and services directorates, regional officers and (where appropriate) local officers mustbe skilled in it. Educational planning officers are required in the cabinet of the minister and in theeconomic planning organization.Special attention requires to be given to the introduction of a planning structure at the fourlevels for the reform of education. Both quantitative and qualitative planning depend for their im-plementation on the understanding and support of the administrative and teaching staffs, the pupilsand the public.It is therefore necessary that personnel divisions of ministries of education should deviseintensive programmes of training in planning in the country and abroad for administrators 1/ andthat the ministry should take the necessary steps in organizing research and discussion to involvemass participation at the four levels in plan preparation and implementation. ConclusionsThe educational planning process and 'good' administration are identical. Educational planning is theforward-looking part of educational administration and the means by which administration can becomemodernized, in the sense of responding more effectively to the needs for change. It makes a moreuseful contribution according to the extent to which (a) different types of plans are integrated in theaggregate plan; (b) the four levels of administration are involved in building up this structure ofplanning and in implementing it according to the lines of budgetary and educational control. Arrange-ments for quantitative planning are weak in most countries in the above sense, arrangements forthe planning of reform are weaker. However, in neither quantitative nor qualitative development is itpossible to plan the 'educational system' from one day to the next; feasible programmes and projectsat the regional level in respect of defined sub-systems already represent a useful start.Planning staff are required in greater numbers than is generally assumed, in orderto provide a backbone structure of plans for administration. Quantitative planning is a techniqueand way of looking at educational development which any reasonably intelligent administrator with 1/Administrators with the appropriate educational background makegood planners and trained planners 'parachuted in' can make goodadministrators. 8882 The nature of the educational planning process a head for figures and no fear of economics or economists can learn. 1/ But training is needed toenable him to learn it, and one of the first prerequisites for planning is an in-service and studyabroad approach to training in and information about planning. The planning of reform is a technique,educational, sociological and political, which has yet to be clearly defined. This is the responsibilityof the educational specialists at the different levels of administration and research. For both types ofplanning, which need to be closely meshed, it should be borne in mind that planning at the four levelsis a technical, but also a secretarial and negotiating task. It covers a wide range of actions rangingfrom clarification of goals to fixing day-to-day schedules. It requires new techniques such as PERTand programmed budgeting so as to render programmes, projects and reform of standing plans,more effective in preparation and execution. It is part of good forward-looking administration. 1/ Y. Dror, Specialists vs. generalists, a miss-question, RandCorporation, Santa Monica, 1968. 8983 Part IICase studies of the relationship betweenplanning and administration FUNCTIONAL ANALYSTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANISATION OFEDUCATIONAL PLANNING: THE CASE OF FRANCE by Raymond Poignant IntroductionThe originality of economic and social planning in FranceThe origin of French planning dates back to January, 1946, with the creation of the Officeof the Commissioner-General for the Plan, responsible for preparing the first plan for therestoration and modernisation of the French economy, at that time ruined by the cumulative effectsof the great economic crisis of the nineteen-thirties and the Second World War.in 1970 the Fifth French Economic and Social Plan (1966-1970) will be completed and workon the preparation of the Sixth Plan (1971-1975) is already well under way. French experience inthis field is therefore now relatively long.It is no doubt, from some aspects, paradoxical, in a country where economic decisionsstill largely depend on the decisions of private business, to speak of 'national development plans ';it can nevertheless be said, objectively, that French planning remains a living reality, fairlyclosely integrated, as we shall see, in French administrative life, and, similarly, in politicallife, since the Plan is debated at length in Parliament, and, for example, the President of theRepublic was able to say, on the occasion of the Fifth Plan, that its execution was 'an ardentnational obligation'.According to the definition of Pierre Masse, former Commissioner-General for the Plan,French planning '... is the search for a middle way, reconciling attachment to liberty and indivi-dual initiative with a common orientation of development'On the basis of this definition, a contrast could be drawn between 'imperative' planningand French planning, which might be called purely 'indicative '. In practice, however, this con-trast must be qualified; it is no doubt true enough from the legal point of view, but it is much lessso in fact:in the first place, what is called 'imperative' planning always leaves a certain numberof hazards in existence, inherent in any human enterprise of this kind; and secondly, the FrenchPlans are a complex combination of decisions and forecasts, constituting something quite differentfrom mere 'indications'. 93 Administrative aspects of educational planning According to the definitions given in successive Planning Acts, the Plan constitutes:- the framework of investment programmes;- the guidelines for economic development and social progress.In other words it includes:- economic growth targets, the achievement of which will be sought ,in particular, by appropriate investments;- social policy targets;- general policy directives, which the Government must follow in orderto overcome the various constraints and reach the targets set.One of the difficulties of this planning is obviously the existence of businesses with rela-tively autonomous powers of decision on whom the Plans are not legally binding; nevertheless,the Plan, in so far as it constitutes a gigantic market survey, has an undoubted operational valuesince it guides business policy and determines government policy.The First Plan (1947-1953) was a sector plan limited to basic industrial activities.Starting from the Second Plan (1954-1957) French planners began to set aggregate growth targets,and to include in these targets all economic and social activities including the development of theeducation system. PART ITHE CENTRAL PLANNING AGENCIES; THEIR FUNCTIONS AND RELATIONSA .THE INSTITUTIONS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE CENTRAL PLANNINGAGENCIESFigure No. 1 shows the structure of these institutions and their main responsibilities.(a) The InstitutionsThe structure of these institutions seems somewhat complicated; it is essentially explained by thefact that the Office of the Commissioner-General for the Plan was designed from the outset as afairly 'lightweight' agency for leadership, coordination and the preparation of political judgments;for this reason, the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance has retained an important role inthe preparatory studies for the Plan and in its execution (role of INSEE and the Directorate of Fore-casting).Furthermore, the research agencies directly concerned with planning, or created to meetits needs, are themselves somewhat disparate (cf. Figure No. 1). The structure of these researchagencies moreover raises difficult problems which have not been properly solved; should specialisedinstitutes be developed, should there be more research contracts? How can the whole be effectivelycoordinated? 9486 Fipizre'.structure or central planning Administrative aspects of educational planning The greatest originality of these structures is the existence in the Office of theCommissioner-General for the Plan of a complex group of ( 'horizontal' and 'vertical') modernisa-tion commissionsl/ in which the work is done in common by:- experts from the central planning services and Ministries ,- representatives of employers' groups,- trade union representatives.The 'vertical' Commissions include the Commission responsible for setting the targetsand assigning the resources for the School and University Plan discussed below.(b) The basic functions1.Basic economic information- perfecting economic and social information (development of nationalstatistical services),- establishment of national accounts.2.

Coordination of the setting of sector targets4. Permanent supervision of the consistency of sector targets with thefundamental equilibria of the Plan at the various stages of its formu-lation:- equilibrium of supply and demand for manpower,- general economic equilibrium (equilibrium of production and consump-tion, input-output tables).- equilibrium of exports and imports ,- equilibrium of saving and investment ,- equilibrium of public income and public expenditure.5. The preparation of choices and political judgments at the different stagesin the preparation of the Plan.6. Coordination and supervision of execution:- supervision of investments of the public and private sector,- participation in the elaboration of annual budgets,- progress reports.B. THE CENTRAL PLANNING AGENCIES AND THE POLITICAL: SOCIALAND ECONOMIC WORLD(a) The central planning agencies and the political authoritiesThis is a fundamental problem in a democracy, which is not easy to solve because of the necessaryimportance of the role of technicians.1/ The structure of which has certain resemblances with that ofPlanning Ministries in Socialist countries. 9688 Functional analysis and administrative organizationof educational planning: the case of France The solution to the problem of 'democratic planning' has been sought:- in the permanent supervision and choice of the government in thesuccessive technical stages of the elaboration of the Plan;- in Parliamentary supervision and vote at two stages; vote on themajor options of the Plan and vote on the final detailed Plan (cf. Table 1).- by confining the technicians to the role of proposing and preparing thechoices.(b) The central planning agencies and the other authoritiesRelations between the Office of the Commissioner-General for the Pian and the Ministry of Financehave been settled by a division of competence which experience has proved to be satisfactory, in sofar as, in the words of a Finance Minister , the budget is the faithful servitor. of the Plan. 'Relations with other Ministerial departments are conducted on the following bases:- the Office of the Commissioner-General has no administrative functionsand therefore does not compete with the other authorities;- the specialists from the various authorities join in the work of the moder-nisation commissions (sector planning) within their competence, and mostfrequently lead the work;to cope with these new tasks (participation in the preparation of a sectorplan and execution of the Plan) the different Ministries have had to createand develop planning services and adapt their working methods accordingly.(c) The Plan and management and labour organisationsFrom the beginning of French planning the need for a large participation of management and labourhas been recognised in the modernisation commissions; this participation lies solely in the tech-nical field (role of experts).Regional reform and the related decentralisation of planning should result in extendingthis participation to regional level; (Regional consultative bodies, the 'C.O.D.E.R. ' , havealready been created with the Fifth Plan).CONCLUSIONThe success of a planning system of the type established in France depends on a whole series offactors:- Political determination:(is it or is it not desired to define publicly anddemocratically the common development aims and to achieve them?)- the acceptance of the system by the traditional authorities and their adaptability to the new tasks (need for prudent and progressive action bythe central planning agencies);- the desire for participation on the part of the leaders of social and economic life (trade unions etc.);- the high quality of the technicians responsible for leading and coordinatingall this work. 97 Table 1.Administrative aspects of educational planning Major options of the IVth and Vth French plansI.

Functional analysis and administrative organizationof educational planning: the case of France PART TTTHE FUNCTIONS AND ORGANISATION OF THE PLANNING SER1'IC7ES OFTHE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH THECENTRAL PLANNING AGENCIESAs already indicated, the development aims of the French education system have been studied sincethe Second Plan in the context of planning work as a whole and integrated in the Planning Art passedby Parliament. The Office of the Commissioner-General for the Plan, however, publishes, inaddition to the Planning Act, the much more detailed report of the School and University Commission.A. THE RESPECTIVE COMPETENCE OF THE OFFICE OF THE COMMIS-SIONER-GENERAL FOR THE PLAN AND THE MINISTRY OFEDUCATION(a)The content of the School and University Plan and the multiple levelsand types of decision affecting educationThe detailed report published by the Office of the Commissioner-General on the occasion of theFifth Plan included:1.Theuantitative tat.lets for the development of the education system,at all levels, during the period of the Plan. These targets are set inthe light, as far as possible, of all the factors which influence thedevelopment of the system:- population,- social demand,manpower requirements,- structural reform of the education system (organisation and lengthof studies, etc.)- certain qualitative improvements (reduction of the pupil/teacherratio, etc...).2.The material investments necessary to achieve these targets (numberof new places to be created); the volume of investment finance is estab-lished on the basis of standardised unit costs;3.A study of the administrative, financial and technical measuresnecessary to implement the investments as early and as cheaply aspossible;4.A study of the desirable trend of the teaching body, and of the possibi-lities of ensuring the corresponding recruitment, with recommendationsfor the measures to be taken in case of difficulty;5.Various studies on social measures for student aid, school transport,etc. , accompanied by conclusions for action.A_progamme of studies and research which it would be desirable toundertake in preparation for future Plans. The reading of this documentmay seem to leave certain major problems still in the dark, such as:-I he trend of the content of studies and teaching methods,the trend of current expenses and costs , etc . 9991 Administrative aspects of educational planning Before passing judgment on this point, it is as well to recall that the process of elaboratingand executing the plan calls for a series of decisions which are very different:- in their level; from Parliament and the Council of Ministers to theCouncils of local authorities and education establishments;in their nature: some affecting major financial options, others affectingincreasingly specific quantitative or qualitative targets.Tt is neither possible nor desirable to include all types of decision concerned in the samedocumenty; at the level of the Office of the Commissioner-General only ove -all decisions arestudied and formulated; they include , moreover, usually by implication, a whole series of otherdecisions, particularly of a qualitative nature, taken at other levels, and especially within theMinistry of Education itself. For example, the reform of curricula and timetables, methods ofteaching mathematics, physics, etc. , are important problems, but problems which cannot hetackled within the Office of the Commissioner-General; the various consequences of the decisionsof the Ministry of Education in the educational field are taken into account subsequently, in dis-cussing building standards, teacher requirements, etc.The content of the report on the plan may, of course, evolve according to the division ofcompetence established between the Office of the Commissioner-General and the Ministry ofEducation.Tn any event, it might be thought. that the absence of any planning of current expenditureforms a serious gap in the report: on the education plan. It is true that the projections of therational accounts which form the basis of the economic: plan, and the tables relating to generalequilibria, include the trend of current expenditure on education, but the corresponding studiesare made outside the Planning Commission in an Inter-Ministerial Working Party and theirresults are not published 2/. It will, however., he noted that the working out of a more thoroughplanning of current expenditure is a problem of the general policy of planning public services,which extends beyond the scope of education and cannot be settled from this point of view alone.It may be hoped that the new work on the rationalisation of budget choices (RCF3) now being donein the Directorate of Forecasting max' lead to progress in this field.(b) The predominance of the office of the Commissione-General for thePlan in the economic and financial aspects of the education planAs the custodian of the internal consistency of the Plan and of financial equilibrium the Office ofthe Commissione-General has competence to study and propose to the political authorities themajor options of the Plan (the option between investment and consumption, productive investments, 1/ This practice is not followed by any country which has a planning system.2/ These studies are, moieover, in their present state, still too summary;they provide a reliable order of magnitude for the trend of this expenditure,btu not a helpful instrument for selecting the options of the education plan. Functional analysis and administrative organizationof educational planning: the case of France collective investments, housing, the distribution of collective investments, etc.). Thanks to theover-all view of the possible economic future given by the 'reference outline' 1/ and its successivevariants, the Office of the Commissioner-General, subject to the decisions of the political authori-ties, thus sets the pattern of the financial effort which seems necessary for education and trainingin the context of the Plan.The level of this expenditure is not fixed at one go, but ,like the rest of the Plan, bysuccessive approximations, in proportion as the various constituents of the Plan can be specified:- in the first phase of the establishment of the reference outline (end1963-beginning 1964 for the Fifth Plan), the technicians of the Officeof the Commissioner-General, INSEE and the Directorate ofForecasting of the Ministry of Finance, act practically on their own, buton the basis of general instructions issued by the government; nevertheless,in view of the capital importance of the figures in the reference outline,they associate the Rapporteurs-General of certain Commissions withtheir work, even at this stage; this is the case with the Education Plan:- during the phase of setting the major targets of the Plan (July 1964),light is thrown on the proposals of the Commissioner-General by a pre-liminary opinion, supported by figures, of the School and UniversityCommission at that stage, and although this is still an internal procedureof the Office of the Commissioner-General, the Ministry of Educationcontributes to the preparation of this preliminary opinion through itsnumerous representatives on the Commission, and in particular, by the studies which it submits to the Commission;- in the phase of the allocation (end 1964) of the block vote for capital equip-ment appropriations - which, in practice , means thenumber of new places to be created, which will result in the appropriations for runningcosts - the Commissioner-General initiates proposals, and it is for theMinister of Education, if appropriate, to challenge them with the PrimeMinister for his arbitration.Experience shows that, in the event of arbitration, the figures prepared in the Office ofthe Commissioner-General, and his staff on the one hand and between the Chairman and theRapporteur-General of the Commission, on the other, are fairly generally accepted by the PrimeMinister, whose decisions are obviously subject to the same constraints, from the point of view ofthe consistency of the Plan, as the proposals of the Commissioner-General, This indicates theimportance of the outline sketch and in general, the predominant role of the Office of theCommissioner-General in connection with financing.This perfectly natural predominance of economists in decisions affecting the financing ofeducation has not been incompatible with a large expansion of capital expenditure on schools anduniversities, and the inseparable current expenditure: 1/ Pre luninary draft of the Plan established at the beginning of the prepara-tory work by the central planning services, especially through rho mediumof projections of the national accounts. 93 Administrative aspects of educational planning in the course of the Fourth Plan (1962-1965) in the context of an over-allgrowth rate of collective investments of 50 per cent over 1961 (cf. TableNo. 1), the Ministry of Education benefited from super-priority (growthrate = 90 per cent); in this way, the investment expenditure of theMinistry of Education should have gone up, under the Plan, from 0.62per cent of the Gross National Product (GNP) in 1961 to about 1 per centof the GNP in 1965 1/ ;- in the course of the Fifth Plan (1966-1970) owing to the relatively highlevel reached by school and university investments in 1965, they weregiven no special priority, but they will again increase between 1965 and1970 at the average rate for public utility services, i.e. 54 per cent to55 per cent (see Table No. 1), a rate still well above the forecast growthof the GNP (27 per cent to 28 per cent); in this way, the amount of schooland university investments should rise to about 1.1 per cent to 1.2 per centof GNP in 1970, that isto say, the highest level of all industrialisedcountries.(c) The educational competence of the Ministry of EducationIn any event, the Ministry of Education remains the 'technical' agency responsible for the nationaleducation policy and, in principle, retains full authority, within the context of Government andParliamentary decisions ,in such fields as:- structural reforms of the education system at all levels;- fixing curricula and timetables,- organisation of examinations, etc.These decisions , however, must first be submitted to the education councils / and tothe Higher Council of National Education 3/.Furthermore, it is the Ministry which is responsible for the execution of the educationplan (creation of new establishments , recruitment and training of the teaching staff , etc.), thoughunder the supervision of thc: Comntissione-General for the Plan, especially on the occasion ofthe elaboration of successive budgets.(d) The inter-relations between the economic and financial aspects andthe educational aspects of the Education PlanWhile it is possible, in theory, to distinguish the economic and financial responsibilities from thespecifically educational responsibilities in establishing the education plan, there are in fact veryclose inter-relations between the different aspects of the plan. 1/ In fact ,they scarcely exceeded 0.85 per cent owing to administrativedifficulties in the use of credits.2/At Directorate level.3/A recent reform of the Higher Council of National Education has modifiedits membership and given a larger place to the representatives of parentsand of economic activity; in particular, the Commissioner-General for thePlan becomes an ex officio member of the Council. 102 Functional analysis and administraive organizationof educational planning: the case of France It might be thought that the 'education policy' proposed by the Minister of Education andaccepted by the Government and Parliament, (extension of compulsory full-time schooling from14 to 16, etc.), was binding on the Commissioner-General and the Minister of Finance and wouldbe enough by itself to determine the level of expenditure to be included in the Plan. In practice,the example of the extension of compulsory schooling to 16 which, under the Ordinance of6 January 1959, came into application in 1967 ,shows that educational reforms of any real magni-tude are not feasible unless they can be financed; but, in spite of the super-priority (plus 90 percent) given to appropriations for education under the Fifth Plan (1962-1965) ,it proved impossible,in the light of the preparatory work for the Fifth Plan, to set up by 1967 the whole network offirst cycle secondary schools, which conditions both the general adoption of compulsory full-timeschooling at the age of ten, and, in this context, the full application of the reform of the firstcycle of secondary schooling 1/.In any event ,if economic and financial imperatives may lead to the phasing in time of theintroduction of educational reforms, the responsibility for the educational concept of these reformsrests with the Minister of Education; this does not mean, moreover, that 'education policy' is anextraneous element of the national development plan, on the contrary, it is a key factor, both fromthe economicoint of view ( manpower trainin ) and from the socialoint of view (im rovinthegeneral cultural level of the population, democratisation of access to extended education, etc.);under the principle of the specialisation of competence, it is natural that responsibility for ft-ispolicy, within the context of government and Parliamentary decisions ,should rest with the com-petent technical authority, the Ministry of Education.But from another angle, the Commissioner-General for the Plan is concerned with thedevelopment of the education system, on all matters affecting vocational and technical educationat the different levels, and everything related to manpower policy. In this field, therefore, thesetting of the quantitative development targets has h'igherto been a responsibility of the Commissionsof the Office of the Commissioner-General for the Plan, as will be seen below. Knowledge of thesedifferent targets should inform the Ministry of Education not only of the volume of the differentstreams of students, but of the structural reforms to be undertaken. For example, the recognitionof the need for personnel with a 'short' higher training which emerged from the forecasting work(1978) of the Manpower Commission of the Office of the Commissioner-General was one of thedecisive reasons for the creation of the University Institutes of Technology. 1/ The complete network of first-cycle schools can be set up only by virtueof the achievements under the Fifth Plan, that is to say , around 1972. 103 Administrative aspects of educational planning The 'qualitative' aspects of vocational and technical training, that is to say , reforms intraining methods, are not normally discussed in the modernisation commissions, but the permanentstaff of the Office of the Commissioner-General follow up these questions and are consulted whendecisions are prepared.In the last analysis ,the magnitude of the changes which have been made in the French edu-cation system at the end of the nineteen-fifties and in the following decade have conferred growingimportance on successive school and university plans; they will no longer be limited to definingthe expansion of education in the traditional context, but will be the instrument for the applicationof educational reforms andto a by no means negligible extent, the occasion for defining themmore fully in the light of the concrete difficulties disclosed by the preparation of the Plan.As in all human undertakings, it must be recognised that the real distribution of respon-sibilities between the Office of the Commissioner-General for the Plan and the Ministry of Educa-tion is linked, in spite of the officially established legal relationships, to the personality andworking methods of the responsible chiefs concerned; the Minister and his heads of service, theCommissioner-General for the Plan, the Chairman and Rapporteur-General of the EducationCommission for the Plan, etc.; in this way, within a legal context theoretically unchanged sincethe Second Plan, the real burden of responsibility may shift one way or,the other.B.

Administrative aspects of educational planning (a) Knowledge of the situationKnowledge of the situation in education at the end of the current Plan, which consilituirthe necessary basis for the preparation of the subsequent Plan ,covers a wide variety of questions.and this task is naturally divided among a number of services.1.Statistics on the education system (present position and trends)enrolment statistics(numbers, streams, enrolment ratio, repeaters , graduates, etc.) and sl:ati sti rs of the teaching body(within the competence of the Central Statistics Service of theMinistry of Education);- statistics of material facilities (number of establishments, classes,areas, rate of occupation of premises, obsolescence rate, miscel-laneous facilities, etc.) (competence of the Directorate of Equipmentof the Ministry of Education) .- statistics and analysis of expenditure and costs (Budget Service andPlanning Service, Directorate of Equipment) 1./studies of educational psychology, and problems oi' guidance;analysis of the behaviour of different social groups motivations ofcareer choices, guidance methods, etc..

an institutionalisedprocess for reflection and decision-making at national levelThe characteristic and essential value of the French planning set-up is that it affords the frameworkfur a permanent decision-making process which, from one Five-Year Plan to the next, determinesor orients, after wide discussion, the general evolution of the education system in France.The process of decision associates the general social , economic andfinancial compet.encesof the Commissione -General for the Plan with the technical competences of the Ministry of Educa-tion in accordance with a fairly loEteial division of responsibilities, the value of which has beenproved by experienceNaturallN ,this planning organisation can be criticised for discharging some of thefunctions described above 2/ no doubt somewhat imperfectly;

It will benoted that the preliminary report of a joint Working Party of the Office of the Commissioner-General _V The question of decentralisation of planning to regional level and estab-lishment level is also a very important subject for reflection.

The Government of India Resolution of 14 July 1964,appointing the last Education Commission (1964-1966) under the Chairmanship of Dr. D.S. Kothari,for instance, draws attention to the fact that 'a wide and distressing gulf continues to persistbetween thought and action ...illThis paper is concerned with two major criticisms of Indian educational ;planning.One is that the educational administrator has on the whole neglected the qualitative improve-ment of education in favour of its expansion. The other is that both planning and implemen-tation in the field of education in India have been highly centralized. Its only other limitedinterest is briefly to suggest a hypothesis for the slowness of change both in the structure andfunctioning of educational administration in the country, despite frequent identification of theself-same major problems in this area.First of all, it is necessary to say a few words about the general context of educa-tional planning in India. Education in India is essentially a State subject, though certainmatters such as 'co-ordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher edu-cation or research and scientific and technical institutions' are a Central responsibility.This means that each of the seventeen States is free to develop an educational system of itsown. This explains the great diversity of educational structures , instructional media,curriculum content and examination practices in the country. Universities and other institu-tions of higher learning are generally autonomous and function independently both of theCentre and the State Governments. At present , there are seventy-two universities and some3,000 colleges imparting university level education. Enrolments in the third level institu-tions ire in the neighbourhood of two million and the number of teachers more than 100,000. 1/ Education Commission (1964-1966) Report, p. 591. 113104 Administrative aspects of educational planning Apart from State Governments and the universities, local authorities also have majoreducational responsibilities. Municipal authorities and Panchayati Raj j/ institutions areassociated with the management of primary and sometimes secondary education in severalparts of the country.Equally important is the role of voluntary or private organizations in the managementof education. The following table gives information regarding the extent of private enterprisein education.

The Indian National Congress, for instance, had set up in 1938 a NationalPlanning Committee for drawing up a national plan for social and economic development underthe Chairmanship of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. The National Committee had appointed twocommittees - one for general education and the other for technical education and developmentof research. Unfortunately, the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 led to the arrests ofmany national leaders and as such the work of the Committee could not make much headway. 1/ The Panchayati Raj Institutions are agencies of Government andadministration at the local level. 1H10d Administrat:ve aspects of educationalplanning in India On the Government side, the task of preparing the first comprehensive plan of educa-tion in the country was undertaken by the Central Advisory Board of Education, the highestconsultative body for education at the national level. Between 1938 and 1943 the Board appoin-ted a number of committees to report and make recommendations on different aspects of edu-cation. The analyses and recommendations of these committees were used towards he pre-paration of a comprehensive plan of educational development for the country in 1944. Thisdocument, popularly known as the 'Sargent Report' - after the name of the then EducationCommissioner to the Government of India ,Sir John Sargent - covers a period of forty years,that is from 1.945 to 1935. Although, because of its many limitations, the plan was neveraccepted for implementation, it is widely recognized to be in many ways the most well-knitand comprehensive educational plan prepared so far.The First Plan was inaugurated in 1961 and covered the period 1931 to 1935. The Planlacked unity and did not very much reflect any clear order of priorities. Ir. was largely anassortment of the post-war educational programmes of different states at that time.The Second Plan covered the period 1936 to 1960. The Plan was designed amongother things to reach certain targets of expansion of educational facilities at differentlevels, and paid some attention to the question of improving the salary scales of teachers.Here again, the governing factor was more the availability of resources rather than theachievement of predetermined objectives.The Third Plan covered the period 1961 to 1965 and tried to provide for needs bothof expansion as well as of consolidation. As usual the resources constraint again turned outto be a major limiting factor.On account of a number of serious economic and financial difficulties , the launchingof the Fourth Plan could not take place until after l\\larch 1969. During the three interveningyears, that is , 1966, 1967, and 11163, planning at The Cern re and in the States was in -heform of annual plans only.Plan achievementsOne important achievement of educational planning during the last two decades or so has beenthe upprecedented expansion of education at all levels. The total enrolment at all stages ofeducation in 1950-1951 was 24 million; in 1965-1966 the figure stood at TO million. This givesan average annual growth rate of 7.4 per cell*. The following table gives some of The detailsof this growth: 1151 0 the Education Commission 11904-1966).

The Constitutional Directiveenjoining upon the State the responsibility to provide free and compulsory education for allchildren up to the age of 14 is still a distant goal and according to the forecast made by theKothari Commission may not be actually reached for another fifteen years or more. At thesecondary stage (post-14) not more than 18 to 19 per cent of the children in the relevant age 117108 Administrative aspects of educational planning group are estimated to he enrolled as yet. At the university stage the proportion is only about2.5 to 3 per cent against the estimated proportion of 5 to 10 per cent in countries such as thernited Kingdom and France and of over 40 per cent in the U.S.A. However, in aggregateterms the Indian system of education has already become the biggest among all the countriesin membership of the United Nations. The total enrolments are of the order of 70 million;and the number of institutions and teachers of the order of 500,000 and over 2 millionrespectivelyEqually phenomenal has been the increase in educational expenditure. In 1946-1947,the total educational expenditure in British India (i.e. excluding Indian States, for whichcomparable data are not available) was Hs. 577 million, that is an expenditure of about.Rs. 1.8 per person. At the end of the Third Plan period (1901-1965), the total expenditure oneducation was estimated at Rs. 0,000 million, or approximately Rs. 12 per person (at currentprices). This means a cumulative increase of 11..7 per cent' The total educational expenditurewas 1.2 per cent of the national income in 1951. It rose to 1.9 per cent at the end of the FirStPlan,per cent at. the end of the Second and 2.9 per cent at the end of the Third. It isinteresting to wne that the rate of growth of the educational expenditure in the first threePlans is 2.2 times the rate of growth of national income (at current prices).However, the proportion of national income devoted to education in this country isstill small as compared to the proportion in the advanced countries. For instance, Japan,are spending considerably more than 6 per cent of theft GNP on education,Which is twice as much as the proportion spent in India. But it should not be forgotten thatin countries with a low level of income the disposable surplus is exceedingly small, and assuch the same level of expenditure in poor countries signifies a much greater effort topromote education than in the more affluent economies.Has 'quality' been neglected?With this record of educational development as the background the question whether or notthe implementation of educational plans in the country has been at least reasonably efficient.and satisfactory is now ripe for consideration.If a critical student of 1he Indian economy were to pronounce a judgment on thehealth and behaviour of the Indian economy since 1951 he would inescapably have to make astudy of the actual annual growth rates against those targeted. Tt is only such comparisonover a number of years that has revealed a continuing gap between promise and performance.For instance, in the Second Plan, the national income increased by 3.7 per cent against thePlan target of 5 per cent, Tn the first three years of the Third Plan the increase was only3.1 per cent against a target of 5.4 per cent. Much of the criticism against the formulationrmd implementation of economic planning in this country derives essentially from this gapbet,wecn the 'targetand the reality, the latter always falling short of the former. Let us nowemploy the same methodology in judging the performance of education.11810J Administrative aspects of educationalplanning in India Some statistical data concerning the growth of education since 1950 were presentedin Table 2. Let us look again at the growth of education since 1960-1961. The enrolment inclasses I-V increased from 35 million in 1960-1961. to 56 million in 1968-1969; in classesVI -VIII from 7 million to 13 million; in classes IX-XI from 3 million to about 7 million; andat the university stage (for arts ,science and commerce faculties) from 0.74 million to1.69 million. The admission capacity in engineering and technological institutions increasedfrom 14,000 to 25,000 at the degree level and from 26,000 to 48,600 at the diploma level.It is only in the case of the provision of compulsory free education that performancehas not been so good. Even here, however, it has been estimated that by 1968-1969, 63 percent of the children in the age group 6 to 14 were at school. Perhaps the only other majorsector in which performance has been extremely disappointing is that of adult education. Acareful study of the financial provisions for and physical targets of adult education in theFive-Year Plans of different States will show, however, that due to various difficulties, par-ticularly social and economic as revealed by field experience, it has not been possible to ac-cord any high priority to this particular programme in educational planning so far. Consideringthe picture as a whole, there is no doubt that as compared to that of economic planning, therecord of education has been distinctly impressive. Why should not this be an occasion, there-fore, to congratulate the educational administrator?It will perhaps be promptly replied that this growth of education does not justify anyspecial bouquets to the educational administrator because much of the present expansion wasinevitable and would have taken place in any case, planning or no planning. The demographicpressures, the upsurge of democracy, the promises made by different political parties duringthe national struggle for independence, the claims of the under-privileged sections of thecommunity for social and economic justice and the global situation as a whole have all beenpowerfully on the side of expansion.But in that case was not planning really redundant? Presuming that it was why shouldthe educational administrator be blamed, even partly , for what has happened?Here attention is likely to be drawn to the fact that such rapid expansion in enrolmentshas put a severe strain on the physical facilities and teaching personnel. In such a situation, theadministrator 's preoccupation should have been with quality. What actually happened, on theother hand, was that in many State Plans of education there was hardly any recognition of theimportance of quality programmes , such as improvement of salary scales and service con-ditions of teachers; provision of adequate buildings and school equipment; improvement ofschool supervision; and development of better curricula, textbooks, reading materials andteaching techniques etc. In others , funds meant for these or similar quality programmeswere freely diverted to meet the pressures for expansion. This should have been effectivelyprevented. In other wordsif the educational administrator had not forgotten his duty by 119110 Administrative aspects of educational planning quality, standards would not have caved in the way they actually have. Attrition rates at allstages, particularly at the elementary stage, would not have been so high as at present;failure rates in different public and university examinations would have been lower and on thewhole the educational situation might have been more cheerful.A basic premise on which the present criticism of educational administration restsis that, as a result of its recent growth the quality of education has declined sharply. Is thepremise a valid one?The Kothari Commission has gone on record to say that. the number of educationaland research institutions doing work of a high standard is definitely larger today than everbefore in the history of this country. Similarly ,the number of able and promising studentsat all stages today is larger than ever before. True, the presence of an extremely largenumber of first generation learners in schools and other institutions in the country temporarilyhas put some strain on standards, but this cannot by itself be taken to mean that therefore theover-all standards have come down significantly! In the absence of scientific evidence it isdifficult to settle this controversy one way or the other.However, it must be admitted that standards of research and training in Indian institu-tions are generally not accorded any high recognition in the advanced countries. But when werethey? While collecting evidence on standards the Radhakrishnan Commission (1949) had occasionto record this:'Many of our witnesses have expressed the opinion that the averagestandards of our university teaching and examinations are low andone principal of a degree college maintained that an average graduateof an Indian university was not very much superior to a matriculateof a British universityEssentially ,the same view has been taken by the Kothari Commission:Our universities do a good deal of work which really belongs to thesecondary school and the latter in its turn does a good deal of workof the primary schools '.The fact of the matter is that the term quality as commonly used in educational dis-cussions and writings is a vague one and means different things to different people. In anymeaningful sense the term 'quality of education' must refer to the degree to which it(education) achieves the basic educational objectives. If a scientific answer has to be foundto the question whether or not the recent expansion of education has resulted in the loweringof its quality, it is first necessary to define educational objectives, then to measure theextent to which education is actually achieving them and finally to compare this extent with theextent of achievement in the pre-plan period.1/Report of the TJniversity Education Commission (December 1948 -August 1949), Vol. I, p. 84.1/ Education Commission Report, p. 41. 120111 Administrative aspects of educationalplanning in India Concerning quality-oriented programmes, it is only fair to state that consistently withthe resources position and urgent demands for expansion, due regard has invariably been givento their inclusion in many of the State Plans since 1951. The quality plea is no stranger toIndian education. in fact, one of the unique merits of the Sargent Plan was that it was a qualityplan through and through. But as was mentioned earlier, the Plan was considered to be un-inspiring and impracticable and was never accepted for implementation. As for diversion offunds from quality to expansion in certain cases, it is a moot point whether responsibilityhere belongs to the administrator or to the political decision-maker.But let us assume for the sake of argument that the quality of education has actuallygone down in recent years. In what material ways would the present situation have beendifferent if the quality of education had not deteriorated or if it had actually gone up instead?Perhaps one of the first things to be mentioned will be that the present wastage andstagnation rates so characteristic of the early stages of education would have diminishedconsiderably. But apart from other consequences , does this not mean that in that case numbersat the lower levels would have exerted an even stronger pressure at the secondary and otherlevels? This would have resulted in even higher enrolments in secondary schools and collegesand possibly in certain professional and vocational types of institutions as well.Probably another consequence would have been that failure rates in different publicexaminations would have come down and the proportions of those qualifying in the first andsecond divisions_1/ gone up. This means that in that case the number of graduates at differentvarieties would have been even larger than at present and that the average performance ofgraduates of different kinds would have been distinctly superior to their present performance.But would not, in the present social and economic circumstances of the country, sucha situation have been even more unfortunate? Considering the growing unemployment amongschool and university graduates, which in recent years has surged forward to engulf evenengineers and technicianswould not such a situation be altogether far more frustratingindividually, and far more explosive socially and politically?It might be argued that a better quality of education would have enabled school andcollege graduates not to seek or wait for employment but to create it. This is mere wishfulthinking. Nowhere and at no time in its entire history has the record of education been veryconvincing in this respect. In the main, education 's record has always been one of preparationfor employment and not one of its creation. 1/ The term 'Division' is commonly used in India to categorizesuccessful performance in the public or university examinations.For placement in the First Division a student must secure 60 percent of the total marks or more. For Second Division he mustsecure at least 45 per cent. Successful candidates securing less than45 per cent are usually placed in the Third Division. 121 Administrative aspects of educational planning One thing is clear. The charge that educational planning and administration have neg-lected quality cannot be taken at its face value. It needs a careful study.Is there too much centralization in educational planning?Apart from the alleged neglect of quality, another major criticism of educational planning in thiscountry has been its ever-increasing tendency towards centralization. The charge is that withLhe adoption of the technique of five-year plans and the creation of the Planning Commission,a good part of the authority to determine policies and priorities and to make resource alloca-tions in different fields, including education, has now shifted to the Centre. The pattern ofoutlays and priorities set by the Centre, in conjunction with the present form of Centralassistance to the States, is said to have distorted the States' own perception of their needs andpriorities.Before looking into this charge, it is important to point out that the Central Govern-ment 's interest in evolving a national system of education is much older than the Five-YearPlans or even Independence. Without going too far into the history of Centre-State relationsin the field of education, it should suffice to mention that the Central Advisory Board ofEducation (originally established in 1921, dissolved in 1923 and revived in 1.935) has alwaysinterested itself in the development of a national system of education. A reference to theSargent Plan prepared in 1944 was made earlier. In 1947, the..Central Ministry of Educationappointed a University Education Commission to consider and make recommendations inregard to different aspects of university education in the country. In 1.952, the Ministry appoin-ted a Secondary Education Commission to report on secondary education and make recom-mendations for its reorganization and qualitative improvement. The Central Government hasnot appointed any commission on primary or elementary education so far but several all-India bodies appointed by it from time to time have reported and advised on elementary educa-tion, including basic education.The last in the series of Education Commissions to be appointed by the Government ofIndia is the Education Commission (1964-1.966). The recommendations made by this Commissionwere carefully examined by the Government. in consultation with Members of Parliament, StateMinisters of Education, Vice-Chancellors of Universities, etc. and a statement on nationalpolicy on education - the first of its kind since Independence - was issued in July, 1968. Themain paragraphs of the statement relate to Free and Compulsory Education, Status, Emolu-ments and Education of Teachers , Development of Languages, Equalization of EducationalOpportunity, Identification of Talent, Work-experience and National Service, Science Educa-tion and Research, Education for .Agriculture and industry, Production of Books, T.':xaminations,Secondary Education, University Education, Part-Lime Education and Correspondence Courses,Spread of Literacy and Adult Education, Games and Sports, Education of Minorities, and theEducational Structure, in that order.122113 Administrative aspects of educationalplanning in India This continuing interest of the Centre in matters educational apart , it is a fact thatwith the establishment of the Planning Commission and the formulation and implementation offive-year plans the financial dependence of the States on the Centre has increased considerablyand reinforced the growing trend towards centralism. In many ways, however, such a develop-ment was inevitable. As pointed out by the Administrative Reforms Commission in one of itsreportsit (planning) needs to be centralized to ensure co-ordination, proper allocationof resources and full attention to national needs and objectives Such trends towardscentralization, particularly in education, have taken place in other democratic countries alsoand can by no means be said to have been entirely unforeseeable.It would be pertinent to mention at this stage that the virtual State monopoly of edu-cation as sanctioned by the Constitution also has its critics. The failure of the country todevelop a national system of education even after more than twenty years of independence isoften attributed to the fact that education is constitutionally a State subject and that the Centreis not in a strong legal position to act. Recent experience of decentralizing the control ofprimary and, in some cases , of secondary education in some of the States has also not beenuniformly very happy. Teachers ,for instance, have been critical of the new arrangementbecause according to them the main interest of the Panchayat Samities in many cases lies intransferring teachers from one place to another regardless of the educational consequences ofsuch transfers. The plea often put forward by the critics of decentralization is that if it cannotbe made a Central subject, education should at least be placed on the 'Concurrent' list.Incidentally there is one important development of which the exact significance forthe future of Centre-State relations in the field of education cannot be predicted with precisionas yet. The fact that the chairmanship of the Planning Commission was, from the first day ofits creation in 1950, vested in the Prime Minister of the Country, and the further fact that thesame political party for long was in power both at the centre and in the States , made it easyfor the Government of India to sell its advice to the States in education, as indeed in all otherdevelopmental fields. That situation has changed now. While the Prime Minister continues tobe the Chairman of the Planning Commission, the Congress lost its monolithic hegemony in thefourth General Elections held in 1967. At present, it has a majority of 44 only in the LowerHouse at the Centre (283 seats in a house of 523). The non-Congress parties are already inpower in 5 of the 17 States. In some others, though in power, the Congress majority is small.This political polarization or regrouping of political parties is likely to intensify further in theyears ahead. Some State leaders have already started a campaign for more powers to the States I/Administrative Reforms Commission, Machinery for Planning,Government of India, March, 1968, p.2. 123Lid Administrative aspects of educational planning and for larger uncommitted financial allocations from the Centre. 'Give us all the money thatwe need and then leave us alone to spend it in any way we like' seems to be a common posturesome of the State leaders are striking these days.It was mentioned above that education in India is essentially a State subject. Whetheror not educational planning in India is unduly centralized will, therefore , depend largely onwhether or not the preparation of State Plans of education is highly centralized. Insofar as theCentre is concerned, its direct responsibility in the strict sense of the term is limited to thepreparation of a relatively small educational plan in the central sector and to the co-ordinationof State education plans into the framework of some kind of a national plan. It is to the mannerof preparation of State Plans ,therefore ,that we must now turn to examine the charge of ex-cessive centralization.Anyone familiar with the preparation of State education plans can be relied upon totestify that there is very little diffusion of the 'formulating' function. State Governments havegenerally available to them the advice of working groups set up for this purpose , but there isaltogether poor communication with and feedback from the field. The defect is not peculiar tothe preparation of education plans. State planning in other developmental fields also suffersfrom the same deficiency. Chapter 5 on Implementation in the Draft Fourth Five-Year Plan(1969-1974) contains the following paragraph:'If the State plans are to succeed, their formulation in relationto physical features and resources and the institutional organiza-tions in each area is the first requirement. Development needsnot only financial resources and material inputs but personneland the right kind of institutions. This requirement has to beworked out for each operational area. The natural corollary ofbeginning to plan realistically and from the bottom is to recognizethat planning is not something that comes from outside or abovebut what each Statedistrict, locality and community does todevelop its own resources and potentialities. This emphasizes widediffusion of initiativedecision-making and participation. It alsoimplies a parallel shouldering of responsibilities'.Considering that this counsel had to be offered some eighteen years after the States had beenengaged in the formulation and implementation of educational plans and a great variety of otherplans is a sad commentary on the State planning process.It is towards remedying the same defect of excessive centralization in the formulationof educational plans that the Kothari Commission found it necessary to recommend the estab-lishment of a statutory board in each district, reorganization and strengthening of the District 1/ Draft Fourth Five-Year Plan, 1969 -1974, Planning Commission,Government of India , March, 1969, p. 104. 124113 Administrative aspects of educationalplanning in India Education Office, and delegation of enhanced administrative and financial powers to the Dis-trict Education Officer. The Commission also laid stress on the preparation of DistrictEducation Plans. The reasoning for district plans is simple and clear:'As time passes, the district will assume still greater importance.Today, a district has an average population of about 1.5 million,an enrolment of about 2,000,000, about 7,000 teachers and atotal educational expenditure of about Rs. 20 million. By 1986,the population of the average district will be about 2.5 million.Its enrolment may rise to about 500,000 with a total cadre ofabout 20,000 teachers and a total educational expenditure ofabout Rs. 125 million. All things considered, the future of develop-ment and reform lies in strengthening the district offices of theDepartment, making them service and supervision centres of allschools and retaining the State-level Directorates only for generalco-ordination and policy-making'. IThe National Seminar on Educational Planning and Administration held at Srinagarin June 1967 made similar recommendations in support of district and institutional plans.This, of course, does not mean that centralization can be entirely done away within preparing a State educational plan. To some extent, centralization is inherent in the veryconcept of planning. District and institutional plans, for example, will need co-ordinationinto the framework of the State plan. In any case, the first inescapable step for a State Govern-ment has to be the issue of a broad outline of policy within which each District authority hasto prepare its own educational programmes. For certain specific purposes, such as the pro-vision of higher education or the provision of vocational or technical education at the secondlevel, the planning can only take place at the State level.But it is one thing to practice centralization to the extent inescapable and quiteanother to exclude severely all local and institutional authorities from participation in theplanning process.Little wonder so many of the State educational plans in the past have beenpredominantly expenditure-oriented.So much about the formulation of State educational plans. What about the quality oftheir implementation? Suppose a State education plan has been prepared after taking into con-sideration the district and institutional plans , would it necessarily make a difference to theeffectiveness of the plan 's implementation? Other things being equal it should; but we alsoknow that other things are rarely equal. There is no choice but to have recourse to experienceand enquire 'How does the functioning of decentralized educational systems compare with thefunctioning of centralized systems? Is it possible to deduce any definitive propositions fromsuck, a comparison? j/ Education Commission Report, p. 261. 125 Administrative aspects of educational planning Without going into details and without identifying national systems of education, it isa safe bet that among highly centralized systems there are sonic which function efficiently andothers whose functioning is far from satisfactory. The same in all likelihood will be found tobe the case among decentralized systems , that is, there are decentralized systems ofeduca-tion which are highly efficient and others which are wasteful and unproductive.Applying to this situation the twin principles of inductive reasoning, namely. thatnothing is the cause of a phenomenon in the absence of which it nevertheless occurs, and thatnothing is the cause of a phenomenon in the presence of which it nevertheless fails to occur,there is only one conclusion to be drawn. It is that there appears to be no causal connexionbetween efficiency and the centralization-decentralization factor. The two variables appearin the main to be independent of each other.Perhaps one 's position on the centralization versus decentralization controversy islikely to be conditioned strongly by his value orientation. In many places, decentralizationhas somehow come to be identified with democracy in the popular mind. The notion is commonthat while decentralization is good, centralization is evil. But as many political analysts haveclarified ,the notion is erroneous. Decentralization by a non-democratic government, forinstance, is bound to be non-democratic. decentralization by a democratic government islikely to have some democratic characteristics, but this may not be true in every case or infull measure.Many leading political scientists are now inclined to take the view that: planning inthe sense of sonic inescapable measure of centralization is not only compatible with democracybut is today a necessary condition of its survival.The basic issue, it seems, is not whether a system of educational planning and ad-ministration is centralized or decentralized but in the context of its particular political, socialand other conditions, how to make it work or improve its efficiency. The conventional centrali-zation versus decentralization debate has a highly academic or theoretical ring about it.Some other criticisms of educational planning and administrationApart. from the two criticisms considered above, namely, neglect of quality and excessivecentralization in educational planning and implementation, there are many others roadefront time to time. It is pointed out, for instance, that. there is insufficient statistical infor-mation relating to student flows , manpower requirements etc. on which to base an educa-tional plan firmly. There is hardly any systematic evaluation or feedback once a. plan hasbeen launched. Key positions in administration are held by generalist administrators and notby specialists. There are far too many committees and senior officers who spend far too much ' of their time in attending committee meetings. The Plan working groups both at the Centre andin the States are given to completing their deliberations in hurried two to three-hour sessionswithout being able to go into important details, Project preparation is conspicuous by its126 Administrative aspects of educationalplanning in India absence and plans give little information regarding the inputs required - physical, material,financial and those relating to personnel - or of the time schedule in which to complete theindividual projects. Financial control and management are defective. Often grants are releasedlate in the year. Budget preparation is divorced from performance. The merit principle isrecognized in principle but in practice promotions are often made on the basis of seniority.Bureaucratic inertia and red tape pose difficult problems. The system of hierarchical routingdelays decision-making. On many occasions extraordinary lapses of time occur before aproblem is recognized, between the time if is recognized and a decision is taken on what todo about it; and finally between the time a decision is taken and it is actually carried out. Andso onTi cannot be denied that several of these criticisms have considerable validity. Edu-cational administrators have themselves on numerous occasions drawn attention to these andother administrative deficiencies. If the problems are so well known why cannot the necessarystructural and functional changes be introduced to improk e the functioning of the system? Tnany case, how does a system manage to survive with such serious operational deficiencies?Before attempting answers to these two questions ,it is important to remember thatsuch problems in educational administration are not peculiar io India or to the developingnations. Each one of them can be shown to exist in the developed countries as well. Theiruniversality suggests complexity, perhaps a certain intractability. Again, it is important torealize that the kind of problems mentioned above are not peculiar to education. Tn varyingdegrees they exist in all other developmental fields as well. At present, the AdministrativeReforms Commission, set up by the Government in 1965, is engaged in the monumental taskof studying public administration from all possible angles and making recommendations forits improved functioning.These being the major administrative problems in education, why is the system ofeducational administration not reorganized radically?It might be suggested that this will depend entirely on the determination of politicalleadership. When, for instance, political leaders do not merely talk a great deal about develop-ment but also give a high priority to it, a country can develop without a formal plan. Conversely,if there is no formal coMmitment to the goals and values of development on the part of thepolitical leadership, development plans no matter how carefully formulated, will have littlechance of successful implementation. Or is the main difficulty here the administrator 's lackof professional integrity? A common criticism is that even when he has serious misgivingsabout the practicability of an educational programme, for opportunistic reasons or for thoseof expediency, he often hesitates to share his doubts with his political boss. The charge maynot be entirely unfounded; but the question in that case is why the political leaders and educa-tional administrators are so lacking in their commitment to the true goals of education planning. 127118 Administrative aspects of educational planning Sociologically speaking, an organization, administrative or of any other description,always exists in the larger society. '... not only does such an organization' , as pointed outby Parsons, 'have to operate in a social environment which imposes the conditions governingthe processes of disposal and procurement, it is also part of a wider social system which isthe source of \"meaning\" legitimation, or higher level support which makes the implementationof the organization 's goal possible'. I/ In fact every organization is surrounded by a numberof overlapping environments, part in harmony and part in conflict with one another. Nogovernment is wholly free to decide on any list of priorities without taking into account theprevailing reactions of its people. Its choices are circumscribed not only by the political andsocial ideas of the time but also by the 'weltanschauung' . Now India has a culture withpluralistic values deriving from religion, language, caste, occupation, level of income and anumber of other sources and these values do not always coincide with the values of planneddevelopment. The different values and standards of the larger society impinge all the time oneducational administration creating motivational conflicts in the minds of political decision-makers and administrators. It is only in terms of such interaction between the values andstandards of development and those of the larger society which surrounds educational adminis-tration that the present gap between the formal commitment of the politician and the adminis-trator to the goals of planning and their actual performance begins to acquire the possibilityof an explanation.And how does a system of administration survive with all such operational handicaps?The answer is that educational administration, to use a perceptive term suggested by Carlson,is essentially a 'domesticated' organization. Like a domesticated animal, a domesticatedorganization is looked after by the society and does not have to struggle for survival. It i sdomesticated in the sense that its survival needs are guaranteed and as such it can take thingseasy. Such an organization may have to compete for funds but in a very limited sense only,because funds are not tied to the quality of performance.In fact, educational administration partakes in this respect many of the characteristicsof the schools it serves. It is principally because of their protected condition that schools areso slow in responding to change. Ten, fifteen or even more years may elapse before aninvention destined to spread throughout the school system puts in its first appearance even in5 to 10 per cent of the institutions. Total diffusion may take an entire generation! Schools andeducational administrators show little awareness of the fact that the knowledge of availableinventions is necessary if education is to improve and that the individuals managing and adminis-tering schools must master this knowledge. Talcott Parsons, \"Some ingredients of a general theory of formalorganization\" in Andrew W. Haplin (ed.), Administrative theory ineducation, Chicago University, 1958, p.44. 12811J Administrative aspects of educationalplanning in India One suspects that. schools and school administration are altogether having a littletoo much protection. Public schools may tend to be even more 'domesticated' than privateones! In many urban centres in India, as perhaps in some other developing countries, publicand non-government schools exist side by side. As a rule teachers often prefer to work inpublic schools because of a greater sense of security even when there are no materialdifferences in the salary scales and other important service conditions. it is well knownthat enforcement of discipline is more difficult in government institutions than in thosemanaged privately. 1VIany alert parents, on the other hand, prefer to put their wards in non-government institutions. Instances are not rare where the popularity enjoyed by a governmentinstitution serving a particular community is due entirely to the non-existence of a rivalprivate organization.How does one change the present situation, assuming of course that it is not goingto be easy? What has been India 's experience of the training and orientation of educationaladministrators for their new responsibilities? There is a prior question here. At present,there is a lot of in-breeding in educational administration. They are generally recruited fromthe ranks of teachers without any special. understanding of or familiarity with problems ofeducational administration. How does one stop this and how can the recruitment policies begeared more purposefully to the basic goals and tasks of educational planning? What is therole of research? What kind or research, evaluation and feedback are likely to he of thegreatest practical value in improving the functioning of educational administration vis-a -viseducational planning? And what precisely has been India 's experience in these areas? Theseare vital questions, but for reasons of time and space their consideration must be postponedto another occasion. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF EDUCATIONALDEVELOPMENT WITHIN GOVERNMENTALAND EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION :UGANDA by J. D. Chesswas INTRODUCTION 1.In Uganda educational administration, and within it, planning and implementation of educa-tional development, is a very complex matter both from the point of view of the formal structureand in respect of the informal contacts that 'make the system tick'. This short paper is an attemptto outline the most important aspects of each of these two interdependent elements, with a commenton the suitability or non-suitability of the structures and practices. GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE 2.The diagram annexed to this paper shows the broad structure of the government, in so faras it affects education, and of the infrastructure of the immediate administration of educationalinstitutions.3.A series of ministries, each headed by a political minister, is responsible to a cabinet ofministers, headed by the President, which is responsible to the National Assembly. The Cabinethas appointed an education sub-committee of ministers to discuss details of educational affairs. Allmatters affecting development must pass to the Cabinet through a planning commission, which ismainly constructed of ministers more directly connected with development. The Minister of Educa-tion is a member of this commission. Matters not connected with development pass directly fromministries to the Cabinet.4.All planning is co-ordinated by the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development, whichis responsible for drawing up the national development plans for presentation to the Planning Com-mission.In addition to an economic planning section it has a manpower planning section, which isvery closely involved in the over-all educational planning procedure. 131121 Administrative aspects of educational planning 5.The Ministry of Education is divided into three main parts which are responsible to theMinister through his civil service permanent secretary.(a) The finance and establishments division is mainly responsible for thecontrol of central government expenditure on education and of civilservice personnel employed in educational services. It also includes the higher education office, which deals with scholarships abroad andstudent affairs at the University of East Africa. 1/ It is headed by an under-secretary, who is responsible, inter alia, for the administra-tive and planning links between the MiniStry and the University Council,a semi-autonomous body.(b) The inspectorate is responsible for professional inspection and adviceto schools and for advising the Minister on such matters. It has close links with the National Institute of Education, which was jointly foundedby the Uganda Government and the Council of Makerere College, theUgandan College belonging to the university.(c) The schools and colleges division is responsible for planning and admini-stration of first and second-level and non-university third-level educa-tion.It has two sections, for administration and planning, under a chiefeducation officer (CEO).The planning section consists of three sub-sections under an assistant chief education officer (ACED) : (i) a senior education officer to assist with the planning process; (ii) a section for educational statistics, and (iii) an architecture and works section, whichincludes at the present time a senior education officer in charge of theI. D. A. secondary schools project.6.(a) As mentioned above, the University is controlled by a semi-autonomouscouncil and each of its constituent colleges has its own council.(b)All second-level and non-university third-level institutions are controlledby boards of governors established under rules made by the Minister ofEducation.(c)The administration of primary education is the responsibility of local andmunicipal authorities, which must follow the policies of the CentralGovernment. Under rules made by the Minister of Education each author-ity must set up an education committee with an education officer as secre-tary and executive officer.Up to the present time, such educationofficers have been seconded central government officers, belonging to theMinistry of Education. 2/ There is also a general line of responsibilityfrom the local to the central level through the Ministry of RegionalAdministration. 1/The University consists of three colleges, one in each of the East Africancountries, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. This structure is to be changed and is at present the subject of review by an independent committee.2/There are management committees for primary schools responsible tothe education committee, but their powers are limited and they are thereforenot shown on the diagram in the annex. 132 Planning and implementation of educational development: Uganda PLANNING OF EDUCATIONAL, DEVELOPMENT A The national plan7.Planning is conducted in accordance with governmental polici es, which are conveyed byministers to the civil servants concerned in their ministries. The main bodies concerned with theplanning of educational development are: (i) the manpower section of the Ministry of Planning andEconomic Development;(ii) the planning section of the Ministry of Education, and (iii) the universitycouncil.8.After consultation with ministries and departments of the East African Community which areconcerned with the employment and training of personnel and with private employers, the manpowersection of the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development draws up its projections of manpowerneeds. 1/ For this process it is advised by a manpower planning board, the main members of whichare the permanent secretaries of the ministries closely concerned with manpower affairs, employersand trade unions.9.These projections are discussed by the manpower and educational planners. In the light ofthese discussions, the latter consults the Chief Education Officer and his colleagues in the inspector-ate and the administrative section of his ministry, especially with regard to the qualitative andadministrative aspects of development. The Ministry of Regional Administration is brought into thediscussion on development of primary education, which is not directly connected with the manpowerplan. 2/ Some, at least, of the local and municipal education officers may also be consulted at thisstage.The ACEO (planning) also consults the National Housing Corporation, a para-statal body re-sponsible to the Ministry of Works, Labour and Housing 2/ with regard to physical accommodationand its costs.As a result of all these contacts, and many others not listed here, he draws up thedevelopment plan for primary, second-level and non-university third-level education, in close con-sultation with the manpower planner and referring where necessary to the officials of the Ministry ofFinance dealing with recurring and capital finance for development purposes.10.A similar procedure .is carried out by the NIakerere college council in consultation with themanpower planner and the under-secretary for finance and establishments of the Ministry ofEducation, 4/1/The East African Community, an organization established by the govern-m- ents of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, which has responsibilities, inter alia,for running certain common services such as posts and telecommunications,railways and harbours, air services, etc.2/It does, of course, affect this plan through its demands for teachers.3/See annexed diagram.4/This is complicated by the fact that each university college serves theth- ree countries.The new structure may alter this in the future. See footnoteto paragraph 5(a). 133123 Administrative aspects of educational planning 11.Scholarships abroad are planned by the higher education office in the finance and establish-ments division of the Ministry of Education in consultation with the manpower planner and officialsof the ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs, which latter is interested because all offers andacceptances of foreign aid for scholarships are channelled through it.12.Foreign aid agencies have an effect on the development plan. Most of them have ideas oftheir own on the policies and practices of the country and it is not unusual for them to bring pressureto bear for changes to be made before they will decide to give aid. The major aid agencies co-operatein an aid co-ordinating committee, which makes for integration of aid with planned development. B.Individual projects13.With a few exceptions in urban areas, individual primary school projects are not considereduntil the over-all plan is approved. At that point education committees of local and municipal author-ities are notified by the educational planner of the total development towards which the Central Govern-ment is prepared to contribute within its plan and asked to submit detailed proposals for the approvalof the Minister of Education. The key person in this procedure is the education officer of the educa-tion committee who, in consultation with the chairman, presents proposals to the committee for dis-cussion and final approval for forwarding to the Ministry. The ACEO (planning) makes his commentsand recommendations to the Minister through the CEO and permanent secretary. The Minister eitherapproves or sends the proposals back through the same route for reconsideration by the educationcommittee.During the whole of this procedure the Ministry of Regional Administrations is keptinformed.14.For second-level and non-university third-level institutions the allocation to individual pro-jects is discussed by the ACEO (planning) with the CEO, the officers concerned in the administrativesection of the Ministry and the inspectorate. Once the Minister has approved the list, each is dis-cussed in detail by the ACEO (planning) with the headmaster and the school architect.15.University projects are a matter for the college council, in consultation with the under-secretary at the Ministry and architects, and where necessary officials of the ministries of Financeand planning and Economic Development.16.All projects involving foreign aid are discussed with prospective donors in very great detailby the officers or bodies concerned as above. Officials of the Ministry of Finance are always closelyinvolved in these discussions. C.Submission and decision17.The final educational development plan is submitted to the Minister of Education and by himto the Planning Commission for consideration, alternative proposals, and eventual incorporation inthe over-all national plan to be submitted through the Cabinet to the National Assembly for adoption. Planning and implementation of educational development: Uganda IMPLEMENTATION OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT A.Flow of funds and physical developmentPreparation of the annual budget18.The ACED (planning) notifies approved development to the officer of the administrativesection of the Ministry who administers each sector of second and non-university third-level educa-tion.Each of these officers draws up his total recurring estimates for the next financial year, in-cluding development.He discusses them with the official concerned at the Ministry of Finance inthe presence of the ACED (planning) and the manpower planner.I. 9 .The ACED (planning) draws up the capital budget for the coming financial year, project byproject, within the development plan, and then discusses it with the official concerned in the Ministryof Finance in the presence of the manpower planner.20.Both sets. of estimates, amended where necessary as a result of the discussions, are incor-porated by the Ministry of Finance in the budget for the coming financial year submitted through theCabinet to the National Assembly.21.A similar procedure as between the education officer and the local or municipal authority isfollowed at the local level.The authority's budget is submitted for approval to the Ministry ofRegional. Administration, which checks, inter alia, that the educational budget is in accordance withapproved plans.Expenditure of funds and construction of buildings22.Atbeginning of the financial year the Cabinet releases such funds as are available andneeded.Certain items may be held back for release later in the year. In some cases where an itemhas been included provisionally, the Cabinet will only authorize release after the case has been justi-fied.All released funds are made available to the Ministry of Finance.23.The Ministry of Finance authorizes the Ministry of Education to incur expenditure on re-leased items and this is operated by the finance and establishments division.21.Most foreign aid passes through the Central Government budget by the above routes but theremay be some elements of foreign aid to the university which pass direct from the donor to the univer-sity council.Primary schools25.The Central Government contribution towards development of primary education is controlledby the Ministry of Education. Once the detailed projects are approved by the Minister as described inparagraph 13, the ACED (planning) authorizes the finance section of the Ministry to pay the contribu-tion to the local or municipal authority, notifying the Ministry of Regional Administrations so that itcan incorporate the additional recurring contribution in its future annual budgets for subvention to theauthority concerned.The authority receives these funds as income together with its other income andoperates the expanded educational service from the total. 135125 Administrative aspects of educational planning 26.In urban areas the authority gives grants for capital development of primary schools tomanagement committees, which employ architects and contractors to erect the buildings and whichbuy the furniture and equipment. In some rural cases a similar procedure is followed, but in mostcases the erection of the school buildings and provision of furniture and equipment is a matter forthe local community.Either the people erect a school in temporary materials, usually with a littlecash contribution for the employment of workmen for the construction of such items as a corrugatediron roof, or they contribute rather more funds for the employment of workmen to erect the wholebuilding.Neither the central nor the local governments have anything like enough funds for per-manent buildings for all development of primary education.Second-level and non-university third-levelCapital27.The National Housing Corporation is responsible for the erection of central governmentschools.In consultation with the headmaster and the architecture and works sub-section of the plan-ning section of the Ministry of Education it draws up the plans, and it either builds by direct labouror awards a contract to a private firm. Funds for this purpose are paid to the Corporation by thefinance section of the Ministry of Education on the authority of the ACED (planning).28.For all aided second and non-university third-level institutions the Board of Governors isresponsible for the erection of buildings. Its administrative work in this respect is usually carriedout by the headmaster, sometimes helped by a building sub-committee. An architect appointed bythe board draws up the plans in consultation with the headmaster and the architecture and workssection of the Ministry, who may consult the inspectorate on suitability of buildings for educationalpurposes.Ultimately the plans need the approval of the Ministry, and this power is delegated to theACED (planning).29.Once he has approved the plans, the ACED (planning) authorizes the finance section of theMinistry to pay the first instalment of the capital grant to the Board of Governors. He authorizes thepayment of the remaining instalments as he receives certification from technicalofficers of theNational Housing Corporation that certain stages of the building programme have been satisfactorilycompleted.The Board of Governors calls for tenders from contractors, and submits its chosentender to the Ministry for approval. The ACED (planning) makes his recommendation to the Ministerthrough the ministerial channels, and the Minister either approves or returns the uroposal throughthe same channels to the Board of Governors for reconsideration. Once the approval has been given,the Board signs the contract and the work proceeds under the supervision of the architect.30.In all cases, both government and aided schools, the headmaster submits his proposals forpurchase of furniture and equipment to the ACED (planning), who consults officers of the inspectorateon the educational suitability of the items proposed. Once the ACED (planning) has approved, heauthorizes the payment of the capital grant for this purpose and the Board buys the furniture andequipment. 136 Planning and implementation of educational development: Uganda Recurring31.Recurring expenditure by the Central Government on both the maintenance of existing ser-vices and development is incorporated into one vote for each sector of the educational services, andthe sector is treated as an expanded whole. Ugandan teachers are recruited by each Board of Gover-nors, subject to the approval of the official concerned in the administrative section of the Ministry.Expatriate teachers are employed and paid by their aid agencies or by the Ministry, according to theagreed conditions of the technical aid agreement, and are posted to the schools by the officials of theadministration section after consultation with the headmasters. Grants for Ugandan teachers and to-wards other non-teacher recurring expenses are paid quarterly in advance to boards of governors bythe finance section of the Ministry on the authority of the section officer in the administration section.These are supplemented by fees and other income, and the headmaster operates the school bankaccount in the name of the Board.University32.Both capital and recurring grants to the university from the Government are paid to the uni-versity and/or college council by the finance section of the Ministry on the authority of the under-secretary for finance and establishments. In addition the university may receive further grants orloans from aid agencies direct, which are paid in accordance with the terms of the agreement.33.The procedure for capital expansion is similar to that described above for second-level insti-tutions.The under-secretary, being an official representative of the Ministry of Education on thecouncil, keeps a watching brief on behalf of the Government on scales of accommodation, plans, etc.Contracts are awarded after competitive tender and payments are made for buildings, works, furni-ture, equipment, architects' fees, etc. by the college council.34.University staff are either recruited direct by the college council or under various foreignaid agreements, which differ according to the donor.Scholarships abroad35.The procedure for selection of scholars is described later (paragraph 42). Once the selec-tions are made, executive action is undertaken by the higher education office in the Ministry of Educa-tion in consultation with the embassies of the donor countries and those in which Uganda Governmentscholars are to study.The flow of funds in connection with scholarships awarded under foreign aidschemes is in accordance with the individual agreements. For Uganda Government scholars, thehigher education office makes all the administrative arrangements such as applications for passports,booking passages, etc., and authorizes the finance section of the Ministry to pay expenses at theUganda end.36.Once the Uganda Government scholar arrives in the country of study, his affairs are takenover by an education attach\u00e9 in the Uganda Embassy. Funds are transferred to the Embassy, whichpays the expenses in the country of study. Administrative aspects of educational planning B.Control of flow of studentsPrimary schools37.Admission to and flow through the primary schools is under the control of each headmaster.Primary to lower stage second-level courses38.Admission to the more popular secondary general schools is controlled by what is collo-quially called the 'auction'. This is a committee consisting of the heads of all such schools under thechairmanship of the Chief Inspector of Schools (CIS). Students leaving primary school are asked tostate their six first choices of secondary schools in order of preference. They are placed in orderof merit resulting from the common primary leaving examination and the CIS offers each in turn tothe school of first choice, turning to the second choice, etc. if a child is refused.He ensures thatno child qualifying by order of merit fails to obtain an offer. This procedure continues until allplaces are filled, including additional places created by the development plan.39.Once the auction is complete, teacher training colleges and technical and farm schools atthe same level make their choices from the remainder. Such choice is in the hands of individualprincipals of colleges, although in some cases the ACE() (planning) may require a college to take aspecified quota from a particular area, especially into a teacher training college, so as to ensure aproperly balanced supply of trained personnel in accordance with the development plan.Lower secondary general to upper-stage secondary-level courses40.An auction similar to that for entry to the lower stage is held for entry to the more popularsecondary general course.Then there is a meeting of an ad hoc committee consisting of representa-tives of ministries conducting training courses, such as the Ministry of Health for nursing, theMinistry of Agriculture for extension workers, and including the Ministry of Education for teachers,for the purpose of choosing from the remainder. The manpower planner attends this meeting as anobserver.These selections also are made for services expanded in accordance with the developmentplan.Upper secondary to university41.Entry to the university is in the hands of the university authorities which appoints its ownselection body.Suggestions have been made.that this selection should be incorporated with the selec-tion of students abroad described in the next paragraph, but at the time of writing there is no informa-tion whether this has been implemented.Students abroad42.Selection of students to study abroad is made from candidates interviewed by a selection com-mittee on which the most important representatives are the manpower planner from the Ministry ofPlanning and Economic Development, representatives of the ministries of Public Service and ForeignAffairs, political personages, and of course the higher education officer of the Ministry of Education,who is the secretary of the committee and the officer subsequently responsible for action. This 138126 Planning and implementation of educational development: Uganda committee co-ordinates all selection for Uganda Government and foreign aid awards. It is informedby the Ministry of Internal Affairs of courses for which applications are made for passports for pri-vate study abroad, but can only note these applications and cannot influence the issue of the passports. COMMENTS Prior to independence in 1962, national planning was carried out by administrative officersin the Chief Secretary's office and the Treasury. With the change to a ministerial system arisingfrom independence, a new Ministry of Planning and Economic Development was created, staffed in themain by economists, a new concept for a country like Uganda. On the other hand planning in theMinistry of Education grew out of the administrative structure. Its first head was an administrativeofficer, an ex-district commissioner. Its subsequent heads were officers with experience of educa-tional administration.Inevitably these officers had to adapt their administrative practices to a plan-ning orientation, and conversely their planning was considerably influenced by their administrativebackground.Hence the complete integration of educational planning with its administration describedin this paper.It so happened that the personalities who were called upon to adapt themselves in thismanner and those in the new-type Ministry of Planning and Economic Development could work happilytogether in spite of their different backgrounds and approaches. The result is that educational plan-ning in Uganda is now firmly established as an integral part of its administration.44.Therefore although changes of political opinion have resulted in development different fromthat originally planned, the system described in this paper works well. In addition to the influence ofpersonalities, many aspects of the structure make for efficient administration, but-there are twowhich call for comment.45.There is no one person, ministerial section or body which co-ordinates the development ofall educational services.The planning section of the Ministry of Education deals with primary,second-level and non-university third-level education, but has no official link with the university,training by technical ministries and East African Community departments or non-formal education.The manpower planner comes nearest to the complete link, with his contacts with the university, theeducational planner and the development of second and non-university third-level education, the tech-nical ministries and EACSO departments and ministries dealing with non-formal education. But hehas no direct responsibility for primary education, except for its impact on needs for and supply oftrained teachers.4G.It so happens that this has not mattered because of the personal co-operation of the manpowerplanner, the educational planner and the under-secretary for finance and establishments in the Minis-try of Education, but it is a bad principle to build structures on personalities who happen to be Administrative aspects of educational planning operating them at a particular time. The Manpower Planning Board is predominantly concerned withmanpower matters and only indirectly with educational affairs. Prior to its existence there was aworking party on education and manpower, one of eleven set up to prepare for the 1966-1971 develop-ment plan.This working party co-ordinated most educational activities, with the exception of non-formal and non-aided private education. It would seem that a permanent body of this nature, coveringall educational activities, including the manpower aspects, with representatives of all interestedministries and organizations, would be an advantage. Such a body could be made responsible to ahigher political body such as the Cabinet sub-committee, which could be responsible for the policyaspects of educational development. 1/ Education covers such a wide range of activities, and affectsan even wider range of spheres, that planning and implementing its development is inevitably a com-plex series of functions which need to be co-ordinated and carried out by various ministries andorganizations. Good though the co-operation is in Uganda, the addition to the structure of its institu-tions of such a co-ordinating body would help to insure the continuation of this co-operation againstthe possibility of the coincidence of personalities who do not get on so well together as have thoseoperating hitherto.47.The other point of comment is the limitation imposed on the function of local and municipalauthorities in the planning process. They are given a total 'ration' and told to work within it (apartfrom the ability of a few of the richer authorities to develop beyond their ration from their own re-sources).This circumscribes their action and usurps their initiative. Ideally it would be better togive them more freedom to submit ideas of their own, but unfortunately the present system is moreappropriate to their present state of development. Even within these limitations there have beenoccasions when a local authority has acted irresponsibly, simply because local enthusiasm has over-come the advice of the education officer, due to lack of understanding of the wider issues involved andof experience in political administration. As time goes on, some authorities may take a more matureattitude and that might be the time to give them more scope for initiative in submitting proposals fortheir part in the national development plan. 1/See paragraph 3. 140 ANNEX National Assembly Cabiiet r-lr-anning Commission [MinisterDeputyMinister-______,Permanent Secretary'MinistryofEducation Finance andEst schoolsTrainingInstitutions41 Part IIINew administrative and budgeting techniquesof use for educational planning E 1101 E OF BUDGETS IN EDUCATIONAL PI ANNING by Jacques Hallak A significant characteristic of planning in developing countries is the relative importance of the publicsector;this is even more true for educational planning, where the growth of the public sector is adominating factor in the development of educational systems.As details of public sector programmes are included in the budgets of the government andlocal authorities, and since educational planning is primarily concerned with formulating objectivesfor action,it would therefore be only logical to expect that the budgetary activity should play a majorrole in planning, programming and controlling educational costs during the planned period. As amatter of fact, a draft plan is only a blueprint for action, whilst budgetary activity is mainly opera-tional in nature.This means that the budget should be so devised as to highlight the truly operationalcharacteristics, both physical and financial, of any given programme.Such is, however, unfortunate-ly hot the experience of m any developing countries; with a consequence that the operational characterof what we may call 'traditional budgets' and their links with planning are largely obscured. 1.Traditional budgetsAn annual budget constitutes the principal instrument with which the national authorities of a countryexpress their priorities for government action. Ideally, one would like to identify an annual budgetwith a one-year plan;but, however, since planning consists in exploring the future, analysing themeans to attain certain targets and deciding on programmes with a view to achieving them, while thepreparation of a budget is usually determined by the situation of the moment, it is clear that one-yearplans and budgets may co-exist in a country and may prove to be somewhat contradictory.In a majority of countries, budgeting is conceived largely in financial terms. The financialaccountability to the legislature is usually the over-riding consideration, and this permeates the en-tire budgetary process.The budget is traditionally thought of as a tool with which to control and dis-tribute the How of the actual financial resources of a state. The emphasis is placed mainly on the 115 Administrative aspects of educational planning observance of appropriation limits. In many respects, it is better adapted to the requirements of afinancial comptroller concerned with preventing fraud and dishonesty, than to those of a manager oradministrator responsible for making well-founded decisions for the use of public funds.The classification of budgetary expenditures rarely enables identification of programmes orprojects;furthermore, it is only infrequently related to the cost of major inputs or educational ser-vices performed.To give the case of Ceylon (see Table 1) as an illustration, cost analysts canneither isolate the cost of specific educational programmes or projects, nor can they estimate thebudgetary unit cost of primary and secondary education separately. In other words, the traditionalsystem of budgeting does not provide information on what a government is actually doing and what itgets for the money spent.Of course, it may be possible to compile such information from depart-mental reports or other supplementary documents, but in many cases this information cannot bedirectly linked with cost and finance data as they appear in a budget or in audited accounts, becauseit does not constitute a basis for budget management. The absence of pertinent information of thistype reduces the usefulness of such a traditional budgetary approach even for purposes of legislativereview and appropriation.Yet, even in their traditional forms, budgets can play an important role in the developmentof plans in general and of educational plans in particular. The basic reason is that it has increasinglybecome the custom to express the consequences of educational plans in budgetary terms. It is there-fore particularly tempting to consider the budget as the most appropriate tool for controlling theimplementation of the plan through the programming of its costs and the ensuring of annual appropria-tions of funds needed.Let us take two examples from socialist countries : USSR and Hungary. In spite of traditionaltypes of budget, these two countries make extensive use of norms, standard and unit costs in budget-ing and programming their educational plans to the extent that their annual budget is considered as themost appropriate tool for the execution of the plan. In Hungary, for instance, each year during thepreparation of the educational budget, the detailed planned costs of the five-year plans serve as abasis for estimating the budgetary allocations. Small adjustments of plan targets might occur due tobudgetary constraints unforeseen in the plan.In practice, the role of the budget will depend on several factors, the most important of whichare the following :(a) Imperative or indicative planningThe degree of flexibility of educational plans will be directly reflected inthe educational budget. As we have seen in the case of a country likeHungary, the annual budgets are the financial expression of the implemen-tation of the plans, and will thus enable regular appraisals to be made ofthe extent to which the long-term forecasts have been realized. 146134 The role of budgeting in educational planning Table 1.A specimen estimate for Ceylon Estimates, 1968/69Head 145.Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs, Vote No. 4Elementary EducationExpenses connected with the Paddy Weeding Programmeand Works and improvements to Maha Vidyalayas(Maintenance, repairs and improvements and services and drainage,latrines and wells)Apportionment No. science(2)Requisites for teaching of art(3)Supply of blackboard instruments(4)Supply of chalk, stationery andother miscellaneous consumablestores(a)chalk(b)stationerySupply of other school equipment,globes, maps, etc.(6)Supply of minor consumablearticles to the College of Musicand dancing and Ballet(7)Supply of simple medicines(8)Repairs to of the Revenue and Expenditure of theGovernment of Ceylon for the Financial Year 1 October 1968 to 30 September1969', Appropriation Act No 38 of 1968.147 Administrative aspects of educational planning In countries where educational plans remain mainly indica-tive or not fully comprehensive, the significance of the budget figuresis not so important as the amounts actually budgeted during the planperiod do not necessarily correspond to a definite degree to the achieve-ment of the educational target. These targets may prove to be more orless costly to attain; the only significant way to control their implemen-tation should be based on physical data. Such data does not appear intraditional budgets.(b) Conversion of targets of the plan into specific projectsA sound and reliable plan should always be converted into definite pro-jects of construction and development (creation of new staff posts, etc.),each project having been costed carefully, and the budget should bedrawn on the basis of these items. In this way, the budget can have asignificant role to play in making available the funds necessary foractually achieving the targets. To a certain extent, this is what hashappened with the present educational plan in Tanzania; although thelarge proportion of external aid expected in the financing of the plan hasbeen a major cause of the difficulties found in reaching the targets.(c) Proportion of public sources of financingIn several developing countries, foreign aid contributes a significantshare of the financing of the educational plan. Under these circumstances,the national budget covers only a fraction of the planned programmes.On the other hand, in countries where external aid plays a minor role -everything being equal - the budget will obviously play a larger role inthe execution of the plan.(d) Systems of financing educationIn federal types of countries, with decentralized methods of financing, state and local authorities budgets can really be the key tools for pro-gramming and controlling educational costs, since federal governmentbudgets are to a large extent more general and also cover only a veryminor proportion of educational costs. On the other hand, in countrieswith a centralized system of financing education, the national budgetswhich bear the greater part of the financial burden should be made moreeffective instruments for the implementation of educational plans.(e) Relations between Ministries of Education, Planning and FinanceIt is not an exaggeration to say that the administrative organization ofinter-ministerial committees for the preparation of educational plans hasa very considerable effect on action taken with regard to the programmesset up for the period covered by the plan.If the educational plan is prepared by a specialized group whichhas no contact with the finance ministry, whether the group belongs tothe ministry of national education or to a planning commission, difficultieswill arise at the execution stage of the plan. The annual budgets mayappear as if they had been established quite independently from the fore-casts made in programming the plan. With such possibilities frequentlyoccurring it is necessary to give the planning service a certain degreeof superiority over the budget service as soon as the principle of planninghas been accepted. 148136 The role of budgeting in educational planning In short, the national budget can play a role of greater or less importance in the service of theeducational plan according to the country, and the circumstances and characteristic's of the planningsystem itself. it can stimulate the fulfilment of the educational plan by financing of a discretionarycharacter, specifying programmes to be carried out and assigning them an order of priority. itmay, in some cases, be the essential instrument for the execution of the educational plan. In allevents , both as a 'watch-dog' and as a yardstick for measuring the fulfilment of the planned pro-grammes, the budget is undoubtedly an indispensable complement to the educational plan.2. The need for new approaches in budgetingWith the generalization of planning procedures and the ever more striking manifestation of an impera-tive need for a more rational management of public finance, the question arises as to whether budgetsof the traditional type can continue to play an entirely satisfactory role in the implementation of edu-cational plans.How indeed can the achievement of quantitative and qualitative educational targets bemeasured unless the means to attain them are explicit and are annually programmed? Can thebudget be the instrument of execution of the plan if alterations and reorientations of existingprogrammes, annually decided upon in small doses (since 'newineasures '11 rarely constitutemore than 10 per cent of the national budget) are not systematically planned in all the budgets ofthe plan period?Finally, the traditional budget methods which:(a) distinguish requirements and funds by balancing them one againstanother;(b) programme the requirements in annual slices and allocate the fundsto administrative services compartmented according to the nature oftheir activities;(c) exclude to some extent the necessary close reference between theinvestment expenditure of one year and the operating costs ensuingduring succeeding years;(d) thereby prevent any comprehensive and comparative appraisal of thetotal cost of an investment;obviously do not entirely meet the informational requirements dictated by the desire for a rationa-lization of national options - a role which it would be desirable to attribute to the budgets.As a matter of fact in 1962 the United Nations Secretary-General stated in his report:'The budgetary systems of many developing countries have failed tokeep pace with the new demands made on them by the greatly increasingscope of activities of the public sector and, in particular, by the adoptionof a planned approach to economic development. Thus , the need is first for the development of new types of information on the public sectorj/ 'New measures and 'services voted' are the terminology used in theFrench budgets, but they correspond to budgetary concepts admitted in allcountries. 149 Administrative aspects of educational planning essential for drawing up long-term development plans , and second for changes in concepts and procedures in government budgeting required tomake the annual budget an effective instrument for implementing thedevelopment plans and policies' .1/In response to the need for correcting this situation, several attempts for improving bud-getary activity have been made:At the school level, management considerations and the need for cost analysis have led tothe introduction in a few countries (*U.S.A. ,Canada, etc. , but also Uganda, Thailand, etc.) offunctional breakdown of the budget items, distributing the expenditures by purpose and type througha uniformized system of accounting.At the national level, with a view to completing the information provided by the traditionalbudgetsan effort to group the expenditures by major functions (broad grouping of operations thatare directed towards accomplishing a major purpose of government) has been initiated in somecountries. A function may be defined as a major division of the total organized effort of the govern-ment which identifies distinct and separate services provided to the public - such as education,health, agriculture, etc. V A classification of this kind, which may be common among variouscountries , provides helpful information on purposes served by governmental expenditures, irres-pective of the organization making the expenditure. This is accomplished by grouping programmesand activities of organization according to the basic services provided, each of which has signifi-cance from the standpoint of the duties and responsibilities of the government as a whole. Thus ,a functional classification can show the share of public budget devoted to education and otherpublic services. In this respect, it is most useful for formulation, review and implementation ofbroad policy objectives, and therefore of primary interest for top-level legislature and executivereview.It is none the less true that although it helps to rationalize decisions, the functional budgetdoes not direct action because it does not enable a clear connexion to be established between thefunctional category and the programme to be put in hand. Nor does it provide data on the nature ofproposed work, its relation to policy objectives, planned performance and its cost. This is despitea definite tendency among those responsible for preparation of such budgets to use functionaland subfunctional categories for segregating governmental expenditures according to the immediateor short-term purposes served. 1/ United Nations, The United Nations Development Decade: Proposals for Action, New York, 1962 (Sales No. 62 II B2), p.112.2/ As an illustration, Table 2 gives the breakdown of the French Budget, by function. 150130 The role of budgeting in educational planning Table 2.Functional distribution of public expenditure in FranceIndex for1965(1964=100)Percentage of administration 105.220.720.3Foreign overseas 95.04.54.0Education and 11 3 . 317 .313.2Social services 105.914.314.1Economic 106.823.323.1Housing, urban French Republic.

Ministry of Finance andEconomic Affairs, Directorate of the Budget , Paris, Imprimerie Nationale(Government Printing Office), 1965.In their present structure, therefore functional budgets do not seem to meet all the needsarising from the generalization of planning procedures and the desire for the rationalization of themanagement of public funds.The use of programme and performance budgeting developed essentially in response to thecall for improving this situation; it is intended to highlight management consideration in budgetingand in so doing to bring out the most significant economic ,financial and physical aspects, of thebudgetary activity. The programme and performance approach to budgeting is based principallyon the use in budget management of three sets of interrelated considerations: (i) meaningful'programmesbroad categories that identify the end products of major organizations - and'activities' - segments of a programme that identify homogeneous types of work carried out bysubsidiary organizations to produce the end products of a programme - are established for eachfunction entrusted to an organization or an agency in order to show precisely the work objectivesof various agencies; (ii) the system of accounts is brought into line with this classification;(iii) under each programme and for its operational subdivisions, action is taken to establishprogramme and work measures that are useful for evaluation and performance. L1 This involvesestablishing an appropriate relationship between long and short-range plans and identifying thatsegment of the plans that is proposed to be implemented in the annual budget. j/ Such a system was introduced in a few countries, e.g. the Philippines;in the U.S. this system has been given the name of 'performance budget '.2/ Units of work measurements in selected programmes in the Philippinesare included for illustrative purposes in Table 3.151 13J Administrative aspects of educational planning Thus, to a large extent, a programme and performance budget can respond to such keyquestions as: What is the purpose of doing a specific thing? What is the cost of doing it , and howfar have the programme objectives been accomplished?Yet the programme and performance budget ,in spite of its degree of refinement andsophistication, is still no more than a descriptive tool for the scope of action of the government,insofar as it does not aim at examining alternative means for reaching the targets , nor does itsuggest the main programmes or projects to be adopted by the public authorities.The Planning-Programming-Budgeting SystemAn important reform which is taking place in several countries aims at improving the efficiencywith which the public funds earmarked for national objectives are utilized. This reform originatesfrom planning, but has developed of its own accord ,especially in the United States. It is alreadybeing applied in Canada, France and other countries.To use the expression of William Gorham 1/ ,the reform has 'an overwhelmingly longtitle': Planning-Programming-Budgeting Systems.Planning; This is an attempt to determine by means of forward-looking research the full range of long-term targets for which thevarious departments of a government recognize their responsibility.By 'long-term targets' is meant here the strategic objectives in atimetable which varies according to the case.Programming: This term involves the definition of the material,financial and human resources which are best adapted to the successiveachievement of the targets ,that is to say the working-out of the medium-term programmes which are the usual components of an over-all plan.Programming implies a comparison of alternative means for attaining agiven target with a view to selecting the best of these means.Budgeting: This is the conversion into budgetary terms of annual propor-tions of the accomplishment of the programmes with allowance for short-term financial restraints.Concretely, the procedures consists of the following actions:- for countries already using planning - the application of a techniquefor improving the preparation of the plan by a rational choice ofprogrammes and for ensuring their implementation by the adoptionof a programme budget for each year of the planning;- for countries originally not using planning - first , the establishment andapplication of medium-term plans for each governmental function, to berevised and brought up to date every year, and second, the use of thefirst year of the plan as the framework for the next budget , it being evident that the preparation of the annual budget will necessitate morerigidity in the plan. 1/ William Gorham was until May 1968 Assistant Secretary in the Departmentof Health, Education and Welfare in the Government of the United States. 1521 u The role of budgeting in educational planning Table 3.Units of work measurement in selected programmes: The Philippines FunctionGeneralGovern-mentOrganizationProgrammeProjectUnit of work measurementBureau ofInternalRevenueAdministration 1.

It involves the establishment of a system of budget classification whichcollates programmes and allocations according to the principal targets , functions , and groups thatbenefit from them. The code of reference adopted should also serve to classify items according tothe administrative agency responsible, budget assignment, method of financing and legislativestatus. In France, for example, operations aimed at classifying the activities and expenditures ofa ministry in terms of programme headings have been undertaken in only a few ministries (prin-cipally the Ministry of the Armed Forces and the Ministry of Agriculture). in the United States, 154 The role of budgeting in educational planning ,l)c, reform of the budget classification system was introduced into all government departments in!:?65. By way of illustration only, Table 4 shows the reference codes and programme categoriesadopted for education. j/ It is important to note that any category given at a particular level mayappear in combination with any category of another level. For example, a programme having as itsobjective 'General research' (level 2, category 5) may include one or more programme targets oflevel 3.As Novick said 2/:'The PPBS method is to set forth certain major objectives, to define pro-grammes essential to these goals, to identify resources to the specifictypes of objectives and to systematically analyse the alternatives available'This means that the PPBS system implies a thOrough systems analysis leading to choosingthe 'preferred mix 'of a set of proposed projects which cannot all be undertaken. Such decisionspresent very complex problems and require, first, qualitative discussion of some of the morerelevant non-quantifiable issues involved in the decision, e.g.. political factors ,non-quantifiable'spillover' effects and the like; and, second, the adoption of a set of quantifiable selection criteriato which the costs and advantages of competitive programmes can be compared.

Such a high level of decision-making dealing with major matters ofallocation must be (and is) based primarily on intuition and judgment.Aralysis will be more helpful if it is to provide solutions for decisions on a somewhat lowerlevel; these solutions in turn might provide valuable information for higher-level decisions. It is onthese somewhat lower decision levels (technically called 'suboptimization') that the analytical studiesare likely to have the highest pay-off. This is incidentally one of the advantages of PPBS, insofar asit leads to increased possibilities of decentralization and to the creation of incentives for efficiency. 157145 Administrative aspects of educational planning To come back to the selection criteria , there are numerous techniques used; for instancecost-effectiveness ,cost utility and cost-benefit analysis. The advantages and the limitations ofsuch techniques are dealt with elsewhere. However , two remarks should be made here:(i)Whatever the technique used, it implies careful cost analysis of projectsand programmes to be budgeted; in this respect a prerequisite for theapplication of PPBS is the availability of sufficiently detailed cost esti-mates for carrying out a thorough cost analysis.(ii) The weaknesses of any quantitative selection criteria , particularly inrespect to the educational budget, are, such that they become probablythe most serious obstacle to overcome in the generalization of PPBS.It can be admitted that in the social budget of the nation as a whole , andin the educational budget in particular , the problem of selection is not necessarily solved when the most economically efficient programmeshave been determined. The 'redistributive' function of educationalbudgets prevents us from giving priority in decision-making to thecriterion of economic efficiency. We are faced with a contradictionbetween the efficiency criterion and the social justice criterion, andthe question 'Who will benefit from this or that programme? can weighmore heavily in some cases than the question 'Which of these programmeshas the highest rate of return? 'The PPBS is a method which covers, in theory, a very wide field since it brings together the planning,the bndgeting, and the rational appraisal of the possible options. In fact, however ,PPBS is not asubstitute for over-all planning since it cannot, in the present 'state of the art' , integrate coherentlyhilt, full range of the nation 's activities; and, further, in view of the difficulty of establishing selec-tion criteria, it does not 3 et provide by itself final solutions to questions of budgetary choices.On the other hand, PPBS undoubtedly marks an advance by its attempt to clarify the manage-ment of public affairs by its encouragement of rigid programming of the operations included in theplan, and by its effect as a catalyst and stimulant of research on the criteria of selection. PPBS in-volves a better analysis of the consequences of the targets proposed by the planners, and thus inturn affects the choice of these targets.Should we therefore conclude that the use of PPBS should he generalized in all developedand developing countries? To pronounce upon the value and the advisability of applying PPBS to theeducation sector obviously involves a political choice. To mention only the technical aspects of theintroduction of this method, it can be said that it would require the forming of teams at a high levelin each department or ministry of the government simply in order to put it into practice, and itwould also presuppose a decentralization of the decision-making process at each government level,with due respect for standards and criteria admitted by all. Furthermore , it would call for a com-plete change in the state of mind and in the traditional relationships existing between the budgetservices and the spending departments. In other words , an essential preliminary to the introductionof PPBS in the educational sector must be a retraining of authorities and officials and a reappraisalof the traditional relationships between budgeting and educational planning. On these grounds atleast, therefore, it merits examination and consideration by educational planning authorities. 158140 NEW MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES AND EDUCATIONAL PLANNING by Ta Ngoc Chau The progress made in operations research and in systems analysis and the remarkable improvementof modern computers (both hardware and software) have facilitated the rapid development of what artknown as new management techniques. This development has been accompanied by changes in theterminology used by those specialists who only a short while ago were speaking in terms of 'ScientificManagement', but who now refer with increasing frequency to 'Managerial Sciences'.It is true to say that the use of these techniques in the management of large commercial andindustrial companies, and of certain government agencies, has given generally satisfactory results.Their extension to other fields of application has therefore been examined - including their utilizationin educational planning.However, the experience acquired so far, both in Europe and in NorthAmerica, is still to limited and too specialized to enable a definite conclusion to be drawn. It wouldseem, nevertheless, that these techniques are very likely to play an important part in educationalplanning in the future.The present study is intended to shed a little light on this problem and to serveas a basis for discussion.It is not an easy matter to give a satisfactory definition of the new management techniquesbecause they have many diversified aspects and serve many different purposes. They do howeverhave one thing in common.In one way or another, they enter into the decision-making process andtheir role is precisely to facilitate decision-making. It should be added that the basic assumption onwhich these techniques are founded, when they are used to give guidance in decision-making, is thatof a systematic search for efficiency in the use of available resources.To the extent that new management techniques serve as instruments which help to preparefor decision-making, they are fully applicable to the different stages of planning - whether it be thecentral stage when the general plan is worked out or the lower stages at which more limited plansare applied.They are also applicable to the different phases of the planning process, including boththe determination of the objectives and programmes and their implementation. Indeed, the resultsobtained in the implementation will enable an over-all evaluation to be made and will facilitate, ifnecessary, changes in the programmes and even a reappraisal of the objectives. 159147 Administrative aspects of educational planning It would not of course be possible to describe these various techniques in this brief' study.It is useful, however, to review their principal characteristics. It will then be possible to show howthey have already been applied in educational planning. Part 1: Essential characteristics of the new management techniques We have already defined the new management techniques as being instruments which help to preparefor decision-making.The process of decision-making should be understood in its broadest sense.It is not limited to the final phase of the choice of the policy to be followed. It goes far beyond thatin seeking out and identifying problems which may arise, in working out different possible solutionsand finally in the selection of the best possible solution. In reality, the distinctions may be lessclear.The search for a solution may lead to the identification of a new problem and call for a newprocess of decision-making. It is nonetheless true that these three phases (identification of theproblem, search for possible solutions, choice of the most suitable one) always occur, and that thenew management techniques are applicable to every one of them.Although these techniques are closely involved in the decision-making process, it is obviousthat it is not the techniques themselves - and much less the computers which allow us to use themwhich govern the decision.It would also be untrue, or exaggerated, to say that the new management techniques'rationalize' the decision, for that would imply that without such techniques the decisions would notbe rational, or at least less rational. Actually, what the new techniques contribute is not greaterrationality but wider and more complete information.'In reality, most major long-range planning decision problems mustultimately be resolved on the basis of intuition and judgment. ... We suggest that the main role of analysis should be to try to sharpenthis intuition and judgment.In practically no case should it beassumed that the results of the analysis will make the decisions. The really interesting problems are just too difficult, and there are somany intangible (e. g. political, psychological, and sociological) con-siderations that cannot be taken into account in the analytical process,especially in a quantitative sense. In sum, the analytical process should be directed toward assisting the decision-maker in such a waythat (hopefully) his intuition is better than it would be without theresults of the analysis'. 1/ 1/G. H. Fisher, 'The role of cost/utility analysis in programbudgeting' in D. Novick (Ed. ), Program analysis and the FederalGovernment, Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press, pp. 67 -68. 160146 New management techniques and educational planning A.Increased utilization of information in the decision-rnakingprocessThe increased role of information results on the one hand from the systematic adoption of a newanalytical approach and on the other hand from the possibilities offered by modern computers in thehandling and processing of data.This new approach is known as the Systems Approach :'Essentially the systems approach involves viewing any productivesystems as a whole in order to examine how its productive processfunctions in relation to its resource 'inputs' and its intended 'outputs'.This analytical approach can be usefully applied to all sorts of pro-ductive systems, including an educational system and its various sub-systems.A 'systems analysis' begins by defining as precisely as possible, theobjectives to be sought.It then proceeds to identify the various alter-native ways by which these objectives might be attained and to weighthe relative advantages and disadvantages of alternative approaches inorder to select the most effective feasible and economical one. Having chosen what seems the best alternative, it proceeds to elaborate a planof action, including a time-table, a definition of actions to be accom-plished during each phase, the various resources that will be requiredalong the way, the nature and timing of results anticipated, and prac-tical means for regularly evaluating progress and for making necessarychanges in the initial plan'. 1/In short, there are two essential consequences involved in this approach, in so far as the decision-making process is concerned. Firstly, there is the necessity of foreseeing not only the directeffects of a decision but also all the repercussions it may have on the system as a whole. Thesecond consequence is the care which must be taken not to limit one's thinking to the immediateeffects buton the contrary, to search out systematically long-term effects. From this twofoldpoint of view, we can say that the systems approach widens the horizons of analysis.Systems analysis, in fact, offers nothing new in itself. Economists have always used it intheoretical analysis.What is new, however, is its systematic use in concrete situations to solveproblems of choosing between various alternatives and between different policies.Given that real situations are extremely complex it is clear that the application of such anapproach may involve the collection and processing of much more data. In the field of data collec-tion, the remarkable progress of electronic data processing, in the last twenty years, has been thedecisive factor in developing and extending the fields of application of new management techniques.However, computers are not by any means a sine qua non in the use of new management techniques.Their use is quite conceivable with simpler means. After all, these techniques are not to be con-sidered as prescriptions implying the use of a given type of computer. Their origin is essentiallyto be found in a manner of conceiving and solving problems. 1/W. Schramm, P. H. Coombs et al, 'The new media - Memo toeducational planners', Paris, Unesco/IIEP, 1967, p. 162. 161 Administrative aspects of educational planning In classifying the different types of decisions, Herbert Simon - who is undoubtedly one ofthe leading specialists in the new techniques of management - suggests that a distinction be madebetween programmed decisions and non-programmed decisions.'Decisions are programmed to the extent that they are repetitive androutine, to the extent that a definite procedure has been worked outfor handling them so that they do not have to be treated de novo eachtime they occur....Decisions are non-programmed to the extent that they are novel,instructional and consequential. There is no cut and dried method for handling the problem because it had not arisen before, or becauseits precise nature and structure are elusive or complex or because itis so important that it deserves a custom-tailored treatment'. 1/In reality, this distinction is of course not so clear. The decisions to be made are not only pro-grammed or non-programmed; between these two extremes there is a whole series of intermediatedecisions.This classification, like all classifications, is to some extent arbitrary, but it appearedto be a conven:.ent way of illustrating the different kinds of new management techniques. B. New management techniques and different kinds of decisionsLet us now consider briefly the new management techniques which may be applied within an areawhich ranges from programmed to non-programmed decisions. 1. PERT and time-phasing of operations in a complex projectThe implementation of a project, that is to say converting the protect into definite actions which willenable it to be carried out by a given date, constitutes a typical programmed decision.The Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is intended precisely to solve thatproblem of time phasing by breaking the project down into the different operations, estimating theprobable time required for each operation, establishing the relationships existing between them, anddetermining, in particular, the operations the completion of which is a necessary condition for thebeginning of the subsequent operations. As a result of an analysis of this kind, it can be seen thatthe time required for the fulfilment of the project does not depend on the time-lag of the entire seriesof operations but only on some of them, that is to say the operations which succeed one another inthe critical path.This path is of special interest because all the time-lags for the operations in thispath will be automatically reflected in the total period of time involved in the fulfilment of theprogramme.PERT, even looked at in this very simplified manner, is a good example of the approach,method and objective of the new management techniques. By a systematic analysis of the problem asa whole, their essential purpose is to assemble the various factors which will facilitate the1/Herbert Simon, The shape of automation for man and. management,New York, Harper and Row, 1965, pp. 58-59. 16213u New management techniques and educational planning determination of a course of action (starting date and order of operations), to identify all possibleproblems in advance (through the design of the critical path) and to evaluate the implementation of theprogramme continuously by checking the results obtained against the plan which has been laid down.The problem which PERT is intended to solve is relatively simple. The target to be attainedis in fact clearly specified. Operational research is directed, to a certain extent, towards problemsof the same type, that is to say problems in which the targets or objectives are clearly defined. 2.Operations research and determination of the optimal solutionThe conduct of military operations during the Second World War created extremely complex logisticproblems. The task of solving these organizational problems was turned over to teams of mathe-maticians, statisticians and economists. Confronted for the first time with concrete problems ofmanagement and administration, these men used their own methods and the instruments of analysiswith which they were familiar. The results had a decisive effect on the very nature of operationalresearch.From the work of those teams of specialists there came into being a whole series of mathe-matical tools - linear programming, dynamic programming, theory of probabilities, theory ofgames, etc.Although great progress has been made in all these fields, and although the combination ofthese mathematical tools with the capabilities and the calculating speed of modern computers hasmade it possible to solve problems of ever-increasing complexity, it must be noted that operationalresearch is applicable only to certain types of decision-making problems.We quote in this connection from Charles Hitch, a specialist in operations research, whoworked for a long time for the U. S. Defence Department and is now President of the University ofCalifornia :'I would make the empirical generalization from my experience at RANDand elsewhere that operations research is the art of sub-optimizing, i. e.of solving some lower-level problems, and that difficulties increase andour special competence diminishes by an order of magnitude with everylevel of decision-making we attempt to ascend. The sort of simple explicitmodel which operations researchers are so proficient in using can cer-tainly reflect most of the significant factors influencing traffic controlon the George Washington Bridge, but the proportion of the relevantreality which we can represent by any such model or models in studying,say, a major foreign policy decision, appears to be almost trivial'. 1/Owing to the fact that operational research can be applied only to a limited number of prob-lems, an effort has been made to introduce other techniques in solving, for example, the problem ofresource allocation. Cost-benefit analysis is one of these techniques.1/ Quoted by F. Rourke and G. Brooks, in The managerial revolution inhigher education, Baltimore, John Hopkins Press, 1966, p. 10. 163151 Administrative aspects of educational planning 3.Cost-benefit analysis and the problem of resource allocationCost-benefit analysis is essentially a method for making a choice between different projects and pro-grammes. By a systematic comparison of costs and benefits (direct and indirect benefits, presentand future benefits), it provides a yardstick for the evaluation of uses of resources.To the extent that this method requires the most accurate evaluation of benefits which ispossible, it presupposes that the objectives of each project of each programme shall be clearly de-fined and it also presupposes that the anticipated results shall be distinctly specified. That in itselfclarifies to a certain extent the problem of choice.Cost-benefit analysis is not, strictly speaking, a new technique. It was already known andused in solving some particular problems, but it is only recently that its use has become generalized,This generalization is undoubtedly due to the constant development of the public sector, but weoelieve it is also due to the possibility of estimating the expected benefits more accurately, thanks tothe improvement in the collection and processing of data.Cost-benefit analysis can be used ex post to compare different projects already- being carriedout, but it can also be employed ex ante in deciding upon the utilization of available resources. Cost-.benefit analysis, for instance, is systematically applied in the preparation of programme-budgets.We shall not dwell upon this problem because it is thoroughly covered in another paper presentedthis sem inar. I/13y providing a yardstick for the evaluation of different projects and programmes, cost-benefit analysis unquestionably gives valuable aid in the decision-making process. In this process,however,it may prove to be very useful to know how the implementation of a project or the alterationof n sub-system may affect the whole system, especially where a very complex system is concerned.That is,to some extent, what simulation techniques propose to do. 4.Simulation and model-buildingThe k?5zsential purpose of simulation is to facilitate experimentation, that is to say an analysis of allthe effects of an action.It is, of course, always preferable to experiment under real conditions, butthpt may p r ovo be impracticable or even impossible.A solution may then be to simulate the real conditions and to experiment, for example, witha scale model.But simulation may also take much more abstract forms - for example, the nprriu :of a complex: system can be simulated by means of a mathematical model.As we have suggested, the essential purpose of simulation and consequently of simulationmodelsis to make it possible to see how the change or alteration of one or more elements of asystem may affect the whole system. In order to perform this role, models must possess two quali-ties which would seem to be almost contradictory - trueness and simplicity. It is indeed necessary 1JSee :J. Hallak, 'The role of budgets in educational planning', fi New management techniques and educational planning for the model to be a faithful representation of reality and to incorporate the basic aspects of thesystem, but it is also necessary for it to be not too complex to be easily understood and hand led.Unfortunately, faithful models are rarely simple and simple models are rarely faithful. It is readilyseen, therefore, that modern computers, by their capacity and their calculation speed, can be adecisive factor in the development and the generalized use of mathematical models.Such are, in very brief outline, some of the new management techniques. Let us now try tosee how they have been applied to educational planning, and what problems this application maypossibly present. Part Ti: The use of new management techniques in educational planning From the point of view of the resources which it consumes, education can be considered, in mostcountries, as one of the greatest national industries. As a matter of fact, the management of someaspects of schools and universities does not differ very greatly from the management of industrialenterprises.That is true for example in the management of personnel and in the problem of theoptimal utilization of space and equipment. It is naturally in those aspects, first of all, that modernmanagement techniques have been used. In many American universities, computers are used incentralizing and keeping up to date the data concerning the various activities of these institutionsand establishing time schedules which permit optimal utilization of teaching time, buildings, labora-tories, workshops and sports equipment, while respecting the preferences and constraints of thestudents.Also, PERT is currently used for time-phasing of complex research projects and forcarrying out large university building programmes.We shall not go farther into these techniques because their use in education is not sub-stantially different from what it may be in other sectors and consequently does not give rise to speci-fic problems. We prefer to confine ourselves to those techniques the application of which to educa-tional planning gives rise to difficulties or problems. That is why we shall examine in particular theuse of cost-benefit analysis, the development of institutional research and the use of mathematicalmodels. A.Cost-benefit analysis and educational planningCost-benefit analysis has been widely used in measuring the efficiency of education by considering itas an investment and by relating its costs to its possible benefits. Numerous studies have alreadybeen made relating to countries as diversified as the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel,Chile, India and Uganda. 16515 Administrative aspects of educational planning Several authors in the United States have shown, for example, that the rate of return isespecially high in vocational retraining programmes organized for the unemployed to facilitate theiradaptation to other employment. 1/In the United Kingdom, Professor Blaug2/ reached the conclusion that in higher educationthe private rate of return (estimated at 14 per cent in the case of men) is substantially higher thanthe social rate of return (6. 5 per cent). That difference is due to the large share of public funds inthe financing of higher education, which includes scholarships to students. Considering that differencethe question may well be raised as to whether it would not be justifiable to convert student scholarshipawards into loans to be paid back in the future.That is the kind of decision for which clarification could be provided in advance by a cost-benefit analysis.It should be noted however that cost-benefit analysis, as applied to education, isconcentrated only on economic benefits. It is therefore customary to start by enumerating the bene-fits and the costs which are not included in the evaluation.In fact, the basic assumption on which cost-benefit analysis is founded, when it is applied toeducation, is a dual oneon the one hand, that earnings of the individuals constitute an adequatemeasurement of their contribution to the product and, on the other hand, that lifetime earnings dif-ferentials between individuals can be attributed very largely to differences in educational attainment.The weak points in that assumption are quite evident.What is more, cost-benefit analysis as it is applied to education is reduced to a mere calcu-lation of the rate of return, i. e. a mere calculation of financial profitability. Paradoxically enough,cost-benefit analysis was originally advocated precisely as a remedy for the inadequacies of financialprofitability calculation and in order to take into account all the factors neglected in such a calculation.It should in particular allow for indirect costs and benefits, or what may be called external economiesand dis-economies.But, as Professor Mark Blaug wrote :'We simply do not know at present how to accurately measure benefits ofeducation that are not directly reflected in the enhanced lifetime earningsof educated people, and all economists, whatever approach they haveadopted towards educational planning, have been guilty of ignoring theseindirect benefits'.He adds, however, that : 1/ M. E. Borus, 'A benefit-cost analysis of the economic effectiveness ofretraining the unemployed', Yale Economic Essays, Vol. 4, No. 2;G. G. Somers and E. W. Stromedoerfer, 'A benefit-cost ProceedingsDecember, 1964.2/M. Blaug, 'The rate of return on investment in education in GreatBritain', The Manchester School of Economic and Social Studies,September, 1965. 166151 Now management lechni:iues and educational planning 'The overwhelming advantage of rate of return analysis is precisely thatit is cast in the mould of cost-benefit analysis and thus automatically en-courages efforts to improve measurement of the benefits of education ...The point is that the very framework of cost-benefit analysis directs one'sattention to critical gaps in data; and that is the chief merit of the framework'. 1/We can suppose that more success will be obtained in the future in evaluating the indirect costs andbenefits of education.Nevertheless, it will still be true that cost-benefit analysis can constituteonly one criterion for the ranking of different projects. It does not offer any information which mayexplain why the utilization of resources can be either more or less efficient. 13.The develo2rnent of institutional researchIt is only recently that institutional research has developed, and the development has taken placemostly in the universities of the United States. While in 1955 institutional research was systematic-ally organized in about ten. American universities, by 1964 that figure had reached 115 and the numbercontinues to increase.Although institutional research can take very diversified forms, it can be defined as a specialeffort made by an organization to study itself in order to accomplish better the objectives which it hasset for itself.Institutional research therefore consists essentially in a systematic analysis of theoperations of the organization and of the efficiency with which it utilizes its resources. The purposeof the analysis is, naturally, to enable the institution to decide on the policy to be followed, on thebasis of the most complete and accurate information possible and not on the basis of mere impressionsor preconceived ideas.Considering the number of fields on which institutional research can be brought to bear, thekinds of decisions which it may influence are widely diversified. In fact, authors are far from beingin agreement as to the exact limits of institutional research.'Actually there are widespread disputes in higher education as to what insti-tutional research is.In the past two principal schools of thought on this sub-ject have attracted considerable support. Some have felt that institutionalanalysis ought to deal primarily with administrative or housekeeping prob-lems, space utilization and the like, thus remaining in effect a form ofoperations research as applied to the business of campus management.Others have argued that it should not be confined to the 'building and groundsside of higher education but should go to the heart of the matter and appraisewhat is happening in the classroom'. 2/ 1/1V1. Blaug, 'Cost-benefit cost-efficiency Budget Programming and Cost-Efficiency Analysis inEducational Planning, Paris, OECD, 1969, pp. 181 and 184.2/F. Rourke and G. Brooks, The managerial revolution in highereducation, Baltimore, John Hopkins Press, 1966, p. 48. 167155 Administrative aspects of educational planning In reality, as was brought out in the investigation conducted by Rourke and Brooks'', therole of institutional research varies enormously from one university to another. At the Universityof Rhode Island, the Institutional Research Bureau and its director play a decisive role in thedecision-making process.It is the opinion of the President of the University, in fact, that thedirector of the Institutional Research Bureau should be his closest adviser. He goes still further byarguing that the position of Institutional Research Director is an excellent training-ground for presi-dential aspirants.In the University of Northern Illinois the situation is somewhat similar; most of the keydecisions taken in recent years having resulted directly from studies conducted by the InstitutionalResearch Bureau.However, the Universities of Rhode island and of Northern Illinois are relatively exceptionalcases.In general, institutional research departments limit their functions to gathering facts andanalysing them, but in so doing they are already playing an important part in the process of decision-making. As the director of an Institutional Research Bureau said :'Gathering facts for their own sake is senseless. The facts must be evaluated so that sound decisions can be made. This office does notmake decisions, it collects, analyses, reports and sometimes re-commends.I feel this makes use a participant in major universitydecisions'. 2/In short, institutional research constitutes a method of studying the operation of the system,and a method which allows the system to be studied from the inside, as it were, by the examinationof its component elements.Simulation and model-building are motivated by the same intention, butthe approach is somewhat different. The emphasis here lies not on a detailed analysis of the variowcomponents of the system, but rather on an twer..-aii viow of the links and re latIonshipsbetwec.r. the variouF.-: components. C.The use of models in educational planningMathematical models have been utilized in educational planning only during the last few years.Theiressential role is to make it possible to estimate all the effects and repercussions of the choice andimplementation of a particular policy on the system as a whole. A costing model, for example,should be able to show all the financial implications of a given option in regard to the educational plan.The scope of these mathematical models varies in different countries. In Denmark a modelcovers the entire educational system and makes it possible to forecast the number of pupils or studentsat all levels of schooling, and hence to estimate teacher requirements and total salary costs. Theseestimates and forecasts serve as a basis for the preparation of a three-year budget. 1/F. Rourke and G. Brooks, op. cit., Chapter :3, pp. 44-67.2/P. Rourke and G. Brooks, op. cit. ,p. 63. 1(38156 New management techniques and educational planning In Norway, models are made separately for each level of education. They show the costeffects of variations in the nwnber of pupils or students, in the number of hours of instruction perweek, in the salaries of teachers and professors, in the size of classes etc.It appears, however, that models can play an especially interesting part at the universitylevel.Owing to the many different kinds of instruction given by a university and the diversity of itsactivities, efficient direction and management of the institution requires definite knowledge of therelationships existing between the different departments and a steady flow of information coveringthe operations of these departments.A model capable of simulating the operation of the university can therefore be extremelyuseful.It can show all the possible effects of a change in the general policy of the university. More-over, the size of the university and the possibility of gathering complete information on the operationof the different departments make it possible to set up relatively detailed models which are more orless true to the institution which they supposedly represent.It is especially in North America that such models have been developed. They are used, forexample, in the Universities of California, Purdue and Michigan - but it is the experience of theUniversity of Toronto which strikes us as being the most interesting.A pilot model was set up in 1965 to simulate the operation of the College of Science. Thisfirst model, which was known as CAMPUS I (Comprehensive Analytical Methods for Planning inUniversity Systems), served subsequently as a basis for a twofold development. The first of thesewas its extension to the entire complex of the University of Toronto in the form of CAMPUS II, andthe second development, which is in a certain sense more interesting, consisted in the use of thismethodology for planning the reorganization and development of the College of Medicine and theUniversity Hospital System.This research, conducted by Professors Judy and Levine, is being carried forward and isexpected to culminate shortly in the construction of a CAMPUS III model which will be more generaland flexible enough to be applied to a wide range of universities and to the establishment of aPlanning-Programming-Budgeting System for institutions of higher education.It can be seen that experience in the utilization of simulation models in educational planningis still too recent for definite conclusions to be drawn. It nevertheless appears, on the basis of theresults so far obtained, that models are destined to play an increasingly important role in educationalmanagement and in educational planning. ConclusionThe introduction of new management techniques into educational administration and planning has notbeen accomplished without incurring a certain amount of hostility or without giving rise to someobjections. 169157 Administrative aspects of educational planning The objection which is most commonly made is that these techniques are essentially quanti-tative.It is agreed that they increase the amount of information available and that they theoreticallyfacilitate better decisions.But this improvement in the way of informational data involves only thequantifiable aspects, and by putting the major stress on these aspects we run the risk of attributingtoo great an importance to them and, consequently, of neglecting other aspects which may be equallyimportant.Another objection, which is more subtle because it is indirect, is that these techniques arecomplicated and difficult for a non-specialist to understand and use. A non-specialist who desires touse them is therefore obliged to appeal to the specialists for assistance and to put his trust in theiranalysis.That state of dependency may lead to two dangers, which are to a certain extent combined.The first danger is what Herbert Simon has called the aphasia of the mathematician :'Some relatively simple management problems turn out to be far toolarge for even such a powerful tool as linear programming. It is easyfor the operations research enthusiast to underestimate the stringencyof these conditions.This leads to an ailment that might be calledmathematician's aphasia.The victim abstracts the original problemuntil the mathematical intractabilities have been removed (and all sem-blance to reality lost), solves the new simplified problem and then pre-tends that this was the problem he wanted to solve all along. He expects the manager to be so dazzled by the beauty of the mathematical resultsthat he will not remember that his practical operating problem has notbeen handled'. 1/The second danger has been described in the following terms by Rourke and Brooks :'Some university administrators have charged institutional researchdirectors with being overly preoccupied with the niceties of methodo-logy to the point where their studies lack application to practicaluniversity problems.Several of the university officials questioned inthe course of this study complained that institutional research directorswere far too much concerned with turning out reports that would bringthem esteem in the eyes of their statistically oriented colleagues and notenough interested in undertaking studies that would contribute to thesolution of actual problems with which the university was confronted'. 2/Although these objections are to some extent well-founded, the dangers which they mention wouldappear to be considerably overrated. Where they have so far been applied, the new managementtechniques have not, in any instance, caused the regular top-level administrator to be replaced byspecialists in these techniques. They have, however, changed to some extent the behaviour of theseadministrators, and in particular their way of examining and solving their problems. Far from beingsimply a method for weighing and measuring all the possible effects of a given policy, the new manage-ment techniques reflect a state of mind and a way of looking at things. They are used to apply a 1/Herbert Simon, op. cit., p. 72.2/F. Rourke and 0. Brooks, op. cit., p. 52. 17015d New management techniques and educational planning rigorous method to the complex process of identifying problems and seeking their solution. Theyaim at the deepest and most complete analysis possible. It is doubtless impossible to introduceall factors into this analysis and it doubtless happens that the 'optimal' solution to which the analy-sis leads is not adopted and that another solution is preferred, precisely because of the necessityof allowing for factors which have not been included. But in that case it is at least possible, bycomparing the two solutions, to measure the additional costs involved in these factors, whetherthey be political or of some other character. 17115J JOB IDENTIFICATION AND 0 AND M TECIINIQUESIN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION by R. W. Silversides PREAMI3LE I am delighted at being given the opportunity of expounding upon the 'virtues' of Organizationand Methods, although, as you may well be aware, there is a considerable 'wind of change'blowing through the management services corridor. It is the view of some that 0 and M hasa limited future and that other more sophisticated or developed management servicetechniques will replace it.In case you are not familiar with the management services worldgenerally, the following are just some of these new management services skills which arebeing prosecuted with vigour on both sides of the Atlantic:Work studyNow developed well beyond the days of time and motion study.Operational researchSeen originally as the mathematicians' world but now regardedby some as having an application to any work situation. Some operational research units even include psychologists.CyberneticsA development of operational research. Particularly concerned with the application of the principles of re-activation.Computer applicationsNow extended well beyond financial processes.Ergonomic sThe ergonomists are modest but are making an increasing contribu-tion on the determination of efficient working conditions. 173160 Administrative aspects of educational planning In addition to the above, there are many sub- or ancillary techniques, e. g. cost-benefitanalysis, discounted cash flow, issue mapping, network analysis and planned programmedbudgeting.A whole new vocabulary is being created for each of these new techniques, which iscausing increased confusion to those at the receiving end. Targets, goals, performance,programmes, etc. can, as a character says in 'Through the Looking-glass', be made to meanalmost anything you want them to mean.There is an urgent need for the establishment of some lingua franca, preferably onan international basis.However, in spite of these many developments there is still a role for 0 and M, thetechniques for which have at least stood the test of time. In fact, none of the other manage-ment services is so well equipped as 0 and M in ascertaining, accurately, the facts on awork situation, the subject of a study.I shall therefore be confining this paper to 0 and M. The examples to which I shallrefer later are not hypothetical. They are all real, and I should be very surprised indeed tolearn that improving the efficiency of administrative and clerical work in all organizations,including education, has been fully achieved without any assistance from 0 and M. 0 AND M TECHNIQUES It would be impracticable to attempt to describe 0 and M techniques in any detail and theextent of their application would, of course, be dependent upon the terms of reference.However, the following is an abbreviated description of the basic techniques:Preliminary surveyThis is a brief study to ascertain the nature of the administrative structure, to identify workor activities by groups or other classifications and to verify the manpower resource in termsof numbers, location, etc.An outline structure would be obtained at this stage. (An examplewill be projected. )It is unlikely that a preliminary survey would reveal serious under-working, although a party of 0 and M officers when visiting the Vatican asked the Pope, 'Howmany people work here ?', to which the Pope replied, 'About half of them'. Fact ascertainmentThis consists of ascertaining, from individual employees by personal interview and from othersources, full details of the procedures and quantities of work. It takes a considerable amountof time, requires training and experience and has its own sub-techniques. 174161 Job identification and 0 and M techniques in educational administration Fact recordingFacts, when fully ascertained from all persons concerned with an identifiable activity arerecorded in various ways to illustrate, in particular, work flow and other important aspects.(A flow chart will be projected at the seminar. ). In addition to flow process charting, otherforms are used to illustrate, diagramatically, quantities of work and especially periodici-ties, i.e. to determine whether the work has a regular or irregular flow. Fact analysisThe whole purpose of fact analysis is to find alternative ways of performing the work whichwill result in it being done quicker or better - or preferably both. Many analytical techniquesare used but one, known as procedure questioning, is an example. The principal questionsused. are:WHAT?This is to establish the purpose of the work and whether the purposeis being fulfilled.It is fundamentally an objective question. A female clerk who spent a lot of time making entries in a columnarregister (the purpose of which was obscure) was asked 'What is thisregister used for?'She replied 'I use it to sit on when I want to dosome typing'.WHERE? This may call for a whole series of sub-analyses. The question could be whether the work is in the right room, i. e. whether it isinterrelated to other work but physically divorced from it. Or it could be whether the work is performed at the centre but could bemore efficiently achieved at the perimeter.WHEN?This is a time-cycle question. The work may have a time cycle of a month but could be more economically performed, with equallygood results, by using three months as the time cycle. In some clerical activities, however, the time cycle may have equal signi-ficance within the span of a day. A logical sequence of clericalactivity within a short period of time may have a considerableeffect on productivity.Motion economy would be a sub-analyticalstudy.HOW?This is the basic and detailed methods question. It is not only aimed at maximizing the use of source documents and avoiding unnecessaryback-tracking but is also of significance in considering the use ofmechanical aids which can range from an adding machine to acomputer.WHO?With the greater use of specialized skill in administrative and clericalwork it becomes increasingly important to ensure that all work isappropriate to the person's skill. Rates of pay are normally a reflec- tion of a person's skill and nothing would be more wasteful than to usea highly skilled person on routine work.WHY?A fundamental question intended to establish whether the work needs tobe performed at all.It has, of course, a distinct relationship to thequestion WHAT?175162 Administrative aspects of educational planning The completion of all fact analysis is not, of course, the end of an 0 and M study. The build-ing up of alternative and better methods of working then follows and, finally, a report. Thereport is a very important document as it is essential that it should prove that the proposalswould lead to greater efficiency and usually to economy.After the report has been considered and the proposals adopted, implementation andfollow-up service would be required from the 0 and M unit. EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION AND 0 AND M The preliminary survey already referred to would almost certainly reveal that the work of aneducation administrative organization would fall into two main categories. The subjectivegroup would be identified with elements of the educational pattern, e.g. primary, secondary,further, higher.The second category, known as functional, would not be identifiable with anyparticular subject but would be seen to be the support role necessary throughout the entiresubjective field.Some examples of functional activities would be supplies, building maintenance,transport, staffing, finance, etc.It is true that in some education organizations the functional activities would be indirect vertical relationship to the subjective. For example, a group of persons responsiblefor primary school administration might also provide such schools with their supplies, trans-port, staffing, etc.Similar functional provisions would also be part of the administrativestructure of a group responsible for secondary education. In other educational organizations,however, the functions would be almost entirely divorced from the subjects.It would not be proper in a paper of this kind to attempt to expound at great length onthe organizational structure of education administration. There are many alternatives.Reference to some organizational problems will be made at the end of this paper.Whatever the nature of the existing organization may be, the functional aspects wouldcertainly be identifiable and would be worth some detailed study as they are the kind of activityfor which 0 and M studies can produce really worthwhile results in terms of over-allefficiency.The following are some examples: Supp liesA very wide variety of materials is required by all educational establishments. These wouldrange from laboratory equipment and pianos to dusters and towels in the washrooms. Thecapital or non-consumable materials might represent the largest sum of money but the 1761B Job identification and 0 and M techniques in educational administration consumables certainly generate the most administrative and clerical activity. The maincategory of consumer goods required by all schools would include textbooks, stationery,cleaning materials, fuel, crockery, etc.There are many alternative means for ensuring that schools receive these materialswhen required and when needed and in the quantities required. Two main alternatives likelyto be encountered ineducational organization might be summarized as follows:(a) The Education Office arranges a contract(s) by competitivetender, thus ensuring that the goods are of the lowest price com-mensurate with the quality required. Schools send their requisitions (either at predetermined intervals or as and whenrequired) to the Education Office where they are examined forreasonableness.A clerk then prepares a formal order to bepassed on to the approved contractor who supplies the goodsdirect to the school.The account is received by the EducationOffice who send it to the school concerned to confirm delivery.The school returns the invoice to the Education Office who certifythe account for payment.(It is assumed that there is a standardprocess for the payment or all accounts. )(b) The Education Office arranges contract(s) similar to thosereferred to in (a) but maintains stocks of some, if not all, of thematerials in an Education Office store. On receipt of requisitions from schools the Education Office sends the goods to the schools(by post or by using the Education Office transport). This pro- cedure would not call for invoice certification but almost certainlywould involve some system of debit and credit transfers betweenthe appropriate accounts.The analysis of procedure (a) would show that, in addition to clerical work in theschools, there was a considerable amount of clerical work in the Education Office, togetherwith the cost of stationery, postage, etc. The analysis would also show that the examinationfor 'reasonableness' was to a large extent notional and that the Education Office activity wasmainly concerned with transcribing requisitions into formal orders with the consequentfurther flow of paper already described.Alternative (b) would almost certainly show a greater saving on the contract pricebecause the Education Office had placed orders for large quantities to be held in their ownstore.However, the cost of maintaining a store with all the ancillary requirements ofstores control, together with the cost of conveying the goods from the central store to theschools, would probably show that the greater purchasing discounts were completely offsetby the cost of maintaining the store.A third alternative would, therefore, emerge from the 0 and M analysis. Thearranging of central contracts would be accepted as the most economical and satisfactorymeans for achieving the lowest prices. If, however, schools were allowed to place ordersdirect to the contractors (as notified by the Education Office each year) and if schools 177164 Administrative aspects of educational planning received invoices direct from the contractors and certified them for payment by the EducationOffice, all other clerical work in the Education Office could be discontinued. It might be arguedthat this alternative system would call for more clerical activity in the schools but this wouldnot only be very small in terms of time per order but, dispersed over all the schools concerned,would be infinitesimal.It might also be felt that proper financial controls by the Education Office would berelinquished, but there is ample evidence to show that schools could themselves effect a satis-factory financial control within the limitations determined by the Education Office by the simpleaddition of invoices or priced orders.The financial saving which could be achieved by this system would, of course, bedependent upon the size of the Education Authority organization. But an average EnglishEducation Authority could expect net savings of the order of \u00a36, 000 to \u00a37, 000 per annum. Staff advertisementsAdvertising staff vacancies is only one part, and a small part, of the staffing function. As inthe case of all functional activities there are many alternatives. The 0 and M study wouldhave shown that the first person to be informed of the resignation of a teacher or otheremployee in a school would be the head teacher. It may well be that the Education Officewould require to know of the resignation for the purpose of their staffing records, payroll, etc.but the activity required for the purpose of ensuring that an advertisement was placed in theproper newspapers or journals would be a sub-activity of the staffing records section of theEducation Office or would call for data transmission to another section of the Education Officeresponsible for advertisements. At this stage, the determination of the wording of the advertise-ment would be made and the advertisement placed, either direct with the newspapers or journalsto be used, or through advertising agents who themselves would place the advertisements.The 0 and M study would show that, for the majority of the staffing vacancies, standardwording was being used and that the newspapers and journals were almost always the same foreach category of employee.This being so,it would follow that the Education Office was only a part of the communi-cation system between the school and the newspaper or journal. The placing of advertisementsby schools direct with advertising agents would call for practically no additional work in theschools, would reduce the delay in the advertisements appearing and would save the whole ofthe clerical transcription in the Education Office.The 0 and M study would probably also produce further economies in wording.In an average English Education Authority the total savings would be of the order of\u00a33, 000 to \u00a34, 000 per annum. 178165 Job identification and 0 and M techniques in educational administration Maintenance of buildingsThe work involved in maintaining schools and other educational establishments falls into twomain categories:(a) planned maintenance, e. g. decorations, improvements andalterations;(b) day-to-day repairs which could not have been foreseen.The bulk of the maintenance money would almost certainly be incurred in respect ofcategory (a) but the amount of administrative and clerical work (as distinct from technicaland professional) would be considerably less than that which would be involved in controllingthe day-to-day repairs.There are many alternative procedures for day-to-day repairs but a fairly typicalone would be for a school to communicate (in writing or by telephone) with the EducationOffice describing the repair requiring attention. These minor repairs would include,especially in the winter months, burst pipes, dripping taps, leaking radiators, broken window-panes, door locks, blocked drains, etc.On receipt of the request from the school a clerk in the Education Office would thenprepare an order for the work to be done (as described by the school) and pass this ordereither to a contractor or to another officer in charge of the gang of men responsible for schoolrepairs work.The 0 and M analysis would show that the procedure did not give rise to any effectivecontrols in the Education Office. It would be impossible to limit the number of repairs toburst pipes, merely because there was insufficient money in the budget. Such repairs wouldhave to be attended to instantly. Equally, it would be impracticable for anyone in the EducationOffice to place an order for work to be done other than in the way it had been described by theschool.So far as the subsequent invoice process was concerned this would be similar to thatdescribed for supplies, i. e. it would include a considerable amount of back-tracking betweenthe Education Office and the schools before the invoice was certified for payment.Therefore to allow schools to place orders direct with approved contractors (or withthe direct labour force) for a whole range of minor repairs would not involve any greaterexpenditure, would reduce or eliminate the time lag and would enable reductions to be madein the clerical staff employed on this work in the Education Office.In an average Education Authority, the savings would be of the order of \u00a32, 000 to\u00a33, 000 per annum. 17916 6 Administrative aspects of educational planning Pay certificationAll pay certificates would be most likely to originate at the source, i. e. the school.If thecalculation of gross and net pay and the making of salary and wages payments were the dutyof an accountant or treasurer (whether located in the Education Office or not) it would beessential for that person to have full details of all employees, including basic rates of pay,conditions, etc.An 0 and M survey would, first, establish that all pay certificates were routedthrough the Education Office and the purpose of the activity (in the Education Office) wouldbe carefully analysed.The application of the procedure question, already referred to, would almostcertainly establish first that there was a considerable element of duplication of recordsbetween the Education Office and the accountant and secondly that the examination of the paycertificates in the Education Office was confined to verifying the arithmetic which had alreadybeen verified at the school and was subsequently verified by the accountant/paymaster.It would be clear, therefore, that if pay certificates were routed direct from schoolto accountant/paymaster no additional work would be required in the school or accountant'sdepartment and there would be a reduction in transmission time.The savings in the Education Depa-tment would be, for an average English county,of the order of approximately \u00a32, 000 to \u00a33, 000 per annum. CENTRALIZATION VIS-A-VIS DECENTRALIZATION It might be felt, from the examples given, that the essence of 0 and M in its application toeducation administration lies in the determination of what should be performed at the centreand what could be equally well performed at the perimeter. Although it would not be true tosay that 0 and M suffers from this kind of limited vision, it is nevertheless submitted thatthere is very considerable scope for achieving savings in education administration cost by athorough examination of this question.In addition to the functions already described in some detail, the same benefits could ,mutatis mutandis, be achieved in respect of many other functions.It is at this point, however, that some further thought is required to be given to thequestion of centralization or decentralization. The strongest argument for undertaking anactivity at the centre is either because it is considered to be the only place where the skillrequired exists or because the aggregation of the work produces a maximization ofproductivity. 18016 Job identification and 0 and M techniques in educational administration In the examples given there is ample evidence that the type of clerical skill or eventhe purpose of the activity at the centre does not result in benefits of this kind. In fact clericalskill might be over-rated.It is the advent of the third-generation computers, however, which gives rise to somenew thought on centralization. The larger and more expensive the machine the more it becomesnecessary to aggregate the work at some centre where such a machine could justify itsexistence.It could not be considered prodigal to provide every school with a typewriter or aduplicator but it would require a very large school indeed to justify an accounting machine andonly a giant technical college might establish a case for a computer for teaching and ancillarypurposes.It is probable, therefore, that in order to make the greatest use of modern computers,some data, at present only existing at the school level, would have to be centralized in orderthat it might be processed to the benefit of effective education administration. For example,it might not be necessary for the Education Office to know, from week to week, the number ofpupils in schools and certainly unnecessary for them to have any more details of age, sex, etc.The ability of a computer to process such data in a way which would facilitate the taking ofdecisions by the Education Authority at regular and predetermined intervals might well requirea fresh approach to this problem.However, the real benefits of computers to be derived by administrative structuresshould take the form of feedback information from the computer. Thus data transmissionshould, so far as possible, be direct from source to computer with feedback to the EducationOffice for executive decisions. This would lead to the further elimination of clerical recordsand processes in the Education Office and establish its proper role, uncluttered by tedious andnon-dynamic activity. CONTROLS All this leads, inevitably, to an examination of the whole purpose of controls as an essentialfeature of education administration; in fact they might be regarded as the administrativeraison d'\u00eatre.The activities, the subject of administrative controls are many and various with anequally wide range of control mechanisms. It would be impracticable to categorize all themany and usually cogent reasons for controls but the following would certainly be advanced inany education administrative organization: 181168 Administrative aspects of educational planning (i)to ensure that all parts of the organization, e. g. schools, were'kept in step' and that none of them was allowed to enjoy facilitiesor privileges greater than those allowed for comparable schools;(ii)that no employee within the organization, e. g. head teachers,exceeded their powers and duties;(iii) that monies determined for the performance of the activitieswere not exceeded.The basic problems to be resolved in the establishment and maintenance of controlmechanisms and vitally affecting the use of administrative and clerical manpower are:(a) whether to control the 'issue' or the 'user':(b) whether to control the norm (viz the situation represented bythe substantial majority) or to control each situation 'on its merits'.A very simple example of the alternatives of control on 'issue' or 'user' could bematerials required by a clerk in the office. He might be told that he could have six pencils ayearno more. Or he might be told that, when his pencil is worn, he should produce thestub to his supervisor who would then issue him with another.So if both the control mechanisms are used, the number of pencils to be issued ispredetermined but the clerk still has to produce each stub for each fresh issue.If this very simple example is extended to schools it would be immediately apparentthat the dual control would achieve no more efficiency or economy than one or other of thecontrol mechanisms.It would simply require nearly twice the administrative and clericalmanpower.Controlling off the 'norm', or management by exception, is more difficult to definebut evidence of attempts to control all possible variations as well as the norm would emergefrom an 0 and M survey.It would be seen to clutter the procedures, the form, the records,the registers, etc.An example would be the health of school children. What was to be accepted as'normal' would have been predetermined and doctors and others would examine for the purposeof ascertaining the abnormal. But the massive returns or backing records could include animmense amount of detail which merely showed that a child was normal. Thus identifying theabnormal for action purposes would be made more difficult, the fields of search would bewidened, clerical errors would be more likely to occur and delays would increase.All controls should be the subject of regular, if not continuous, review and with orwithout assistance from 0 and M. Their purpose should be dynamic and objective and notbased upon concepts both outmoded and outdated. 1821.0 Job identification and 0 and M techniques in edcuationat administration ANCILLARY METHODS All that has been said so far is related to the methods studies which form an integral part of acomprehensive 0 and M review. The ancillary or supporting clerical activities are alsostudied.Two are worth mentioning: FilingAn office filing system or systems can so easily be regarded by those concerned as merely arepository for letters and other papers upon which action has been taken. An 0 and M studywould not only reveal the inefficiency which can stem from a badly designed or fragmentedfiling system but would also highlight the amount of time spent by employees, of various levels,in searching for letters which could not be easily traced.The arguments in favour of a centralized filing system in an Education Office are over-whelming unless such an office has to be accommodated in several different buildings. It wouldbe unlikely that only certain administrative or clerical staff used files peculiar to them and in agood filing system it is essential that all persons, of whatever level, shall be able to ascertainthe full history of any situation without having to refer to colleagues who may have other portionsof the history.The 0 and M contribution to filing would be comprehensive, i. e. a proposed new systemwould be described and determined in detail together with proposals for the storage of obsoletedocuments and the provision of a broughtforward service, etc.Revisions to filing systems would probably not show any direct labour savings butwould certainly improve the work flow and, in many cases, provide a better service to thegeneral public and other interested parties. Forms design In all the procedures studied during the course of an 0 and M survey it would be unlikely tofind that there were no forms. Good forms design is a specialized 0 and M skill and it wouldnot be possible for me to describe this in any detail. It would certainly not be true to suggestthat 0 and M aims at getting rid of forms: in fact, in many cases, new forms may be proposedin order to eliminate written or typewritten material. A good range of well-designed forms isthe very essence of first-class clerical processes, although an 0 and M study showed, in onecase, not only a very large number of forms but one, which consisted of a plain piece of paperheaded 'Form to be used when no other form is applicable': 18317t) Administrative aspects of educational planning WORK MEASUREMENT Work measurement, by any definition, has already reached out beyond the confines of themanual worker.In fact it could be upheld, by some, that it has no frontiers, no limits.That it is as feasible to measure the work of professional people, such as lawyers or doctorsor teachers, as it is to measure the work of a man who digs holes in the road.It would be quite impracticable, in the limited time available, to expound upon, orexplain, the increasing range of work measurement techniques. But because the applicationof them to clerical work (including Education Office clerical work) is now being vigorouslypursued, they are worth a brief mention.An 0 and M study of an Education Office clerical structure would be unlikely toresult in all clerical and administrative procedures being changed. Many would be found tobe efficient.Work measurement would therefore be applied:(a)to work as performed (no changes proposed);(b)to proposed revised methods of working.The first application might take the form of averaging or rated activity. It is probablethat an increase in productivity of between 10 per cent and 30 per cent could be expected.The second application would take into account the labour savings to be achieved byrevised methods but would produce a further saving by requiring an increase in productivityas well.Thus, if the revised methods showed a saving of 25 per cent the total saving would bebetween :35 per cent and 55 per cent.Identifying the work elements would be the first essential and the use of predeterminedmotion time standards would be limited. However, typing is a simple example. Line or tapmeasurement would be the predetermined standard. The following results could be expected: (a)35 shorthand typists(b) conversion to audio typing(reduction of 35 shorthand typiststo 24 audio typists)(c) application of line production standard(24 audio typists reduced to 21)Salaries\u00a3 20, 000 per annum\u00a313, 000 per annum En, 000 per annum Cost of audio equipment would have to be set off against the savings but the equipment cost wouldbe not more than \u00a31, 000 per annum.Does work measurement in the office mean that financial incentives must be awardedfor determined increases in productivity? It would be too early to give a categoric answer tothis question but there is already ample evidence that the 'bonus incentive motivation' attitude 184171 Job identification and 0 and M techniques in educational administration (which is regarded as the essence of manual workers bonus schemes) could not only beexpected of clerical workers but would actually be expected bi them.Could this be extended to education administration? There might be some difficultyin identifying the work elements of senior administrators but it would be possible to establishsome workload standards however indirect they might be. It could bel-held that the quality ofthe work would suffer from this approach. But even quality may have to be included in thework measurement formula. What teacher would not claim that he could do a better-qualityjob if he had less pupils.How many less?Work measurement has a long way to go. It is certainly going! PROBLEMS PECULIAR TO EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION The need to achieve an even or equitable work flow has already been referred to. ManyO and M proposals are aimed at achieving this in order to overcome the staffing problem.Too often a study would show that the staffing provision was based upon peak load periods.This problem is particularly marked in education administration. The schoolholidays could amount, in total, to fourteen weeks a year and the effect upon the workloadin the Education Office during this period would be most marked. In addition, an importantcommunication point, viz the school, would cease to exist during the holidays and many pro-cedures would cease to operate.Even allowing for administrative and clerical staff holidays there would still be abalance of ten/eleven weeks of the year when they were at work and the teachers and pupilswere not.It is difficult to find a completely satisfactory answer to this problem but the engage-ment of a proportion of the clerical and typing manpower on a 42-week basis instead of 52would certainly show some savings and would relate that resource more directly to workloadrequirements.The second, and particularly difficult problem, could be described as 'reconcilingthe individual with the pattern'. Some reference has been made to establishing the norm ormanagement by exception.This would not only be necessary for the less personal aspects ofthe service, e. g. maintenance, but even for the very personal, e. g. student grants. Todetermine every case on its merits would not only call for a prodigal use of administrativeand clerical manpower but would be likely to result in almost all decisions being challengedas unfair or inequitable. 185172 Administrative aspects of educational planning An important provision, which would go some way towards meeting this problem,would be to adopt that well known maxim of the Courts of Justice, 'Justice must not only bedone.It must be seen to be done'. The standards upon which decisions affecting individualsare taken should be made known to those affected or likely to be affected. Not all would seethem as fair, but a great deal of time could be saved in explaining why the decision had beentaken.The filing system might not need so much space: ORGANIZATION Almost all the illustrations and observations made in this paper have so far been concernedwith the Methods part of 0 and M. I would like, therefore, first to summarize the Methods andwork measurement analyses from the point of view of the most efficient organization and,secondly, to return to the relationship between the subjective and functional categories referredto at the beginning of this paper.The performance of a functional activity at tha perimeter, viz a school, saves a con-siderable amount of communication and avoids back-tracking. It would be nice to include somecomments about general semantics. What is disturbing is that, perhaps because the specializedvocabulary is being enlarged, good communication is extremely difficult to achieve. In theexample of building maintenance which has been given, a caretaker may describe part of theschool in his way, the head teacher gives it a different description and the clerk in the EducationOffice makes what he thinks is a point of clarification. When it reaches the surveyor or con-tractor he cannot make head nor tail of itThe functional work in the Education Office should therefore be confined to that wherea central control mechanism is essential or where only the aggregation of the work can achievethe proper use of specialized skill.What are some of these specialized skills? Figure ability is clearly one of them.Computers may do all the arithmetic, but correlating figures, identifying the abnormal from ascrutiny of figures, absorbing two or more sets of interrelated figures call for an aptitude notpossessed by all.So the first functional grouping of work should be the 'figure' group. This would in-clude salaries and wages, revenue and capital expenditure and general statistics.A second skill could be called 'report writing'. This would not be confined to reportsproper but the correspondence activities. Placing of children in schools, staff appointments,committee agenda and minutes are just examples of the report-writing group. 186173 Job identification and 0 and M techniques in educational administration A third skill is 'recording'.This might appear to be a simple skill but mind/handco-ordination should not be underrated in the office. A good filing clerk must be accurate buthis rate of working would be vitally affected by his mind/hand co-ordination ability.So the recording group would include filing, staff records, iltventories, supplies, etc.The typing and duplicating skill hardly requires any description.These aggregations of skills secure first that the administrative and clericalaptitudes can be clearly identified. Recruitment of such manpower should be objective. Thereshould be tests aimed at verifying that appropriate aptitudes are possessed. To recruit aclerk for an Education Office on the vague information that he has certain educational ctsrtifi-cates or that he has worked in another office is quite inadequate. It is essential that he shouldbe recruited with a specific and predetermined skill in mind.The second benefit to be derived from skills aggregation is that it enables the levelsof work to be properly determined, i. e. a good 'division of labour' can be achieved. Frag-mentation would probably mean that half the staff were doing some work above their ability(and pay) and the other half were spending measurable parts of their time on routine dutiesbelow their skill.A third benefit is that it ensures the proper provision of supervisers. Almost allpeople require supervision if their performance and the standard of their work is to be properlymaintained.Would supervision of functional activities in an Education Office call for trainingin the subjective background, viz education? Probably not. The functional activity could soonbe learned.Supervisory skill should be sought and training in the work given if necessary.Knowledge of the job is not the first requirement of a really good supervisor.Work measurement could now be applied to activities, the skill requirements for whichhad been aggregated.The identification of a denominator (or countable unit) is of great signifi-cance when applying work measurement. It provides the essential control mechanisms forverifying performance (by individuals or by groups) against the goal or target. The denominator,e. g. number of orders or invoices, etc. would probably vary from day to day but it would beperfectly feasible to assess the performance over a period of, say, one month.Furthermore, the aggregation of skills would facilitate another important aspect ofwork measurement and its related job evaluation. The essence.of both these techniques wouldbe to establish a fair and proper relativity, viz of productivity and of level of pay.If time permitted it might be an appropriate moment to expound upon job evaluation.However, sufficient to say that the weighted points analogue approach has proved to be the mostsuitable for administrative and clerical work in an education organization.Weighted points analogue consists of identifying the work elements (ground common towork measurement), selecting the appropriate analogue from a comprehensive table of analogues Administrative aspects of educational planning and weighting it (at par or above) according to the table. The total points scored would then becompared with other posts to establish the table of relativity. It would then be a simple matterto apply an existing pay structure to the relativities.It should, perhaps, be added that job evaluation would normally be included in an0 and M study and would be of particular importance in connection with any changes in methodsor organization which stemmed from the study.It should be fairly clear that, although the functional requirements of education admini-stration have not been exhaustively catalogued, the building up of a functional structure on thelines indicated would maximize the efficiency and economy aspect.The outstanding question, referred to at the beginning of this paper, is the relation-ship between the functional and subjective activities.Subjective work would probably fall into definable,,groups, e. g. primary, secondary,further, higher and each of these would have its own specialization, e. g. physical education,domestic science, handicrafts, etc.The purposes of the subjective groups would be twofold:(a)to examine the educational provisions, to forecast future needs(normal growth), to plan and implement changes in basic patterns;(b)to determine, on a day-to-day basis, educational problemsstemming from the fulfilment of the curricular and on extra-curricularactivities.Assuming the provision of the necessary staff for the functional activities theimmediate support required by those responsible for the subjective work would be surprisinglysmall.Out of a total staff of, say, 100, 90 or more would be on functional work.The scope for applying 0 and M to the subjective work would, therefore, be limited.The major problem would, however, be the organizational one of relating thefunctional to the subjective.First, it would have to be accepted that the persons in charge of the subjects had agreater responsibility than those in charge of the functions. By any job evaluation standardstheir fields of discretion would be wider, their time span of responsibility would be more signi-ficant and their commitment of money and materials (in the long term) greater.Thus a structure on the following lines would appear to reflect the situation:PrimarySecondarFurtherHigher Report writingRecordingEtc. Figureroue 188170 Job identification and 0 and M techniques in educational administration But a structure on these lines would be certain to cause a bottleneck and would createproblems because those in charge of the functions would each have four 'bosses'.An alternative would be to provide for a co-ordination of the subjective activitieswhose role would include relating the functional support to the several subjective requirements.The communication channels for this kind of structure would be unwieldy. Informationwould have to be fed upwards (to the co-ordinator) before being transmitted downwards tovarious parts of the functional groups.It should perhaps be emphasized that communication is of the greatest importance.An intended change in the pattern of secondary education or selection for secondary schools,for example, would call for a radical change in many procedures and records. There have,perhaps, been too many examples in education administration when the best of changes ineducation have been held up through lack of appropriate alternation in the functions.A third alternative, therefore, would be to establish a post to be occupied by a personin complete charge of all the functions.He might be seen as an administrative overlord. He would enjoy a status equal tothat of the persons in charge of the subjects, would be in day-to-day liaison with them andwould provide a two-way communication system.The structure would then be:PrimarySecondaryFurtherHigherAdministration There could, of course, be many permutations on this pattern but it would provide avery good base. CONCLUSIONS I hope I have been able to give you some idea of the contribution which can be made by 0 and Mto improving the efficiency of education administration.In the final analysis the essence of all management services is to propose alternativemeans for securing objectives. There is not a 'right' or 'wrong' way of doing anything. Butthere are some ways that are better than others. 189 Part IVTeaching the administrative aspectsof educational planning TEACHING THE ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF EDUCATIONALPLANNING by A . Abdul Day em IntroductionWhen educational planning first came into the limelight ,care was always taken to point out thateducational administration must adapt itself to the new requirements imposed by this planning. Itwas consequently expected that there would have to be a complete revolution in the structure of theadministration and in its responsibilities; it was felt that the functions of educational administra-tion would have to be set out anew and adapted to its new role.Although theoretically justified, this concern has nowadays practically disappeared. Theopposite view is beginning to take over , with the accent being increasingly placed on adaptationand change in the actual planning, the better to adapt to the progress achieved by the administra-tion. The nature and procedures of educational planning are being radically altered because of theideas and new techniques which have emerged in administration in general and in management inparticular. This paper will not be concerned with the theoretical question of whether planningshould be part of administratiLl or vice versa; nor with the important role of administration inthe different phases and procedures of planning. Nor will it be concerned to show how importantis the role of the organizational and decision-making services in effectively carrying out the plan,and reiterating in consequence an idea that has become almost self-evident, i.e. that administra-tion is the main factor in increasing productivity and in the efficient and optimum utilization ofresources.We wish to go further and say that educational planning appears more and more - andshould be so treated - as a planned administration, and that administration is consequently tendingto become a comprehensive planning technique. Hence educational planning can itself be treated asan aspect of administration, and vice versa. The point at issue is no longer to conciliate planningfunctions with administrative functions, but the amalgamation of the two. 19311Th Administrative aspects of educational planning 1.After experiments had been made in educational planning in several countries over anumber of years, procedure and the operational element acquired increased importance. It is ob-vious in all countries that the main snag in carrying out plans derives primarily from a certaininadequacy, while the plans are being drawn up, in the administrative procedures that are indis-pensable to their execution. To lay down the successive stages necessary to the elaboration of aplan, fix a time-table for its execution, do the programming that the attainment of its objectivesimplies, ensure liaison between those who provide the resources and those who use them and, inshort, make planning into a whole, and into a series of decisions, of measures to be taken, pro-grammes for execution, or even of plans - this , more and more , seems the very basis of effec-tive and realistic planning. Educational planning is thus reduced to a series of planned projects,stages and administrative procedures. The plan will be 'a series of successive approximations I .1./2. One of the aspects taken by the problem is the relation to be established betweenlong-term and short-term planning. Administrative procedures are usually annual, monthly oreven daily. Planning is rather long-term. From the outset, a way must be found of ensuringintrinsic and organic links between the long-term objectives laid down and the procedures forobtaining them. This means that long-term planning must be convertible into adequate short-termprocedures, that these procedures must be present at the very heart of the plan and be more orless immenent to its structure. The plans which are to anticipate the future must be conceived asprojects, stages and procedures capable of containing the present, and the administrative pro-cedures used to organize, direct ,co-ordinate and control the mechanisms which prefirure thefuture in the present must match up to what is expected of them in the context of the plan 'sobjectives.In short, not only must planning and administration pursue the same aims , but they mustbe undertaken jointly in the continuous process which is planned development.3. Accordingly, what are known as the new techniques in administration and managementmust become the main instrument for establishing these organic links between the long-term objec-tives of the plan and the administrative procedures which are to achieve them. Thanks to them , theseparation between planning techniques and administrative techniques become superficial and out-dated. A single technique is emerging, valid both for the planning and the administration of educa-tion. Administration techniques become in a way techniques impregnated with planning concerns,and planning techniques tend more and more to become practical procedures easily translated intoaction and capable of converting the plan into a series of plans and programmes. Unesco, Educational Planning: A Survey of Problems and Prospects.Paris, 1967, p. 159. 'Formulation and implementation of the plan aretherefore really a single major operation with which all those employedin national education are intimately associated.' 19417:7J Teaching the administrative aspects of educational planning To illustrate this trend it is hardly necessary to go into all the new techniques of manage-ment and administration, since colleagues at this seminar will be doing so. It need only be pointedout that these techniques give grounds for hoping for a complete integration of educational planningand educational administration, rendering planning 'administratable ' ,so to speak and, as statedabove, transforming planning into a comprehensive planning technique.For, as everyone knows, the new management techniques are not only execution tech-niques but above all are techniques of planning and forecasting. In speaking of the different methodswhich derive from systems analysis , operational analysis methods , the methods of technologicalforecasting, the methodology of rationalizing choices, graph techniques - in short all the modernmethods for decision-preparing, one is really dealing with techniques for forecasting, planning,or sometimes even perspective planning. Such techniques as support graphs , relevance trees,theDelphi method, critical path, PPBS (Planning-Programming-Budgeting Systems), are not onlymanagement and decision techniques but also techniques which can serve in elaborating plans andensuring from the outset that the plans established can be converted into practical stages andprojects. In fact, all that has been done in methodology for several years past with a view tointroducing new techniques into management are really ways of trying to improve the quality ofdecisions by introducing a scientific approach into the methods used for preparing the decisions.They thus establish an organic link between the elaboration of decisions and their execution.It is incidentally obvious that, thanks to planning, management and administration tech-niques have themselves undergone a development which better suits them for planning require-ments. Some in fact derive from planning and started as planning techniques. Gradually , however ,administration techniques which developed especially during the managerial revolution have inturn begun to gain the upper hand over planning techniques. Nowadays, this interaction is leadingto a progressive amalgamation of the two.4.If we take just a single example i.e. budgetary programming (PPBS), now beingexperimentally applied in education and in other sectors ,it can be clearly seen how this new ideaof programme plays an important role in the whole process of planning, and how it will change theperspective within which the links between the administration and the planning of education areseen. Budgetary planning, in the form of analytic studies which precede the establishment oflong-term plans ,or budgetary planning and its execution , provide a clear example of a short anda long-term educational planning tool, i.e. one which contains the seeds both of planning and ofadministration. It helps to bring into line and integrate the planning aims and the executionprogrammes , the structure of the objectives and the structure of the principal tool for theirattainment, i.e. finance. As the United Nations Manual for Programme and PerformanceBudgeting points out: 'Between a plan and a programme and performance budget, there arecertain structural similarities of form and common elements in the accounting for resource 195180 Administrative aspects of educational planning use.'S If a plan is mainly characterized by the utilization, in a given sector , of programmes andprojects as operational units, these features are also those of a budget programme. As a resultof the analogies in the form and orientation of operations , the budget programme is particularlysuited to the implementation of a plan and the evaluation of progress made in operations providedfor under the plan. 2/ Mr. Hirschl/ says this most directly when he points out that 'For planningto be capable of implementation the planning process must not end with the preparation of a set ofrecommendations or plans prepared in isolation from the programmes through which they must beimplemented. The mechanism for implementation includes the preparation of programmes inphysical and financial terms which ultimately are incorporated in the budget. 'Budgetary planning can thus be taken as an instrument among others which satisfies theneeds of 'administered' planning and a planned administration (development administration, to usethe fashionable term), and which, in the education sector, can be used to define the aims moreclearly (planning oriented towards execution) and identify various possible ways of obtaining theseobjectives (administration for planning).In practice, it offers a way of dealing with a well-known situation, namely that in a numberof countries any attempt at proper planning is made extremely difficult by the manner in whichbudgetary estimates are established.In thus showing up the fundamental links between the plan and the programmes , in clearlyshowing the important role which the idea of programme plays in the whole planning process , newtechniques such a PPBS mark the definitive acceptance of this trend towards a complete fusionbetween planning and administration. They declare administration, yet again , to be a comprehen-sive planning technique, one that fo-med and crystallized inside the communion between the two.If ,in short , planning is ,in the last analysis ,co-ordination in time and space, the effort requiredmust accordingly be primarily an effort of organization and management. P.H. Coombs says sospecifically: 'The needed revolution in education must begin with educational management '. 4/5. Quoting Coombs automatically evokes the world crisis in education and the role in itthat can be played by new and efficient educational administration. The fantastic increase in thepopulation of school age and the increasing social pressure on education that has to be reconciledwith limited human and material resources have brought educational administration to the j/ United Nations , A Manual for Programme and PerformanceBudgeting, New York, 1967, p. 3.2./ Id.,ibid.W.Z.

A second phase thus arrived only a few years back when greater weight began to be accordedin educational administration to systems analysis. The trend is thus more and more towards a newpoint which implies that administrative procedures, educational methods , schools and fiscal struc-tures should be analyzed as systems in the widest sense of the term. This new approach thushelped the transition from the scientific management and cult of efficiency stage to a new era inadministration which no longer insists on basing decisions regarding education only on minimumpossible cost and optimum financial efficiency. As Bodart and Hennionj/ point out in a very impor-tant paper , educational yield does not depend only on investment but on complex innovatory andregulatory operations.In thus developing, the new techniques in educational administration, based mainly onsystems analysis, take an important step towards re-establishing intimate links between the ad-ministration and the planning of education. They in fact try to take on the very rhythm of educa-tional action and seek the essence of the data of education. They aim at influencing teaching andmaking it more effective by operating on its qualitative and quantitative components and, above all,by considering education as a whole. This comprehensive approach which calls for new methods ofboth administration and planning is the most evident proof of the progressive fusion taking placebetween educational administration and educational planning.Such techniques as PPBS, cost efficiency analysis, the critical path method and otherswhich derive from systems analysis are all types of organization whose object is to improve thegeneral quality and efficiency of education. They start from the hypothesis that present educationalplanning techniques can be improved by developing analytic techniques which have proved themselvesin other sectors.Seen in this light 'planning is not a process of speculating on probable developments andpreparing a theoretical blueprint for meeting needs. Rather is it a process of attempting to deter-mine appropriate goals and objectives , obtaining and analyzing pertinent information that willbring into focus present and emerging problems and needs, and obtaining agreement on steps andprocedures that are designed to meet those needs so the objectives can be attained' .But now, if educational planning suffered at the beginning from the traditional and conser-vative administrative mechanism of education, is not educational administration, in the new perspec-tive that is opening up, suffering in turn from the now outmoded planning methods and concepts?1/ N.

P.xiii. 197182 Administrative aspects of educational planning It is true that the new perspective was in fact to a certain extent the fruit of the introduction ofplanning. It nevertheless had its own methods, originating in the management techniques which haveproved effective in other sectors, particularly in industry and in the armed forces. In any case, themain point is not to discover a relation of cause and effect between these new administrative tech-niques and planning but rather to show their common development towards the same end, theirinteraction, and their complete fusion.This long introduction has seemed necessary to reply to the question at issue the teaching of theadministrative aspects of educational planning. Its essential purpose is to arrive at the followingconclusion: it is not, in the last analysis, teaching of the administrative aspect of educationalplanning that should be examined; rather must the whole teaching of educational planning be thoughtout anew in the light of the new trend towards a more complete fusion between planning and admini-stration. As Eidej/ points out, planning should be considered as an administrative function. It isan instrument of efficient administration. It has no independent functions in itself, but only as partof the global administrative organization. The planning process , he explains, canonly in theorybe separated from the execution stage.What methods of teaching and training, accordingly , are likely tobe satisfactory fromthis point of view?1.Starting from this unity between administration and planning, planning should first betaught 'administratively' ,so to speak. The accent must be on the stages , the projects and theadministrative organization of the plan. Establishing a time-table for the elaboration and executionof the plan, describing the administrative decisions which must be taken at each stage and at eachmoment, analyzing all the arrangements and measures to be taken during the different stages ,showing the liaisons and relations with all the agencies concerned in the plan - all of these arethe procedures which are absolutely central to the teaching of educational planning. Above all itis necessary to analyze the process of elaboration, adoption, execution and evaluation, derive thestages operationally from the comprehensive whole, show the critical stages (not without cause,this expression recalls PERT-Programme Evaluation and Review Technique) , formulate themajor decisions, so as, finally ,to be able to see the whole process in a clear network of properlyrelated actions and interactions.2.This would appear to indicate using an active method in teaching educational planning,since only this active method can adapt itself to the approach just described and subsequentlyindicate the administrative quintessence which lies at the root of the planning process. An activemethod means attempting to initiate students in the real tasks an educational planner has to face.This initiation is made through a hypothetical example which takes in schematic form all the realwork of planning and administration that planners normally do. Such an example, describing theKjell Eide ,\"Organization of Educational Planning\", In EducationalPlanning. Syracuse University, 1964, pp. 72 and 74.1981 83 Teaching the administrative aspects of educational planning planning process in an imaginary country, will no doubt always be hypothetical and incapable ofsubstituting for a real situation. It can , however , be derived as far as possible from a realexample, and will in any case better help to explain the nature and mechanism of the planningprocess than ex-cathedra lecturing. In particular, it allows the practical application of the newtechniques of educational planning and administration, and faces students with organizationalproblems that are a challenge to their inventive spirit. By going into the actual details of theprocesses and methods employed, the students take part in their elaboration, their developmentand even in the creation of new methods. They thus find out the attitude of mind behind all of theefforts of research workers and planners to develop administrative and planning techniques.3. By this active method and hypothetical example ,students can be introduced to newtechniques of educational planning. To establish a time-table, prepare a plan for the training ofplanners or administrative staff survey the state of education in the country, organize a pub-licity and explanation campaign, lay plans for the preparation of programmes, try out such pro-grammes, etc. , students can use such techniques as 'chrono' , critical path relevance trees.They are introduced to programming by studying certain sectors of a plan (construction, equip-ment, training of teachers, etc.) or certain major projects within the plan (primary education,extension of compulsory schooling by a year, science teaching in secondary schools, access tohigher education, etc.). They also learn to establish links between programmes and theirfinancing, and to understand the point and importance of programme budgets, the difference be-tween these and functional or traditional budgets, and the internal logic. of these programmebudgets, which are a daring attempt to link planning with administration. Other methods such ascost efficiency analysis , the Delphi method, or operational research can obviously also findtheir place in this exercise, this point of concentration. There are various possible exercisesfor showing the applicability of different operational research methods to the solution of particularproblems of school policy. j/ Other exercises could show the contribution these techniques canmake to educational management problems: implantation of schools, organization of schooltransport, construction of school buildings , allocation of classrooms , recruitment of teachers,student selection, and so on.Besides these different activities, dealt with as part of the active method, sufficient attentionmust be given - so far as possible within this active project, or otherwise outside it - to certainproblems which more particularly concern the administrative side of educational planning. 1/ Using these methods, pilot projects have been carried out in theUnited Kingdom, Yugoslavia and other countries on such questions asthe structural reform of secondary education, the problems raisedby the extension of compulsory schooling, and the criteria to be usedin the allocation of resources for investment in technical education.19918(1Administrative aspects of educational planning 1.The structure of the educational planning agencies and their different types must bestudied and analyzed. Advantage can be taken of experiments in other countries , choosing the mosttypical. Experience in the Soviet Union and in France for example, could be particularly useful;likewise that of a developing country.The structure of educational agencies should of course be studied in both its internal andexternal aspects. The internal structure will show how the educational planning office is arrangedand its relations with the other administrative services of the Ministry of Education. The externalstructure will cover external links with all the other agencies and services concerned with planningoutside the Ministry of Education, and especially with the central economic and social planningservice , manpower services , and statistical services.2. The problem of centralization and decentralization of educational administrationshould receive particular attention but be studied not as a theoretical problem in itself, but as aproblem which has repercussions on education. Emphasis must be placed on the impact of educa-tional planning on this problem , showing how decentralization of educational administration couldbe considered as the corollary of planning.3. The administrative pyramid ,i.e.the hierarchy of authority and responsibilities ,and the different administrative divisions and services also have a special interest. It might benecessary here to go into some detail on problems connected with the psychology of administration,human relations, group dynamics,allocations of authority, delegation of powers leadership,sociometry and other questions of social psychology , organization and management - but theseshould always be related to the planning of education. In the same connection, the problem ofthe training and recruitment of administrative personnel must not be forgotten , but with theaccent always on the impact of educational planning on this training and recruitment.4. Place can no doubt be found, in the practical exercise of preparing a plan for ahypothetical country, for analyzing and discussing questions connected with the participation ofsociety in elaborating the plan. But the subject is so vast and important that it needs particularattention, and treatment apart. It raises such delicate problems as: the participation of profes-sional opinion and of all of society; the role of representatives of certain economic and socialsectors; the importance of pressure groups; how to obtain the conscious and effective collaborationof society in executing the plan and so on. All of this no doubt involves the vital and thorny questionof democracy in relation to the plan which is administrative, technical and political all at the sametime. Hence the more general question of planning policy, which is vital in educational planning andcan throw light on the whole role of administration in planning.5. To crown all, it would seem necessary to give particular importance in trainingstudents to the problem of innovation in education in general and in its administration in particular.Indeed, one of the purposes in introducing them to new techniques in educational administration isto arouse this spirit of creation and innovation in them. The world crisis in education teaches 200183 Teaching the administrative aspects of educational planning above all that a remedycan be found only by having recourse to the creative spirit, this essentialinstrument which man always uses when challenged 'oy the limits of his resources. Faced with thegrowing disequilibrium between educational needs and the means available, the only proper attitudeis the creative one of questioning the whole traditional approach to education. The technologicalrevolution, so sought after here, demands above all a spirit of innovation in educational adminis-trators. Their training should be such as to help them to accept this spirit, to give up the conser-vative usages of traditional administration, and to understand what innovation requires andpromises.The accent, regarding innovation in administration itself ,should be concentrated on allthe techniques and methods which ensure the efficient utilization of human and material resources(teachers, school buildings, equipment, use of time, school transport, and so on). For this, it isuseful to place them in touch with experiments made in certain countries which have establishedorganization and method services (0 and M). The main purpose of these services is to keep theadministration always up to date and facilitate the efficient and economic operation of the Ministryof Education. By analyzing and discussing with students the functions of these services (betterorganization, simplification of procedures best use of administrative personnel, working hoursarrangements, better adapted utilization of material and equipment, and so on), they are helpedto re-think administrative functions with a view to the innovation which new conditions in educationimply in all countries.In any case, the creation and operation of an 0 and M service or other innovation unit inthe Ministry of Education should always be discussed with the students. As Coombs has said, theteaching systems themselves should be provided with the means to innovate.However ,the students should not be limited to innovation in administration in the moralsense , the problem of innovation in education must be raised in the widest sense of the word, andall the attempts at administrative innovation subsequently related to all of the technological revo-lution in education. Innovation in education must be shown as the major problem in coming years,made necessary by a number of factors which underline the world crisis in education (considerableincrease in school-going population, explosive increase in knowledge, democratization of education,etc.). This crisis demands innovations which challenge the whole traditional framework of education:knock down the classroom walls, operate on the constraints imposed on all education by the fixedrelation between number of pupils and number of teachers (pupil-teacher ratio), replace the indi-vidual teacher by teams (team teaching), change the idea of the school year , try out auto-instructionmethods of teaching, imagine a more polyvalent, and flexible type of school architecture, stress thenew concept of lifelong integrated education, including the promises it offers and the changes it willmake in the whole structure of school and out-of-school education. Administrative aspects of educational planning The constant concern in all that has been said above has been to show that the teaching of the admini-strative aspect of educational planning must not only reflect the intimate links between administra-tive objectives, functions and procedures and those in planning, but also help to achieve a greaterunity between the two.This teaching should set out to prove that all distinctions between the two have only historicreasons which can be dropped and that, to be really efficient and realistic, educational planningmust realize that it has no point except as an attitude of mind and a technique which could rendereducational administration more conscious of its objectives and functions .1/Educational adminis-tration theoretically has planning functions which it has long neglected. Its responsibilities forscanning and preparing the future are in principle inseparable from its other responsibilities fororganization, control, co-ordination and decision. Planning accordingly arrived to recall itsveritable role by showing the importance of forecasting, of 'inventing the future' .But soon after this arrival, planning ceded to the mechanism of its independent developmentand began to appear as a discipline apart, getting further and further away from the framework ithad originally in principle come to serve, namely, educational administration. For a certain timethe technical, or even the technocratic, dominated in educational planning, often largely forgettingthe main purpose of this planning, which is to change and develop educational administration forthe better. Planning contented itself with a theoretical attitude which required educational admini-stration to adapt itself to the newcomer without on its side making the necessary effort to renderthis adaptation feasible.Administration, on its side, began to take its distance in practice with planning, began evento doubt its techniques, challenge its realism , and constitute itself as an independent sector whereso much that was new had already been tried out. And, in the beginning, the advance in managementtechniques in various economic and social sectors helped to give backing to this independence. Anatural symbiosis nevertheless took place during their almost independent development, and thisgradually brought about a return to the normal condition of things, namely, a closer collaboration,and even organic unity, between the two. Planning must have thrown a new light on the role of ad-ministration which began to be seen as administration for development. Administration elaboratedrational decision-making methods and techniques which could easily be integrated with planningobjectives. Planning experience in certain countries had shown the gravity of the administrativelacunae in the established plans, and helped to re-establish faith in a form of educational planning 1/ As the Unesco document (ED/ICEP 3) prepared for the InternationalConference on Educational Planning says: 'The plan is neither a pre-diction by an all-wise technocrat nor a political promise; it is a workinghypothesis. Planning cannot be the monopoly of a small group during theperiod of planning, it must be the preoccupation and permanent respon-sibility of the entire administration'. (p. 162)202181 Teaching administrative aspects of educational planning more faithful to its original intention which , it may be reiterated, is to change education bychanging the mechanisms and methods of its administration.Teaching educational planning (and incorporating the administration aspect in the planningaspect) should help to achieve this return to the normal, and encourage the incipient fusion betweenthe two aspects of a same process. For educational planning could have no other purpose but tocome to the aid of educational administration, the better to adapt it to the requirements of economicand social development.S There was of course no intention of creating a new authority, but onlyof developing, aiding and introducing innovations in the one that existed. From this simple, almosttautological point of departure, we start out to give back its primordial role to educational planningand place it effectively at the service of educational administration and subsequently at the serviceof education itself.All that educational planning should attempt to do is to aid the administration to becomesomething which ensures the objectives of economic and social development, which elaborates itsdecisions on rational grounds, which plans, directs and foresees and which, finally, becomes adynamic agency which can adapt itself to future requirements and prospects.But the birth of educational planning from economic planning, despite all the advantages,resulted in its growing up a little far from education and from educational administration and this,with other factors, helped to deviate it from its proper aim and encouraged its development as analmost independent technique.V When, after attempts to tie planning to existing educationalsystemsthe unfortunate results of this deviation became tangible, and when the purpose thenbecame to re-establish the links between plan and reality, between objectives and their attainment,and to make educational planning the art of the possible and not the art of the impossible - it wasall too evident that the difficulties derived particularly from the fact that educational planning hadbeen almost completely uprooted from its proper terrain education, and the proper administrationof education. The importance of administration in educational planning was hastily pointed out,with talk of an administrative aspect (as well as a qualitative aspect) of educational planning.Hence the return to a normal situation in which the problem is taken up again in its originalsetting. It is education which must be planned, and this can only be done by the infusion of planninginto the very heart and mechanisms of the administration, adapting this planning itself to thepractical requirements and procedures which the efficient and dynamic administration of educationdemands.j/ It will be clear that the term educational administration is being used intwo senses which seem difficult to separate from the point of view that isput forward throughout this document i.e. administration as the executionof adopted policiesand administration as the organization of the planningprocess. The elaboration of educational policy cannot in fact be separatedfrom its execution.2/ It must be admitted that every new technique such as planning must in-evitably pass through a stage of theoretical research and uncommitted study.The great thing is not to remain forever in this stage.203 Administrative aspects of educational planning However, the temporary divorce between the planning and administration of education hasnot been without profit. It has no doubt aided each to bring its techniques to maturity, to see theirinadequacies, and to appreciate the advantages of the reconciliation, a reconciliation which istaking place in the most natural way in the world , taking advantage of all the lessons of experienceand of the maturity of the two parties. Perhaps we may therefore nourish the hope of seeing anew era in which the two aspects can more intimately unite, and together confront the one singleproblem which jointly faces them , that of linking educational progress to the needs of economicsocial and cultural development and the prospects of a new world that is coming to birth. 20418J TEACHING OF EDUCATIONAL PLANNINGIN TRAINING COURSES FOR EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION by John Hartley To be of value this paper must, I feel, be mainly concerned with our own experience in Readingwhere we have, since 1962, been offering a course in educational administration for overseasserving officers. The difficulties that we have faced in teaching educational planning annually togroups of students with very varying experience and coming from a wide range of countrieswill,I hope, be of relevance to members of this workshop and it is my hope that in discussionnot only will I receive guidance on how better to cope with those difficulties, but that otherswith similar problems may also, like a famous fictional hunting character of the last century,Jorrocks, who said when asked why he always looked at the horses in cab ranks, You learnsa lot of awoidance looking at cabhorses'.Briefly, since 1962 we have had between thirteen and over twenty students annuallyfor a nine- to ten-month university diploma course. The aim of the course is to provide cen-tral and institutional administrators with the opportunity to make a detached assessment of theimportant difficulties with which they are faced and by study of current thought on administra-tive theory and practice, and by coming into direct contact with serving administrators inEngland and elsewhere who are dealing with similar problems, to return better fitted to over-come these difficulties. The course is also intended to enable those who are lecturers ineducational administration to reassess the practical value of the courses for which they areresponsible and to improve their own instructional material and methods.The first of our problems is naturally, selection. We are not completely our ownmasters over this. Only very rarely can we interview candidates and we have to rely on therecommendations received, usually through the British Ministry of Overseas Development,from the countries from which the candidates come. Most students are supported by technicalaid schemes administered by that Ministry. Our basic requirements are that a candidateshould have had five years' experience in a senior and responsible post, a university degreeor acceptable equivalent, and be certified by his government as either in or destined for 205 Administrative aspects of educational planning employment in an administrative post. We also require a certificate that each candidate forthe course has sufficient command of English to allow him to follow the course satisfactorily,but members of the workshop who have, like myself, worked at both ends as a certifyingofficial in the country of origin and as a certificate assessor in the receiving country, willknow what a chancy thing this form of assessment can be. We are, therefore, in getting ourgroup together, immediately faced with the problem that Shukla, for instance, so succinctlydescribes in his chapter on training educational planners in the World Year Book ofEducation 1967.The Reading University School of Education is a comparatively small one, and fromits own resources cannot provide the range of teaching necessary for a course of this nature.Considerable call is, therefore, made on the services of staff from other university facultiessuch as sociology, politics and economics, and we have a small advisory committee chairedby the Professor of Education, with representatives of these faculties as members. Abouthalf our teaching needs can be provided by members of the staff of the School of Education.For the other half we depend on other faculties and speakers or seminar leaders from outside,nearly all of whom are serving administrators.During the first few years of the course, until 1966, the majority of students camefrom countries that had inherited the British Colonial system of education. Since then suchstudents have been in a minority. This change in clientele fortunately coincided with the twoworkshops held here on the training of educational planners, which I attended, and to whichtwo other staff members already closely connected with the course came to join supplementaryseminars on the teaching of economics and statistics. This helped us to make necessary changesin the content and direction of the course. The time for attempting to create better educationaladministrators than we had been, but still in our own image, was to some extent P ast.It is,therefore, with our experience over the last three years that I wish particularly to deal.Now I must turn to the subject. We at once come to the highly disputed boundary bet-ween where planning ends and administration and management begin. Whilst I shall try to keepwithin acceptable limits,I shall undoubtedly stray over the boundary. My excuse is that sinceproblems of implementation must be of particular importance in any course labelled administration,1 have, in my work with our course, tended to look at planning from the administrative side ofthe fence, just as I did in my service days.We consider our first job to be to try to bring home to our students the vital need foreffective planning. This now involves trying to overcome a very marked feeling of disillusion-ment as regards educational planning. This is particularly the case with many of the LatinAmerican students, and those who have hau experience in planning units or branches of theirMinistries are no exception. They complain of years of hard work, the use of valuable 2061191 Teaching of educational planning in training coursesfor educational administration expatriate expertise, the hours spent in consultation and conferences throughout their countries,and the efforts made at all levels in their Ministries to prepare the returns needed beingjettisoned by political whim before the plan that has evolved from all this is even studied. Theusual statement that planning exercises are only started up by governments in order to fob offcriticism until it dies down is another that is often made. As soon as selections are made,usually in May or June (our course begins in October), we write to each student asking him tocome prepared with as much supporting documentation as possible (we offer to purchase thisfrom him later) in order to give a paper dealing at some length with a major educational pro-blem with which his country is faced. When the student arrives, he and his tutor discuss theproposed paper and put it into final shape. These presentations, which are given very early inthe year, invariably form something of a general pattern and help the somewhat disparategroup to see how much they really have in common: unemployed school leavers, common im-balances in their educational structures, drop-outs and inefficient primary schools, etc.These common problems having been identified, we attempt to instil into our students, parti-cularly the disillusioned, that there is no alternative to disaster other than by effective plan-ning, and to reinforce this at an early stage we secure the services of planners with wide in-ternational experience, such as Guy Hunter, to come in to hold seminars to emphasize theuniversal nature of these problems.Having attempted by these means to get the students to remind themselves of theirnational problems and to see their universal nature, we feel that it is important that theyshould see that they are themselves, whatever their positions, deeply involved in the wholeplanning process and that it is therefore important they they should all have some understand-ing of the mechanics by which that'process works or fails to do so. To cover this, a series ofseminars led by a staff member, who fortunately has had recent experience at a regional centre,is held, aiming at giving initial insight into the methods of educational planning, the importanceof the demographic approach and the interrelationship between economic and educational plan-ning and the nature of the statistical data needed for effective planning. This work is supple-mented by further seminars on aspects of economic planning, led by a member of the economicsdepartment, and on linear programming and measurement in planning. At this stage, selectiveuse begins to be made of the Fundamentals of Educational Planning, Discussion Series. We usethese in our group discussions in two ways: either before the seminars referred to above takeplace, so that they may provide ammunition to use at the seminars, or in our post-mortemsafter lectures or discussions. In the Easter vacation we have, through the kindness of thisInstitute, been able to have a series of seminars here, which have been led by senior membersof the staff. Subjects discussed have included: 207 Administrative aspects of educational planning Integration of euucational and economic planning;The use of systems analysis in educational planning;Integrating external assistance into educational planning;Cost and financial aspects of educational planning.Since the University of Reading has always been strong on the agricultural side, theSchool of Education has maintained a strong interest in rural education. There are at leastfive courses for senior teachers from England and abroad given annually in aspects of ruraleducation. The teaching staff and contacts are, therefore ,readily available for dealing withthis important subject, so we hold a series of seminars and discussions on 'The educationaladministrator and the rural schools '. This year the discussions have been led by an agricul-tural economist with East African experience, an agriculturalist who was spending a year atthe University between FAO assignments in Latin America, a planner of international repute,an educationalist who has wide experience both as an administrator and an 'expert' in ruraleducation in Africa and the Middle East, and the Director of our Agricultural Extension Unit.Fergus Wilson's paper in the Fundamentals Discussion Series has been a valuable piece ofsupplementary reading for the group discussions during this series.Before going on to work done on sub-group and individual bases ,I should mention twofurther subjects which seem to us of great importance to the administrator and which certainlyfall within the sphere of the teaching of educational planning. Firstly, there is the study of com-parative education. This goes on all the time. The ready and continual exchange of experiencebetween students seems to us one of the most valuable things that any course of this nature hasto offer. As I have shown, it is given emphasis from the start. During the first term the groupattends a major series of lectures by the University Professor of Comparative Education anda further series by an Emeritus Professor of Education on education in England and Wales. Asan integral part of the course, the group studies the educational system of another Europeancountry in some detail. This has so far been France. This study culminates in a visit to Paris,the time not spent at IIEP and Unesco being taken up with visits to French educational institu-tions and lectures by serving administrators on the French educational system. Secondly, wepay a good deal of attention to decision-making and man-management. Discussions on these,led by a psychologist, are followed by case study work. This year, the cases chosen were two'causes cdldbres, one of national and the other of local interest. Each was presented by amember of the University staff who had, by good fortune, had personal knowledge of his caseand had worked with the leading protagonists.This is about as far as we feel that we can go in this area working as a whole group.I have already referred to the problem of the wide differences in individual experience, needs,interests and abilities that we face each year. We try to overcome this in two ways. Firstly,by giving a good deal of time to study group, or syndicate work as we call it and, secondly, by 208I9J Teaching of educational planning in training coursesfor educational administration doing as much work as possible on individual lines under close tutorial guidance. For the first,we choose annually four or five subjects for study, our choice being based on the majorityneeds of the students for the year. We have always had several students each year who havebeen directly concerned with educational planning at the Ministry or regional or provincialheadquarters level, and we have formed these students into one of the study groups or syn-dicates. The method work that they do at this stage is based on the Henley model. They havean adviser, nearly always a staff member, who is required to remain as far as possible inthe background, a chairman and secretary, who may or n-lay not rotate according to circum-stances, and they work under pressure to prepare a joint report on the subject selected forstudy. Reports are usually of about three to four thousand words. Finally, the reports arepresented to the whole group and the members of the syndicates concerned have to defendthese reports against the criticism of their fellows. Over the last three years the PlanningSyndicates have produced reports on educational planning with special reference to educationalguidance; the role and methods of work of planning units in Ministries of Education and thestaffing and place of planning units in Ministries of Education. The adviser is always someonewith considerable planning experience. As an example of the work covered in these syndicates,the contents of the second of these reports reads as follows: (general survey dealing with the establishment of planningunits in Argentina, Bahamas, El Salvador, Ghana, Nicaraguaand the Philippines (the countries from which members ofthe Syndicate came);(ii) general appreciation of the problems related to educationalplanning:(a) difficulties in implementation;(b) personnel involved in planning;(c) place of the planning units;(d) interdepartmental co-operation;(e) integration of educational planning with social andeconomic development;(iii) a comparative study of educational planning in England andthe USSR.Reference to fifty publications was made in the bibliography.Whilst one cannot claim great authoritative weight tor a report of this nature coveringso wide a field,its preparation gave its authors the opportunity for purposeful specialisedreading and considerable, and at times heated, discussion during its compilation. It also involvedmembers of the groups in visits to the Planning Division of the English Department of Educationand Science (our Ministry of Education) and the headquarters of the Lancashire EducationAuthority which is responsible for educational planning in one of our scheduled developmentregions. 2091 9 1 Administrative aspects of educational planning One of our objectives has been to give our students practice in digesting a good deal ofmaterial quickly and working together in order to prepare a balanced report against tin-le. I shouldadd that we have recently been reconsidering the way in which we have been doing this work. Whilstwe still regard it as a useful experience for administrators to work together in this way, it is askingrather too much of groups which, even though small, contain such a wide variety of experience andability, to read English quickly. Those whose English is good and who have in the normal course oftheir service had to do committee work leading to reporting, either take on far too much , leavingtheir less experienced colleagues comparatively idle, o.. become frustrated by their colleagues'difficulties in trying to keep up. We should, perhaps ,depart further from the Henley procedure andput less emphasis on the time factor, jettisoning the term 'syndicate' and substituting somethinglike 'special study groups ', but we shall continue these exercises in some form. The students, likeourselves, regard them ;is very useful and they certainly engender considerable competitiveenthusiasm. We also feel that the subjects that we have been choosing may be of too wide a natureand that we must build up a stock of documentation for sub-group use which will enable these groupsto deal with more specific problems. Our difficulty here is that even with a sub-group of only sixor seven people, it is not always easy to find a subject that is of clear relevance to the needs ofall. Apart from having essential documentation readily available for the sub-group, we encourageinitiative by acceding to its wishes to send delegates on consultative and fact-finding visits to otheruniversities ,the Royal Institute of Public Administration, ODI and Central and Local GovernmentOffices and so on. We follow this practice of making the best use we can of national resources ofinformation and experience as opposed to merely relying on our parochial sources, when we cometo what we regard as the most important part of our programme: tutorial work on individual lines.We are convinced that if , as is inevitable, our students have such wide differences in needs,interests and abilities ,it is wrong to think in terms of a completely set programme with so muchteaching time allotted to each of the various aspects of administration. Before going further I mustemphasize that this variety is not without its very real advantages. It is good for what we term the'Land Rover' administrator, the man in an outlying provincial or district headquarters, to workclosely for the year with what we term the 'air- conditioned' administrator in a Ministry head-quarters, and vice versa. The improvement in the standard of debate at our regular group discus-sions as the year proceeds is evidence of this. However , our responsibility is to make each indivi-dual better fitted to undertake increased responsibilities on his return home. It is the individual whomatters. The University has accepted our view on this and has allowed our Diploma Award Regula-tions to be altered so that assessment is now made very largely on the standards of written assign-ments prepared under tutorial supervision and not, as previously, on the results of a formal finalexamination. These assignments have to be fairly substantial pieces of work. For example , aFilipino student, who was Dean-elect of the Faculty of Agriculture at a university that had recentlyachieved university status ,arrived faced with a very considerable planning problem, not only over 2109 5 Teaching of educational planning in training coursesfor educational administration the recasting of what had been a department of a technological institute into a full university faculty ,but also over the change of the institution to its new status ,a process in which he, as a seniorstaff member, was deeply involved. We had ascertained something of his needs by direct corres-pondence with him before the course began and were able to arrange that he should, throughoutthe year, attend special tutorials with the Sub-Dean of the Department of Agriculture and with oneof the senior Assistant Bursars of our University, both of whom were currently concerned withproblems of change and expansion as a result of Robbins. Because of his special experience inthis field, the 'tutorial supervision' required by our Regulations , was given by a staffmember ofour Department of Agricultural Economics. The resulting assignment was a substantial piece ofwork, well up to post-graduate degree standard.In dealing at this length on what we are doing at Reading in this field, I have assumed thatthe problems we are facing regarding the very varied background of our students are common ones.My colleagues in England who are responsible for university courses in administration for studentsfrom abroad, Regional Directors' statements during the earlier workshops here and Shukla iscomments to which I have referred all seem to confirm this. Whilst we may be accused of makingour course so open-minded that everything runs out of the bottom we feel strongly that we musttry and overcome this by following a full tutorial procedure. With two course tutors this means anideal maximum of fourteen to sixteen students It also means the co- operation in this tutorial work ofother university faculties when special needs have to be met. We also regard it as of great import-tance that help relevant to the students needs should be sought on a national basis , particularlyfrom practising administrators. With special reference to my theme, from which I have, I fear ,often departed, we hold the following views which we try to put into practice:Firstly, with the newcomers having this sense of disillusionment about the results of much -publicized educational plans in their countries, to try and restore morale and, by thinking of theirhome situations and comparing them with those of their colleagues ,to appreciate that whatever thefate of their five or ten-year national plans the urgent need is for a rational and systematic approachtowards ensuring essential change. We regard this early evangelical work to be later reinforcedduring our visit here, as essential for all. This work, in order to be effective ,must, from our view ,start from a consideration of the base of the student 's home situation.Secondly, we are concerned to impart an understanding of what effective planning entails.Hence our close association in the conduct and teaching at the course with the staff of the Depart-ments of Sociology and Economics and with our statisticians. Administrative aspects of educational planning Thirdly, we consider that individual needs , which we regard as paramount , can only bemet effectively by individual treatment through tutorial work and through extended consultation withpractising planners on a professional-to-professional basis , whether they be localauthority officersdealing with the long-term problems of a change to comprehensive education, heads of expandingschools or institutions who are planning to meet long-term financial and staffing problems , or primaryschool organizers trying to effect the changes in teachers outlook and methods as a result of thePlowden and Gittins Reports. 2121 9 1 [-)porldixes 1.9(ei Appendix A REPORT OF WORKING GROUP No. 1 ON TEACHING THEADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF EDUCATIONAL PLANNING by Professor A. Abclel Dayern(Beirut Centre) IntroductionThe participants in the Seminar, while recognizing that instruction in the administrative aspectsof educational planning must necessarily differ according to the objective of the training given toeducational planners, have endeavoured to identify certain essential factors which, in their opinion,should be included in any programme of training in that field.However, the stress which should be placed on each of these factors, the way in whichthey should be included in the training programmes and the method of approaching and teaching them,must naturally depend on the nature of the training, its length and its targets, as well as on the con-ditions peculiar to each country.From this point of view, and to the extent to which the administrative aspects of educationalplanning can be considered separately from its other aspects, the participants have singled outcertain factors which seemed important to them and which we shall outline in four chapters. Chapter I:Factors relating to the administration of educational planningin generalThe role of national policy in educational planning and the interdependency between education andnational policy: the participants brought out, in this connexion, the importance which should begiven in teaching the administrative side of educational planning to the different kinds of organizationand control of general and educational planning according to the respective political system (required,guided or suggested planning, etc. ), the basic role of the political authorities in the establishment ofthe general educational policy and the planning targets, and in the implementation of the plan, andalso the relationship which should be established between the political authorities and the planningorganization, etc.The study and analysis of the educational system (understood in the broadest sense of thisterm as including school, pre-school and extramural instruction public and private instruction 2151 9 9 2N. ppendixes adult education and mass culture permanent education, etc. )in the context of the administrative,economic, social, political, demographic and cultural structure of the country. (The accent mustbe placed on the administrative structure of the system. )The democratic nature of the plan and the degree of participation of all the people in educa-tional planning (with emphasis on the means to ensure such participation. ) Chapter II:Factors relating to the organization of the machinery ofeducational planningThe organization of educational planning (the educational planning service or unit: its structure andlocation, educational planning committee deciding on the targets of the plan, specialized commissionsor branches) from a two-fold point of view:Internally - the structure of the educational planning agency and its relations with otheradministrative services of the Ministry of Education; andExternallythe external relationships between this agency and all other agencies orservices concerned in planning at the various stages and in particular with the nationalplanning service.Special attention must be given to the initial efforts and steps necessary for the creation andrecognition of the educational planning services.Interdependency between the educational planning organization and the financial organizationof the country.Stresses the importance of a study to find means of improving the structure of theordinary type of budget in order to make it more operative and better adapted to the achievement ofthe targets of the educational plan and demonstrating the importance of programme budgeting (reflect-ing the mental attitudes or motives thus revealed and considering the close relationship which shouldexist between the plans and their implementation through the method of construction of the budget.The various levels of the educational planning organization: national level regional levelinstitutional levelsector level, etc. Chapter III:Factors relating to the organization of the educational planningprocessDevelopment of the educational planning process in its different stages establishment of a time-table for the preparation of the plan division of the Educational plan into planning programmes andspecific projects, etc.In this connexion, the participants stressed the importance of the operationalaspects underlying the work of preparing an educational plan, the necessity of working out materialand financial programmes in the actual preparatory stage of the plan and the practical steps and pro-cedures best indicated for the achievement of the targets of the plan.In this approach, they showed the importance of examining the processes involved in thernicroplanning of education (planning at the regional and institutional levels and educational sub-system 216200 Appendixes planning).They stressed in particular the good results which may be produced by this greaterinterest in the operational aspects as regards the bridging of the gap between the planning and theadministration of education.The implementation of the educational plan with all its administrative implications: thepromulgation of new laws and legislative measures administrative reorganization - role of regionalagencies and individual institutions - interministerial and interdepartmental co-ordination limita-tions imposed by the annual budget - psychological and social resistance pressure groupsinspection of progress in the execution of the plan reappraisal and further clarification of targetsmeasures to be taken in the event of unforeseen developments, etc.The planning and administration of qualitative pedagogical reforms and their adjustment tothe educational plan.Special interest should be given to the part which such reforms may play in theimprovement of the internal and external efficiency of education. Chapter IV: Factors relating to an administrative renovationStructure of the administrative pyramid involving the levels of authority and of function and the variouspossible divisions of the administrative services (functional, operational and executive services).An examination of the problems urgent and routineencountered by an educational admini-strator in his daily work and the ways and means to deal with these problems. Particular stress mustbe placed on the tasks involved in this routine administration and in the personal qualities which anadministrator should have in order to cope with them successfully.Knowledge of organization theories and of the different concepts of organization, withemphasis on the part played by human relations and the human factor in administration: administra-tive psychologyenergy and initiative of groups leadership, etc.Reorganization and modernization of educational administration, with special attention to begiven to the establishment of an 'innovation unit' in the Ministry of Education and the role which itshould play in new administrative developments. To be mentioned in this connexion are the experi-ments conducted in countries which have established units known as Organization and Method (0 and M)services with a view to improving the organizational structure, simplifying procedures, ensuringoptimal utilization of administrative personnel, arranging hourly work schedules, using material andequipment better adapted to the job to be done, etc.Knowledge of new methods of managementl/ and the part which they can play in the efficiencyand logic of decisions.The general spirit of these methods, based on operational research andsystems analysis, will be more important than their technical details, which are complicated and 1/ Special attention should be given to the more general aspect of innovationin education and to the part which the administration can play in a renovationof the general educational system. 217201 A ppendixus difficult to apply in many countries. Special initiation in certain simple decision-making techniques(such as simulation) is always possible and is useful. In teaching these methods, it would be im-portant to show how they can help in solving certain special problems of school policy and contributeeffectively in dealing with problems of educational management: siting of schools organization oftransport facilitiesconstruction of school buildings arrangement of classrooms recruitment ofteacherspupil selection, etc.Knowledge, of mechanical aids and equipment for administrative purposes and in particularthe part which can be taken by computers in the general administration of education and in certainadministrative problems of individual schools. 218202 Appendix 11 REPORT OF WORKING GROUP No.2 ON RESEARCH NEEDS OF T1117:A DIVITNTSTRATTVF, ASPECTS OF 1?DUCATTONAL, PLANNTNG by Professor J. Sheffield(Columbia University, New York) IntroductionIn addressing itself to the problem of identifying critical areas for research into the administrativeaspects of educational planning, the working group saw itself as part of a broader effort on the partof the Institute to up-date the 1965 Tnventory of Research Needs.1/ The group agreed that much edu-cational planning to date had been primarily a statistical exercise of setting targets based on shakydata and questionable assumptions. Too often this planning was linked with national economicplanning at the macro-level, which meant that little attention was given to detailed analysis at theproject level. In order for effective planning to become a reality more attention must be given tothe social and political forces within which priorities must be identified and plans must be imple-mented. Since the goal of educational planners is to bring about changes in the system, we mustlearn more about the system in order to design a strategy for changing it.Communication and decision-makingThe study of organizations has often focussed on structure, without sufficient attention to function;the process and purpose behind the structure. Tn education, the process involves a continuous in-teraction of policy, planning, implementation and evaluation. Our concern should be to learn howthis process takes place in order to improve its efficiency.This first requires an analysis of the decision-making process starting with an inventoryof all the decisions to be made and the information needed for each decision. From this point comu-nications channels can be identified which lead to the most efficient decision-making structure.The ideal length of the communication channels will thus determine such questions as the degreeof centralization or decentralization. Thus by mapping flows of information between decision points,a communications model emerges which can be used to design a structure. 1/ Educational planning: an inventory of major research needs. Paris,TIEP ,1965. 219203 Appendixes When one starts with the structure, on the other hand, one creates a communicationssystem divorced from actual functions. The result of this pattern is a rigid bureaucracy in whichmany decisions are made via an informal communications system ( 'the grapevine ').Failure to implement educational plans is frequently due to communications difficultieswithin the administrative structure. While the complexity of these problems will vary fromcountry to country, effective planning will require both general research and detailed analysis ofthe particular situation with its unique set of political and cultural constraints.Participation and decision-makingA conceptual framework is needed which can identify the degree of participation in decision-makingin educational planning. For example, on the one extreme, an administrator can decide on a givenpolicy in total isolation from his subordinates. On the other hand all concerned might be activelyinvolved in each decision ,either directly or through representatives. Between these two extremesmany levels of involvement can be identified. In each decision the critical issues are what kind ofparticipation, by whom and at what stage in the process. For example, if the only involvement ofdepartment heads in the formulation of a new plan is in the compilation of statistical data, theirparticipation in the decision could be said to be minimal. The implementation of any programme isto a large extent dependent upon the degree of involvement of administrators in the programme'sdevelopment.Other areas of concernIn the light of these general issues, the working group identified a number of specific questions onwhich research is required. Because the details of the research projects will have to be workedout in each specific instance, the following list is merely an outline of possible questions to beconsidered.A. Administration- What backgrounds to administrators have?- What aspects of their roles do they feel inadequately trained for?- How can they develop these skills?- How can administrators work together to maximize their managerialskills'?B.Finance- What is the most efficient mix of central government funds, localtaxes and school fees?- How can managerial techniques make these scarce resources gofurther?- How can financing of education best contribute to the improvement ofstandards and the equalization of educational opportunity? I-Tow can one evaluate an effective D.institutions best be organized for change?learned from other fields concerning adaptationschool or school system (beyond usual measures of inputs or student achievement)?Organizing for research- How can countries identify research priorities?- What types of institutions are most effective for research?- How can universities and government departments work togetherwith a minimum of duplication? (This also applies to institutions inother countries.)- How can useful research findings be effectively disseminated?(what are the strategic points for diffusion?)the Areas of researchContribution of research institutions (for instance pedagogical institutes) and institutions includingresearch sectors or activities (for instance Faculties of Education) to change - both as regardsinnovation and diffusion of innovation.Sub-problems:(a) What are the problems to be researched by these institutions accordingto the nature - developed or underdeveloped - of the country or region?(b) What is the best place for these institutions, according to the country?For instance:Is it necessary, in developing coun tries (Brazil and Iran can afford good examples) to linkdeeply pedagogical institutes to executive instances (Ministry or Secretariat of Education) in orderto avoid both academic projects of research and the non-utilization of the results of research (eventhose of pragmatical nature) by the executive instances? Evidently some dangers are involved inthis connexion (possible political submission or dependence on scientists , narrowness of the fieldsof research etc.), but, on the whole , theimbalance is not necessarily negative. The exact imbalancehas to be researched, country by country, and according to the degree of development.Is not the current position of Faculties of Education , within universities, in developing areasa factor of ineffectiveness, since the 'consumers' of the products (teachers) of these faculties arenot necessarily linked to universities? Frequently there is a tendency, from part of educational ad-ministration of first and second levels not to utilize or under-utilize these teachers (and theeventual innovation they incorporated and can diffuse) and to prefer other products , formed rapidlyby centres of training directly linked to executive instances. Thus the Faculties of Education arenot fruitful and, frequently, accepting this situation (which presents certain advantages: tranquility,possibility of long-term research, political independence etc.), tend to close themselves within anivory tower , affording specialists and kinds of formation useless for the improvement of the educa-tional system.What are the means to avoid this ineffectiveness and the duplications it implicates.221\"05 Mr. Abdel DayemMr. Veda PrakashaMr. M.
