However, although the country will have the capacity and capability to ensure that everyone receives [the Covid-19 vaccine](https://sg.asiatatler.com/society/covid-19-vaccine-in-singapore-what-you-should-know), there are a variety of factors that could affect the vaccination process. In December 2020, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had announced that the country will have enough vaccines for the entire population by Q3 of 2021. Many have been curious about the vaccination process, with questions about the pain as well as the possible side effects. Frontline workers in the aviation and maritime sectors in Singapore are prioritised for the Covid-19 vaccine, with vaccination centres for the two industries set up in January. We spoke to a [leading stewardess from Singapore Airlines](https://sg.asiatatler.com/life/singapore-airlines-fully-vaccinated-airline-worldwide), Amber Chan, who has been flying with the national carrier for the past decade, to get a first-hand account of the vaccination process and to know her thoughts as a frontline worker that was among the first to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.

Amber Chan (AC) We were vaccinated on February 3 at Changi Airport Terminal 4, which has been turned into a vaccination centre. Firstly, we began with registration where a healthcare worker asked us about our medical history and drug allergies and what happens if we consume those drugs. Depending on the severity of the reaction, and especially if any swelling or anaphylactic distress is mentioned, a doctor on site will be called to assess us to see if we are fit to take the vaccine. If we were cleared to receive the vaccine, we moved on to step two, which would be the actual vaccination. At the vaccination area, there were several booths with nurses who administered the vaccine. Before he or she proceeded, a second health screening was done to check on any possible allergies. The nurses told us about the possible side effects such as fever, soreness of the arm and fatigue, and then asked if we were right- or left-handed. If you were right-handed, they will administer the injection in your left arm. After the shot was given, my nurse checked that I was fine, applied a plaster and told me that I would be placed under observation for 30 minutes before being released. This is to ensure that there is medical attention on hand in the event of a negative reaction to the vaccine. The third and final step would be the 30 minutes of observation where everyone who has been vaccinated will sit and wait for their 'release time' to be announced. A final check was then done to ensure that our particulars were in order, and a reminder was issued to visit a doctor if any possible side effects lingered after the third day. Did the injection hurt? AC The jab did not hurt in the slightest. It was like a tiny ant's bite. "}
