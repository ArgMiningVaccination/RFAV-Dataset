Modern mainstream medicine isn't always the best approach when it comes to treating chronic and complex health conditions such as inflammatory arthritis, [sleep disorders](https://www.everydayhealth.com/sleep-disorders/sleep/sleep-101-ultimate-guide-on-how-get-better-nights-sleep/), and pain. \"In the conventional model, we can often get caught up in the 'find it, fix it,' mentality,\" says [Adam Rindfleisch, MD](https://oshercenter.org/oc-event/grand-rounds-a_rindfleisch/), the vice dean of for the [Whole Health Institute](https://www.wholehealth.org/) in Bentonville, Arkansas. \"That model works if you're dealing with an infection or a broken bone; in terms of working with all the chronic diseases that we see now, it's not as helpful [on its own],\" he says. Integrative medicine can be a good choice for people living with chronic pain, as it aims to treat the whole person rather than simply addressing the complaint. Integrative medicine may be more about getting to the root causes of health issues, compared with conventional Western medicine, says Dr. Rindfleisch. That means its practitioners consider symptoms in the context of other characteristics or facts. \"When I see a person, I try to take in every aspect of that person, not just what is wrong at present,\" Rindfleisch says. In many cases, integrative and complementary medicine is best utilized in collaboration with mainstream or biomedical medicine, to balance their strengths and weaknesses, and help support a patient's healing. What Is Integrative Medicine? The integrative medicine movement has roots in the popular holistic, complementary, and alternative healing practices of the 1960s and 1970s. In the early 2000s, a forward-thinking group of philanthropists formed the [Bravewell Collaborative](https://bravewell.org/) in an effort to \"humanize\" healthcare. Rather than focusing solely on a patient's disease or its resulting symptoms, their vision for integrative medicine was to focus on the whole human being. In the integrative model, patients would not be passive recipients of doctors' orders but rather individuals empowered to take charge of their own health. At around the same time, the Consortium for Academic Centers for Integrative Medicine (CACHIM), which eventually became the [Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health (ACIMH](https://imconsortium.org/about/history/)), was formed and included top university programs at Duke, Harvard, and Stanford. The organization is committed to a comprehensive approach to healthcare while also recognizing the importance of experience supported by evidence-based results. Although the Bravewell Collaborative dissolved in 2015, its early support of the Academic Consortium has allowed ACIMH to expand and flourish; it now includes more than 75 academic health centers, medical and nursing schools; one of the most widely known is the [Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine](https://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/index.html) at The University of Arizona in Tucson. An Attempt to Integrate Many Types of Medical Care, Including Traditional In addition to a holistic approach to patients, integrative medicine draws on conventional and complementary approaches to their healthcare. According to a [2021 survey](https://www.valuepenguin.com/alternative-medicine-survey) of 1,100 U.S. consumers, more than half report using at least one form of complementary or alternative medicine or natural remedy to treat a health problem, and 66 percent of consumers want these types of treatments to be covered by health insurance. Integrative Terminology Evolves Alongside Attitudes If a nonmainstream practice is used together with conventional medicine, it's called \"complementary\"; if the nonmainstream practice is used in place of conventional medicine, it's considered \"alternative,\" according to the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/complementary-alternative-or-integrative-health-whats-in-a-name). Yet the language, and attitudes, are in flux. Over time, that which was considered complementary or alternative may have been adopted by mainstream medicine. (Probiotics, for example, were once considered complementary but have \"crossed over\" to the mainstream.) Today, the field emphasizes whole person health and aims to focus beyond medical approaches and support well-being in general. Proponents of integrative medicine have steered away from the term alternative, favoring more inclusive terms such as traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) or traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM), both of which are names used by the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/traditional-complementary-and-integrative-medicine). When used alongside mainstream care, supplements, herbs, [deep breathing](https://www.everydayhealth.com/alternative-health/living-with/ways-practice-breath-focused-meditation/), [yoga](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/treatment/best-worst-types-yoga-rheumatoid-arthritis/), and [massage](https://www.everydayhealth.com/osteoarthritis/massage-therapy-for-osteoarthritis.aspx) are all examples of complementary therapies, while prescription drugs and surgery are examples of what we commonly think of mainstream medicine. The key is in the word integrative,\" Rindfleisch says. \"You're trying to bring together whatever can work the best for the person.\" How People With Chronic Pain Can Benefit From an Integrative Approach An integrative approach aims to go beyond treating these symptoms, conditions, and behaviors, which can easily quiesce only to reappear in another form. \"It's kind of like the game Whac-A-Mole,\" Rindfleisch says. \"You knock one thing down and another thing pops up.\" To stop the cycle of treating one set of symptoms only to exchange it for another, an integrative physician will typically explore the many causes (including lifestyle, emotional challenges, and self-limiting beliefs) and help people find solutions. [Irina Todorov, MD](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/22069), an integrative health provider in the Cleveland Clinic Health System and based in Lyndhurst, Ohio, begins her evaluations with questions that many mainstream physicians wouldn't typically ask. What to Expect From an Integrative Health Doctor Once a patient explains their health issue or the reason for the visit, Dr. Todorov begins the discussion. \"What is your lifestyle? What are your [stressors](https://www.everydayhealth.com/stress/guide/)?\" she asks. Often in the course of conversation, other issues are revealed, such as stress from problems at work or a complex medical history that includes comorbidities or co-occurring conditions. Most traditional doctors have 15 minutes or less for an appointment, which often means no time for any discussion beyond the medical complaint, says Rindfleisch. \"That doesn't allow for time to get to know the person as an individual or get into issues such as meaning and purpose or [self-care](/self-care/) practices,\" he says. In the integrative health setting there's more in-depth assessment at the outset, says Rindfleisch. Problems are discussed, but there's also time spent on what is going right. \"It's helpful to know the signature strengths of a person,\" he says. Time is also spent on values and goals, which can vary widely from person to person. \"I like to ask someone who comes to me about what really matters to them,\" Rindfleisch says. \"Let's take a step back and ask, 'What do you want your health for in the first place? What do you want to be able to do?'\" That conversation can be enlightening and help guide how the condition or symptoms will be treated, he adds. \"It's not uncommon for an integrative health intake form to ask details about nutrition, your [sleep schedule](https://www.everydayhealth.com/sleep/insomnia/resetting-your-clock.aspx), your social life, your spiritual life, as well as your surroundings and environment,\" says Rindfleisch. Integrative Medicine Doctors Prescribe Nondrug Therapies as Well as Medications The additional training that integrative doctors complete enables them to have conversations about different treatment modalities. \"Take [nutrition](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/what-makes-someone-an-expert-in-diet-and-nutrition/) as an example,\" Rindfleisch says. \"Research has shown that most physicians get only two weeks or less training on nutrition. If you never really learned about something, it's hard to share it with your patients.\" At most medical schools, historically, information about herbal remedies or supplements isn't part of the curriculum at all, he says. By contrast, integrative healthcare physicians can spend hundreds of hours learning and training in those subjects. The [American Board of Physician Specialties](https://www.abpsus.org/) now offers a medicine board certification exam in integrative medicine. To become a [board-certified](https://www.abpsus.org/specializations/integrative-medicine/#primary) integrative medicine doctor, Todorov completed 1,000 additional hours of training in integrative care before she passed the board exam. \"Nutrition was a big part of our additional training. We also completed study modules on many manual therapies, such as [physical therapy](https://www.everydayhealth.com/pain-management/physical-activity-and-therapy.aspx), aqua therapy, and [chiropractic therapy](https://www.everydayhealth.com/chronic-pain/chiropractic-therapy-how-can-it-help-chronic-pain/),\" she says. By completing those studies, Todorov has additional therapies to use to determine what would be the most effective in addressing each person's condition and symptoms. Personalized Treatments Are Powerful Understanding a person's goals, motivation, and obstacles to well-being increases the chances of that person following through with the treatment plan. There has to be buy-in by the individual, Rindfleisch says. \"If the person isn't interested in the plan you've put together because it's not really resonating, then you've wasted everyone's time,\" he says. Todorov agrees that patient engagement with the plan is a must. \"When someone asks me what the best exercise is, I tell them the best exercise is whatever they are willing and able to do,\" she says. How an Integrative Medicine Doctor May Treat Chronic Pain Managing chronic pain with integrative medicine would depend on a lot of factors, including the type of pain a person is experiencing, says Rindfleisch. \"Is the pain related to headache, [fibromyalgia](/fibromyalgia/guide/), [back pain](/back-pain/guide/), or something like [rheumatoid arthritis (RA)](/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/)? Those will all require different approaches,\" he says. Because integrative health considers all aspects of a person, two people with the same symptoms of pain and even the same diagnosis might get two entirely different treatment plans, he says. \"It can also take some trial and error to find the best treatment plan,\" he adds. In some pain conditions, integrative approaches are now being included in the recommended protocol for treatment, says Rindfleisch. For example, the [American College of Physicians](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M16-2367?_ga=2.117740041.1810129443.1647629916-1669579262.1647629915) recommends massage and [acupuncture](/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/) for acute or subacute low back pain. Mind-body therapies such as meditation and yoga are also recommended for some pain conditions, according to the [NCCIH](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health). Potential integrative approaches for people with chronic pain might also include exploring any underlying trauma they may have experienced, nutrition counseling, identifying optimal ways to be physically active and making sure they have appropriate social connections and support, says Rindfleisch. In addition, people with pain might explore underlying trauma (emotional, physical, sexual, spiritual) they may have experienced, or distress that they are experiencing as a result of their health condition or challenges with the mainstream medical system.

Local hospitals or even state regulatory agencies can provide information about the integrative practices in your area. Word of mouth is often a good way to find a healthcare provider, including an integrative medicine practitioner, says Rindfleisch. Some states recognize integrative health as a specialty, but the requirements and licensing can vary widely depending on your location. The [NIH suggests](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/decisions/credentialing.htm) selecting an [integrative healthcare provider](/integrative-health/things-to-know-when-selecting-an-integrative-healthcare-provider/) as carefully as you would a conventional doctor. Do your research and ask lots of questions. Look for integrative doctors who take your health insurance. These doctors still have to be licensed in their initial field, such as internal or family medicine. If the provider is not licensed in the state for any healthcare discipline, that's a red flag. If you have health insurance, visits with board-certified integrative healthcare doctors will be covered just like an appointment with any other physician that accepts your insurance. However, some of the complementary treatments they recommend, such as [cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)](https://www.everydayhealth.com/chronic-pain/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-and-how-can-it-help-chronic-pain/) or [biofeedback](https://www.everydayhealth.com/chronic-pain/biofeedback-therapy-can-help-chronic-pain/), may not be covered. In most cases, the treatment or therapy must be considered \"safe, effective, and medically necessary\" to be covered, according to [Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota](https://www.bluecrossmn.com/health-plans-101/alternative-medicine-whats-safe-and-whats-covered). If you have a PPO plan, you may need to submit a superbill if your preferred physician is out of network. (A superbill details information about services that an insurer may require.)
