I. S UMMARY Responding to the complaints of families reporting vaccine injury and pursuant to its authority, the Subcommittee on Criminal Jus- tice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources (the subcommittee) initi-ated an oversight investigation into the implementation and oper-ation of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (theAct) as administered jointly by the Department of Health andHuman Services [HHS], the Department of Justice [DOJ] and theU.S. Court of Federal Claims (the Court). The Act serves three purposes: (1) Provide fair, expedited com- pensation to those who suffer vaccine injury through the NationalVaccine Injury compensation ([VICP] or the Program); (2) Enhancethe operation of our system of childhood immunizations; and (3)Protect the Nation's vaccine supply by shielding manufacturersfrom liability. The Act has been highly successful in some of its objectives. The vaccine supply is stable and over 1,500 petitioners and their fami-lies have been compensated. But the program has received criti-cism that it does not operate as efficiently or equitably as intendedby Congress. Designed as a ``no-fault'' alternative to litigationagainst vaccine manufacturers, the program was envisioned by VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:01 Oct Settle Claims Quickly and Easily,'' GAO/HEHS\u00b100\u00b18 (December 1999), p. 1. 2Ibid., p. 4.Congress to compensate ``quickly, easily and with certainty andgenerosity'' those individuals who are injured or die as a con-sequence of our universal vaccination policy. Based on testimonial and documentary record, the subcommittee finds that the program under the direction of HHS has approvedchanges that substantially restrict compensation coverage. Further-more, avoidable, protracted and adversarial litigation of claims hasresulted, thereby undermining the remedial nature of the programas intended by the Congress. Accordingly, recommendations are made to:Review the Vaccine Injury Table (the Table) to ensure that it reflects current science and epidemiology; Continue developing and implementing speedy and fair infor- mal dispute resolution options and practices; and Determine a reasonable alternative standard for non-Table cases. II. B ACKGROUND Vaccination is a foundation of modern public health programs and is considered one of the most effective public health initiativesever undertaken. Since immunization programs began, the numberof people contracting vaccine-preventable diseases in the UnitedStates has been reduced by more than 95 percent. 1Morbidity and mortality attributable to smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella, polio,diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus has almost been eliminated. Over 12 million vaccinations are given to children annually, and many millions of vaccines are given to adults. 2States now require that virtually all children be vaccinated prior to entering school. The benefits of vaccination are measured in terms of prevented disease in individuals and in the population to be protected againstinfectious disease. The risks are measured as potential side effectsand injuries. Both are monitored as part of the U.S. public healthsystem. In some instances, the differences in the ways that im-mune systems react to vaccines on rare occasions may result in se-vere side effects, including death or disabling conditions requiringlifetime medical care. Despite these rare instances, it is the overwhelming view of the medical and public health community that the risks of vaccine re-actions, both mild reactions and rare serious ones, are far out-weighed by the public health benefits of current vaccination prac-tices. Maintaining public support for immunizations is critical forpreventing outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases. NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT Every year, a number of children are seriously injured by ad- verse reactions to vaccines. When such a tragedy befalls a family,they are faced with devastating emotional and financial con-sequences. As the devastation of adverse reactions can lead to pa-ralysis, permanent disability and death, families without adequateinsurance can face enormous expenses, including residential care,therapy, medical equipment, and drugs. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:01 5``Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,'' GAO/HEHS\u00b100\u00b18, p. 5.Following a nationwide initiative to raise immunization levels among children in the late 1970's, lawsuits in the 1980's stemmingfrom adverse reactions threatened to negatively affect availability,cost and development of vaccines. Before the VICP was established, families experiencing vaccine related reactions had to rely upon traditional tort litigation. Fami-lies were often unable to obtain the scientific and legal resourcesneeded to substantiate vaccine-related injuries in legal proceedings.Scientific studies and medical evidence needed to definitively linkvaccines with various medical conditions were often unavailable orinsufficient to establish the traditional level of proof required forcompensation in the civil tort system. As lawsuits increased, vac-cine manufacturers also were burdened with the time and expensesof litigation, as well as the availability and affordability of liabilityinsurance. As the number of vaccine manufacturers fell and pricesrose, physicians and public health professionals warned of the po-tential return of epidemic infectious diseases. 3 In response, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine In- jury Act of 1986 (Public Law 99\u00b1660) (the Act) to establish a simplesystem of compensation for children suffering injuries related toroutine pediatric immunizations. The Act created a National Vac-cine Program and VICP, including advisory committees for each.The Act specifies remedies available to persons suffering vaccine-related injuries, establishes requirements regarding recordkeepingand reporting on vaccine administration and adverse effects, andcalls for increased studies of vaccines. The new system for vaccinecompensation was intended to be ``fair, simple, and easy to admin-ister.'' 4 NATIONAL VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM Under the Act, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Pro- gram ([VICP] or Program) was created to provide compensation to those who suffer vaccine-related injury or death. The Program isdesigned as a ``no fault'' alternative to civil litigation intended tobe ``fair, simple, and easy to administer'' and ``to compensate per-sons with recognized vaccine injuries without requiring the difficultindividual determinations of causation to injury.'' 5 Vaccines currently covered under the Program include diph- theria, tetanus, pertussis (DTP, DTaP, DT, TT or Td), measles,mumps, rubella (MMR or any components) and polio (OPV or IPV).Hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib), and varicella(chickenpox) vaccines were added for coverage, effective August 6,1997. Rotavirus was added effective October 22, 1998. Eight yearsof retroactive coverage from the effective date is provided for vac-cine-related adverse events associated with any vaccine newlyadded to the Program. Since enactment, the Program has paid out approximately $1.17 billion in awards for vaccine injuries and attorney's fees. Disburse-ment for injuries related to vaccines administered after October 1,1988 are provided by the trust fund supported by an excise tax of75 cents on every dose of vaccine sold that is covered by the Pro- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:01 Oct 8``Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,'' GAO/HEHS\u00b100\u00b18, p. 13.gram. Retrospective claims are paid from general fund appropria- tions.6 ADVISORY COMMISSION ON CHILDHOOD VACCINES The Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines [ACCV] is charged with monitoring the VICP and making recommendationsto the Secretary of HHS on its implementation. It is composed ofnine members appointed by the Secretary for 3-year terms. Threeare healthcare professionals, of whom at least two must be pedia-tricians; three are members of the public, of whom at least twomust be parents or guardians of vaccine injured children; and threeare attorneys, of whom at least one is counsel to a petitioner andone represents manufacturers. The Commission meets four times ayear and is required to submit recommendations on the Programto the Secretary of Health and Human Services. One of the primary responsibilities of the Commission is advising on modifications to the Table. According to the statute, ``The Sec-retary may not propose changes to the Vaccine Injury Table or anyrevision thereof, unless the Secretary has first provided to theCommission a copy of the proposed regulation or revision, re-quested recommendations and comments by the Commission andallowed the Commission at least 90 days to make such rec-ommendations.'' Controversy continues over whether, after reviewing proposed regulations but undergoing a substantial change in membership,the Commission had the opportunity to reconsider fully the finalversion of the March 1995 regulations to the ACCV prior to theireffective date. Critics contend the Commission was unable to ad-dress the appropriateness of the amendments, in particular thedefinitional change of the word ``encephalopathy'' in the ``Aids to In-terpretation.'' Moreover, the ACCV proposed certain additions tothe Table that subsequently were rejected by the Secretary. In con-trast, HHS argues that the Commission reviewed the change. In1996, HHS won a legal decision regarding this matter. 7 NATIONAL VACCINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE The National Vaccine Advisory Committee [NVAC] has a broad mandate for reviewing and making recommendations concerningvaccine research, production, delivery, safety and efficacy. Rec-ommendations have included ad hoc committee reviews of risks as-sociated with each of the vaccines listed on the injury table. NVAC is comprised of representatives from State and local health departments, vaccine companies, academia, and consumergroups. 8 VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENTS In an effort to establish adequate risk communication, the Act re- quires that all healthcare providers who administer vaccines mustprovide a Vaccine Information Statement [VIS] to the vaccine re-cipient, their parent or legal guardian prior to each dose. Each VIScontains a brief description of the disease as well as the risks and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:01 Oct the vaccine. The VIS is developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] and distributed to State andlocal health departments as well as individual providers. Criticisms have been expressed that the VIS advisements may be incomplete and, in practice, there may be failures to inform recipi-ents of appropriate circumstances for considering modification tothe normal vaccination schedule or to opt out of receiving the vac-cine. The subcommittee agrees that pediatricians and health careproviders should fully inform patients about vaccine risks and ben-efits. ASSESSMENTS OF CAUSALITY Vaccine reactions can be classified by frequency (common, rare), extent (local, systemic), severity (hospitalization, disability, death),causality, and preventability (intrinsic to vaccine, faulty produc-tion, faulty administration). Because of the large number of vaccine exposures, it is clear that temporal associations with adverse outcomes will occur even whenthere is no causal association. Many health problems in infancywill occur in children who have been vaccinated, and some of theseproblems will by chance occur in recently vaccinated children. An adverse event can be causally linked to a vaccine more read- ily if: 1) the event conforms to a specific clinical syndrome whoseassociation with vaccination has strong biological plausibility (suchas anaphylaxis immediately following vaccination); 2) a laboratoryresult confirms the association (i.e. viral culture and genetic se-quencing show virus is a vaccine and not a wild strain); 3) theevent recurs on re-administration of the vaccine (positive rechal-lenge); or 4) a controlled clinical trial or carefully designed epide-miological study shows greater risk of adverse events among vac-cinated than control groups. Because few of the adverse events reported meet any of the first three criteria and clinical trials are almost always too small to pro-vide useful information on serious rare events, epidemiological evi-dence is the basis for assessing vaccine-relatedness for most seriousadverse events that are investigated. Still, much remains unknownabout possible adverse events that may be associated with past andpresent vaccination practices. CHILDHOOD VACCINE STUDIES The Act called for the Institute of Medicine [IOM] to review ex- isting studies and medical literature and provide a foundation forrecommendations on vaccine injury causation. In reports issued in1991 and 1994, IOM published several conclusions regarding thescarcity of knowledge about vaccine safety, citing severe limits indata and research capability. Of the 76 adverse events IOM re-viewed for a causal relationship, 50 (66 percent) had no or inad-equate research. Specifically, IOM Committees identified the following limitations of existing knowledge: 1) Inadequate understanding of biologicmechanisms underlying adverse events; 2) Insufficient or incon-sistent information from case reports and case series; 3) Inad-equate size or length of follow-up of many population-based epide-miological studies; 4) Limitations of existing systems VerDate Adverse Events Associated with Vaccines (National Acad- emy Press, 1994). 101996 IOM Vaccine Safety Forum. 11Vaccines\u00d0Finding the Balance Between Public Safety and Personal Choice, hearing before the House Committee on Government Reform, 106th Cong., 1st sess., serial No. 106\u00b184 (1999).to provide persuasive evidence of causation, and 5) Few publishedepidemiological studies. IOM warned that ``if research capacity and accomplishments [are] not improved, future reviews vaccine safety [will be] simi-larly handicapped.'' 9IOM recommends: ``More research could be done on potential long-term adverse effects from vaccines as wellas the potential of vaccines to induce or worsen immune disorders.''CDC agrees that there remains ``uncertainty about estimates of therisk associated with vaccination'' and that to ``continue research toimprove the understanding of vaccine risks is critical.'' 10 Despite concerns of IOM, parents, public health authorities and other stakeholders, research needed to develop additional scientificevidence that conclusively addresses many issues of causality hasnot been completed. Concerns have been expressed that additionalresearch is needed to address the effects of vaccines on chronic dis-eases, adverse events reporting, the delivery of multiple vaccinesand increased rates of childhood vaccinations. 11While vaccines must be demonstrated to be safe and effective prior to marketing,agencies including NIH, FDA and CDC contend they are con-strained by limited resources. However, in part as a response to theconcerns of this subcommittee, HHS has recently contracted withIOM to undertake further vaccine safety studies. COMPENSATION PROCEDURES An individual claiming injury or death from a vaccine must file a claim or petition with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (theCourt). To qualify, injury claims must be filed within 36 monthsafter initial onset of symptoms, and claims for deaths must be re-ceived within 2 years of death and 4 years after the onset of thevaccine-related injury from which the death occurred. The Sec-retary of HHS, as overall administrator of the Program, is namedRespondent on behalf of the government and is represented by theDepartment of Justice [DOJ]. A physician assigned by HHS has 90 days to review the petition and make a non-binding recommendation as to compensability,based primarily on medical records. This recommendation is thenprovided to the Court through the DOJ attorney assigned to thecase. If the court concurs with an entitlement recommendation, itmay obviate the need for a hearing. Those cases that are not conceded usually proceed to a hearing before an assigned Special Master, who acts in a capacity similarto an administrative law judge. Both the petitioner and the DOJpresent testimony, including expert witnesses, and decisionmakingauthority is vested in the Court's assigned Special Master. To expedite proceedings, formal civil discovery and rules of evi- dence have been relaxed in favor of a more informal process, andtimelines have been established. The Special Master is required toissue a judgement within 240 days (exclusive of suspended time)from the date a claim is filed, or the petitioner may withdraw fromthe Program. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Program,'' GAO/HEHS\u00b100\u00b18, p. Questions About NVICP,'' p. 4.The Special Master's decision may be appealed by either party to a judge of the Court, then to the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Ap-peals, and then to the U.S. Supreme Court. 12Following adjudica- tion, if compensation is awarded, damages are negotiated and fu-ture needs assessed, typically in consultation with medical profes-sionals, life care planners and other experts. For compensable inju-ries, awards may take the form of an initial lump sum plus an an-nuity providing a stream of benefits for lifetime costs of care notcovered by insurance. The Program does not pay punitive damages.Successful claims are eligible to receive reasonable compensationfor past and future unreimbursable medical, custodial and rehabili-tation costs; a $250,000 limit for actual and projected pain, suf-fering and emotional distress; and lost earnings. A cap of $250,000was legislated as payment for compensable deaths. To ensure access, the Program also pays attorneys fees and costs for the petitioner regardless of adjudication, assuming there is areasonable basis for the petition and it was filed in good faith.While not required, most petitioners do seek legal counsel to helpnavigate the program's procedures and the need for complex med-ical evidence. No petition may be filed under the Program if a civil action is pending for damages related to the vaccine injury, or if damageswere previously awarded to the petitioner by a court or in a civilsettlement against the vaccine manufacturer or administrator.However, lawsuits may be filed against manufacturers or healthcare providers under State law in some circumstances, such aswhen a petition is dismissed or judged noncompensable, or whenthe vaccine is not covered under the Program, or if the petitioneris not satisfied with the amount of awarded compensation. 13 Since the program's date of inception, October 1988, approxi- mately 6,000 petitions have been filed, 75 percent involving injuryallegations from vaccines administered prior to the law's enact-ment. Of those cases, more than half (3,500) have resulted in dis-missal. To date: 71 percent of the claims are for DTP/DTP-Hib; 2percent for tetanus/Td/DT; 15 percent for MMR or components, 10percent for OPV/IPV; and the remaining 2 percent are for new vac-cines, vaccines not covered under the VICP, or unspecified vac-cines. Awards have ranged from $120.00 to $7.9 million, with theaverage approximately $800,000. 14 STANDARDS OF PROOF Petitioners may become eligible to receive compensation in three ways. First, the claimant must prove, by a preponderance of theevidence, that an injury listed on the Table occurred within theprescribed time. Second, if the injury is not listed on the Table or did not occur within the prescribed timeframe, pursuant to present adjudicationpractices, a petitioner is held to traditional and more difficult tortstandards, and must prove traditional causation or ``causation-in-fact.'' Congress' guidance on ``causation-in-fact'' cases is as follows,``Simple similarity to conditions or time periods listed in the Tableis not sufficient evidence of causation; evidence in the form of sci- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16``Vaccine Injury Compensation,'' GAO/HEHS\u00b100\u00b18, p. 12. 17``An Overview of Vaccine Safety,'' CDC.entific studies or expert medical testimony is necessary to dem- onstrate causation for such a petitioner.''15Only a small percent- age of claims found not to be covered on the Table receives com-pensation (only 13 percent). 16 Finally, the petitioner may receive compensation if he or she demonstrates that the vaccine significantly aggravated a pre-exist-ing condition. Children who do not receive compensation from thefund may be required to rely on other Federal health services thatprovide limited medical coverage and home health assistance. VACCINE INJURY TABLE A unique mechanism is used in the Program to provide peti- tioners with a rebuttable presumption of causation. This mecha-nism is the Table of Compensable Events, known as the VaccineInjury Table (the Table) and its complementary Qualifications andAids to Interpretation, which provides definitions for injuries andthe specific circumstances under which the Table injuries mustoccur. Originally enacted in 1988 by Congress and subsequently re-vised by HHS with the advice of experts, the Table identifies seri-ous adverse events that certain experts considered to be caused byvaccines. 17 The Table serves to eliminate some of the uncertainty caused by gaps in medical knowledge by listing vaccines covered by the pro-gram and the injuries, disabilities, illnesses, and conditions (includ-ing death) for which compensation may be paid. It also defines theperiod of time during which the first symptom or substantial aggra-vation of the injury must appear. Provided that no ``factor unrelated'' can be established by the government as the cause of injury, adverse events that occur with-in the Table are presumed to be related to and caused by the vac-cine. By creating a framework to allow for a presumption of cause and effect to exist for the claimant, the Table is intended to removemuch of the burden of proof required in traditional tort pro-ceedings. By contrast, under traditional civil litigation practices,the injured party bears the burden of proving that the vaccinecaused injury. This presumptive feature is crucial to the integrityof a no-fault, expedited vaccine injury compensation system, andthis approach to vaccine relatedness was intended as a guidingprinciple for the Vaccine Compensation Program. Alternative presumptions of cause and effect procedure already exist in other Federal health and benefit programs. For example,the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 (PublicLaw 104\u00b1262) (Veterans Health Care Act) requires the Departmentof Veterans Affairs [VA] to furnish hospital care and medical serv-ices, and may furnish nursing home care to veterans exposed toherbicides in Vietnam. For an Agent-Orange-based claim by a Viet-nam veteran for service-connected benefits, the Veterans HealthCare Act requires: A medical diagnosis of a disease which VA recognizes as being associated with Agent Orange [specified diseases]; VerDate Department of Veterans Affairs, Vol. 16, No. 1 (May 2000). 19``An Overview of Vaccine Safety,'' CDC, p. 4.Competent evidence of service in Vietnam or offshore in the adjacent waters between 1962 and 1975; and Competent medical evidence that the disease began within the deadline (if any).18 VACCINE ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING SYSTEM The Act mandates that all health care providers report certain adverse events following vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse EventReporting System [VAERS]. VAERS was established by the Foodand Drug Administration [FDA] and CDC in 1990 to provide a uni-fied mechanism for the collection and analysis of adverse events as-sociated with vaccines currently licensed in the United States. Re-portable vaccine adverse events are defined as health effects thatoccur after immunization that may or may not be related to thevaccine. 1916 VAERS is a passive surveillance system, a repository for volun- tarily submitted reports. An active surveillance system, by con-trast, would follow all individuals in a defined population to deter-mine their responses to vaccinations. The VAERS reporting form isdesigned to allow a narrative description of adverse events. To encourage reporting of any possibly vaccine-induced adverse event, the criteria for reporting to VAERS is nonrestrictive; thesystem accepts and includes any report submitted, no matter howtenuous the possible connection with vaccination might seem. Allpersons, including patients, parents and health professionals canreport to VAERS with no restrictions on onset intervals or require-ments for medical care. The Act does require that physicians report\u00d0directly to VAERS or to the manufacturer\u00d0certain categories of serious outcomes de-fined for regulatory purposes as an event resulting in death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization, prolongation of existing hos-pitalization, or permanent disability. VAERS is intended to serve as the ``front line'' of vaccine safety, since this type of national reporting system can rapidly documentpossible effects and generate early warning signals that can thenbe more rigorously investigated in focused studies. VAERS is con-sidered especially valuable in assessing the safety of newly mar-keted vaccines. VACCINE SAFETY DATALINK PROJECT The gaps that exist in the scientific knowledge of rare vaccine side effects prompted the CDC to develop the Vaccine SafetyDatalink [VSD] project in 1990. This project involved forming part-nerships with four large health maintenance organizations [HMOs]to continually monitor vaccine safety. VSD is an example of alarge-linked database [LLDB] and includes information on morethan 6 million people. All vaccines administered within the study population are re- corded. Available data includes vaccine type, date, manufacturer,lot number concurrent vaccinations (those given during the samevisit) and injection site. Medical records are then monitored for po-tential adverse events. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:01 Trust Fund,'' GAO, p. 19.The VSD project allows for planned vaccine safety studies as well as timely investigations of hypotheses. At present, the VSD projectis examining potential associations between vaccines and 34 seri-ous conditions. The database is also being used to test new vaccinesafety hypotheses and issues from the medical literature, VAERS,changes in the immunization schedule or from the introduction ofnew vaccines. III. V ACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM ISSUES VACCINE INJURY TABLE CHANGES The Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (the Act) established the first Vaccine Injury Table (the Table) as an interim compromiseuntil more scientific information became available, and granted theSecretary rulemaking authority to amend the Table at such time,bringing it more in line with current science. It also called for IOMto assist the Secretary in making changes by conducting a reviewof medical studies. HHS exercised its rulemaking authority to amend the Table and the Aids to Interpretation in 1995 and again in 1997, following thepublication of IOM studies in 1991 and 1994, respectively. In thereports, IOM identified certain conditions that were 1) consistentor inconsistent with a causal relationship; 2) those that favored ordid not favor a causal relationship; and 3) those where evidencewas insufficient to indicate the presence or absence of a causal re-lationship. Most conditions fell in the third category, as IOM con-cluded there was insufficient medical evidence to prove or disprove a relationship between vaccines and two-thirds of the 75 medicalconditions studied. In conjunction with public policy considerations provided by the ACCV, scientific issues raised by the NVAC, and input from thepublic, the Secretary added seven injuries and removed three oth-ers from the Table while altering definitions in the Aids to Inter-pretation. These revisions made it easier for some petitioners to ob-tain compensation, but more difficult for a larger number of peti-tioners. Far more claims were associated with the injuries removed from the Table than were associated with the injuries that were added.Prior to the Table revisions, three quarters of the claims alleged in-juries on the Table, after the revisions were implemented, morethan half of the claims filed were Table injuries. Of note, almosthalf of past claims awarded compensation were for injuries subse-quently removed from the Table. 20 Under current practices, modifications of the Table largely deter- mine the types of claims for which compensation will be awarded.Historically, injury claims not covered under the Table tend to beapproved for compensation far less often than Table injuries, andthe compensation amounts are considerably lower. 21Thus, in ad- ministering and refining the Table, HHS defines the parameters ofcompensation coverage, and is able to limit liability through admin-istrative changes. The justifications for some changes have been VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:01 Oct Injury Compensation,'' GAO/HEHS\u00b100\u00b18, p. 15.criticized by some patients, members of the petitioner's bar, and others. Recently, GAO concluded, ``Where science is insufficient to deter- mine causal relationships between a vaccine and injuries, it is notclear that HHS' criteria and approach to making injury tablechanges are consistent.'' 22 Discussing amendments to the Table, HHS cites the following four factors: IOM findings (and subsequent medical studies); bio-logic plausibility; recommendations from the Advisory Council onChildhood Vaccines [ACCV] and the National Vaccine AdvisoryCommittee [NVAC]; and prevalence of the condition in the popu-lation attributable to vaccines. However, GAO findings concludethat: ``In communicating its decisions to the public, HHS does notuniformly discuss each of these factors, and the reasons why therelative importance of each factor varies among the decisions is notapparent in all cases.'' 23GAO noted: The Institute of Medicine (IOM) found that existing sci- entific evidence favored acceptance of a causal relationshipbetween tetanus vaccines and brachial neuritis, and HHSadded that condition to the injury table. On the otherhand, the Institute also found evidence of a causal rela-tionship between the tetanus and oral polio vaccines andGuillain-Barre syndrome, but HHS did not add this condi-tion to the injury table. The IOM found the evidence inadequate to accept or re- ject a causal relation between vaccines and residual sei-zure disorder, and HHS removed this condition from theinjury table. The Institute also found evidence inadequateto accept or reject a causal relation between the measlesand mumps vaccines and encephalopathy, yet HHS leftthis condition on the injury table. HHS stated in the Federal Register that decisions not to add injuries, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, or to re-move injuries, such as residual seizure disorder, werebased to some extent on the level of risk in compensatingan inordinate number of non-vaccine-related cases for theextremely rare vaccine-related case. In applying this cri-terion, however, HHS' assumptions about the number ofpotential claims and thresholds for deciding the reasonablelevel of financial risk for compensating non-vaccine-relatedinjuries were not defined. 24 Accordingly, criticisms have been expressed that certain proce- dural actions taken by HHS in revising the Table were inconsistentwith the intent of Congress. Some changes have been made to theTable restricting compensation coverage for reasons of both scienceand policy. It is the view of many in the medical community thatthe Table, with its near-determinative effect in practice upon com-pensation, reflects some of the best available scientific and epide-miological research. Finally, current adjudication practices gen-erally assume that the Table reflects existing science and place un-duly restrictive causation burdens on petitioners who seek to make VerDate 11-MAY-2000 p. 9. 28Ibid., p. 10.claims not covered by the Table. Congress intended that a peti- tioner be given a reasonable opportunity to present evidence of vac-cine injury relatedness even when the injury does not fall withinthe Table. COMPENSATION DETERMINATION AND AWARD DELAYS The compensation process continues to take much longer than Congress intended. The original legislation required a judgementwithin 1 year and was subsequently amended to require a decisionby the Court's Special Master within 240 days. GAO found that 30\u00b140 percent of claims filed each year was processed within 2 years. 25 However, of the more than 5,000 claims filed from October 1, 1988through February 1999, only about 14 percent received judgmentwithin 1 year, most did not receive judgment within 2 years, andalmost a third received judgment in 5 or more years. 26 Significant delays in adjudication reportedly resulted from the volume of claims received for injuries that occurred prior to October1, 1988. As the January 31, 1991 deadline to file these retrospec-tive claims drew near, the number of petitions jumped from 125 in1989 to 3,263 in 1990, creating an immediate and substantial back-log that continues to impact HHS. 27 Although the number of claims filed since the 1991 deadline has dramatically decreased, the number of claims adjudicated also hasdeclined. The continued procedural delays, which include suspen-sions at the request of petitioners, reportedly are attributed insome instances to the government's desire to execute a vigorous de-fense. According to DOJ, the most common cause of delay is petitioner's inability to provide required medical records that permit a properreview of their claims. HHS data show that more than half of allpetitioners were requested to provide supplementary medicalrecords or other information, and most took at least a year to doso. After all the information was received, in most cases, it took thecourt over another year to reach its decision. 28 Petitions claiming injuries ``off Table,'' or not listed on the Table, account for some delays. According to the Chief Special Master,whether cases proceed under the Table or as causation-in-fact casescorrelates directly to the amount of time, the number of issues pre-sented, and the cost of processing cases. He explains that, prior tothe enactment of the Table changes, the vast majority of cases(well over 90 percent) proceeded pursuant to the Table and wereresolved quickly. ``Causation'' cases take longer as more specializedexperts are required, more legal and medical issues are presented,hearings are longer, concessions are fewer, and decisions are farmore difficult, lengthy and time intensive. The duration of caseproceedings and adjudications could increase if the number of non-Table injury cases increases. ADVERSARIAL PROCESS As the DOJ has pursued aggressive defenses in compensation cases, entitlement and compensation determinations have been per- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 statement by Dr. Marcel Kinsbourne. 31Decision of Special Master Edwards, Marks v. Sec HHS, p. 15.ceived by some petitioners as being inappropriately adversarial in nature. According to a GAO report, the availability of more fundshas enabled DOJ to ``establish a cadre of attorneys specializing invaccine injury.'' According to DOJ, there are 16 trial attorneys inthe vaccine compensation program. HHS ``established an expertwitness program'' to challenge claims. 29It is also important to note that Program procedural changes may need approval from theCourt. During our September 28, 1999 hearing, the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources (the sub-committee) received testimony from petitioners, their experts andattorneys charging that the governments' defense has, in the wordsof one witness, ``become increasingly stubborn and aggressive, tothe point that in its spirit, it is now indistinguishable from the ad-versarial manner in which some civil lawsuits are conducted.'' DOJ asserts that many attorneys in the petitioners' bar speak highly of the compensation process and the cooperative efforts ofgovernment counsel. Contrary to DOJ's views, critics cite a numberof questionable practices by DOJ, even with the sanction of theCourt, appeals resulting in multiple entitlement hearings, aggres-sive use by government of expert witnesses and investigators, andhighly adversarial conduct aimed at impeaching petitioner experts.Other criticisms are noted below: DOJ attorneys make full use of the apparently limitless re- sources available to them. They substitute one expert for an-other if the opinion rendered by the first is unfavorable orseems not to impress the court, essentially replacing one the-ory for another, or recruit multiple experts for a single case.Multiple entitlement hearings result. According to DOJ, theGovernment has only appealed one case to the Federal CircuitCourt of Appeals since 1995, and also contends that peti-tioner's experts are numerous.If a Court decision is unfavorable, DOJ may repeat argu- ments during the Damages Hearing that fail during the enti-tlement phase, thus making the process of awarding due com-pensation unnecessarily contentious and burdensome. 30 Marks v. Sec. HHS has been criticized. ``In the special mas- ter's view, [respondent's] counsel's abrasive, tenacious, obstrep-erous litigation tactics were inappropriate in a program that isintended to be less adversarial; and hindered greatly a fair, ex-peditious resolution of the case. In addition, counsel lacks sim-ply tact and compassion. Quite frankly; the special master isembarrassed that respondent's counsel and respondent's lifecare planner represented the United States Government in thiscase.'' 31DOJ claims this case was highly exceptional, and the attorney's conduct was reviewed. Finally, DOJ indicated to the subcommittee that no DOJ attor- neys handling vaccine injury cases had received formal training inAlternative Dispute Resolution [ADR] techniques and practicesprior to the subcommittee hearing on this topic. Since the hearing,DOJ reports that all attorneys assigned to vaccine compensationcases have been trained in ADR and that efforts are underway to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:01 Oct v. HHS, pp. 3\u00b111.utilize ADR more fully. DOJ also has suggested the addition of a Court rule requiring consideration of voluntary ADR in all cases. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY The doctrine of sovereign immunity generally prevents the Fed- eral Government from being sued without its consent. In inter-preting legislation, courts may consider whether there has been awaiver of immunity with respect to a particular type of litigationagainst the United States. One canon of statutory construction is that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be definitively and unequivocally expressed. A sec-ond one is that the statutory language setting forth a waiver is tobe construed strictly in favor of the government. Yet another prin-ciple of statutory construction regarding remedial or ``welfare'' leg-islation is that courts give a liberal interpretation to further the re-medial or humanitarian purposes underlying the statute. Because the Act authorizes suits and monetary awards against the United States, the doctrine of sovereign immunity has been in-terpreted and applied by Special Masters. With respect to the Act,which is ``remedial'' in nature and waives the Federal Govern-ment's immunity from suit, the sovereign immunity doctrine hasbeen used to ``trump'' competing remedial constructions and providea rationale for restricting compensation awards. 32 Petitioners' representatives argue that the remedial intent of the Act to provide generous compensation should prevail. Some arguethat the waiver of sovereign immunity is not applicable technicallysince the Secretary simply administers a trust funded through avaccine tax. Some critics of current practices have called for an ex-press provision to nullify the application of the doctrine of sov-ereign immunity. The committee is concerned that the doctrineshould be applied in an appropriate manner, consistent with the re-medial purposes of the Act. COMPENSATION TRUST FUND Historically, the vaccine injury compensation trust fund (the Trust fund) has received more in vaccine excise taxes than it haspaid out for claims and related administrative costs. Because thefund has spent only about $347 million of the $1.37 billion accrued through fiscal year 1999; the remaining approximately $1 billionwas loaned to the Treasury and used for other Federal programsand activities in exchange for Treasury securities. Interest on thesesecurities now totals approximately $435 million. The interest inaddition to the $1 billion loaned to the Treasury make up the $1.46billion balance accrued by the end of fiscal year 1999, representinga very substantial unused reserve. Unless changes in the administration of the Program are imple- mented or new scientific research findings become available, thistrend of revenue exceeding expenditures could continue, while com-pensation awards are increasingly difficult. At current rates, theCongressional Budget Office projects that in the next 10 years, thefund will double in size. The limited number of compensation awards and growing fund balance have become controversial, with various options being con- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:01 Oct Vaccines Do Harm to Kids: Autism and More,'' Insight Magazine, Feb. 4, 2000, p. 3. 35``Commonly Asked Questions About the NVICP,'' HRSA, p. 2. 36``Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund,'' GAO report, p. 19.sidered to address the unused funds. Vaccine manufacturers viewthe growing balance as an indicator that the excise tax rate is toohigh and should be lowered. Petitioner families cite the fund as evi-dence of the government's unwillingness to compensate vaccine in-juries and advocate a less restrictive injury table and less burden-some compensation practices. While the administration has not ar-ticulated a clear position on this issue, officials from HHS haveconsidered the fund as a potential source of revenue for vaccine-re-lated research or surveillance. 33 In the 106th Congress, Representative Lewis (R\u00b1KY) abill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce the taxon vaccines to 25 cents per dose. The bill has 66 cosponsors, 40 Re-publicans and 26 Democrats, of which 27 are members of the Waysand Means Committee. Senator Bunning (KY) introduced the com-panion bill, S. 85. While the trust fund contains a significant sum of money, efforts to reduce funding sources raise serious concerns. The worldwidevaccine market is estimated soon to top $7 billion. 34In the United States alone, there are currently vaccines in development againstalmost 60 diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites,including AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Coverage for new vac-cines could negatively affect the future trust fund balance. 35 Similarly, changes in the recommended schedule of vaccinations, the increasing use of combination vaccines, and the potential foremerging knowledge linking vaccines to adverse reactions makesrisk assessment increasingly difficult. HHS has warned that thefund should not be considered an impenetrable reserve of funds. Options to control the growth of the trust fund could have rev- enue and spending implications for the overall Federal budget. TheBudget Enforcement Act of 1990 mandates that Congress offset thecost of legislation that reduces revenue or increases spending by es-tablishing new or higher taxes elsewhere or by decreasing spendingfor other programs. 36 VACCINE ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING SYSTEM Typically, vaccine safety studies that are epidemiological based make inferences from the absence of specific problems. Therefore,it is important to examine and consider surveillance and risk man-agement systems and practices. While the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System [VAERS] may be lauded as the ``front line'' of vaccine safety, the lack of en-forcement provisions and effective monitoring of reporting practicespreclude accurate assessments of the extent to which adverseevents are actually reported. Former FDA Commissioner David A.Kessler has estimated that VAERS reports currently represent onlya fraction of the serious adverse events. The quality of VAERS data has been questioned. Because reports are submitted from a variety of sources, some inexperienced incompleting data forms for medical studies, many reports omit im- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:01 Events Following Vaccination: Workshop Summary,'' by Cynthia J. Howe, Richard B. Johnston, and Gerald M. Fenichel, editors, November 1995.portant data and contain obvious errors. Assessment is further complicated by the administration of multiple vaccines at the sametime, following currently recommended vaccine schedules, becausethere may be no conclusive way to determine which vaccine or com-bination of vaccines caused the specific adverse event. As a database for epidemiological studies, VAERS has serious weaknesses. One major problem is that since unvaccinated people experiencing adverse events are not reported to VAERS, there is nocontrol group to study. Given that over 10,000 reports are filed an-nually, it is difficult to assure the accuracy and completeness of thedatabase. IOM recognizes that there are limits to the detection andresponse systems currently in use. In a forum convened on thissubject, they concluded: ``[E]fforts can be made to improve thequantity, quality, accessibility, and usefulness of VAERS re-ports.'' 37 CONFLICTING ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES Within Congress, there is bipartisan concern over dual respon- sibilities and potential conflicting interests in HHS drug develop-ment and delivery. Regarding vaccines, HHS conducts and encour-ages vaccine research on the one hand and is the lead agency with-in the Federal Government for the promotion of vaccination pro-grams. HHS also administers the Vaccine Injury CompensationProgram ([VICP] or the Program). Critics charge these responsibil-ities may conflict. Under HHS, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] makes recommendations for the routine adminis-tration of vaccines along with schedules regarding appropriate peri-odicity, dosage, and contraindications. The ACIP recommends vac-cine purchases by CDC. The Food and Drug Administration's Vac-cine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee[VRBPAC] is responsible for supporting applications for licensureof vaccines. Because of the importance of preserving the public health through the use of safe and effective vaccines, maintaining thehighest level of integrity over the entire spectrum of vaccine devel-opment and implementation is critical, and opportunities for con-flicting roles and interests should be avoided whenever possible. IV. L EGISLATIVE PROPOSALS PROPOSALS ENDORSED BY HHS AND DOJ The Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines [ACCV] has recommended that the HHS Secretary propose changes to the Pub-lic Health Service Act and the Internal Revenue Code that wouldimprove the VICP. One of these proposals, the elimination of therequirement that claimants must have incurred non-reimbursableexpenses in excess of $1,000 to file a petition for compensation, wassigned into law on October 22, 1998. The remainder of the rec-ommendations have been incorporated into a bill and sent to theCongress for its consideration. These include: VerDate 11-MAY-2000 current statute of limitations from 3 years for in- jury claims and 2 years for death claims, to 6 years for thoseclaiming injury or death resulting from a covered vaccine.Allow for the inclusion of family counseling expenses in VICP awards.Add a phrase to specifically allow for the inclusion of reason- able fees and costs associated with the establishment of aguardianship or conservatorship in the definition of ``othercosts.''Allow for an interim payment of costs incurred in adjudi- cating a post-1988 claim under the VICP after a finding as toentitlement is established. Such an interim payment would bemade prior to entry of a final judgment and upon a findingthat there was good faith and a reasonable basis for the claim.Establish a specific method of calculating lost earnings under VICP.Eliminate requirement that ACCV meet at least four times annually.Change the rulemaking process for amending the Table by reducing the period for public comment from 180 days to 60days, and eliminating the requirement for a public hearing. Clarify the Scope of the term ``Factors Unrelated'' as it ap- plies to determining eligibility and compensation.Expand criteria for one of the two reserved general public seats on the ACCV under Section 2119(a)(1)(B) of the PublicHealth Service Act to include individuals who have suffered avaccine-related injury either as children or as adults.Allow the U.S. Court of Federal Claims the discretion to pro- vide for a check for attorneys' fees and costs awarded undersection 2115(e) to be made payable solely to the attorney forthe petitioner.Increase to $10,000,000 the limitation on the amount that may be expended for payment of administrative expenses re-lated to the operation of the VICP from the Vaccine InjuryCompensation Trust Fund. The following amendment, which the ACCV did not have the op- portunity to review, was added to the Department's proposed billby the Department of Treasury: Allow use of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund to pay expenses incurred by the Bureau of the Public Debt in pro-viding financial services to the Trust Fund. ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS Among recently recommended legislative reforms brought to the attention of the subcommittee are the following: Senator Daschle (D\u00b1SD) introduced a bill, S. 992, ``to provide technical amendments to the Vaccine Injury Compensation TrustFund.'' The bill repealed certain mutually conflicting amendmentswithin Public Law 105\u00b1277, ``Omnibus Consolidated and Emer-gency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999.'' The change elimi-nates confusion regarding compensability of petitions based on cer-tain administrations of any of the three vaccines added to coverageunder the program in 1997. In addition, the bill removes the re-quirement that at least $1,000 in non-reimbursable expenses be in-curred prior to acceptance of the petition for consideration. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:01 Oct 1337, ``a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce the tax onvaccines to 25 cents per dose.'' This is identical to the bill intro-duced as H.R. 1337, entitled the ``Vaccinate America's ChildrenNow bill has 66 cosponsors, 40 Republicans and 26Democrats, of which 27 are members of the Ways and Means Com-mittee. Strong support for this proposal also was seen in the 105thCongress within the Ways and Means Committee and the SenateFinance Committee. Senator Bunning (R\u00b1KY), introduced a com-panion bill in the Senate, S. 85, with six cosponsors and more ex-pected. Representative Marcy Kaptur (D\u00b1OH) introduced H.R. 1003, ``a bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise the filingdeadline for certain claims under the National Vaccine Injury Com-pensation Program.'' The language in the bill is the same as in thebill she introduced in the 105th Congress as H.R. 3778. Her pro-posal is to amend the criteria defining the starting point for thetime period in which a petition for compensation may be filed. Cur-rently, the timeframe is 36 months beginning with ``the date of theoccurrence of the first symptom or manifestation of onset or of thesignificant aggravation of such injury.'' This bill retains the 36-month time period, but allows the period to commence on the datea diagnosis of vaccine injury is made. Eight other Democrats wereadded as cosponsors. Representative Nancy Pelosi (D\u00b1CA) introduced H.R. 1274, a bill to ``amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a creditfor medical research related to developing vaccines against wide-spread diseases.'' The ``Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act of 1999''would provide a tax credit equal to 30 percent of the qualified vac-cine research expenses for the taxable year. The vaccine researchcovered would include development of vaccines and microbicides formalaria, tuberculosis, HIV, or any infectious disease (of a singleetiology) which, according to the World Health Organization,causes over 1 million human deaths annually. This bill had eightcosponsors, all Democrats, including five members of the Ways andMeans Committee. On May 26, Senator Roth (R\u00b1DE) introduced S. 1134, the ``Af- fordable Education Act of 1999.'' This original measure was re-ported out of the Finance Committee and placed on the Senate Leg-islative Calendar under General Orders. Section 410, ``Inclusion ofCertain Vaccines Against Streptococcus Pneumoniae to List of Tax-able Vaccines,'' would amend Section 4132(a)(1) of the InternalRevenue Code by adding a new subparagraph follows: ``(L) Anyconjugate vaccine against streptococcus pneumoniae.'' The standardexcise tax would be collected on all sales of such vaccines on theday after the date on which the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention officially recommends routine administration of thisvaccine to children. The vaccine has yet to be licensed by the Foodand Drug Administration. V.
