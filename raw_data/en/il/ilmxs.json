And as luck would have it, many upscale spas are luring guests by offering innovative and cutting-edge services that combine traditional techniques with wellness add-ons like water treatments, beer baths, Himalayan salt and honey. Jump to So say goodbye to stress and say hello to indulgence with these latest newfangled spa and wellness experiences. 1. The Beer Spa\u2014Denver, Colorado Sip it, soak in it\u2014that's the philosophy behind The Beer Spa, a unique, modern-day spa in Denver, Colorado. Alone or with a friend, you can book a Beer Therapy session. Each 90-minute session includes a private wood-paneled room containing a foamy beer- and water-filled tub. Start your newfangled spa session in the personal infrared sauna adjacent to the Beer Therapy suite, which utilizes technology that warms the body and not the air as typical saunas do, thus avoiding intense, uncomfortable levels of heat. Follow that up with a rain shower before you get into the tub. Before or after your soak, order local Colorado beers, wines, hard ciders and non-alcoholic beverages in the adjoining Taproom. Finish your visit with a stop in the Relaxation Room. This touchless zero-gravity massage chair boosts your beer-induced Zen state into the stratosphere. 2. [Carillon Miami Wellness Resort](https://vacayou.com/destinations/property/carillon-miami-wellness-resort)\u2014Miami, Florida This singular beachfront resort boasts the largest spa on the Eastern seaboard of the U.S. Recently reimagined with the dual goal of both pampering guests to the max and inspiring them to wellness, the spa at the Carillon Miami Wellness Resort specializes in a mixture of Western, alternative and aesthetic medicine techniques. One of its most unique and newfangled spa and wellness treatments is a thermal hydrotherapy circuit, designed so you move through a series of hot and cold suites separated by gender. In the Experiential Rain Showers room, for instance, you can bathe under a shower that mimics a cooling tropical rain shower, an Atlantic storm or a Polar mist, while in the Igloo suite you chill out in a cold-air room infused with the scents of menthol, mint and eucalyptus. In other rooms, you can sweat out toxins in a classic Finnish-style sauna, pamper your feet in a foot spa and soak in a bubbly \"Vitality\" tub. The circuit concept relies on the power of water to restore the body and mind by stimulating circulation, soothing pain and boosting relaxation. 3. [JW Marriott Scottsdale Camelback Inn Resort & Spa](https://vacayou.com/destinations/property/jw-marriott-scottsdale-camelback-inn-resort-spa)\u2014Scottsdale, Arizona A quiet and secluded mountain spa in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, the [Spa at Camelback Inn](https://vacayou.com/destinations/property/jw-marriott-scottsdale-camelback-inn-resort-spa) recently opened a Mindful Meditation Room where you can relax while inhaling Himalayan salt emitted by seven lamps positioned around the room, drinking spa water infused with gemstones and listening to calming music or sounds. Inhaling air infused with Himalayan salt has been found to be beneficial for people suffering from allergies and other respiratory conditions. It's also potentially helpful for clearing acne and calming itchy skin. Above all, due to the meditation and deep breathing you do while in the room, you leave feeling tranquil and less stressed. 4. [The Lodge at Woodloch](https://vacayou.com/destinations/property/the-lodge-at-woodloch)\u2014Hawley, Pennsylvania Nestled in the woods of the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania just 95 miles from the New York City metro area, The Lodge at Woodloch is small but mighty, rivaling larger and better-known destination spas. All spa treatments here are laser-focused on helping guests discover natural ways to improve wellness. One innovative, touchless treatment, FLOAT, an experience where you lie in a large, shallow tub filled with water and a high level of Epsom salts, promotes the ability to float in the water without effort. Epsom salts are also time-tested remedies for relieving muscle tension, joint inflammation and arthritis pain. The private FLOAT cabin is sound- and light-proof to block out external stimuli and create a relaxing and meditative experience. You can soak in the tub for 50 minutes in total darkness without sound. Or you may choose from various settings for lighting and music. Whatever settings your choose, you'll find the unique environment supremely relaxing. 5. [Ojai Valley Inn](https://vacayou.com/destinations/property/ojai-valley-inn)\u2014Ojai, California Deep in the Topatopa Mountains lies a beautiful oasis. About 90 minutes north of Los Angeles, the Ojai Valley Inn's luxury spa offers a unique single or group Native American-inspired treatment called the Kuyam Experience. After slipping into spa wraps, guests are ushered into a specially designed sauna. Guests apply desert clay that is instilled with essential oils on their bodies. Then, they sit back and relax as a guided meditation plays in the background. The combination of the intense heat and the clay draws pollutants and toxins out of the skin. Spoiler: the shower afterward is wonderfully refreshing. 6. Four Seasons Resort, Walt Disney World\u2014Orlando, Florida At the tony Four Seasons Resort inside Walt Disney World, a healing warmed honey myofascial massage is on the spa menu to ease tired muscles and detoxify and moisturize the skin. The spa sources its honey locally from The Winter Garden Honey Company. Honey, of course, is well known for its antibacterial, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and anti-aging benefits. Slathering it on the body creates a uniquely luxurious, relaxing experience. The spa service also includes a full-body Himalayan salt-and-tea scrub.
