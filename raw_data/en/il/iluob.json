Some added benefits of acupuncture include improvements in sleep, mood, energy and even blood circulation. \"According to the oriental medicine, acupuncture can actually treat a lot of symptoms and conditions,\" said acupuncturist Dr. Martin Fu. Acupuncture is an alternative medicine practice that dates back nearly 3,000 years. It involves inserting thin filiform needles into the skin at certain pressure points. Stimulation of these acupressure points releases chemicals within the body that promote natural healing and wellness. It has been shown to help relieve low back pain, headaches and migraines, knee osteoarthritis, myofascial pain syndromes and post-operative dental pain. People have also sought out acupuncture for cancer pain and infertility. People who receive acupuncture have experienced improvements in sleep, mood, energy and blood circulation. \"I was in a little car accident, and there just wasn't anything working,\" said Aaron Mickens, one of Dr. Fu's patients. \"I got tired of medication. I was at the point where I tried everything else. Might as well, and I liked it.\" Aaron said he can now make it through the day without taking Tylenol. Acupuncture sessions are 30 to 60 minutes and the treatments have a 95% success rate in relieving pain. Patient Anne Marie Vandenweghe Boudreaux said she has had chronic lower back since she was 17. After being treated by Dr. Fu, Anne Marie said she can now play with her grandkids. She said she had never been pain free until she saw Dr. Fu. Dr. Fu, who practiced as a medical doctor in China, specializes in integrating Western medicine with traditional Chinese medicine practices. With acupuncture, \"you're not just treating the symptoms,\" said Anne Marie. \"You're getting to the cause, the root.\" Dr. Fu said the procedure doesn't hurt, though there is some sensation with needles. Both Anne Marie and Aaron shared that there is no pain during an acupuncture session. [Learn more about the acupuncture services](https://www.ochsner.org/l/acupuncture) offered at Ochsner Health. "}
