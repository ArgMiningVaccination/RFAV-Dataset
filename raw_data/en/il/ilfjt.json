When I meditate regularly I: - Sleep better - Handle stress and anxiety better - Stay calmer - Stay more positive But the key phrase here is \"on and off\". Despite my best intentions, I tend to drift away from my daily practice: - I get busy - I get tired - I get distracted by other projects or commitments. - I think I don't need it anymore. - I just don't get around to it. But, to truly reap the long-term benefits of meditation, it needs to become a part of your everyday life. If you stop doing it, any benefits are quickly lost. With that in mind, a couple of weeks ago I decided to start meditating again. And, this time, I'm determined to commit to meditating every day until it becomes habitual. So far so good! The Balance Meditation App In the past, I've usually mediated \"unguided\". But this time, I'm going the guided route via a smartphone app. Enter the Balance App. Many meditation apps are available, so why did I choose Balance? Around the time I decided to start meditating again, a promotion on Facebook offered Balance free for 12 months. So I thought I'd give it a go. And I must say, I'm pretty impressed. The app: - Is simple and intuitive to use. - Personalizes your meditation experience. - Teaches you HOW to meditate. - Has two skilled and experienced mediation coaches to choose from. - Has plenty of meditation plans and single sessions to choose from.
