We ask that all visitors, including those who have been vaccinated against COVID-19, follow these safety measures to protect everyone's health. Please note that we may adjust our safety guidelines based on changing CDC COVID-19 Community Levels. We encourage visitors to regularly check our website before their visit for the latest guidelines. Washington, D.C. is currently in the CDC's Low Community Level category. During this time, we are implementing the following safety measures: If Sick, Stay Home We are asking all visitors who are sick or feel unwell to please stay home. Visitors are encouraged to wash and sanitize hands frequently during their visit. Hand-sanitizing stations will be available throughout our facilities. Face Coverings As of March 11, masks are not required to visit Smithsonian museums or the National Zoo. While it will not be required, all visitors who feel more comfortable wearing a face mask during their visit are encouraged to do so. Proof of Vaccination Visitors are not required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination to enter the museum. Note: Special events and some after-hours programming may require guests to provide proof of vaccination. Social Distancing The Smithsonian welcomes millions of visitors each year. We encourage visitors to maintain a safe social distance of six feet or more between households and groups when possible, but our museums get crowded, especially during peak visitation times. Visitors who wish to avoid crowds are encouraged to plan their visit during weekdays. Hygiene Please wash and sanitize hands frequently during your visit and practice good hygiene. Hand-sanitizing stations will be available throughout our facilities.
