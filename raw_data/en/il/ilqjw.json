The specialization of Rasayana (Rejuvenation therapy)", "sitename": "Charak Samhita", "date": "2023-04-17", "cleaned_text": "Abstract [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana), the first chapter of the [Chikitsa Sthana](/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) deals with one of the most important specialties of Ashtanga (eight branches) [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda), namely, Rasayana Tantra. [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) means rejuvenation and anti-ageing therapies in [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda). It also includes all measures for geriatric healthcare and immunity enhancement. [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) essentially denotes medicinal nutrition, rejuvenation, longevity, immune-enhancing and geriatric health care. The [rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) are not necessarily drugs. They may be in the form of a [rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) food, or a positive healthy life style with a [rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) effect or a [rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) drug or all the three together. The [rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) remedies promote good qualities of the cells and tissues of the body through improved nutrient effect, boosting the digestion, metabolism and/or augmenting the microcirculation and tissue perfusion. This chapter is divided in four padas (parts) dealing with different aspects of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) therapy. The four padas are Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita), describe eight specialties of [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) which were in vogue and practiced during the vedic period denoting that [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) was already a highly evolved system of medicine with professional specialization. This is why [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) is also called Ashtanga [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) and its eight angas (or arms) are as mentioned below: - Kayachikitsa - Internal medicine - Shalya tantra - Surgery - Shalakya tantra - Ophthalmology, Ear Nose Throat - Kaumarabhritya - Gynecology. obstetrics and Pediatrics - Agada tantra - Toxicology [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana)- Nutrition, Rejuvenation, Immunology Sexology, Aphrodisiac and Reproduction - Bhuta Vidya - Psychiatry and Demonology The present chapter deals with Rasayana tantra of Ashtanga [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) which has assumed a very high consideration in contemporary times in view of the potential role it could play today with increasing incidence of nutritional disorders, lifestyle related health issues and above all the rapid population aging world over, warranting newer strategies for geriatric health care and healthy aging where modern medicine has not much to offer. [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) is the means of obtaining the best qualities of body cells and tissues and is able to defeat aging and disease. All [rasayanas](/index.php?title=Rasayana) are ojovardhaka i.e. promoter of [ojas](/index.php?title=Ojas) or immune strength in the body, imparting vyadhikshamatva i.e. immunity in the body. The mode of action of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) remedies has been deliberated for long. Many scholars consider [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) effect as the prabhava (specific therapeutic effect) of these remedies without really giving rational interpretation. However, Professor RH Singh et al (1972) have suggested that the [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) remedies and measures act at three levels and produce subtle molecular nutrient and immune-enhancing effect with a range of secondary impacts such as improved nutritional status, immune-enhancing, longevity, healthy aging, promotion of health and prevention of disease. The three levels of action are: - At the level of rasa acting as a direct nutrient enriching the nutrient value of plasma. - At the level of agni acting as digestive and metabolic booster. - At the level of srotas acting as srotoprasadana promoting the microcirculation and tissue perfusion. The net effect of all the three levels of action is an improved nutrition. The division of this chapter into four padas (parts) reflects an interesting style of classic writing simulating the style of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali aiming to emphasize the continuum of the deliberations which could be fragmented in the chapterization style. The tendency of pada style can also be visualized in the [Sutra Sthana](/index.php?title=Sutra_Sthana) of [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita) where all the thirty chapters have been systematically clubbed in seven chatushkas i.e. four chapters clubbed in one chatuska containing allied subject matter. Thus, Rasayanadhyaya (this chapter) is of great significance both from literary as well as from the subject matter point of view. The first part , Abhayamalakiya Rasayana Pada, begins with the path breaking statement about bheshaja-abheshaja i.e. good medicine vs bad medicine. The bad medicines are poisons while the good medicines are of two categories: - Ojovardhaka i.e. heath promoting, - Roganut or disease curing. The ojovardhaka remedies again are of two categories namely [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) and [vajikarana](/index.php?title=Vajikarana). The chapter further describes the qualities of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) and the methods of its use. It specially dwells upon the best rasayana describes the role of brahmacharyadi [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) prayoga (use of [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) for performing eternal duties) and Bhishak prashansa (praise of physician). Sanskrit text, bhagavAnAtreyaH||2|| Now the first quarter of the chapter \"Abhayamalakiya Rasayana Pada\". vyadhihara (destroyer of diseases), pathya (beneficial for the bodily channels), sadhana (instrument for therapeutic action), aushadha (that which is prepared of herbes), prayashchitta (expiation), prashamana (pacification), prakritisthapana (that which helps recovery to normalcy), hita (wholesome) - these are the synonyms of bheshaja two categories: - that which promotes strength and immunity in the healthy, - that which alleviates disorders. [4] types (1) badhana (acute), (2) sanubadhana (chronic).[5] is categorized in vrishya (aphrodisiac) and [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) (promotives), while the therapy of the second category is mostly applied for alleviation of disorders. The word prayah specially denotes only particularity because both the groups perform both the above functions namely, promotion of strength including immunity and alleviation of diseases. [5-6] Benefits of treatment, one attains longevity, memory, intelligence, freedom from illness, youthfulness, excellence of lustre, complexion and voice, optimum strength of physique and sense organs, perfection in deliberation, respectability and brilliance. [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) is the means of attaining excellent qualities of rasa etc. dhatus i.e. body cells and tissues.

By this one attains eternality based on filial tradition here and hereafter along with fame, fortune, strength and corpulence. [9-12] Two types of promotive treatment for the healthy is described here. As regard the measures for alleviating diseases, those will be described in the concerned chapters on therapeutics. The sole purpose of therapeutics is to alleviate diseases. The method of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) has been described first and thereafter the aphrodisiac measures have been described. which is contrary to the bheshaja i.e. therapy. This is to be avoided whereas the bheshaja therapeutic measures are to be described further to be adopted. [15] Modes of Administration of Kutipraveshika and Vatatapika Rasayana of the administration of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) therapy, namely: - kutipraveshika (indoor) and - vatatapika (outdoor). Firstly, the procedure of indoor treatment will be described. For this a cottage should be built in an auspicious ground, facing eastward or northward and in a locality inhabited by king, physicians and brahmanas, holy saints, is free from dangers, is auspicious and has easy availability of necessary materials. The cottage should have sufficient space and height, three interior chambers one after the other, a small opening, and thick walls and should be comfortable for the seasons, neatly clean and favorable for the treatment. It should be impermeable for undesirable sound etc. (sense objects), free from women, equipped with necessary accessories and attended by physicians with medicines and brahmanas. Now, in northerly course of the sun, bright fortnight and auspicious date, star, hour and karana, one having clean- shaved, with strong restraint and memory, faith and focused mind, and stress-free state, feeling companionship with all the creatures, having worshipped the gods and brahmanas first and keeping the gods, cow and brahmanas to the right side, one should enter the cottage and be cleansed and thereafter when he feels happy and strong, he should use [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) treatment. Further I shall talk about the cleansing procedures. [16-24] Body purification before [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) treatment | [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) treatment, adequately oleated and fomented, should take formulations with hot water consisting of the powders of haritaki, rock salt, amalaka, jaggery, vacha, vidanga, haridra, long pepper and dry ginger. When he is evacuated properly by this procedure and has resumed the routine dietetic regimen, he should be given barley preparation added with ghee for three, five or seven days (according to measure of evacuation) till the accumulated feces are eliminated. Thus, when he is considered as having cleansed properly, the physician should administer the appropriately chosen [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) (drug) in consideration of his age, constitution and suitability. [25-28] Properties of Haritaki and Amalaki | |||| taste, is hot, wholesome, carminative, light, appetizer, digestive, life promoting, tonic, excellent sustainer of youthfulness, relieves all diseases and affords strength to all sense organs.

(The individuals having indigestion, consumption of rough food, emaciated by indulgence in women, wine and poisonous substances and afflicted with hunger, thirst and heat should avoid prolong use of haritaki.) Amlaki has the same properties and actions as haritaki, only the bio-potency is different (haritaki being hot while amalaki is cold.) Thus, looking to these actions, one should regard the fruits of haritaki as well as amlaki like nectar. [29-37] Qualities of ideal drugs for therapeutic use | excellent among the mountains, which is the best habitat of medicinal plants. Hence one should obtain the fruits grown there in proper time, mature with taste and potency, replenished with the sun, air, shade and water in respective seasons according to need, and which are uneaten, un-purified, uninjured and non toxic. The excellent actions and uses of these fruits will be described now. [38-40] Brahma Rasayanam | |||| pentads) of panchamula are taken in quantities of 400gm (each of the pentad), along with the fresh fruits of haritaki and amlaki in number of one thousand and three thousand respectively. (The five pentads are as follows): shalaparni, brihati, prishiparni, kanthakari, and shyonaka, sharadi pentad of roots. These five pentads are taken together and boiled in ten times quantity of water. When water is reduced to one tenth, it is brought down and filtered. On the other hand, the fruit of haritaki and amlaki are picked out, their seeds are removed and pounded well on stone slabs or in mortar. This is mixed in the above decoction and powder of the following drugs and substances are added to each in quantity of 160 gm and sugar candy 44 kg, tila oil 5 kg 120 gm, ghee 7kg 680 gm are added to it.

Now the preparation is kept in a vessel laced with ghee. This preparation should be used in proper time and dose. The proper dose is that which does not disturb the digestion of the food. When the drug is digested the patient should take shashtika rice with milk. By taking this [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) drug the sages of vaikhanasa and balakhilya groups and other ones attained immeasurable life span; acquired excellent youth shedding off the rotten physique, became free from dullness, exhausation, dyspnoea and diseases; and endowed with full concentration, intellect and strength practised celibacy and spiritual penance with full devotion. An individual desirous of longevity should use this Brahma rasayana by which he attains long life, excellent (youthful) the above qualities are taken in the number of thousands and are steamed on the vapor of milk like the flour paste. When they are well steamed, they are taken out, dried in shade and are powdered after removing the seeds. This is impregnated with the juice of one thousand fresh fruits of amalaki and added with the in the quantity one eight of amlaki powder. This is again impregnated with the juice of nagabala in the quantity of 40 kg. and dried in shade. Then in double quantity ghee or ghee-honey mixed are added to it and is made in the shape of small boluses. This is kept in a clean and strong vessel oiled with ghee and is stored underground within the heap of ashes for a fortnight after having performed the spiritual rites through those who know Atharvaveda. After the fortnight is over, this should be taken out and added with the powder (bhasma) of gold, silver, copper, coral and iron in one eighth quantity.[58] - | |||| | [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) preparation should be taken regularly in the dose of 5 gms gradually increasing with the same by the said method in every morning in consideration of the digestive capacity, after the consumed medication is digested, shashtika rice along with milk added with ghee should be taken. This treatment affords one to achieve the therapeutic results mentioned above. Here are the summarizing verses- On using this brahma rasayana, already used by great sages, the user becomes disease free, long lived and with great strength. He becomes charming to the world, with all mission fulfilled, having splendor like that of the moon and the sun, acquires and retains the knowledge. He is endowed with divine psyche, firmness like that of mountain, valor like that of wind. Even poison is reduced to non poison on coming in contact with his body. [59-61] Chyavanaprasha | |||| | |||| and 500 fruits of amalaki- all these put together should be boiled in water measuring 100 litres 240 ml. when the drugs are extracted completely the decoction should be brought down.

[77] Summary - | nectar for the Gods and ambrosia for the serpents so was the [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) treatment for the great sages in early times. The individuals using [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) treatment in the early ages lived for thousands of years unaffected by senescence, debility, illness and death. One who uses the [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) treatment methodically attains not only longevity but also the auspicious status enjoyed by the godly sages and finally oneness with indestructible the quarter of haritaki, amalaka etc. six accomplished [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) formulations have of haritaki, amalaka etc. in the chapter on [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) in [Chikitsa Sthana](/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) in the treatise composed the quarter of the chapter \"Pranakamiyam Rasayana pada\". Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2] Benefits of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) and effects of domestic food and lifestyle | breath! Listen to me explaining the procedure of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) therapy which is like another nectar, acceptable for the gods, having incomprehensible miraculous effects, prolongs life span, provides health, sustains age, relieves excessive sleep, drowsiness, exertion, exhaustion, lassitude and emaciation, restores tridoshika balance, brings stability, alleviates laxity of muscles, kindles internal fire and imparts excellent luster, complexion and voice.

All morbidity arise due to domestic food in those eating sour, saline, pungent, alkaline, dried vegetables, meat, sesame, sesame paste and preparation of (rice) flour, germinated or fresh, awned or leguminous cereals, incompatible, unsuitable, rough, alkaline and channel blocking substances, decomposed, heavy, putrefied, and staled food items, indulging in irregular diet or eating while the previous food is undigested, day sleep, women and wine, performing irregular and excessive physical exercise causing agitation in the body, affected with fear, anger, grief, greed, confusion and exhaustion.

Thus, the person subdued with malaise, depression, sleep, drowsiness, lassitude, lack of enthusiasm, dyspnea, incapability in physical and mental activities, loss of memory, intellect and luster, becomes resort of illness and thus does not enjoy the normal life span. Hence looking to these defects, one should abstain from all the said unwholesome diet and activities so that he becomes fit for using the [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) treatment- saying this Lord Punarvasu Atreya kg 560 gms of ghee should be cooked with juice of amalaka fruit grown in a good soil and time, possessing unaffected smell, color and taste, which are mature with taste, size and potency, along with one fourth quantity of punarnava. There after the process should be repeated with the juice of vidari, along with the paste of jeevanti, thereafter with the four times the quantity of milk and decoction of bala and atibala along with the paste of shatavari.

[4-6] Amalaki of amalaki along with the same numbers of fruits of pippali should be dipped in to alkaline water prepared from the young palasha tree. After taking them out they should be dried in shade after removing seeds and powdered. This powder mixed with four times honey and ghee and stored underground for six months. Thereafter one should take its dose according to his digestive capacity only in forenoon and not in afternoon. The diet should be according to suitability. By its use, one attains the stable life span of hundred years without enduring senility. The other beneficial effects are as described earlier. [7] Amalaki powder fruits in quantity of 2 kg 560 gms is impregnated with amalaki fruits juice for twenty-one days and nights. This should be mixed with honey and ghee in the quantity of 5 kg 120 gms and added with pippali in one eighth quantity and fine sugar in one fourth quantity. This preparation now should be kept in a container lined with ghee and stored in early rains under a heap of ashes. After the rainy season is over, this should be uncovered and be used along with suitable and wholesome diet. This provides a stable life span of one hundred years devoid of senility. Other impacts affordable from this medication are as described pippali fruits each 2 kg 560 gms, sugar-candy 3 kg 840 gms, ghee, oil and honey together 15 kg 360 gms - all are mixed together and kept in a pot lined with ghee and stored in early rains under a heap of ashes. The therapeutic effects are as mentioned earlier. [9] fruits having aforesaid qualities should be heated in a covered tub made of fresh palasha wood which does not emit vapour with wild cow dung fire. When they are heated properly and when self cooled their seeds should be removed and the remaining material should be crushed. Thereafter pippali powder 2 kg 560 gms, vidanga powder 2 kg 560 gms, sugar 3 kg 840 gms, oil, honey and ghee each 5 kg 120 gms should be added to it. The preparation then should be kept in a clean and strong container laced with ghee and stored for twenty one days and nights. Thereafter it should be used. By its use, life span of one hundred years stands devoid of senility, other impacts are as said roots of nagabala in chala muhurta in the month of Magha or Phalguna while being clean and attentive, having worshipped the deities and engaging the brahmanas to recite auspicious mantras. The plant should have grown in a forest area covered in kusha grass, having soil unctuous, black and sweet or of golden color, devoid of poison, injurious animals and defect of wind, water and fire, and also of cultivation defects, ant-hill, cremation ground, sacred tree, infertile area and habitation and having proper access to air, water and the sun according to season, the roots should be undamaged, in-encroached, neither immature nor too old, possessed with potency, having shed off the old leaves and with new leaves not appeared. The roots should be washed well and the bark should be taken in the dose of 40 gms, finely pounded and mixed with milk in every morning or as powder with milk or along with honey and ghee. After the medicine is digested, one should take diet of shali and shashtika rice along with milk and ghee. If used regularly for a year, it makes the life span for one hundred years without senility. Other outcomes are as described before. [11] khadira, and shimshapa and the ten age sustaining drugs are used by the method as in case of nagabala. If the fresh juice is not available this method should be adopted- 2 kg 560 gms drug should be dipped in equal quantity of water for the day and night, then it should be pressed and filtered and used as swarasa. [12] Various preparations of Bhallataka - undamaged, undiseased, mature in taste, size and potency, looking like ripe jamboo fruits should be collected in the month of jyeshtha and ashadha and be stored within the granary of barley or black gram. After four months, in the month of Agrahayana or Pausha they should be taken out for use by one who has made his body fit through the intake of cold, unctuous and sweet substances. At first ten fruits of bhallataka should be crushed and boiled in ten times of water, when 1/8 extract remains, it should be filtered and taken mixed with milk after smearing the inner part of the mouth with ghee. Gradually increasing the dose by one fruit per day it should be led to thirty which is the maximum dose. In this way the total number of fruits taken comes to one thousand. When the drug is digested, one should take shali and shashtika rice with milk added with ghee. After the treatment is over, the patient should live on milk diet for the period double to that of treatment. By this one attains stable life span of one hundred years without senility. Other impacts of the treatment are as mentioned before. [13] Bhallataka of bhallataka should be crushed and filled in a heating pot which is put on a firm and oiled (with ghee) pitcher already dug underground up to the neck covered with a lid. Then after pushing it with black earth, it should be heated with cow dung fire. The extract which is collected in the lower pitcher should be taken out.

Other outcomes of this treatment are as described taila should be taken in quantity of 2 kg 560 gms and cooked along with milk and paste of madhuka in 1/8 quantity. This should be repeated hundred times. Other details are as above. Other preparations fruits of bhallataka are irritant, inflaming and are like fire but they assume nectar like properties if used as prescribed. Their use in the above ten forms is described which should be prescribed considering the disease, constitution, and suitability. There is no disorder of [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) and obstructive condition which is not ameliorated by bhallataka quickly. Moreover, it promotes intellect and agni. In early days, the old great sages like Chyavana etc, who desiring vital strength, attained immeasurable life span by using these beneficial [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) formulations. After attaining longevity they performed as desired, spiritual penance, celibacy and self- medications and ascended to the heaven. Hence those who desire longevity, vital strength and happiness should use the [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) methodically and carefully. [17-22] up verse - In this quarter relating to desire for vital strength the great sage, compassionate on creatures, described thirty seven successful formulations the second quarter on desire for vital strength in the chapter on [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) in [Chikitsa Sthana](/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) in the treatise composed quarter \"Karaprachitiyam Rasayana Pada\". Thus said Lord Atreya.[1-2] Note: The section deals with rejuvenation effects of plucked fruits of amalaki having qualities described should be taken, their seeds are removed and they are dried and powdered. Later in the month of Magha and Phalguna, this amalaki powder should be impregnated 21 times with the juice of fresh amalaki fruits, dried and powdered again. 2 kg 560 gms of this powder should be taken. Then the drugs belonging to the groups vitalizer, bulk promoting, galactogouge, semen promoting and age sustainers mentioned in the chapter on six hundred evacuatives and finely cut heartwood of sandal, and vidanga - all together should be taken in the quantity of 2 kg 560 gms and boiled in ten times of water. When one tenth of the original volume remains, the decoction should be filtered well and added with the above powder of amalaka. Now this should be heated on cow dung fire or the fire of bamboo chips or reed stalks till the liquid portion is completely evaporated. This uncharred material should be collected and is spread on iron plates for drying. When it is dried well, it should be powdered finely with stone slabs on the deer hide and stored carefully in an iron pot. This powder added with one forth quantity of iron powder (bhasma) and mixed with honey and ghee should be used according to one's digestive capacity. [3] - | was used by Kashyapa, Angiras, Jamadagni, Bharadwaja, Bhrigu and similar other rishis who by consumption of this medication became free from exertion, disease, senility and fear and acquired great strength due to its effect and performed penance as desired. This [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) preparation was developed by Brahma and it provides a life span of one thousand years, alleviates senility and disease and promotes strength of intellect and times, the great sages attained stable life span by using the [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) treatment properly and timely due to penance, celibacy, meditation and serenity because no [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) treatment is successful in individuals who are not attentive, are engaged in divergent activities and live in villages. [7-8] Kevala Amalaka Rasayanam (iti kevalAmalakarasAyanam)| One should live in amidst cows, remain on milk diet mediate on Savitri mantra(Gayatri mantra), observing celibacy and controlling his sense organs for a year. At the end of the year, he should fast for three days and then should enter in to a forest of amalaki trees on full moon day of the month of Pausha, Magha or Phalguna. Then he should climb on one of the amalaki trees having big fruits, should take the fruit situated on a branch by hand and should wait for some time repeating the Brahman mantras till nectar descends in the fruit. During this period nectar positively resides in amalaka fruit which, due to presence of nectar, becomes sweet like sugar and honey, unctuous and soft. The person having regained youthfulness lives the number of thousand of years equal to that of fruits eaten.

Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2] Note: as wanderers, some times, due to consumption of household medicines and food often become obese, and slow in action and unhealthy trait.

This group of great sages consisted gods, addressed them saying - welcome to the intellectual sages, the knower of Brahman, endowed with wealth of knowledge and penance. You are having malaise, luster-lessness, derangement of voice and complexion and ill health along with its associated corollaries caused by domestic living. Domestic living is the root of all the inauspicious effects. You have committed great favor to the people, now it is the time for intellectual sages to look to their own self and to enrich the science of life for the well being of your own self as well as of the people in general. [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) is made available to me by Ashwin who received it from Prajapati, who again received this knowledge from Brahma. Now looking to the short life span of the human beings, that too affected with senility and diseases associated with unhappiness and continuous suffering disturbing their performance of penance, restraint, regular practices, clarity and study you should learn from me, understand propagate the divine knowledge which is the holiest, prolonging life span, alleviating senility and diseases, generating energy, the nectar like, propitious savoir and noble for the welfare of the humanity with friendliness and compassion to them and to create for yourselves the best, holy, noble and immortal intellectual to the wisdom of the king of gods, all the rishis praised the precepter with incantations and applauded his statement with great pleasure. [5] Indrokta [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) to these rishis said - now all this has to be brought into action. Now is the auspicious time for [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) and the celestial drugs grown in Himalaya are also matured such drugs if taken with milk for six months will certainly induce maximum life span, youthful age, disease free, excellence of voice and complexion, corpulence, intellect, memory, quality strength and other desired '' herb having golden latex and lotus like leaves, adityaparni is the herb which is known as the \"sun's beloved\" and has golden latex and flowers like sun disc, nari is the herb known as ashvabala having leaves like those of balwaja, kashthagodha is the iguana shaped herb, sarpa is the serpent shaped herb, soma is the king of herbs having fifteen nodes and increasing and decreasing according to the condition of the moon, padma is the herb having shape, colour and fragrance like that of lotus, aja is the herb known as ajashringi, neela is the climber plant having blue latex and flowers and diffused branches.

In six months such a person becomes gods like in age, complexion, voice, face, strength and luster, great intuition, he attains divine vision and audition, becomes able to move up to thousand yojana and assumes unaffected life span of thousand years. [7] - | |||| | the verses - The therapeutic impact of divine herbs can be sustained only by the individuals like you and not by those with uncontrolled self. By the effect of these herbs you will attain all desired merits while on your normal duties. The herbs growing in sacred lands can be utilized by forest dwellers as well as by householders as duly prescribed with self restraint. [8-10] prashasyate||12|| These divine herbs produce milder effect in case of different habitat, subject and mode of administration through the method of intake in the same for all. The individuals with luxurious living who are unable to search or use these herbs should resort to the other methods of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) which are described below. [11-12] | |||| | |||| |||| herbs of strength promoting, vitality promoting, bulk promoting and age sustaining juice of all these drugs and palasha kshara should be taken in the quantity of 40 gms each, cow milk four times, tila oil and cow ghee each 5.12 kg, should be added to it and cooked together. After it is well cooked, the fatty preparation should be brought down. 2.56 kg each of amalaka powder impregnated hundred times with amalaka juice, fresh honey and powdered sugar 640 gms each of vamshalochana and pippali should be mixed together well. The preparation should be kept in a well cleansed earthen pot smeared with ghee for a fortnight. Then the dose as per the digestive capacity should be used mixing it with powder of gold, copper, coral, iron, quartz, pearl, cats eye, conch and silver in 1/16 quantity. During the period of medication the patient should avoid exertion and sexual intercourse and should take diet of shashtika rice along with ghee extracted from milk after the previous meal is digested. This [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) remedy relieves all diseases, is aphrodisiac, excellent enhancer of life span, provides strength to psyche, memory, physique, digestive fire, intellect and senses, promotes energy, complexion, and voice, alleviates poison and inauspiciousness and renders the words truthful. This intellect promoting and broad spectrum [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) formulation should be used properly by those who desire success, youthfulness, charming personality and social image. [13-26] | of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) therapy is prescribed for those who are fit, disease free, wise, self controlled, leisurely and are wealthy otherwise the outdoor method of vatatapika rasayana therapy is advisable. The former kind of regimen is, no doubt superior but is difficult to operate. If during the treatment some complications arise due to faulty methods, better treatment is planned after discontinuing the initial course of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) therapy. [27-29] Achara Rasayana An individual who is truthful, free from anger, abstaining from wine and women, non violent, relaxed, calm, soft spoken, engaged in meditation and cleanliness, perseverance, observing charity, penance, worshiping gods, cow, brahmanas, gurus, preceptors and elders, loving and compassionate, is vigilant and sleeps in balanced way, consumes routinely ghee extracted from milk, considering the measure of place and time with propriety, un-conceited, well behaved, simple, with his senses well concentrated to spirituality, keeping company of elders, positivist, self restrained and devoted to holy books should be regarded as using the [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) for ever. Those, who, endowed with all the auspicious qualities, consumes [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana), gets all the aforesaid benefits of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) treatment. [30-35] Importance of purification never get the benefits of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) if he has not undergone grossly the process of samsodhana of his physical as well as mental impurities. The treatment meant for providing longevity and for relieving senility and disease succeed in persons having purified mind and body controlled self. Such a treatment should not be prescribed to those who have degenerate self, are disease free, are not twice born and who are reluctant to receive such a treatment. [36-38] Historical examples | |||| | |||| | |||| preparations, [vajikarana](/index.php?title=Vajikarana) recipes and remedies designed for the treatment of diseases - all depend on (vision and skill of) the physician. Hence the wise should honour with all means the treating physician who promotes life, is wise and well versed in the science of life as the king of gods honours Ashwins. Ashwins are the physicians of gods and carriers of sacrifices. The head of sacrifice was cut which was joined by Ashwins. The fallen teeth of Pushan, destroyed eyes of Bhaga and the spastic arm of Vajrina were treated by them and thus he, addicted to soma drink, was again made happy. Chyavana, the descendent of Bhrigu, who was sexually indulged and became diseased, devoid of complexion and voice in old age, was reverted to youthful age. On account of these and other similar achievements, the two excellent physicians became highly adorable to the great selves like Indra, etc. and vessels, praises, recitations, various food preparations, incenses and animals are offered to them by the twins born. In the morning, Indra enjoys the soma drink in the company of Ashwins and he also makes pleasure along with them in the sautramani sacrifice. Indra, Agni and Ashwins were worshipped mostly by the twin born and are praised in the vedic hymns, not so the other gods. Thus the twin physicians Ashwins are worshipped by the gods and their masters. Then how should the physicians not be honored with all means by mortals who are affected by the death, diseases and senility and after the search of happiness? The physicians who is endowed with good conduct, wisdom and rationality, is thrice born, well versed in scriptures and master of life should be honored as preceptor by the people. [39-51] [Vaidya](/index.php?title=Vaidya) and medical completing the course of training, it is the third birth of a physician because the physician does not carry the epithet vaidya from the previous birth. On completion of training, Brahma or Arsha psyche enters in to him certainly according to the knowledge. Hence the physician is known as the thrice born. The wise, desirous of stable life, should not backbite, re approach and harm the master of life. [52-54] | |||| | |||| | |||| siddhArthaH sukhamatyantamashnute||62|| The treated patient, whether having promised or not, if does not offer any thing to the physician he is not freed. The physician too should consider all his patients as his own sons; protect them sincerely from all the ailments, wishing the excellent piety. [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) has been empowered by the great rishis devoted to piety and wishing immortality for welfare and not for earning or enjoyment. One who takes up the treatment only for human welfare and not for earning or self enjoyment supersedes all and those who sell the regimen of therapy for livelihood and devoted to the heap of dust leaving aside the store of gold. One who provides life to those being dragged to the abode of death by severe diseases while cutting the death nets cannot be simulated with any other donor of virtue and wealth because there is no charity better than providing life. The physician who is compassionate on living being as the highest virtue, proceeds in treatment of patients, achieves all objects and enjoy maximum happiness.

( vesr 1.4) - Abheshaja (non-therapeutic agents) can is also of two types : - badhana (acutely acting), - sanubadhana (chronically acting).( verse 1.5) - The objectives of [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda)healthcare management includes chikitsa (measures that alleviate disorders), vyadhihara (destroyer of diseases), pathya (beneficial for the bodily channels), sadhana (instrument for therapeutic action), aushadha (that which is prepared of herbs), prayashchitta (expiation), prashamana (pacification), prakritisthapana (that which helps and sustains recovery to normalcy), and hita (wholesome). (verse 3-4) - The therapeutics for preservation of health include vrishya (aphrodisiac) and [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana)(promotives) that helps promoting strength and immunity. - Objective of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana)therapy is to attain longevity, memory, intelligence, freedom from illness, youthfulness, excellence of luster, complexion and voice, optimum strength of physique and sense organs, perfection in deliberation, respectability and brilliance.

It can even help to arrest genetic disorders. - Indoor residence of person in specific kutipraveshika method endows extraordinary benefits. [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana)may be in the form of specific single drugs or compound preparations of drugs, in the form of specific diet, specific regimen and activities or in the form of a specific good conduct. [Vajikarana](/index.php?title=Vajikarana)improves the quality of [shukra](/index.php?title=Shukra)and thereby improves [oja](/index.php?title=Oja). [Shukra](/index.php?title=Shukra)is not just semen but its effects can be observed allover body and on mind, in the form of genesis of new [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu)(important body constituents) , promoting proper growth and development of existing [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu), by helping to maintain mental health etc. as described in [Vajikarana](/index.php?title=Vajikarana), the second chapter of [Chikitsa Sthana](/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana). - By adopting proper lifestyle and by using appropriate [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana), it is not only possible to regain freedom from diseases, but it is also possible to maintain and even positively promote health. For this, [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana)is very much important in the present era. - Prior body purification is necessary before administration of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana)treatment.

[Indriya Sthana](/index.php?title=Indriya_Sthana) describes the signs and symptoms which indicate certain death of a person. The treatment in such conditions results in failure. Therefore, it must be avoided. The treatment in such conditions should be continued with proper knowledge and also with due consent. After describing limitations of treatment in [Indriya Sthana](/index.php?title=Indriya_Sthana), [Chikitsa Sthana](/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) describes successful treatment of rest of conditions. Different levels of treatment According to [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda), the life is conglomeration of four factors namely shareera (the body made up of five [mahabhutas](/index.php?title=Mahabhuta)), [indriya](/index.php?title=Indriya) (the sensory faculty), [sattva](/index.php?title=Sattva) or [manas](/index.php?title=Manas) (mind) and [atma](/index.php?title=Atma) (the soul). On this basis, disease is also studied at different levels. Therefore, the treatment also is performed at different levels. After initial treatment for relief, [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) describes prayoga (long term treatment for complete cure) and apunarbhava chikitsa (treatment which prevents recurrence of the disease) to maintain and promote health, [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) is given. Various aspects of Chikitsa (treatment) At the beginning of the chapter, various aspects of treatment are explained by using various synonyms. Chikitsita are means for curing disease. Pathya means specific wholesome diet and regimens which will help to cure disease, it also means that which maintains normalcy of [srotas](/index.php?title=Srotas) (channels for transportation and transformation of nutrients in the destined body constituent). Sadhana means various instruments and procedures helpful for successful treatment. [Aushadha](/index.php?title=Aushadha) are medicines obtained from herbs. Prayashchitta means the redressal for diseases originating from previous deeds of the person. Prashamana is that which leads to complete cure. [Prakriti](/index.php?title=Prakriti) (specific constitution of a person) makes him prone for certain diseases. Prakritisthapana helps to protect a person from them by maintaining balance of all three doshas. Hita is that which helps to make dhatus stable and protect them from diseases.

So, whatever the person speaks, he has the capacity to practically act accordingly. Also, he speaks only the truth. So, his words come true. Because of such good qualities, he gets reverence from people. (verse 7,8) Benefits of [Vajikarana](/index.php?title=Vajikarana) (verse 9-12) - Apatyasantanakara- Not only the person using [vajeekarana](/index.php?title=Vajeekarana)will have progeny, but even his further generations also won't have infertility, so effects of [vajeekarana](/index.php?title=Vajeekarana)are capable of making genetic changes - Sadya Sampraharshana- produces erection instantly - Develops sexual potency (like a horse, horse being symbol of best qualities of semen and sexual potency) - Capacity for sexual act uninterruptedly - Enhances beauty, personality and capacity to attract opposite sex - Nourishes the body - Even after indulging in sexual activities, [shukra](/index.php?title=Shukra)is still properly produced - Not only quantitative increase, qualities of [shukra](/index.php?title=Shukra)improve, fertility is produced - Like banyan tree, gets surrounded by good progeny - Earns respect and honour in society - Gets all the joy from the children in this world - Gets as if immortality, because next generations carry on his good works - Success, wealth and prosperity, strength, robustness Two modes of administration of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) (verse 1.1.16) [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) can be used by two methods: - Kuti praveshika- The person stays in a kuti (specially built house) for a specific period and uses [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana). - Vatatapika- The person continues with his routine activities, while using [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana). Construction of a Kuti (hut) (verse 1.1.16-20) The place Kuti is built at a place near city or town, i.e. in civilised place, near the place of king or government officials for legal issues, permissions, near place of vaidyas (physicians) for advice of other senior vaidyas whenever required, where advice of experts in other fields of knowledge is available, place of well cultured gentlemen , decent place with social security, with availability of necessary instruments, equipment and amenities, located in east or north, for proper light and ventilation, selected as per the bhoomi pareeksha ( selection of good land) as described in [Madanakalpa Adhyaya](/index.php?title=Madanakalpa_Adhyaya). Structure and design Structure and design is decided by experts in that field, but the specific requirements are mentioned in this chapter, such as: with proper height ,width, with three concentric courts, having small windows on height, having thick walls, comfortable for all seasons, spacious, with proper lighting, pleasant for stay, protected from sound pollution ,other forms of pollution and unwanted sounds, smells etc., where celibacy can be maintained, equipped with necessary instruments, equipment and amenities, having on duty vaidyas, consulting vaidyas and consultants in other fields. The pictures can give an idea regarding this. Entering the Kuti The specific way of entering the kuti is described in the text. Not only by using specific purificatory methods, the body pf the person is prepared for the effects of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana), but he is also prepared mentally. The person gets extraordinary qualities due to [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana). But he may use them only for his personal benefits and may harm others in the society. For this he is convinced to use his qualities for the benefit of the whole society. He also resolves to properly complete the procedure, since ceasing of the procedure midway may be harmful for health. Quality control in selection of medicines (verse 1.1. 38-40) - Bhoomi pariksha (criteria to select good land for collection of medicines) as described in [Madanakalpa Adhyaya](/index.php?title=Madanakalpa_Adhyaya)verse 9, should be followed. amalaki ( Emblica officinalis) used as [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana)in this chapter are preferably collected from the range of mountain Himalaya. - The medicines developed at proper season as per their natural life cycle are collected, - The medicines which are fully grown, developed are collected. - Medicines with optimum qualities like rasa, veerya etc. are selected. - Medicines are collected from plants, which are properly exposed (not under or over exposed) to natural factors like sunlight, wind, rains etc. are selected. - Not pecked at by birds etc., unspoiled and unmarked with cuts or diseases. - Free from toxicity Abhayamalakeeya Pada This part of the chapter deals with from haritaki (Terminalia chebula) and amalaki (Emblica officinalis) as the name suggests. These are the first two [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) mentioned in this chapter denoting their anulomana of vata i.e. helps to maintain normal movements of vata. It moves out the accumulated dosha and mala, thus helps to maintain patency and proper functions of srotas. It also activates dhatvagni. Although haritaki is not directly providing nourishment to dhatus (body tissues), but due to to proper function of srotas, removes obstructions and helps the nutrients to reach to the dhatus. Also by activating dhatvagni, it helps in proper conversion of nutrients into dhatus. Because of these actions, haritaki is very important [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana). Amalaki Rasayana (verse 1.1.36-37) Most of the qualities and actions of amalaki are similar to haritaki. But [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) in the first Pada The first part of this chapter mentions six Brahma Rasayana, Chyavanaprasha, both haritaki and amalaki). The contents and procedures for preparation of each of these [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) is mentioned in the text. Commentator Gangadhara has given further details about steps in actual preparation. Apart from the commonly described benefits of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana), at the beginning of the chapter, each [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) has got certain specific benefits. A vaidya selects a [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) for a person considering mode of action of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana), based on qualities and actions, and based on specific benefits of that [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana). Brahma Rasayana This [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) is prepared with thousand haritaki fruits and three thousand amalaki fruits, with 25 other medicines used for kvatha (decoction) and 14 other medicines used for kalka (in the form of paste). Specially this [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana), apart from general benefits of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana), is described as useful for removing tandra (drowsiness), klama ( lassitude), shvasa (dyspnea). It also boosts intelligence and memory. These benefits of this [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana), are because it ignites agni, performs digestion of ama, therefore improves the quality of rasa. Also since it eliminates accumulated [malas](/index.php?title=Mala) from the body and performs pachana of ama, srotas become clear and patent. Thus, tamoguna is reduced and [sattva](/index.php?title=Sattva) [guna](/index.php?title=Guna) increases. While the second brahma [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) is prepared with a thousand amalaki fruits triturated in the juice of a thousand amalaki fruits. With addition of 23 other medicines and bhasma (specific form which can be absorbed and assimilated in the body) of gold, silver, copper, praval and iron. Because of such ingredients, it specifically provides great physical strength, and also power of indriya (sensory faculty) is enhanced. Also the body develops the capacity to counteract the effects of poisons. Chyavanaprasha Rasayana Chyanaprasha is prepared from the pulp of 500 amalaki fruits, with addition of 36 other medicines used for kvatha (decoction) and fine powders of four other medicines added at the end. It is specifically useful for maintaining youth and vigor. It helps to build body tissues in children, old and emaciated persons. Ignites agni and Improves beauty. Also useful in disorders of voice, diseases of chest, heart diseases, and disorders of urinary tract and genital organs. Diseases from changing lifestyle and importance of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) The second quarter starts with description of changing lifestyle and the resultant disorders. It is described that with their healthy lifestyle the ancient sages were free from diseases. But diseases originated due to urbanization and thereby changing lifestyle. This description is even more important in present era, because many of the dietary articles and the activities mentioned here have become common now like more consumption of salt, sour and pungent items, sprouted grains, dried vegetables and meat, sleeping in day time, irregular timings of meals, irregular improper and excessive exercises and physical activities, using unhealthy combinations like milk with salty and sour items, or milk with fruits, continuously affected by anger, grief, greed fear like mental states etc. This results in diseases with laxity in muscles, muscular dystrophies etc., diseases of bone marrow, joint disorders, impotency and infertility and so on. It is described that by following proper healthy lifestyle and by the use of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana), one can get freedom from such diseases. Therefore, thorough study and application of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) is needed in the present era. [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) in the second pada In the second quarter 37 [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) have been described. The name pranakameeya suggests desire or quest for living i.e. desire for longevity. For this purpose, [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) prepared mainly from amalaki are described. Nagabala Rasayana As the name suggests provides strength and stability to body tissues. The same method of using nagabala as [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) described here is applicable for using 10 other [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) enlisted from bala to punarnava. Bhallataka Rasayana This is extremely ushna-teekshna due to which it is used in [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) dominant conditions, or where [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) obstructs movements of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata). Also, to remove obstruction in srotas and facilitate conduction and conversions going on in srotas. Bhallataka is also excellent [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) for igniting functions of agni. It also increases intelligence, as it removes tamoguna (which is responsible for inhibition). 10 specific formulations of bhallataka are described, which can be used as [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) . Although bhallataka is very potent, it can result in unwanted effects, when improperly used. Therefore, the precautions to be taken while using it, are mentioned in the text. [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) in the third pada The third quarter is named as Karaprachitiya because the first [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) mentioned here is prepared from amalaki fruits plucked by hands. In all 16 [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) are described. Apart from rasayanas prepared from amalaki, there is lauhadi rasayana. Special benefits of this [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) include increased physical strength, enhanced capacity of indriya (senses), body becomes capable of sustaining injuries and wounds heal quickly. This is because loha (iron) provides bala (strength) to rakta. Also loha being dominated by [Prithvi Mahabhuta](/index.php?title=Prithvi_Mahabhuta&action=edit&redlink=1), provides strength to parthiva osseous [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta) normal [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha). It controls rajoguna and increases [sattva](/index.php?title=Sattva), resulting in boosting intelligence. Yashtimadhu also nourishes [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu) and ultimately increases [shukra](/index.php?title=Shukra) and [ojas](/index.php?title=Ojas). As explained by commentator Chakrapani, effects on [indriya](/index.php?title=Indriya), [mana](/index.php?title=Mana) and [buddhi](/index.php?title=Buddhi) are mediated Mandukaparni is and it specially pacifies [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta). It controls rajoguna ushna, three [doshas](/index.php?title=Dosha), controls tama and increases [sattva](/index.php?title=Sattva). Keeping in mind such peculiarities, specific [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) is chosen for a specific person. Many researches have been conducted on these medhya rasayana. [[1]](#cite_note-1) and bibhitaka is one of the most important medicines in [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda). Its an important [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) also. Triphala mainly pacifies [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) and [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta). By removing obstruction to its movements, it helps to maintain proper actions of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata). It improves the functions of dhatvagni to digests ama and eliminates abnormally accumulated [mala](/index.php?title=Mala) and [doshas](/index.php?title=Dosha), therefore makes the srotas clear and patent to enable nutrients to reach [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu). It also controls [meda](/index.php?title=Meda) which helps to maintain balance in all the [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu), because abnormally increased [meda](/index.php?title=Meda) blocks nutrition of other [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu) Shilajatu Being katu-tikta and ushna, shilajatu pacifies [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha). It also helps in digestion of ama. Therefore, removes obstruction and helps normal movements of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata). It controls formation of [meda](/index.php?title=Meda). Abnormal [meda](/index.php?title=Meda) blocks nutrition of other [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu). Shilajatu, by controlling formation of meda, regulates genesis of all the [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu). In the conditions originating from ati santarpana, i.e. when [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu) are provided excessive nourishment, but proper transformation of these nutrients in the [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu) is not done, shilajatu is very effective. But in the conditions due to ati apatarpana i.e. when proper nourishment is not available for the genesis of [dhatus](/index.php?title=Dhatu), shiljatu is not the [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) of choice. The fourth quarter describes mainly two types of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) told by Indra and about soma as [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana). Achara Rasayana (rasayana effects of good conduct) Another important aspect of the fourth quarter is achara rasayana. Good conduct like speaking truth, non violence, compassion etc. is considered very much important to obtain benefits of any [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) described here. Vaidya For experts of [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda), the term vaidya is used, which means one having proper knowledge. A vaidya may be of any cast, race etc. by birth, it doesn't matter. Because it is said, that when he completes his education in [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda), he is as if reborn. He is like guardian of life. Therefore, deserves respect from the society. A vaidya has to care for the patients as if they were his children or family members. A vaidya, by practicing with compassion towards the ailing, earns much more than wealth. Therefore, a vaidya should not consider treatment as a business. This advice of [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita) holds true even today. Those who serve patients with this attitude, get such benefits from the society, which no other profession can get, and unmatched as compared to wealth. Contemporary researches Clinical trials on Rasayana have shown that Pippali (Piper longum) are effective in the treatment of allergic disorders such as eczema, urticaria, allergic rhinitis, and bronchial asthma; autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or cancer or pulmonary tuberculosis. It provide better and faster relief, prevent recurrences and also improve quality of life.Furthermore, Medhya Rasayana drugs are found effective in stress-induced conditions such as anxiety and insomnia or neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and senile dementia. The findings of all these studies indicate that Rasayana has a definite role to play in the maintenance and preservation of health, and appropriate use of Rasayana can help to bring down the prevalence of many diseases, ultimately reducing health-care burden. [[2]](#cite_note-2) Potential areas for future research - Rasayana Tantra is one of the Eight important branches of Astanga [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda). It deals with an important category of medicinal and non-medicinal rejuvenative remedies advocated for promotive and preventive health care including retarding aging and promoting longevity. These remedies are claimed to improve the quality of cells and tissues (even the genes) of the body through following mechanisms: - Direct nutrient effects, acting at the level of [rasa](/index.php?title=Rasa) - Digestive and metabolic booster effect, acting at the level of agni - Promoting micro circulation and tissue perfusion, at the level of srotas - Direct nutrient effects, acting at the level of There is a need to develop an appropriate research methodology of assessment of the effect of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana) remedies on the above mentioned three levels. - Clinical assessment of the effect of [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana)drugs and formulations described by Charak using appropriate biological and therapeutic parameters on clinical trial mode with emphasis on the nutritional effect, anti-aging effect and adaptogenic and immunomodulating effect of this important category of Ayurvedic drugs. - Architectural study of the concept of trigarbha rasayana, kuti described in [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita)and to examine the science behind this model for future use if found logical and scientific and for further development. - Attempt to develop a new discipline of [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda)geriatrics and immunology through the [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana)leads available in the [Rasayana](/index.php?title=Rasayana)chapter of [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita).
