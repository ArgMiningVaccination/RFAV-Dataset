Dr. Goetz 5 Dear Dietetic Interns, Congratulations on being accepted into the KU Medical Center Dietetic Internship! Each of you have worked extremely hard and persevered through adversity in this last year. You should be proud of your accomplishments! You all possess characteristics that will lead you to success through this internship year and as future Registered Dietitians. As I reflect on my internship experience, I wanted to share some thoughts that you can carry with you throughout this journey. First, treat every rotation, experience, project, and class assignment as an opportunity to learn. No matter what you are doing, you can be learning! It is completely normal to enjoy some areas more than others \u2014that is how you will learn where your passions flourish. However, even the areas that you enjoy less will teach you valuable lessons about the profession. Keep an open attitude towards all your rotations and classes. Remember that everything you do this year has a purpose! Whether you are practicing skills, gaining knowledge, or building networks, every experience offers insight toward your future. In a practical sense, treat every rotation or professional meeting like a job interview. You never know who could be reviewing applications when you start applying as an RD! Second, embrace every situation by stepping beyond your comfort zone. This is one of the best ways to learn! This year is all about learning. You are not expected to be experts already. Ask questions (there's no such thing as a dumb one!) , take advantage of unique opportunities, and be open to new ideas and tasks. Your preceptors and teachers want to help you learn and succeed. Remember, they were all in your position at one point! Seek their feedback when you get things right and, maybe more importantly, seek their feedback when you get things wrong\u2014 these are the moments when you may learn the most. Have confidence in yourself! You earned this opportunity, so be confident in yourself and your abilities! You will be amazed by how much you g row this year. Embrace this season of change and challenge yourself to continue expanding your knowledge base. Third, time-management and flexibility are incredibly important skills for this internship year. Now more than ever, know that your approach to a situation can be the key to a positive experience. Try to remember that even situations that do not go as planned still hold great opportunity for amazing outcomes. This year is about balance, learning, and most of all, enjoyment! Manage your time effect ively so that you can enjoy every aspect of this year. Your wellness is SO important! Be sure to make time for the things that matter to you, such as family, friends, hobbies, exercise, and whatever makes you happiest. Don't feel guilty for taking some time to do what you love. Try not to put too much on your plate (work wise, not food wise J), and have reasonable expectations for yourself - sometimes you will need a break, and not every hour has to be productive. Set the expectation to take a bit of time completely away from school or rotation every week to do something you enjoy. If you don't prioritize a bit of rest, things can get out of balance- and we want you to succeed mentally and emotionally too! Remember - you can't pour from an empty cup. Fourth, get to know your classmates. Share your experiences, challenges, and triumphs. They will understand your struggles and be there to celebrate your accomplishments. You are all in this together. Be eager to listen to advice and stories they are willing to share. Your classmates are there to believe in you and encourage you through every difficult task you may endure- they will often be right there enduring it with you! 6 Finally , believe in yourself! You have already worked so hard to get here. This year may have some challenging moments, but you have the skills and resources to succeed. The faculty and I are here to help you in any way we can. If you ever feel like you are struggling during ANY part of the year- academics, internship, work -life-balance, emotions - PLEASE reach out to me! I am here to talk through it all with you. This internship is an important component of your degree, your future career, and of your life. We are in this profession to help others and guide them towards living a more healthful life, so I encourage you to remember your passion and your \"why\"! Enjoy this year! It is going to be full of learning moments, experiences, and memories. I cannot wait to start this journey with you all.

If the applicant isn't accepted or decides she/he does not want to accept the offer to be admitted to the KUMC Dietetic Internship program, she/he may partici pate in the centralized match process. Health Requirements and Screening Prior to Start of Program Criminal Background Checks and Drug Screening Dietetic interns are required to obtain a criminal background check and drug screening. These screenings are completed through Validity Screening Solutions and are the financial responsibility of the intern ($39 for background check, $52 for the drug screening). Instructions for compl eting these screenings will be provided by the Program Director after admittance to the program. Acceptance into the School of Health Professions academic programs is conditional, pending the results of a criminal/healthcare- related background check. Your acceptance into the School's program will not be final until we have received your background check information from Validity Screening Solutions, so do this as quickly as possible. Please be aware that while most health care facilities with whom we have affiliation contracts will accept our verification that a background check has been performed on a student, some may require a more current or different report. However, the School of Health Professions requires only one background check prior to final acceptance and subsequent enrollment. The School of Health Professions may also run an Employment Disqualified List (EDL) check for enrolled students if required by an affiliation site. This check reviews Missouri records for any 19 individuals who have been disqualified from working in a health care facility in that state. You need not provide additional information for this check, nor is there any cost to you. However, should this be required by your affiliation site, we will need your signed permission to release your Social Security Number to the MO Department of Health and Senior Services, the agency that provides the EDL check. Should a background check/EDL check come back with an unacceptable conviction, the applicant/student will be notified by the School of Health Professions. If there is a conviction that does not disqualify the applicant/student from a program and subsequent affiliation, the student should be aware that this may not be the case for the professional certifying agency. It is the student's responsibility to confirm whether or not the conviction will prevent them from taking a certification/qualifying examination upon completion of the program. Health and Immunization Information Policy Health requirements for dietetic interns can be found at Services & Scheduling (kumc.edu) (be sure to select the form specifically for Dietetics & Nutrition Interns). Students will need to meet KUMC Health requirements for enrollment and for continuation in the program.

If you have not begun the three -shot series prior to arriving on campus, you will be required to receive the first Hepatitis B immunization. The Hepatitis B vaccine is available through Student Health for a fee paid at the time of service. Please c all Student Health Services for information about immunization costs and appointments. Failure to provide the required health and immunization data by the required deadlines prevents you from starting the program. You need to provide proof of the immunizations to preceptors when beginning supervised practice experiences. Keep a copy of health and immunization data for this purpose. Forms for a religious or medical exemption can be found in our Student Resources . Communicable Disease Policy Students with a communicable disease or infectious illness that could impact the health and safety of others MUST contact Student Health Services on their respective campus. Prior to participation in school activities, all students are required to have their communicable disease risk status assessed. Students with a known communicable disease or infectious illness may be asked to consent to release of appropriate medical records, be evaluated in person, obtain diagnostic testing and/or be referred to a specialist depending on the nature of the communicable disease. The student is 20 responsible for any costs (some of which may be covered by medical insurance) involved in evaluation of his/her condition. All enrolled students on a KU Medical Center campus (Kansas City, Wichita or Salina) with a communicable disease or infectious illness that may affect the health and safety of others MUST advise Student Health Services on their respective campus. Examples of communicable disease or infectious illness under this policy include, but are not limited to, viral hepatitis, febrile illness, antibiotic resistant infections, tuberculosis and mumps. The staff at Student Health has an obligation to reduce the risk of infection of patients, other students, faculty and staff on the KU Medical Center campuses. Therefore, a decision about the risk the student poses to the health and safety of others on university campuses or while performing student duties at an affiliated institution will be the responsibility of the Student Health staff. Individualized plans for accommodation with respect to students with any infection risk will be based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, specifically, the updated recommendations to promote patient safety while providing risk management and practice guidance to students and health care providers. If there are restrictions or accommodations that are requested or suggested in individual cases, the student's school of study and/or Academic Accommodation Services will be contacted concerning Student Health's recommendations without giving specific medical information unless the student signs a consent for release of such medical information. The student's school of study will make the final determination of any accommodation(s) that can be reasonably made to allow a student to participate to the fullest potential and complete their educational requir ements without compromising the health, safety , and welfare of others on the KU Medical Center campuses and affiliates. A student with a communicable disease or infectious illness pursuing a course of study that requires clinical rotations should be aware that the University of Kansas cannot guarantee placement for clinical rotations at external affiliate sites. Students participating in clinical rotations are subject to the requirements and approval of the clinical rotation site. KUMC COVID 19 Vaccine Policy KUMC encourages students to receive the COVID -19 vaccine. KUMC programs will assign students to clinical or other programmatic activities without regard to their COVID -19 vaccine immunization status unless it is a requirement of the third -party site. Students may not decline an assignment due to being unvaccinated unless specific accommodations have been requested and granted pursuant to the Students with Disabilities Policies and Procedures Manual Viewing Students with Disabilities Policy (policystat.com) or the Religious Accommodations Process Viewing Students with Disabilities Policy (policystat.com) . If a third- party site requires students be vaccinated to participate in a clinical or programmatic activity, unvaccinat ed students would be precluded from participating. KU Medical Center policies - general policies and expectations for the campus School of Health Professions - add i tional information specific to the SHP . 21 Flu Shot Requirement All currently enrolled KU Medical Center students must receive seasonal influenza vaccine. Students may receive the flu vaccine at Student Health Services or provide documentation of the vaccine to Student Health. If a student is submitting documentation, the documentation must include the name of the vaccine, lot number, expiration date, date received and provider name with credentials. This includes vaccines that are obtained via The University of Kansas Health System's Occupational Health Clinic or other hospital clinics. Reasonable attempts will be made to provide free vaccines to students during the fall semester. Students who are not able to obtain the vaccination at Student Health due to distance considerations, scheduling conflicts, or for any other reason are responsible for obtaining the vaccine elsewhere at their own expense and providing the proper documentation. A vaccination deadline date will be assigned each year by which the seasonal influenza vaccine must be received. Any student who has not received vaccination by this date will receive a Student Health hold which will prevent enrollment. Students who do not have the hold removed by the first day of class may incur additional re -activation fees. Students who fail to comply with immunization requirements may not be able to enroll for the upcoming term and they will not be able to participate in their clinical rotations. Forms for a religious or medical exemption can be found in our Student Resources . Health and Liability Insurance Dietetic interns are required to have current health insurance in order to participate in the program. You may choose any health insurance plan. If you do not have health insurance, you may be eligible to purchase health insurance through the State of Kansas health insurance plan (For information, please visit: Student Health Insurance (kumc.edu) . You are required to provide a copy of your health insurance card and \"Health Insurance Affidavit\" to Student Health Services. You provide proof of health insurance coverage to preceptors when beginning supervised practice experiences. Dietetic interns have general liability insurance. The School of Health Professions (SHP) has a policy with Columbia Casualty Company for all students in the school. SHP assumes the cost of the liability insurance for students. Professional liability coverage is up to $1,000,000 per occurrence and annual aggregate of $3,000,000. The current policy is effective July 1, 2023, through July 1, 2024, and is renewed annually. Other Information Needed Prior to Starting the Program HIPAA, Student Safety and Other Compliance Training Dietetic interns must complete required KUMC orientation and training as well as specific training on The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rules. The HIPAA training covers rules about confidential handling of patient information. The university orientation provides information to help you familiarize yourself with the tools you need to succeed and to help you transition into the learning environment at KUMC. You will receive an email from the Office of Student Life regarding the required university orientation prior to arrival. This is an online module. Once the entire module has been successfully completed, 22 your orientation hold will be removed. This will typically take 24 hours (Monday -Friday).

A four-year medical course began in 1905 when the Kansas City Medical College and the College of Physicians and Surgeons merged under the direction of the University of Kansas. The late Dr. Simeon Bell and his wife, Eleanor Bell, made the union possible by a gift of land to the University of Kansas. In 1920, the School of Medicine acquired land at the present location at 39th Street and Rainbow Boulevard. The new building, named Bell Memorial Hospital, opened in 1924. Since that time, this location has been the site of the University of Kansas Medical Center that includes the hospital and the many health professions programs offered by the University of Kansas. In 1936, the name was changed to the University of Kansas Hospital, and again in 1947 the name was changed to the Kansas University Medical Center. The KUMC School of Health Professions was created in 1976 (formerly the School of Allied Health). The Department of Dietetics and Nutrition is one of the programs offered by the School of Health Professions. The University of Kansas Medical Center has participated in dietetic education since 1943 when the Dietetic Internship Program (DI) was established. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association) and the Graduate School of the University of Kansas approved the plan for a combined master's program with the DI in 1958. The combined program admitted the first students in 1960. In 2001, the DI changed to a graduate certificate program with the option to complete a Master of Science (MS) degree in Dietetics and Nutrition. It is expected that by the end of July 20 23, a total of 566 individuals will have completed the DI. In 2016, the DI received full accreditation by the Accreditation Council on Education for Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND, formerly Commission on Accreditation for Dietetic Education) for another 7- year term ending December 31, 2023. This was extended to December 31, 2024 due to the COVID pandemic and another extension was granted in summer 2022 and is valid until December 31, 2025. D ue to the requirement to hold a graduate level degr ee to be an entry -level practitioner, in Fall 2023, the program again became a Combined MS/Dietetic Internship. A DI Graduate Certificate Program continues for those who enter the program with a graduate degree. The department offers four other graduate programs in addition to the Combined MS/DI including the Great Plains IDEA (online Master of Science degree), a web- based 12-hour graduate certificate program with an emphasis in Dietetics and Integrative Medicine, a doctoral degree program in Medical Nutritional Sciences , and a Doctorate in Clinical Nutrition. Program Mission and Goals/Objectives The mission of the School of Health Professions, University of Kansas Medical Center is: To serve the citizens of Kansas, the region, and the nation and to develop tomorrow's leaders through exemplary education, research and service. 24 The mission of the Dietetic Internship Program is: To produce competent entry -level registered dietitian nutritionists with enhanced skills in nutrition therapy for health and education positions that will provide services for the citizens of Kansas, the region, the nation, and the world. The Dietetic Internship program goals and objectives are: Program Goal #1: The program prepares graduates to be competent entry -level registered dietitian nutritionists . At least 80% of program interns complete program requirements within 30 months. (Dual MS/DI Program) At least 80% of program interns complete program requirements within 12 months . (DI Graduate Cert ificate Program) 80% of program graduates take the CDR credentialing exam for dietitian nutritionists within 12 months of program completion. The program's one- year pass rate (graduates who pass the registration exam within one year of first attempt) on the CDR credentialing exam for dietitian nutritionists is at least 80%. Over a 5 -year period, 80% of employers will indicate that graduates dem onstrated adequate knowledge and practice ability for entry -level practice as a dietitian (rating of at least 4 on a 5- point scale). Three years post program completion, 80% of respondents to graduate surveys will rate their preparation for entry level practice as adequately prepared or better over a 5 - year period. Program Goal #2: The program prepares graduates for practice in the field of dietetics and nutrition and participation in professional organizations. Of graduates who seek employment, 75% are employed in nutrition and dietetics or related fields within 12 months of graduation. Over a 5- year period, 75% of respondents to graduate surveys will be members of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics or related professional organizations. The program outcome data are available upon request to the public and interns . Accreditation Status The University of Kansas Medical Center Dietetic Internship Certificate Program has been gran ted full accreditation by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). This is the accrediting body recognized by the Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation and the United States Department of Education. The address and phone number of ACEND is 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, IL 60606- 6995, 800-877-1600. The program self-study and site visit completed in 2015 resulted in full accreditation status until December 31, 202 3. In 2020, ACEND granted a one- year extension due to the COVID -19 pandemic (expires December 31, 2024). Another extension was granted in summer 2022 and is valid until December 31, 2025. 25 ACEND Learning Outcomes/Competency Requirements The \"Core Competencies for Registered Dietitians\" developed by ACEND depict the supervised practice skills which dietetic interns completing the DI are able to do at the beginning of their careers. Dietetic interns are required to participate in the learning activities that fulfill core competencies completed during graduate courses and supervised practice experiences. Core competencies are completed by the end of the five-semester program (MS/DI students) or two semester program (DI Certificate Program) .

The dual program allows graduates to meet the supervised practice experience and graduate degree requirements set forth by ACEND within 5 semesters . The 38 hours of graduate coursework and a minimum of 1, 000 hours of supervised practice experiences included in the program contain the required content to meet the required core competencies for entry -level dietitians. The interplay of experiential and didactic learning provides an opportunity for the development of expertise in dietetics and nutrition. Students complete 38 hours of graduate courses as a requirement of the program: 24 credits of core graduate coursework, 3 credit hours of research, 3 credit hours of electives, and 8 credit hours of practicum (supervised practice experience). These courses are graded using the traditional letter grading scale of A, B, C, D, F. Practicum grades (8 credits) are awarded a satisfactory/unsatisfactory grade. Classroom work takes place on Mondays during the first fall and spring semesters when students are also engaging in supervised practice experience. There are no required on- campus courses during the summer semester (semester 3). During the last 2 semesters (fall/spring) classwork occurs on Mondays and Wednesdays . Classes are held at the University of Kansas Medical Center campus located at 3901 Rainbow Boulevard in Kansas City, KS. The program requires at least 1, 040 hours of supervised practice experiences in the areas of clinical nutrition, food and nutrition management, community nutrition, and practice area of interest. DN 827 Practicum consists of 3 credit hours fall (1st semester), 3 credit hours in the spring semester (2nd semester) , 1 credit hour in the summer semester (3rd semester) , and a final credit the last semester of the program (5th semester) . For the 8 hours of DN 827 Practicum, you complete supervised practice experiences and projects under the direction of preceptors as well as other assignments and activities requested by the program director and faculty. The program director assigns dietetic interns to preceptors based on dietetic interns' preferences as well as the availability of preceptors. Dietetic interns receive a list of available preceptors for supervised practice experiences and have the opportunity to list their top choices. If you fail to submit your choices, the program director makes assignments. The ability of supervised practice facilities to accept dietetic interns varies from semester to semester and year to year. At the beginning of each supervised practice experience (semesters 1-3), dietetic interns receive guidelines and semester calendars. Experiences take place at a variety of locations and require travel within and outside of the Kansas City area. You are responsible for providing your own transportation to supervised practice experience sites and required meetings. Supervised practice experiences generally take place Tuesday through Friday, usually 32 hours per week, during the first three semesters . Classroom work takes place on Mondays during these first 3 semesters. 30 Academic Plan for Dual MS/Dietetic Internship Program The following is an outline of the academic plan for the Dual MS/D ietetic Internship Track Program (38 credit hours): Fall Semester 4 Spring Semester 5 CLASSES Biostatistics (3) DN 8340 - Research Methods (3) DN 895 - Macro nutrients (3) DN 819 - Scientific Writing (if non- thesis) (1) DN 827 - Practicum ( 1) DN 896 - Adv Micro nutrients (3) ELECTIVE * Optional Elective Optional Elective RESEARCH ** DN 854 - Non-thesis (1 -3 cr, optional ) OR DN 899 -Thesis (1 cr) DN 854 (1-3 cr, optional ) OR DN 899 -Thesis (1 cr) Fall Semester 1 Spring Semester 2 Summer Semester 3 CLASSES DN 822 - Management 1 (1) DN 825 - MNT 1 (3) DN 870 - Health & Behavioral Counseling (1) DN 827 - Practicum (3) DN 826 DN 2 DN 818 - Seminar in D&N II (1) DN 842 - Public Health (1) DN 827 - Practicum (3) DN 827 - Practicum (1) DN 819 (if thesis ; 1) ELECTIVE * Optional Elective RESEARCH ** DN 854 -Non-thesis (1-3 cr, optional ) OR DN 899 -Thesis (1 cr) HOURS 8 credit hours 9 credit hours 1 hour + research/elective 31 HOURS 9-10 hours + research/elective 4 hours + research/elective TOTAL HOURS 24 hours core graduate coursework 3 credit hours elective coursework 3 credit hours research coursework 8 credit hours practicum (supervised practice experience) Total: 38 credit hours *Students will take 1 elective course and may choose which semester the course is taken. **Students will take 3 credit hours of research (DN 854 or DN 899).

MS Thesis versus Non-thesis Option Students should be in conversation with their P rogram Director and DN faculty to determine whether they will complete a thesis or non- thesis. The timing of this decision varies by student, depending upon their coursework timetable. Differences in the research experience for the thesis and non- thesis options are outlined below. When the student enrolls for DN 899 Thesis for the first time, the student will be g iven the booklet entitled \"Reference for Thesis Research and Oral Examination\" by the research advisor. When the student enrolls in DN 854, the student will be provided with a course syllabus by the research advisor. These documents each provide more details about the proc esses involved in completing the courses. DN 899: Thesis Time period: Thesis research can be done over a number of semesters (typically takes 3 semesters) S cope of research : Thesis research involves all aspects of research including a proposal, collection and analysis of data and a thesis. Thesis Written document : Formatting guidelines are provided by Graduate Studies. Oral presentation: 30 min presentation to department; 30 min of questions from thesis committee. G eneral oral exam : 30 minutes. This exam must occur in the last semester of enrollment and must meet the academic deadline 35 The thesis is submitted electronically . DN 854: Special Problems (Non -thesis) Time period : The project is generally completed in one or two semesters. After the project proposal is approved by the project committee, students must log 100 hours of work on the project. S cope of research : The project may include one or more of the following: o Writing an intensive review of the literature on a given topic with additional requirements other than those of DN 819 Scientific Writing. o Participation with a faculty member in the development of a research proposal, manuscript , or grant. o Participation with a faculty member in conducting a pilot project. o Participation with a faculty member in the design, implementation, or the evaluation of a program in a specialized area of dietetics practice. o Collection and/or analysis of data in conjunction with a faculty member engaged in research. Written paper : A 4-6- page proposal document followed by a final written document that summarizes the work completed, including a discussion and significance of findings (length determined by advisor based upon scope of project) .

Curriculum for Dietetic Internship Graduate Certificate Program The KUMC Dietetic Internship program provides supervised practice experiences that allow the dietetic intern to practice, develop, and apply skills gained in the classroom. The DI allows graduates to meet the supervised practice experience requirements set forth by ACEND. The 16 hours of graduate coursework (8 hours didactic, 8 hours practicum) and a minimum of 1, 000 hours of supervised practice experiences included in the program contain the required content to meet the required core competencies for entry -level dietitians. The interplay of experiential and didactic learning provides an opportunity for the development of expertise in dietetics and nutrition. The DI requires a minimum of 1, 040 hours of supervised practice experiences in the areas of clinical nutrition, food and nutrition management, community nutrition, and practice area of interest. DN 827 Practicum consists of 4 hours during the fall semester and 4 hours during the spring semester . The grading scale for DN 827 Practicum is Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory. For DN 827 Practicum, you 37 complete supervised practice experiences and projects under the direction of preceptors as well as other assignments and activities requested by the program director and faculty. The program director assigns dietetic interns to preceptors based on dietetic interns' preferences as well as the availability of preceptors. Dietetic interns receive a list of available preceptors for supervised practice experiences and have the opportunity to list their top choices. If you fail to submit your choices, the program director makes assignments. The ability of supervised practice facilities to accept dietetic interns varies from semester to semester and year to year. At the beginning of each supervised practice experience, dietetic interns receive guidelines and semester calendars. Experiences take place at a variety of locations and require travel within and outside of the Kansas City area. You are responsible for providing your own transportation to supervised practice experience sites and required meetings. Supervised practice experiences generally take place Tuesday through Friday, usually 32 hours per week, during the fall and spring semester. In addition to the supervised practice experiences, dietetic interns complete an additional 8 hours of didactic graduate courses as a requirement of the program: Medical Nutrition Therapy I and II (6 hours) and Management in Dietetics and Nutrition I and II (2 hours) . These courses are graded using the traditional letter grading scale of A, B, C, D, F and are required for the Graduate Certificate. Classroom work takes place on Mondays. Classes are held at the University of Kansas Medical Center campus located at 3901 Rainbow Boulevard in Kansas City, KS.

Experiences take place in hospitals, clinics, community healthcare agencies, and other practice settings in which dietetics and nutrition services are provided. Dual MS/Dietetic Internship Supervised Practice Experience Schedule A list of available supervised practice facilities is provided to dietetic interns each semester. The Program Director makes assignments based on needs of preceptors and interests of dietetic interns. She works with dietetic interns to identify other education facilities that are not on the list that assist the dietetic intern in meeting his/her individualized educational and professional goals. Interns submit their top 5 choices for each rotation and the program director then assigns the rotation location. Supervised Practice Rotations Clinical Nutrition - 425 hours ( ~15-16 weeks) Clinics (IPE, JayDoc) ~ 30 hours Food and Nutrition Management - 200 hours ( ~6-7 weeks) Community Nutrition - 200 hours ( ~6-7 weeks) Practice Area of Interest - 120 hours ( ~3-4 weeks) * Total: 975 plus alternative learning experiences *For the practice area of interest, you design supervised practice experiences with the preceptors you choose. A minimum of 120 hours is required. *In addition to the supervised practice hours accumulated through rotations, there will also be hours awarded for alternative learning activities completed during coursework or activities outside regular supervise practice hours. It is estimated that 128 additional hours will be received for these act ivities. Total Supervised Practice Hours (minimum) - 1,103 Dietetic Internship Graduate Certificate Supervised Practice Experience Schedule A list of available supervised practice facilities is provided to dietetic interns each semester.

It is estimated that 98 additional hours will be received for these activities. Total Supervised Practice Hours - 1,073 hours Requirements for Supervised Practice Rotations Prior to starting the supervised practice experience rotations , interns are required to submit health and immunization records ; proof of health insurance coverage; complete a criminal background check and drug screen; and HIPAA, safety , and other training at KUMC. Dietetic interns should be prepared to provide proof of this information to preceptors . Some facilities may have other requirements that must be fulfilled prior to starting a rotation (i.e., CPR training). Any expenses incurred for these services are the responsibility of the intern. Supervised Practice Facilities All supervised practice sites must have a signed Affiliation Agreement prior to the intern starting their rotation experiences. The Affiliation Agreement delineates the rights and responsibilities of both the University of Kansas Medical Center and the affiliating organization. Agreements must be signed by the Dean of the School of Health Professions at KUMC and an individual with appropriate institutionally - assigned authority at the affiliating organization. The P rogram Director maintains the Affiliation Agreements and initiates a new agreement when an agreement is scheduled to expire. Policy of Replacement of Employees We are committed to ensuring our interns receive the education and training necessary to become competent, entry -level registered dietitian nutritionists. Thus, it is our policy that interns are not to be used to replace employees. At the end of the clinical rotation, the intern will complete staff relief. Staff relief does not replace the dietitian. The dietitian is still required to provide intern supervision and to co- sign notes. If an intern feels that they are being used to fill in for other employees on a regular basis, please report this to the Program Director. Supervised Practice Documentation Dietetic interns will document supervised practice hours via the Trajecsys system. In addition, they will be asked to complete a brief daily and weekly reflection of activities. In addition to supervised practice hours conducted in the professional work setting, there will be times when interns will receive hours for completion of simulation, case studies , and role-playing activities . The program director will inform interns of when and how many hours should be recorded for these activities . These activities are above and beyond those assigned for the required supervised practice experience rotations . Supervised Practice Performance Evaluations Evaluations help dietetic interns progress toward the goal of becoming a competent entry -level dietitian. The performance evaluation process consists of the dietetic intern's self-evaluation and the preceptor's evaluation of the dietetic intern's performance in the supervised practice setting. Generally, dietetic 40 interns participate in the evaluation process every 3-4 weeks and at the end of supervised practice experiences. The evaluations may be more frequent , if desire d by the preceptor. Evaluations monitor both clinical competence as well as professional and ethical behaviors. These evaluations will be submitted electronically through Trajecsys. Dietetic interns meet with preceptors to discuss performance evaluations. Class homework, presentations, and exams are other methods used to assess the dietetic intern's work. Dietetic interns are asked to evaluate each course, supervised practice experience, and the overall internship program. The KUMC program director, faculty, and staff provide the forms and online surveys to complete these evaluations. Professional Meetings and Activities Dietetic interns participate in professional meetings, projects, and other events under the guidance and sponsorship of the department and other groups. The following activities by dietetic interns are expected: membership in state and national professional organizations; preparation, display and presentation of professional related exhibits ; and participation at department, school, and university functions. All dietetic interns are required to obtain Student Membership in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND). Benefits of student membership include access to AND resources, access to the Journal of the Academy of Dietetics and Nutrition, and member rates for products and meeting fees. Membership in the Academy automatically grants membership to the Kansas Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (or other state affiliate where the student resides). Interns will be required to provide the Program Director with proof of student membership. Dietetic interns are encouraged to attend professional gatherings, annual conferences of the Kansas or other state dietetic associations, and the Food and Nutrition Conference and Exposition (FNCE) . Dietetic interns may be excused from classes or supervised practice experiences to attend approved meetings. Dietetic interns may be assigned to help with various departmental events, health fairs, seminars, and open houses that occur during the academic year. Many seminars are available at KUMC each week and are announced via the Weekly Academic Calendar and e- mail. These seminars are open to students, faculty and staff from all departments. These seminars are an opportunity to observe an interdisciplinary approach to research and to the prevention and treatment of disease. Students are expected to read these announcements and to attend ones that augment their life-long learning goals. As a bonus, a few seminars provide free lunches! Semina rs can be located on the KUMC calendar at http://www.kumc.edu/events - calendar.html . JayDoc Free Clinic JayDoc Free Clinic is an interdisciplinary, student -run clinic for uninsured individuals in Kansas City. Dietetic interns are required to work at JayDoc throughout the dietetic internship program . Dr. Goetz will let you know the required number of sessions. This service will provide valuable experience providing preventive nutrition counseling in a primary care setting. Each month, dietetic interns sign up for a clinic night in the following month using the JayDoc volunteer website ( https://jaydoc - 4412a.web.app / ). At t he clinic, interns are expected to check in with a nutrition co- director upon arrival . Dietetic interns may count these hours towards practicum supervised practice experiences , including any additional nights that they wish to volunteer. 41 The Co -Directors will let d ietetic interns know what time they should arrive at the clinic. Dress is business casual and students should wear their KU student name badge. Each dietetic intern fills out one patient checklist per patient counseled. All patient checklists are to be turned into the nutrition co- director at the end of the night or placed in a designated folder at the clinic. If a dietetic intern is unable to attend the night she/he signed up for, she/he must arrange with another dietetic intern to switch nights and notify Emma Montgomery ( emontgomery6@kumc.edu) and Jennifer Tran ( jtran12@kumc.edu ) the Nutrition Co-Directors for JayDo c. Inter professional Teaching Clinics During the semester that the dietetic intern completes the Clinical Nutrition rotation, she/he will be required to complete two half days each within the Team -Based Teaching Clinic ( TBTC ; formerly called Interprofessional Teaching Clinic ) and Geriatric Int erprofessional Assessment Clinic (GI AC). Interns will be assigned two consecutive Wednesday afternoons to participate in GIAC and two consecutive Friday mornings for TBTC (unless a different schedule is requested by the preceptor) . Interns are required to submit a reflection paper on their experience. Additional information will be provided during the internship orientation and within Blackboard. You can also visit the TB TC Conduct - Code of Ethics You are required to read and comply with the professional conduct guidelines outlined in the Code of Ethics for the Dietetic Profession at Commission on Dietetic Registration (cdrnet.org) . As dietetic interns relate with peers, patients, faculty, staff, and a variety of professionals in the clinical setting, ethical behaviors are expected. In the clinical setting, behaviors must be such to promote efficient and effective care of patients and the orderly operation of the organization. The impression that dietetic interns strive to achieve is one that inspires trust and confidence among clients, families, professionals, staff and peers. Professional behavior is required of students in the classroom and supervised practice experiences. This is important as it relates to the confidentiality of patient medical records and employee records. It is inappropriate for dietetic interns to discuss personal matters with patients and other health professionals, or to solicit personal advice from such persons. Comments and actions should be professional and appropriate to the healthcare and business setting. Students maintain pleasant, courteous, and respectful behaviors toward patients and family members, peers, faculty, preceptors, and other health professionals and staff. It is important that you are appropriately responsive to staff, enthusiastic about assigned work, abide by the established policies and procedures of the institution, and adhere to the specific lines of authority when working at facilities. Failure to observe appropriate ethical behaviors in the clinical setting is academically and professionally unacceptable as well as medically and legally compromising. Guidelines about use of cell phones, laptops and mobile devices in the classroom and during supervised practice experiences include: no recreational web surfing during class or supervised practice experiences; and cell phones and other mobile devices are muted or turned off during supervised practice experiences and in the classroom. Exceptions to the guidelines are when they are used in specific applications approved by faculty and preceptors for class and supervised practice work. 42 Standards of Dress and Appearance Dietetic interns are required to be neat, clean, and appropriately dressed when reporting to classes, rotations, and professional gatherings. Whether on campus, in the supervised practice environment, or at a professional gathering you project a professional image as you represent the department and profession of nutrition and dietetics. Appropriate dress and appearance ensure consistent and acceptable presentation to patients, visitors, faculty, and staff; prevents contamination of foods; and protects you from injuries caused by inappropriate clothing. For classes and events outside supervised practice hours, dress appropriately for the occasion. Dress should be professional if giving a presentation. For supervised practice experience, students are expected to confirm to the dress requirements of the facility . Interpretation of appropriate dress rests with the preceptor. If you are inappropriately dressed , you may be dismissed for the day and required to make up hours missed. Lab Coats White lab coats or scrubs may or may not be required, depending on the facility. Some hospitals require lab coats or scrubs , whereas community sites may not require them. It is your responsibility to purchase a lab coat or sc rubs if it is required at a supervised practice site. KUMC ID Badge Students are required to have a KUMC ID badge for access to campus resources and for supervised practice experiences. You obtain a KUMC ID badge by setting an appointment or if possible, the program director may arrange for a group appointment during orientation. The email is UniversityIDBad ge@kumc.edu . Badges are issued in the campus badge office located in DELP G060. Shoes Shoes should be closed toed and clean appearing. Flip-flops are not permitted. Slip resistant soles on shoes are required in food service areas. Jewelry Jewelry should be kept to a minimum and may be deemed unsafe for certain settings. Generally, jewelry should be restricted to a wristwatch, wedding rings, and earrings when working in food service areas. Preceptors may have additional restrictions on jewelry. Piercings and Tattoos Visible body stud jewelry (rings or studs in the nose, tongue, lips or eyebrow) are generally not allowed during supervised practice rotations, please check with your preceptor . Efforts should be made to conceal or cover tattoos during rotations, when possible. Cosmetics and Nails Makeup should be applied conservatively. Colognes and perfumes should be lightly applied and light in scent (if worn). Nails should be conservative in length and neatly manicured. Nail polish must be conservative and not chipped. Artificial nails (tips, overlays, wraps, etc.) may not be allowed due to safety concerns , please check with your preceptor . Preceptor s may also have additional restrictions . Hair Hair should be clean, styled and when working in the food service areas hair restraints are required. Mustaches, beards, or sideburns below the ear lobe must be closely trimmed and neat. When working in the food service area, restraints for hair and beards are required. 43 Outside Employment Students who assume outside employment to support themselves during the time when supervised practice experiences occur need to be aware that dietetic interns who work during the program may not complete the requirements of the program in a satisfactory and timely manner. If you choose to accept employment , you need to arrange outside work around the widely varying supervised practice experience schedules. You should not accept jobs that require work during daytime hours on Mondays through Fridays during the semester (semesters 1 and 2, both program tracks) . Some supervised practice experiences require dietetic interns work evening hours during the week and some weekend hours, so the outside employment hours need to be flexible. If problems arise relating to supervised practice experience hours and outside work hours, the program director and preceptor will discuss their concerns with you. You are required to fulfill the supervised practice experience schedule set by the program director and preceptor by altering the outside employment schedule so that supervised practice experiences are completed. Supervised Practice Compensation Interns are not compensated for their supervised practice experience hours. However, if the opportunity presents itself during the practice area of interest rotation, interns may accept a stipend or hourly wage (i.e. , working on project that offers a stipe nd, completing hours at a place where currently employed). This will be at the discretion of the DI program director and the intern must clearly demonstrate within the Step 1 Learning Plan how the goals/learning needs selected for the rotation will build upon their current knowledge and/or skills. The Program Director must review and approve this plan. Classwork Expectations Students/interns attend classes and are prepared to participate in the learning process. The faculty members are present to assist and facilitate learning but expect active student involvement during classes. Turn off or mute cell phones, laptops and other mobile devices unless approved by faculty so as not to disrupt classroom activities. Dietetic interns are expected to maintain high standards of conduct. Dishonest, irresponsible, and unethical behaviors are not tolerated. The department adheres to policies set forth by the S chool and the University concerning cheating and plagiarism. To plagiarize means to \"present the ideas or words of another as one's own\" (from Webster's New Explorer Dictionary and Thesaurus, Merriam- Webster, Springfield, MA, 1999, page 397). Clearly cite references used in preparing assigned projects. Guidelines for citing references are provided in classes; however, if you are not certain how to do this, it is your responsibility to contact a faculty member or librarian to obtain clarification. Plagiarism in any form is not accepted and is handled according to School and University policies. Software that detects acts of plagiarism is used to score written work for violations of plagiarism. Instructors evaluate the results of the plagiarism score to determine what action is required. Plagiarism is considered academic misconduct and can result in a failing grade. The policies set forth by the School and the University concerning cheating and plagiarism are described in the KUMC Student Handbook at Student Handbook (kumc.edu) . 44 Attendance It is expected by faculty that students attend classes. You are required to call and/or email the appropriate professor as designated in the course guidelines if you are absent from class. You may be penalized for absences , if stated in course guidelines. You will complete scheduled supervised practice experience hours. If you have extenuating circumstances or illnesses that prevent participation in scheduled experiences , you are required to contact the preceptor at the supervised practice site AND the Program Director to report the absence. Failure to report an absence is unprofessional and impacts your performance evaluation. At a later date agreed upon by the preceptor , you will complete hours missed from supervised practice experiences. You will be responsible for making arrange ments with the preceptor to make up absences. Vacations and Holidays The Dual MS/Dietetic Internship program will follow the KUMC academic calendar. Students completing the DI Graduate Certificate program will follow some minor exceptions to the KUMC academic calendar. DI Certificate students will have a reduced winter and spring break to allow for completion of supervised practice hours within the reduced 2 semester time frame. Students in both tracks will be given a detailed calendar that will outline the designated breaks. Please note that should an intern need to makeup missed superv ised practice hours or need additional time to meet required competencies, he/she may be required to complete supervised practice hours during university designated breaks. A student who is absent from class for a religious observance may reschedule an examination, presentation, or supervised practice experience without penalty. However, it is your responsibility to notify the professor, program director, and preceptor of the absence prior to the religious holiday. When you miss classes or supervised practice experiences, you are still required to complete all assigned work, exams, and projects due during the absence. It is your responsibility to secure handouts and notes from the missed classes and plan for make- up hours missed due to the absence with the preceptor. If you have special requests for absences from classes and supervised practice experiences, e.g., job interviews and family events, you should discuss requests in advance with the faculty, preceptors, and program director. They will review the request, and, if approval is granted, you will be required to m ake up all of the missed work later. Hazardous Weather Policy and Communication The Office of the Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor provides official notice about cancelled classes for the University of Kansas Medical Center. In the event of hazardous weather, check the local news media (Fox 4, KCTV5 and/or KMBC 9) to see if KUMC has cancelled classes for the day and check university email for a broadcast email on hazardous weather cancellations. You can also call 913- 588-INFO for a recorded announcement. If KUMC cancels classes, you do not report to classes or supervised practice experiences. Hours may need to be made up at a later date if the intern has not accrued extra hours (all interns must accumulate a minimum of 1,000 hours of supervised practice experience from rotations ). If classes are not cancelled due to hazardous weather, but the student/intern does not feel safe driving to the site, he/she should contact the preceptor by phone as well as the DI Program Director by email at the beginning of the scheduled workday to report the absence. In this case, the student completes the 45 missed work hours later if KUMC did not cancel classes for the day. Discuss hazardous weather plans with your preceptor before it happens so you know what to do. At some sites, staff may be willing to pick you up and bring you to work when the weather is hazardous as they need your help. Emergency Communications on Campus The campus utilizes the Rave Text Messaging system to send updated information in emergency situations. Students should be automatically opted in to receive messages, but confirmation or changes can be made through the Enroll & Pay system. Injury or Exposure while Working in a Supervised Practice Facility If you are injured or exposed to blood, body fluids, or other infectious materials while performing duties in a dietetic intern capacity, you should immediately come to KUMC Student Health located at 1012 Student Center Building (phone 913-588-1941). The clinic is open 8 AM - 6 PM on Mondays and 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM Tuesday through Friday. At any other time, you should present to the KUMC Emergency Room. You have 72-hours to start on the appropriate treatment. KUMC ER bills Student Health Services directly for costs incurred related to dietetic intern injury or exposure to infectious materials. If you are injured or become ill unrelated to an exposure incident while performing duties as part of the program, you should seek treatment based on your health insurance policy and the policy of the institution where you are working at the time of the incident. You are responsible for financial arrangements for any injury or illness sustained while working at the facility. The clinical education facility will instruct you on health and safety precautions and related policies during orientation to the institution. Computer Skills and Recommended Devices It will be expected that the students can properly use email and software programs for word processing, presentations, searches of biomedical literature and data management. Both instructor -led and web- based courses are offered at KUMC without charge to employees and students. Students who need a computer class on a particular topic will be expected to search out the appropriate computer training.

There may be times during the program when you are required to travel outside of the Kansas City metropolitan area in order to complete educational and supervised practice experiences. It is your responsibility to provide the transportation and pay for the costs of travel. The university does not assume liability for your safety traveling to educational sites. You may have extra housing or lodging expenses if working at a site or attending meetings outside of the metropolitan area. Scholarships Scholarships are available annually from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Foundation (ANDF), and the Kansas and other state and district dietetic associations. Applications for scholarships are usually announced in December and due in February. Web sites to find information are: http://www.eatrightfoundation.org/Foundation/scholarships /; http://www.eatrightks.org/ . The Program Director will also post notices regarding scholarship opportunities within the DN 827 practicum blackboard course. The Department of Dietetics and Nutrition provides scholarships and awards for students in Dietetics and Nutrition that include the Sevie Nelson , Marian Boelte, Ruth Gordon , and Rowena Sherrill Awards /Scholarships . You will receive information about how to apply for scholarships and awards from the department staff if you are eligible. MS Student Assistantships Graduate Teaching Assistantships and Research Assistantships are available through the Department of Dietetics & Nutrition on a semester -by-semester basis (this typically occurs for Dual MS/DI students during semesters 4 and 5 but could also include semester 3). The time commitments and wages vary. Availability of assistantships will be announced to Dual MS/DI students during the second semester of enrollment (spring 2024 semester) . Competition for assistantships exists. Criteria and terms of the assistantships will be announced when availability of assistantships are announced. Occasionally, circumstances arise in which a student must discontinue an assistantship, which will have impact upon the faculty/staff member directing the assistantship and also means losing whatever tuition reduction the assistantship carried. This decision needs to be made under the advisement of the faculty/staff member directing the assistantship as soon as possible in order that another student can be hired and receive the tuition reduction (if applicable). Please consult with 51 Graduate Studies for more information regarding tuition: http://catalog.ku.edu/graduate- studies/kumc/#gtgratext . MS Student Assistantship Policies a. See the Graduate Studies principles concerning assistantships: https://catalog.ku.edu/graduate-studies/kumc/#gtgratext b. Time Commitment: A student is hired for a specified percent full time equivalent (%FTE), and the number of average hours worked per week must be proportional to the appointment percentage. These are salary positions and thus students are expected to work during breaks (see banked hours policy below). Time spent on thesis or non -thesis projects does not count toward the GRA/GTA appointment. c. G RA/GTA Work versus MS Research: If a faculty member is both the faculty employer and the faculty research advisor for a student, the hours the student spends for work and research are to be counted separately. In fairness to all assistants, those who have the same faculty employer and research advisor should not work less total hours than a student employee who work s for one faculty member and is advised by another for MS research. d. A ssignments : The department chair will decide on the faculty member with whom each graduate teaching assistant (GTA) will primarily work and how the work hours will be distributed if the s tudent is working for more than one faculty member. Occasionally, a GTA will be asked to do an assignment for the department or a faculty member other than the one to whom s/he is usually assigned. If a GTA is not given enough work to do, s/he should ask the faculty employer for more work. If the faculty employer does not have an assignment, the administrative assistant or MS Director can be consulted. e. W ork Schedule: The student will meet with the faculty employer by the first week of school to determine the types of assignments, work site and work schedule that will be required by the faculty employer. f. A dditional Employment : Before arranging for a second position, the student must work out with the faculty employer the compatibility of the work schedules. g. T ime Sheets : The graduate student employees will keep track of work hours on a time sheet. The time sheets have columns for GTA/GRA work hours and for the student research project on which the student worked. This record keeping will protect the student and help the advisor see how much time his/her assignments require. At the end of each pay period the faculty advisor/ faculty employer will be given the time sheet by the advisee/employee for approval. h. GR A/GTA Banked Hours : It is possible for the graduate student employee to \"bank\" hours by working extra hours per week during school vacations or in weeks when the student can. To avoid having banked hours get out of hand, students will be able to bank two weeks of hours at their own discretion. Additional banked hours will need to be approved in writing by the faculty employer. A copy of the approval needs to be given to the Administrative Assistant so that she can appropriately manage payroll. i. Tr ansportation and Lunch: Time spent for transportation and lunch do not count as work time on a routine basis. There may be an occasional exception. For example, travel time might be 52 paid time if a student has to go to a second work site during the workday or if the work site is outside the Greater Kansas City Area. Another exception might be if the meal is a \"working\" meal. The faculty employer will decide if transportation time or meal can be counted as work time for a particular assignment. Direct ory Information It is necessary that the Department and preceptors have your current address, cell phone number, KUMC e- mail address, and emergency contact. When there are changes in contact information, you should communicate changes to the department staff, faculty , and preceptors as soon as possible. Departmental Facilities The Dietetics and Nutrition main offices are located in DELP G020. There are more faculty offices located in DELP G037. Faculty mailboxes are located in DELP G037 and some faculty have drop boxes by their offices. The student room for Dietetics and Nutrition students is located in DELP G028 where there are student mailboxes, computers, worktables and a microwave. The refrigerator and kitchen sink are located further down the hall from this room. Students may store lunches in the refrigerator. Please keep the student room and kitchen areas clean including the microwave, refrigerator, and sink. Label foods placed in the refrigerator. Dispose of uneaten foods and drink immediately. Departmental Communication For routine communications, the DN Department will communicate with students via email or individual mailboxes in the D&N student room. It is important that you check your mailbox in the student room weekly during the semester. Students are expected to check their KUMC email daily. Do not delete email messages from KUMC or the department without reading them first. KUMC email is available through the KUMC Outlook Web App from computers outside KUMC. For some classes, instructors may require more frequent checking of communication systems. Please note and follow Information Resources policies for syncing email on a phone App. For some communications, the department may need to use your home or cell phone or home mailing address. Therefore, we ask you to keep us informed of changes in address or phone numbers. If you need to print or photocopy materials , you should not use the departmental photocopy machines for printing or copying unless it is with the authorization of faculty or staff. Students can print or copy documents at Dyke's Library or the HEB for free (up to $20/semester; see the following link for additional details: http://dykeslibrary.blogspot.com/2017/05/update- on-student -printing.html ). DN Faculty and Staff The primary objective of the faculty is to assist you in your endeavor to become a competent scholar and professional. Faculty members are available to meet with you. You should make appointments with faculty through the faculty member or leave a message (voice mail or email). If you have difficulties contacting a faculty member , please notify the Administrative Assistant. Some faculty members travel out of town or may be on leave and are unavailable on short notice. You are not to use faculty as a \"sounding board\" to complain about other faculty, staff, or preceptors. If you have a complaint about a course coordinated by faculty, meet with the faculty in charge of the 53 course to discuss the concerns. If the faculty does not deal with the concerns adequately , contact the Program Director or Chair of the Department to set up a meeting to discuss concerns. The faculty uses services of departmental staff. You are not to make personal requests of the staff, e.g., photocopying, typing, and transmitting personal incoming telephone calls, except in cases approved by faculty or emergency situations. The table below provides contact information for the DN Faculty: Name Office Phone (913) E-mail Goetz, Jeannine PhD, RD, LD Associate Professor MS/DI 588-5358 hhull@kumc.edu Anna Arthur, PhD, RD Assistant Program Director * G027C DELP 945-7079 aarthur4@kumc.edu 945-9601 acarbuhn2@kumc.edu Carlson, Susan PhD A.J.

However, the Program Director provides academic counseling in order to help you fulfill academic goals for the DI (and MS program) . You should review your plan of study using the \"Academic Plan\" during the first semester of graduate work. Your academic progress is reviewed and documented in the KU Advising Tool under the myKUMC intranet . The Program Director will advise on which courses should be taken each semester. During the final spring se mester, the program director will assist you with the application for approval to take the Registration Examination for Dietitians upon completion of the program. When faculty observes a student is having difficulty relating to class work, supervised practice, or other areas, he/she recommends the student seek guidance from the Student Counseling and Educational Support Services ( see COUNSELING & EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES section ). Prior Learning/Competence and Transfer Credit The University of Kansas Medical Center does not grant exemption from dietetic internship supervised practice experiences or graduate coursework for prior education or employment experiences. The University will allow up to 6 credit hours of comparable graduate coursework to t ransfer for completion of the MS degree. The University does not accept transfer credit for the graduate coursework required for the Graduate Certificate Dietetic Internship pr ogram. Progress in Program - Academic Probation The department uses the academic standards set by the University for graduate students. Each student is required to maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or better. If a student's GPA falls below 3.0, s/he will be placed on probation by the Dean of Graduate Studies and will have one semester to raise it to a 3.00. If the student is unable to raise their GPA to at least a 3.0, the student will not be permitted to re- enroll in graduate work unless the Dean of Graduate Studies acts favorably on a departmental recommendation for the student to continue study. The student is also required to earn a grade of \"S\" (satisfactory) in the DN 827 Practicum courses ( 8 credit hours). The Program Director will monitor supervised practice evaluations to ensure that the intern 55 is satisfactorily meeting the required competencies and maintaining professional and ethical behavior. Should issues arise, the Program Director will schedule a meeting with the intern for further discussion and counseling (see RETENTION AND REMEDIATION PROCEDURES section). Only courses graded \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\" co unt toward graduate credit for a Master of Science degree ( 30 credit hours) or towards the Graduate Certificate (8 credit hours) . The faculty reviews the academic work of graduate students each semester to determine academic progress, need for probation, or dismissal from the program. Program Time Limitations/Leave of Absence Dual MS/Dietetic interns are required to complete the program within 7 years of beginning the program. DI Graduate Certificate students are required to complete the program within 4 years of beginning the program. If a student starts the program and later needs to leave the program before all required work is completed, he/she meets with the Program Director explaining the rationale for the leave and when he/she plans to return to complete the program. The student documents the absence request in writing and submits it to the Program Director. The Program Directo r then reviews the request , and if it is approved, a student' s spot for supervised experience is typically reserved for up to one year but could be extended longer based upon extenuating circumstance. During a leave of absence, students are not considered officially enrolled and are not reported to lenders as being on a leave of absence. If students take a leave of absence, they will not be eligible to enroll without completing a reactivation form and paying the reactivation fee. The following checklist should be consulted when considering a LOA: 1. Contact Student Financial Aid to: a. Ask about contacting lenders , b. Ask about possible need to repay financial aid for the current semester , c. Ask about load deferments . 2. Contact the Associate Registrar to: a. Check to see how current fees will be handled. Refunds may go to financial aid. b. Check about retaining residency for fee purposes. If you are not enrolled at the University of Kansas and move outside the State for the period of the leave of absence, in all likelihood you will lose your residency status. 3. Health Insurance - Ask how it is possible to remain on the student health plan. The Office of Graduate Studies Request for Leave of Absence checklist is found here: https://www.kumc.edu/documents/gradstudy/LOA%20Checklist_SHP.pdf . When the student is ready to resume the program, they must notify the Program Director. If the student still needs to complete supervised practice experience hours, the Program Director will make an effort to find new placement for the student according to their desired timeframe; how ever, this will be dependent upon availability of rotation sites. Students returning from a LOA must complete the form linked here to be approved for enrollment in coursework: https://www.kumc.edu/documents/gradstudy/LOA%20Return%20Form_SHP.pdf . Please note, students who were granted a medical LOA must provide a letter from the physician stating the problem for which leave was granted has been resolved and the student is ready t o resume graduate work. 56 Retention and Remediation Procedures Should a precep tor identify that a dietetic intern is not performing in a satisfactory manner, the following sequence of remediation procedures will be initiated : 1. If a preceptor at a supervised practice site judges that an intern's performance is not satisfactory, the preceptor will provide the intern with constructive feedback regarding the unsatisfa ctory perfo rmance along wit h suggestions for improvement . 2. If the intern' s perfor mance does not improve within the specifi ed time period, the preceptor will then notify the Program Director regarding the se concerns. 3. The Program Director will then convene a meeting that includes the program director, preceptor, and the intern. The student will be counseled regarding the shortcoming/iss ues and a written plan for improvement identifying the s pecific knowledge and skills that must be satisfactorily demonstrated and the ex pected time frame for completion of this improvement plan will be developed. Once agreed upon, this document w ill be signed by all parties involved. 4. If a student is still unable to improve their performance to a satisfactory level within the noted timeframe , the Program Director will explore tutorial support and/or remedial instruction opportunities for the student. 5. If perfor mance improves to an acceptable level during this time period, the intern will be allowed to continue with the internship program. 6. If the student is still unable to improve performance to a satisfactory level based upon the written and signed plan, the Program Director will convene a Depart ment Committee consisting of the Program Director and 2 faculty members to determine further action (placement at another rotation facility, removal from program, etc .) dependent upon the areas of concern . If the st udent is removed from the program, they will be counseled into career paths that ar e appropriate to their ability. If the student is completing the D ual MS/DI program and the concern r aised is not academic related (i.e., unethical behavior, substance abuse, etc .), a committee consisting of the Program Dir ector, Depart ment Chair, and one additional faculty member will be convened to review the concerns and to determine if the student can be removed from the dietetic internship program but s till remain in the MS program . Withdrawal from a Course and Tuition Refund Students who are considering withdrawing from one or more courses must contact the Program Director since this decision may have significant consequences . The Program Director will assist the student in deciding how to proceed . Withdrawal from a course will delay a student's timeline for program completion. If the student decides to request a withdrawal , he/she must submit this request in writing to the Program Director. The request must include: The course(s) from which the student is requesting a withdrawal , The reason(s) for the withdrawal request, and The student's proposed plan for completing the course and the program . 57 The Program Director will consider each request for withdrawal on a case- by-case basis and determine whether and how the student may proceed in the program. When a student withdraws from a course, the point of the semester in which the student withdraws will determine the notation on the transcript (i.e., W for withdrawal, letter grade, or no class notation recorded). For specific dates regarding what is noted on the student transcripts please refer to the University Registrar's enrollment webpage and read about how a withdrawal affects grades recorded on the official transcript. Students must officially drop or withdraw from classes. Non- attendance does not constitute a drop or withdrawal. Individual classes may be dropped online via Enroll and Pay . Please note the academic calendar for drop dates and refund rates (https://www.kumc.edu/academic -and- student -affairs/departments/registrars -office/academic -calendar.html ). Students should be aware a withdrawal may reduce or change eligibility for financial aid. At the discretion of the department, excessive withdrawals from coursework will constitute inadequate progress toward degree completion and dismissal from the program. Withdrawals are considered excessive if they exceed the following limits: 1. A student may withdraw from a course one time only. Students may not withdraw from any course a second time and remain in the program. 2. During a student's progress to degree, s/he may withdraw from courses up to 3 times in total while still remaining in the program. Grievance Procedures/ACEND Complaint Procedures The student has the right to submit a grievance in situations when the student believes that the departmental procedures have been misapplied or applied in an arbitrary or capricious manner. The student should first meet with the faculty member involved to discuss the situation and attempt to resolve the concern. If the situation cannot be satisfactorily resolved, then the student meets with the Departmental Chair to discuss the situation and resolve the concern. If resolution is not possible , the student can submit a grievance to The School of Health Professions Dean for review and referral to the ad hoc Grievance Committee. The school follows established procedures for grievances, which can be found in Graduate Studies and School of Health Professions Handbooks . Students are advised to submit complaints directly to ACEND only after all other options with the program and institution have been exhausted. The address and phone number of ACEND is 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, IL 60606- 6995 ; 800-877-1600. The program director maintains written documentation of student complaints and outcomes in the student's departmental file and in the web-based KU Advising Tool. Student Ombudsman The role of the ombudsman is to investigate and facilitate resolution of allegations by any student of perceived unfair, inappropriate, discriminating or harassing treatment (behavior) by faculty, staff, administrators or fellow students. The ombudsman is an impartial party and a safe place for students to be heard and to receive impartial attention without fear of loss of privacy. The Student O mbud sman office is located on the 5 th floor of Wescoe and can be reached at 913.588.4698. More information can 58 be found here: https://www.kumc.edu/academic -and-student -affairs/student -resources/student - ombudsman.html Disciplinary and Termination Procedures Disciplinary and termination procedures can be found within the \"Actions related to Academic and Nonacademic M isconduct\" section of the School of Health Professions student handbook. These procedures can be found at: https://www.kumc.edu/school -of-health -professions/academics/student- handbook.html Students in this program may be dismissed if any of the following occur: o The student who is on academic probation fails to raise their cumulative graduate GPA to 3.0 or above. o A student on disciplinary probation exhibits recurrent or other behaviors that require a second disciplinary action. Withdrawal from the Program Occasionally extraordinary personal or medical circumstances, or a change in career direction, may lead a student to question whether to continue in the program. If this occurs, the student must meet with the Program Director and develop a plan about whether to continue. When a student withdraws from the program ( i.e., drops all courses), the point of the semester in which the student withdraws will determine the notation on the transcript (i.e., W for withdrawal, letter grade, or no class notation recorded). For specific dates regarding what is noted on the student transcripts please visit the University Registrar's enrollment webpage . Procedures for withdrawal from the Dietetic Internship program : The student must submit a letter to the Department Chairperson and Program Director stating that he/she is withdrawing and why. The student must inform the KU Medical Center Registrar's Office that he/she is withdrawing, and then complete a withdrawal notice. The Program Director will record a copy of the withdrawal in the student's academic file. Readmission Policy Students who have withdrawn from the program may be considered for readmission to the program during subsequent internship matching rounds. The student will be required to complete the full application process and will receive the same considerations as other applicants. Release of Student Information/Access to Student Records The University of Kansas Medical Center adheres to a policy of compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Students have four primary rights under FERPA including the right to: 1) inspect their education records, 2) consent to di sclosure of personally identifiable information except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent, 3) seek correction of their records to prevent inaccurate or misleading information, and 4) file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education if they feel their rights have been violated. 59 Student files are kept within a locked file cabinet within the Dietetics and Nutrition Department. These files contain: original application, transcripts, verification statements, and other correspo ndence or disciplinary information. A student may review his/her departmental student file in the presence of DN faculty or staff. The department does not release information about the student to other parties unless requested by the student in writing and if it complies with FERPA. Additional information related to the Student Records Policy can be located at: http://policy.ku.edu/registrar/student -record- policy . Program Completion Requirements and Information DI Program Pre - and Post - Exams The P rogram Director gives exams to students prior to starting supervised practice experience ( all - semester 1; pre- test) and at the completion of supervised practice experiences (spring semester (2nd semester) for DI Certificate students, and during the final program semester for MS/DI students (5th semester) . The purposes of the exams are to: 1. Ensure that diete tic interns have adequate knowledge and application base for entry -level practice in dietetics; 2. Motivate dietetic interns to prepare for the Registration Exam; 3. Provide the dietetic interns with practice in taking computer administered comprehensive multiple -choice exams; and 4. Allow dietetic interns to identify knowledge and application areas that need further study for the Registration Examination. Dietetic interns learn exam scores after the exams are finished. Dietetic interns are required to earn a score of 80% or greater /25 on the final exam administered during the final semester of the program (DI Certificate - spring 2 nd semester; Dual MD/DI - spring 5th semester) . Dietetic interns who do not earn a passing score on the final exam are required to take additional exams until a score of 80% or greater /25 is achieved. Dual MS/Dietetic Internship Program Completion Requirement The program completion requirements for awarding a verification statement for our Dual MS/DI track students will include: 1. Complete MS in Dietetics and Nutrition degree. Complete required program coursework with a cumulative grade -point average (GPA) of at least a 3.0 for all KU graduate coursework (38 credit hours); 2. Be in good academic and ethical standing within the University; 3. Successfully complete a minimum of 1,000 hours of supervised practice experience in a variety of settings ; 4. Receive a passing score on all ACEND core competencies; 5. Pass the final exam for the program with a score of 25 or greater; and 60 6. Complete all program requirements within 7 years of beginning the program. Dietetic Internship Graduate Certificate Program Completion Requirements The program completion requirements for awarding a verification statement for our DI Graduate Certificate track students will include: 1. Previous completion of a Graduate degree. 2. Complete required program coursework with a cumulative grade -point average (GPA) of at least a 3.0 for all KU graduate certificate coursework ( 16 credit hours); 3. Be in good academic and ethical standing within the University; 4. Successfully complete a minimum of 1,000 hours of supervised practice experience in a variety of settings ; 5. Receive a passing score on all ACEND core competencies; 6. Pass the final exam for the program with a score of 25 or greater; and 7. Complete all program requirements within 4 years of be ginning the program. Application for Degree During the semester in which the student expects to complete degree requirements (DI Graduate Certificate - spring semester; Dual MS/DI students - typically spring of 2 nd year), the student must complete an \"application for degree\" through Enroll & Pay at: https://sa.ku.edu/psp/csprd/?cmd=login&languageCd=ENG& . Please consult the Academic Calendar -and -student - affairs/departments/registrars - office/academic -calendar.html Verification Statements Upon successful completion of all program requirements (based upon requirements listed above) , the program director will provide you with a \"Verification Statement\". The required information is submitted by the P rogram Director to the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) to begin the approval process for taking the Registration Examination for Dietitians. You will receive 6 copies (or a digital file) of the verification form for use in application for AND membership, licensure, applying for examinations, employers, and for yourself. Photocopies of the form are not accepted by credentialing bodies. The department keeps a copy of the form in your student file indefinitely . Once the required information for registration eligibility is submitted to CDR, it takes about one to two weeks for you to receive information about the Registration Examination application. Go to the CDR web site at http://www.cdrnet.org/ for more information about the application process for the exam. 61 Information for After Program Completion National Registration Examination Once CDR has approved the graduate to take the Registration Examination, he/she receives the application to take the examination from the testing service (Pearson Vue) . The graduate completes the application and submits the required fees to take the examination. The examinations are scheduled at approved testing sites. The graduate schedules the date for taking the examination at the chosen site. The Registration Exam uses the computer adaptive testing method. For more information on the Registration Examination view http://www.cdrnet.org/ . The Department owns a copy of the latest version of the Registration Examination Study Guide , Visual Veggies software, Inman Review, Review of Dietetics, RD in a Flash as well as other study materials . You are encourage d to borrow these materials or purchase other available materials prior to taking the Registration Examination. Use of the Term RDE/RDNE CDR is concerned with the use of RDE/RDNE (registered dietitian eligible , registered dietitian nutritionist eligible ) to designate registration eligibility. RDE or RNDE is not a credential recognized by CDR. Individuals cannot use the term RDE or RDNE for employment or other purposes. Dietetic interns sign a form at the end of the program indicating that they will not use RDE or RDNE . Graduates of the program become Registered Dietitians (RD) or Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDN) when they pass the Registration Examination and pay the required fees to CDR. Licensure In most states in the US, dietitians are required to obtain a license to practice. New graduates that plan to practice in these states need to apply for a license to practice. The laws and contacts for licensure of dietitians in these states are found at Commission on Dietetic Registration (cdrnet.org) Employment Opportunities Faculty will email notices of employment opportunities that are sent to the department to graduate students.
