Steyer , M.D. Rhonda Ray, Ph.D., Contractor Abstr act 1 ABSTRA CT he purpose of T itle VII, section 747 is to trainTdiverse, br oadly competent primary care physi\u00ad cians, physician assistants, and dentists to meet the health car e needs of all Americans. Compared to all U.S. primary care medical and dental training pr o- grams, T itle VII, section 747 programs have achieved the following successes: Graduates ar e four to five times more likely (42-56 percent versus 10 percent) to work in medically un\u00ad derserved communities.1 Graduates are three to five times mor e likely (35- 50 per cent versus 10 percent) to come fr om under - represented minority or disadvantaged groups.1 Despite the successes of T itle VII, section 747 pr o- grams in strengthening the Nation's primary care ca\u00ad pacity, the health emer gencies following September 11, 2001, revealed gaps between primary care medi\u00ad cine and dentistry and the public health infrastructure. Increased support for these programs will help develop public health competencies for primary care medicine and dentistry and better prepare this front-line workforce to respond to ongoing public health concer ns, includ\u00ad ing health emer gencies. To increase the prepar edness of both public health professionals and primary car e medical and dental pro \u00ad viders, systematic linkages between public health and primary care physicians, physician assistants, and den\u00ad tists should be established, replicated, and fiscally sup- ported. Enhanced public health training for the Nation's primary care medical and dental providers will protect and improve the health of America. Recommendation 1 To avoid under mining the ef fectiveness of curr ent programs, T itle VII, section 747 r equires continued sup- port and additional funding. Recommendation 2 Training and education to develop essential public health competencies should be encouraged for all pri\u00ad mary car e medical, dental, and physician assistant pro- grams supported by T itle VII, section 747. Recommendation 3 All primary car e physicians, dentists, and physician assistants should be educated and trained in knowledge management and use of infor mation technology to access and communicate infor mation about public health issues. Recommendation 4 Examples of T itle VII, section 747 pr ograms that successfully train pr oviders with broad public health competencies should be widely disseminated to com\u00ad munities of inter est. CONCLUSION As highlighted in the 2001 r eport of the Advisory Committee on T raining in Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry, programs funded by T itle VII, section 747 can rapidly intr oduce curricula and appr oaches to facilitate r esponses to emer ging public health issues, such as the health care emer gencies evident in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. Meeting the gr ow\u00ad ing challenges facing primary care education with- out under mining the ef fectiveness of current pro- grams requires an annual appropriation of $198 million, as indicated in the Advisory Committee's 2001 r eport.2 2 Executi ve Summary 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMAR Y INTR ODUCTION Title VII, section 747 has been instrumental in cr e\u00ad ating a supply of diverse, br oadly competent primary care physicians, physician assistants, and dentists. From its beginnings, T itle VII, section 747 has helped de\u00ad velop and expand training pr ograms for these primary care health pr ofessions.3 Further , primary care medi cal and dental pr ograms supported by T itle VII, section 7 47 have outper formed the average of all U.S. training pr o- grams for these health professions pr ograms: In 1998, 42-56 per cent of graduates of these pro- grams entered practice in underserved communi\u00ad ties, compared to a mean of 10 per cent of U.S. health professions graduates overall.1 In 1998, underr epresented minority or disadvan\u00ad taged groups 35-50 per cent of gradu\u00ad ates of p rograms supported by T itle VII, section 747, c ompared to a 10 percent minority represen\u00ad tation among the U.S. health pr ofessions workforce overall.1 TITLE VII, SECTION 747: IMPR OVING ACCESS Access to health car e and pr eventive services is criti\u00ad cal for impr oving the health of all Americans and espe\u00ad cially for r educing health disparities between majority and minority populations. In addition to geographic, financial, or structural barriers to health car e, personal and cultural barriers such as language or ethnicity of-ten prohibit access to health care. Title VII, section 747 has supported increased di\u00ad versity among health care pr ofessionals and among faculty who train providers. This increased diversity in turn facilitates cultural competence and helps over come barriers to health car e for minority and disadvantaged populations. 4 According to the 2000 census, minori\u00ad ties comprise 25 per cent of the Nation's population.5 Minority physicians are five times more likely to pro- vide care for medically underserved and vulnerable populations that are often sicker , poore r, and mor e disadvantaged than patients served by non-minority physicians.6 Incentives, including financial ones, have often been needed to facilitate access to health care in rural and underserved communities or among the disadvantaged.7 Health care is also needed by an estimated 44.3 mil- lion people (more than 15 per cent of the U.S. popula\u00ad tion under age 65) who have no health insurance and by millions mor e who have inadequate coverage.8 In addition to incr easing the number of clinicians who serve medically underserved and disadvantaged populations, clinical training pr ograms supported by T itle VII, sec\u00ad tion 747 pr ovide direct care to these populations. Many challenges remain to be overcome before parity of health outcomes can be achieved for all popu\u00ad lation gr oups. Support for T itle VII, section 747 re- mains critical for incr easing access to health care and increasing diversity of primary car e providers. TITLE VII, SECTION 747: IMPR OVING PREP AREDNESS FOR HEAL TH EMERGENCIES Despite the successes of T itle VII, section 747 pro- grams in str engthening the Nation's primary car e ca\u00ad pacity, the health emer gencies following September 11, 2001, revealed gaps between primary care medi\u00ad cine and dentistry and the public health infrastructure. These weaknesses have prompted an examination of the pr eparedness of the health car e workforce to re\u00ad spond to health emer gencies. Like previous health events such as the first cases of AIDS, the anthrax cases served as sentinel health events signaling emer ging health threats. Inefficiencies in the health car e response to these health emer gencies indicate a critical need for increased communication and collaboration between public health pr ofessionals and the health care workforce, particularly primary car e providers. These providers serve on the frontlines of health care and interact with two-thirds of all Americans, mor e than any other type of clinician. 9 One of the lessons lear ned from these unpr ec\u00ad edented events is that adequate preparedness to handle such emer gencies is necessary to protect the health of the American public. This pr eparation entails joint efforts and a shar ed core of knowledge among public 4 Executi ve Summary health pr ofessionals and primary care pr oviders, who are typically the \"first r esponders\" who identify and manage cases r esulting from public health emer gen\u00ad cies. The Nation's disadvantaged and underserved populations\u2014those most likely to be served by T itle VII, section 747 programs and graduates\u2014ar e also the populations most vulnerable in medical emer gencies because of their lack of resources and lack of access to care. Title VII, section 747 is an ideal mechanism for enhancing the preparedness of primary car e physicians, physician assistants, and dentists to respond to health emer gencies and meet the health care needs of all Americans. This r eport of the Advisory Committee on Training in Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry ad- dresses the need to enhance the public health compe\u00ad tencies of primary care physicians, physician assistants, and dentists and thus str engthen America's health car e workforce and public health infrastructur e. TITLE VII, SECTION 747: IMPR OVING ALLIANCE OF PUBLIC HEAL TH AND PRIMAR Y CARE MEDICINE AND DENTISTR Y The events following September 11, 2001, mor e than anything in r ecent history, revealed the weaknesses in the public health infrastructur e, stated for mer Sur\u00ad geon General Dr . David Satcher to the Advisory Com\u00ad mittee at its meeting on May 13-14, 2002. This infra\u00adstructure, as defined by Satcher , has thr ee key components: public health practitioners at the local, State, and national level; primary care and other health practitioners who provide health car e to individuals; and the public, whose need to know when and how to respond to health threats is more critical than ever . 10 Only by working together to maximize knowledge and resources will the Nation's health care providers and public health professionals be adequately pr epared to protect and enhance the health of all citizens. As noted by an Advisory Committee workgr oup at the May 13-14, 2002 meeting, no one, rich or poor , young or old, can hide fr om the health thr eats facing the Nation.11 The fu\u00ad ture effectiveness of public health and of primary car e medicine and dentistry necessitates a br oad understand\u00ad ing of the major challenges to the health of populations.12 Historically, practitioners of public health and pri\u00ad mary care medicine and dentistry have trained and operated separately. As noted by one speaker at the meeting of the Advisory Committee, these disciplines \"have differ ent jobs that require dif ferent skills.\"13 How- ever, the work and skills of both disciplines are needed to addr ess ongoing and emer ging public concer ns. Public health and primary car e medicine and dentistry must be able to collaborate ef fectively to ensure the safety and well being of our Nation. Medical and other health care practitioners play an important r ole in enhancing public health, but to maxi\u00ad mize that r ole, systemic barriers need to be over - come.7,13 Public health should inter face mor e with pri\u00ad mary car e medicine and dentistry, and medical and dental education is one important means of effectively impacting systems of health care to accomplish public health objectives. Medical and dental education pro- grams can strategically cr eate better communication and collaboration with the public health community by promoting core public health competencies for primary care physicians, dentists, and physician assistants. An educational alliance between public health pro\u00ad fessionals and primary car e physicians, dentists, and physician assistants will equip the Nation's health car e workfor ce for a mor e effective r esponse to public health concer ns, including health emer gencies. The events following September 11, 2001, illuminate the impor \u00ad tance of a cohesive, cooperative response from both the public health community and the health car e com\u00ad munity. Collaborations between public health and pri\u00admary care medicine and dentistry are essential to build bridges that will facilitate pr evention, rapid detec\u00ad tion, and appr opriate treatment of biological, envi\u00ad ronmental, and nuclear events that threaten the American public. These bridges will create better surveillance and assessment activities to deter mine and monitor health status indicators. The bridges will also incr ease access to health car e and decrease ad- verse health events, including diseases, disabilities, and trauma. Keynote speaker Laurie Garrett observed at the Advisory Committee meeting that the United States spends 1.3 trillion dollars on health or more than 13 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 14 De- spite this vast injection of national r esources into health care, the Nation ranks 24th in the world in disability- adjusted life expectancy. Other countries such as Canada or Japan spend far less of their GDP , yet greatly exceed the United States in health status in\u00ad dicators. Further , most of the health care spending in the United States is dir ected towards treatment and management of disease, and a substantial por \u00ad tion of health car e dollars is spent on the last 30 days of life. In comparison, less than two percent of Executi ve Summary 5 the Nation's health spending is devoted to public health.15 Clearly, the priorities for health spending in this country need to be reviewed. COLLABORA TIONS OF PUBLIC HEAL TH AND PRIMAR Y CARE MEDICINE AND DENTISTR Y Despite the gaps existing between public health professionals and primary care physicians, physician assistants, and dentists, efforts have been made to con\u00ad struct alliances between public health professionals and health care practitioners. Both public health and pri\u00ad mary care medicine address infectious diseases such as tuberculosis through prevention and treatment. Recent emerging infections such as HIV create bridges between public health and primary care medicine and dentistry, as providers are concer ned not only with tr eatment op\u00ad tions, but also with standard pr ecautions to prevent the spr ead of infections. The recent emer gence of W est Nile Virus produced collaborative efforts among public health workers and primary care medical providers in identifying this source of illness thr ough patter ns ob\u00ad served by practitioners and investigated by public health epidemiologists. Despite such collaborations, links be- tween public health and primary care medicine and dentistry often fall short of meaningful integration. In recent years, greater collaboration of public health with medicine and dentistry has been the vision and objective of or ganizations and individuals who foresee a healthier Nation enhanced by prevention-oriented and population-based health care. Reports have addressed the untapped possibilities of this collaboration and have identified models of collaborative experiments.16-21 However , the refor m of medical and dental education to create a for mal collaboration between public health and primary car e medical providers and dentists re- quires fiscal and institutional support. Although collabo\u00ad rative models exist, few training pr ograms for primary care physicians, physician assistants, or dentists have requir ed all students to obtain public health competen\u00ad cies or gain experience in clinical practice with medi\u00ad cally underserved and disadvantaged populations.22 Further , few faculty who have public health competen\u00ad cies or experience in providing health car e to the underserved and the disadvantaged are available to serve as role models for trainees.7 Nevertheless, existing models can provide important lessons for medical and dental pr ograms seeking to pr epare trainees to partici\u00ad pate more fully in community-oriented and population- based medicine and dentistry. CONCLUSIONS Current programs supported by T itle VII, section 747 ar e critical to fulfilling key public health missions: enhancing the training of br oadly competent primary care physicians, physician assistants, and dentists; in- creasing access to health car e among underserved and disadvantaged populations; and pr omoting diversity in the health pr ofessions. The need to establish a more effective alliance between public health and primary care medicine and dentistry is imperative. T itle VII, section 747 is an ideal vehicle for r eforming medical and dental education to assure that providers have cor e public health competencies needed to meet the Nation's health care needs. Not only must health car e providers be better pre- pared to r espond to bioterrorism and other emer ging health threats, but public health training for primary care medical and dental providers is an unpr ecedented opportunity to increase prevention efforts and reduce health disparities and adverse health outcomes. The goals of Healthy People 2010 \u2014to extend life expect\u00ad ancy and reduce health disparities23\u2014can be better and more rapidly achieved through public health training supported by T itle VII, section 747. Incorporating public health competencies and skills at the program level and through accrediting or ganizations is also important for long-ter m reform of health care and health outcomes. Meeting the gr owing challenges that face primary care education without under mining the effectiveness of curr ent programs r equires an annual appr opriation of $198 million, as indicated in the 2001 r eport of the Advisory Committee.2 RECOMMEND ATIONS I. TO AVOID UNDERMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT PROGRAMS , TITLE VII, SECTION 747 REQUIRES CONTINUED SUPPOR T AND AD\u00ad DITIONAL FUNDING . Title VII, section 747 has been instrumental in creating a diverse, broadly competent primary car e medicine and dentistry workforce for the Nation. Expansion of cor e Title VII, section 747 funding is needed to fulfill its pur \u00ad poses: to train a supply of primary care physi\u00ad cians, physician assistants, and dentists to provide health car e to American communities, especially to disadvantaged populations and underserved communities that might lack access otherwise, and to promote diversity among primary car e medical and dental providers. 6 Executi ve Summary Title VII, section 747 has had dramatic impacts on primary care medical and dental training and on the health care pr oviders who graduate fr om programs awarded T itle VII, section 747 funding. Medical and dental training programs funded by Title VII, section 747 have developed innova\u00ad tive curricula in HIV/AIDS, geriatrics, managed care, domestic violence, genetics, culturally com\u00ad petent care, and rural health. 3 Family medicine, general inter nal medicine, general pediatrics, physician assistant, and general and pediatric dentistry programs have developed and ex\u00ad panded due to T itle VII, section 747 support. T itle VII, section 747 has also helped increase primary care r esearch, which makes primary care medi\u00ad cine a more attractive career option for residents and improves the quality of primary car e among patients.3 Primary care medicine, physician assistant, and dentistry pr ograms supported by T itle VII, section 747 have emphasized service of their graduates in medically underserved communities and among disadvantaged populations. In 1998, 42-56 per - cent of graduates of these programs entered prac\u00ad tice in underserved communities, compared to a mean of 10 percent of U.S. health professions graduates overall. Further , data for 1998 indicate that 35-50 percent of graduates of programs sup- ported by T itle VII, section 747 repr esented mi\u00ad nority or disadvantaged groups, compar ed to a 10 per cent minority r epresentation among the U.S. health pr ofessions workforce overall.1 Evi\u00ad dence indicates that these graduates are five times more likely to practice among underserved com\u00ad munities and disadvantaged populations.6 Contin\u00ad ued institutional and fiscal support is needed to sustain these achievements of increased health care access and increased pr oportions of minorities in the health pr ofessions. II. TRAINING AND EDUCA TION TO DEVELOP ES\u00ad SENTIAL PUBLIC HEAL TH COMPETENCIES SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED FOR ALL PRIMAR Y CARE MEDICINE , DENTISTRY , AND PHYSICIAN ASSIST ANT PROGRAMS SUPPOR TED BY TITLE VII, SECTION 747. To prepare a health car e workfor ce to r espond more ef fectively to ongoing health concer ns and public health emer \u00ad gencies, public health training needs to become a part of primary care medicine, physician assistant, and dentistry education. T o facilitate development of these competencies, programs should initiate the following activities: A. Define minimal competencies needed for providers to respond to popula\u00ad tion-based health concer ns, including bioterr velop these competencies; and estab\u00adlish procedur es for assessing these competencies in trainees. To help guide programs, a list of \"Cor e Competencies in Disease Prevention and Health Promotion for Under graduate Medical Education\" has been established by the Medical School Objectives Project, convened by the Association of Ameri\u00ad can Medical Colleges. 24 Similarly, the Ameri\u00ad can Dental Education Association has devel\u00adoped a list of cor e competencies that incorporates community-based health educa\u00ad tion and pr omotion competencies needed by dentists entering practice. 25 B. Develop educational modules to help train primary care physicians, physician assistants, and dentists to respond to public health concer ns, including bio\u00ad terrorism and other emer ging health problems. Educational modules and simula\u00ad tions are important tools for applied lear ning and dissemination of increasingly complex sub\u00ad ject content. T o prepare students for events that can only be anticipated, such methods create virtual appr oximations of actual events. C. Encourage collaboration of Federally funded programs training public health professionals and T itle VII, section 747- funded pr ograms training primary care medical and dental providers. Interdis\u00ad ciplinary ef forts that cross traditional program boundaries are important for creating needed bridges between public health and primary care. Such collaborations serve as models and maximize effectiveness of public funds. D. Encourage resear ch between public health faculty and medical and dental faculty to facilitate collaborative prac\u00ad tices in primary car e medicine and den\u00ad tistry. Cross-disciplinary collaborations model and facilitate alliances between public health and primary care and illustrate inter discipli\u00ad nary teams, syner gies, and best use of joint resources. E. Create leadership training courses that focus on developing alliances between public health and pri mary care medicine Executi ve Summary 7 and dentistry . Leadership is r equisite for facilitating change within training pr ograms and communities. Faculty and trainees skilled in facilitating and leading alliances between public health and primary car e medicine and dentistry ar e needed to ensure successful col\u00ad laborations. F. Develop incentives for r ecruitment, de\u00ad velopment, and support of faculty who have training and experience in public health and who have pr ovided health care to underserved communities and disadvantaged populations. Public health-oriented faculty are needed to serve as role models for trainees and to develop cur \u00ad ricula that utilize their expertise and experi\u00ad ence, yet studies indicate various difficulties involved in recruiting and r etaining clinician- educators.26-27 G. Encourage faculty development pr o- grams that link primary care medical and dental faculty with the public health community. Lifelong lear ning and institutional support for faculty are considered important characteristics of quality medical education programs.28To develop faculty who have public health competencies and who can model those competencies for trainees, fac\u00ad ulty development should include opportunities for community-based and population-based practice. H. Ensure that public health training for primary care physicians, physician as\u00ad sistants, and dentists is both didactic (classr oom based) and experiential (ap\u00ad plied). Educational methods instilling public health competencies need to be both class-room based and field based. Students lear n by observing and doing, not just by hearing. Faculty development should also include both classroom and field experiences to enhance faculty's public health knowledge. I. Encourage accr editing bodies to de\u00ad velop measur es that ensure up-to-date public health training for all levels of learners (i.e., students, r esidents, fac\u00ad ulty, incentives curr ently en-courage primary car e medical and dental edu\u00ad cation programs to incorporate public health into their curricula. However , policies can of\u00ad fer those incentives.7 Requiring public health competencies for pr ogram accreditation would compel medical and dental pr ograms to imple\u00ad ment coursework and clinical requirements into their training. J. Encourage collaborations with pro- grams funded by sources other than Title VII, section 747. Many programs that fall outside the purview of T itle VII, section 747 ar e involved in public health at some level, including social work and legal professions pr o- grams. T itle VII, section 747 programs should seek collaborations with these programs, some of which provide models of inter disciplinary efforts, such as those achieved in preven\u00ad tive medicine r esidencies and bioinfor matics programs. III. ALL PRIMAR Y CARE PHYSICIANS , DENTISTS , AND PHYSICIAN ASSIST ANTS SHOULD BE EDU\u00ad CATED AND TRAINED IN KNOWLEDGE MANAGE \u00ad MENT USING INFORMA TION TECHNOLOGY TO ACCESS AND COMMUNICA TE INFORMA TION ABOUT PUBLIC HEAL TH ISSUES . As more infor \u00ad mation becomes available on the W eb, primary care providers and dentists need to be able to ac\u00ad cess and use this infor systems enhance surveillance, coor dination of patient car e, and management of emer ging public health issues within communities. They can be used to track patients, maintain disease r egistries, and electr onically submit r eports of r eportable ill\u00ad nesses. Further , the Inter net and e-mail ar e ideal for communicating and disseminating infor mation. IV. EXAMPLES OF TITLE VII, SECTION 747 PRO- GRAMS THAT SUCCESSFULL Y TRAIN PROVID \u00ad ERS WITH BROAD PUBLIC HEAL TH COMPETEN \u00ad CIES SHOULD BE WIDEL Y DISSEMINA TED TO COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST . The Health Re- sources and Services Administration should iden\u00ad tify and disseminate infor mation about pr ograms that successfully produce trainees demonstrating strong public health competencies. Model train\u00ad ing programs having successful public health out- comes illustrate what approaches work best and what problems must be overcome. 8 Summary Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress 9 ADVISOR Y COMMITTEE REPOR T TO THE SECRET ARY OF THE U.S. DEP ARTMENT OF HEAL TH AND HUMAN SER VICES AND T O CONGRESS DELIVERING THE GOOD: IMPRO VING THE PUBLIC 'S HEALTH BY ENHANCING THE PRIMAR Y CARE/PUBLIC HEALTH INTERF ACE IN THE UNITED STATES INTR ODUCTION Title VII, section 747 has been instrumental in cr e\u00ad ating a supply of diverse, br oadly competent primary care physicians, physician assistants, and dentists in the United States. Since 1976, with the enactment of the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act, T itle VII funding has supported the development and ex\u00adpansion of training pr ograms for primary car e medi\u00ad cine and dentistry, especially to increase health car e access for medically underserved communities and dis\u00adadvantaged populations. Support fr om T itle VII, sec\u00ad tion 747 has also been important for health profes\u00ad sions experiencing critical shortages of both pr oviders and faculty for training programs (e.g., dentistry) and for pr omoting and increasing racial and ethnic diver \u00ad sity among primary care physicians, physician assis\u00ad tants, and dentists. TITLE VII, SECTION 747: FULFILLING CRITICAL MISSIONS Studies indicate that primary care medical and den\u00ad tal pr ograms supported by T itle VII, section 747 have successfully fulfilled goals of this legislation and that correlations exist between graduates of programs funded by Title VII, section 747 and incr eases in desired out- comes. 29-31 Providers graduating from T itle VII, section 747 programs outper form graduates of all U.S. pri\u00ad mary care medical and dental training programs in key ways: Title VII, section 747 graduates ar e four to five times more likely (42-56 percent versus 10 per cent) to work in medically underserved communities.1 Title VII, section 747 graduates are three to five times more likely (35-50 percent versus 10 percent) to come from underrepr esented minorities or dis\u00ad advantaged groups.1 Further , providers who attended pr ograms funded by Title VII, section 747 have higher rates of desired practice outcomes than those who attended pr ograms not funded by T itle VII, section 747: Graduates of T itle VII, section 747 programs are 17 per cent more likely to choose primary car e spe\u00ad cialties (36.3 per cent versus 30.9 per cent).29 Students of T itle VII, section 747 pr ograms ar e 55 percent mor e likely to choose family practice spe\u00ad cialties (15.8 per cent versus 10.2 percent.29 Family physicians graduating from both medical school and r esidency pr ograms funded by T itle VII, section 747 ar e 20 percent mor e likely to practice in impoverished areas (11.9 percent versus 9.9 percent) and 12 percent more likely to practice in rural communities (24.5 per cent versus 21.8 per - cent) than those attending a medical school and resi\u00ad dency not funded by T itle VII, section 747.31 Title VII, section 747 has also helped accomplish other important objectives: Medical and dental training programs funded by T itle VII, section 747 have developed innovative curricula in HIV/AIDS, geriatrics, managed care, domestic violence, genetics, culturally competent car e, and rural health. This funding has been perhaps the most important vehicle for structural changes in training pr ograms, including demonstration pro- grams such as the Inter disciplinary Generalist Cur \u00ad riculum and Under graduate Medical Education for the 21 st Century.3 Title VII, section 747 has helped to support dental education at a time when the Nation is experienc\u00ad ing a critical shortage of dental faculty. This short- age threatens the futur e of dental education and access to dentistry.32-33 10 Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress Family medicine, general inter nal medicine, and general pediatrics programs have expanded, lar gely due to T itle VII, section 747 support. Similarly, physician assistant programs, which have developed with the help of funding fr om T itle VII, section 747, are training highly skilled health care providers who are integral to the health car e delivery system. Fur \u00ad ther, dental training pr ograms, both general and pediatric, have expanded and grown with the assis\u00adtance of T itle VII, section 747 support. 3 Title VII, section 747 has also been responsible for an incr ease in resear ch opportunities in primary care medicine. Research fellows completing their train\u00ading in family medicine, general inter nal medicine, and general pediatrics have incr eased in number and quality due to T itle VII, section 747 support. These expanding levels of resear ch help make primary car e medicine a mor e attractive career option for resi\u00ad dents and also impr ove the quality of primary care among patients. 3 Continued fiscal support is needed to sustain these achievements of increased health car e access, increased proportions of minorities in the health pr ofessions, and expansion and development of needed primary car e medical and dental pr ograms. TITLE VII, SECTION 747: IMPR OVING ACCESS Access to health care and preventive services is criti\u00ad cal for impr oving the health of all Americans and espe\u00ad cially for reducing health disparities among population groups. In addition to geographic, financial, or struc\u00ad tural barriers to health care, personal and cultural bar \u00ad riers such as language or ethnicity often pr ohibit ac\u00ad cess to health care. Title VII, section 747 has supported increased di\u00ad versity among health car e professionals and among faculty who train providers. This increased diversity in turn facilitates cultural competence and helps over come barriers to health car e for minority and disadvantaged populations. 4 According to the 2000 census, minori\u00ad ties repr esent 25 per cent of the Nation's population.5 Minority physicians are five times more likely than non- minority physicians to provide care for medi cally underserved and vulnerable populations. These popula\u00ad tions ar e often sicker , poor er, and mor e disadvantaged than patients served by non-minority physicians.6 Incentives, including financial ones, have often been needed to facilitate access to health care in rural and underserved communities or among the disadvantaged.7 Further , an estimated 44.3 million people (mor e than 15 per cent of the U.S. population under age 65) have no health insurance, and millions mor e have inadequate health car e coverage.8 These under -insur ed populations also need access to health car e. In addition to incr easing the number of clinicians who practice in medically under - served communities and among disadvantaged popu la\u00ad tions, clinical training programs supported by T itle VII, section 747 provide direct care to medically underserved communities and disadvantaged populations. Many challenges must be over come before parity of health outcomes can be achieved for all U.S. popu\u00ad lations. Support for T itle VII, section 747 remains criti\u00ad cal for expanding access to health car e and increasing diversity of primary car e providers. TITLE VII, SECTION 747: IMPR OVING PREP AREDNESS FOR HEAL TH EMERGENCIES Despite the successes of T itle VII, section 747 pro- grams in str engthening the Nation's primary care ca\u00ad pacity, the health emer gencies following September 11, 2001, served as a wake-up call to alert Americans to national health vulnerabilities. As with past health events such as the first cases of AIDS, the health emer \u00ad gencies of 2001 can be viewed as sentinel events sig\u00ad naling emer ging health thr eats. These events sounded another alar m that became obvious with the r ecogni\u00ad tion of a potential anthrax epidemic: a critical need for more cohesion and alliance of the U.S. health care and public health systems. Inefficiencies in responses to these health emer gen\u00ad cies indicate a critical need for incr eased communica\u00ad tion and collaboration between public health profes\u00ad sionals and the health car e workfor ce, particularly primary car e providers. These providers serve on the frontlines of health car e and interact with two-thir ds of all Americans, mor e than any other type of clinician.9 One of the lessons lear ned from these unpr ec\u00ad edented events is that adequate preparedness to handle such emer gencies is necessary to protect the health of the American public. The Nation must pr epare a health care workforce that can respond effectively and ef fi\u00ad ciently to public health concer ns, including emer and emer ging health community-oriented and population-based pr evention of chr onic and acute illnesses. This pr eparation entails joint ef forts and a com\u00ad mon core of knowledge among public health pr ofessionals Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress 11 and primary car e providers, who are usually \"first re\u00ad sponders\" who identify and manage cases r esulting from public health emer gencies. The Nation's disadvantaged and underserved populations, those most likely to be served by T itle VII, section 747 pr ograms and gradu\u00ad ates, are also the populations most vulnerable during medical emer gencies because of their lack of resour ces and lack of access to care. Training is key to pr eparedness. T itle VII, section 747 is an ideal mechanism for educating primary car e providers in public health competencies, facilitating population-based and community-based skills and train\u00ad ing, and increasing the alliance between public health and primary car e providers. 2002 MEETING OF THE AD VISOR Y COMMITTEE To consider ways in which T itle VII, section 747 can help prepar e a primary care medical and dental workforce that inter faces mor e effectively with public health, the Advisory Committee on T raining in Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry (ACTPCMD) met in W ash\u00ad ington, D.C., on May 13-14, 2002. Six speakers at this meeting made pr esentations to the Committee to provide a context in which to consider medical and dental education that facilitates collaborations with pub\u00adlic health (See Appendix A). During the meeting, three break-out workgroups spent many hours addressing issues of refor m of medical and dental education to enhance the alliance between public health and pri\u00ad mary care medicine and dentistry. The workgroups each focused on public health training strategies for one of the following topics: increasing access, using inter dis\u00ad ciplinary teams, and addressing acute and chr onic health issues. (See Appendices B,C, and D.) The ideas and recommendations emer ging fr om this meeting and fr om the workgroups for m the basis of this report. THE COMPELLING NEED FOR AN ENHANCED ALLIANCE BETWEEN PUBLIC HEAL TH AND PRIMAR Y CARE MEDICINE AND DENTISTR Y Former Sur geon General Dr . David Satcher stressed in his pr esentation to the Committee that the events following September 11, 2001, mor e than anything else in recent history, r evealed weaknesses in the pub\u00ad lic health infrastructur e. This infrastructure, as defined by Satcher , has thr ee key components: public health practitioners at the local, State, and national level; pri\u00ad mary care and other health practitioners who pr ovide medical care to individuals; and the public, whose need to know when and how to r espond to health threats is more critical than ever . 10 Only by working together to maximize knowledge and resources will the Nation's health care providers and public health pr ofessionals be best able to protect and enhance the health of all citizens. As one workgroup stated, rich or poor , young or old, no one can hide from the health threats facing us today. 11 The future of public health and of primary care medicine and den\u00adtistry depends on a broad understanding of the major challenges facing the health of populations in the twenty-first century. 12 Over a quarter of a century ago, Higher Education for Public Health stated that \"public health activities change with changing technology and social values, but the goals r emain the same: to reduce the amount of disease, pr emature death and disease-produced dis\u00ad comfort and disability.\"12 With the incr eases in scien\u00ad tific knowledge, emer ging health threats, risks fr om environmental pollutants, awareness of factors impact\u00ad ing physical and psychological health, and shifting para\u00ad digms of approaches to disease control and preven\u00ad tion, America's health needs and priorities continue to be in a state of flux. The public health infrastructur e must also adapt to exter nal for ces if it is to continue to protect and impr ove the public's health. Healthy People 2010 defines the public health in\u00ad frastructure as \"the resources needed to deliver the es\u00ad sential health services to every community ....\"34 Es\u00ad sential health care is not limited to making sur e that everyone who is ill has access to a physician. The pub\u00ad lic health appr oach seeks to pr event illness and thus circumvent the need for many visits to physicians. More collaborative efforts of primary car e and public health will str engthen the public health infrastructure so that it is better pr epared to respond to health emer gen\u00ad cies, emer ging illnesses, and acute and chronic health problems. The 1988 Institute of Medicine r eport, The Futur e of Public Health , identified three \"core functions\" of public health, also referred to in Healthy People 2010 : assessment, which includes surveillance activities to measure health status; policy development, which en- compasses r egulations and laws needed to protect the public's health; and assurance of access, which entails provision of health care, a critical component in achiev\u00ad ing and maintaining a healthy Nation. 34 12 Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress Access to health car e is possible only thr ough a com\u00ad mitment of suf ficient resour ces to train an adequate supply of primary care providers who can deliver care. Access to health car e for underserved communities and disadvantaged populations is possible only through a commitment by primary care medical pr oviders and dentists to serve these communities and populations. Securing and sustaining a supply of providers who can provide health car e, especially to the underserved and the disadvantaged, has been a major objective of T itle VII, section 747. Although the missions of public health and primary care medicine and dentistry are to enhance the health of the Nation, these health professions have had seem\u00adingly different objectives for almost a century. As Pulitzer prize-winning author Laurie Garr ett stated in her ad- dress to the Advisory Committee, \"The task now is to figure out wher e the lines [between primary care and public health] ar e and how everything is r eally defined\u2014 not how they have come to be defined inaccurately and mistakenly in the latter half of the twentieth cen\u00ad tury, but what constitutes appr opriate definitions of primary car e and public health as we go into the twenty- first century.\" 15 As Garr ett observed, the United States spends 1.3 trillion dollars on health or more than 13 per cent of the Gr oss Domestic Product (GDP).14 Despite this vast injection of national resour ces into health car e, the Nation ranks 24th in the world in disability-adjusted life expectancy. Other countries such as Canada or Japan spend far less of their GDP , yet gr eatly exceed the United States in health status indicators. Further , most of the health care spending in the United States is di\u00ad rected towar ds treatment and management of disease, and a substantial portion of health care dollars is spent on the last 30 days of life. In comparison, less than two percent of the Nation's health spending is devoted to public health. Public health interventions have been the main r eason for increased life expectancy, yet most U.S. health dollars ar e spent elsewhere.15 Clearly, the priorities for health spending in this country need to be reviewed. Despite gaps between public health and primary car e medicine and dentistry, constructive alliances have been formed. Historically, infectious diseases such as tuber \u00ad culosis have gained the attention of both public health and primary care medicine and dentistry because of a need for both treatment and rigor ous pr evention. Re- cent emer ging infections such as HIV have resulted in bridges between public health and primary care medi\u00adcine and dentistry, as providers ar e concer ned not only with treat ment options, but also with standar d precau\u00ad tions to pr event the spread of infections. The recent emergence of W est Nile V irus pr oduced collaborative efforts among public health and primary care medical providers in identifying this sour ce of illness through patter ns observed by health care practitioners and in\u00ad vestigated by public health epidemiologists. In addition, economic disparities in dental health have pr ompted public health interventions to expand dental car e, es\u00ad pecially for children. According to the American Den\u00ad tal Education Association, \"Oral health is increasingly perceived as an important aspect of overall health, and the evidence of a connection between oral and sys\u00adtemic diseases is gr owing.\" 32 Even with successful collaborations, links between public health and primary car e medicine and dentistry often fall short of meaningful integration. A mor e ex\u00ad tensive and systematic inter face between public health and primary car e medicine and dentistry is needed. T itle VII, section 747 can help foster this collaborative en\u00ad terprise between primary car e and public health at the most fundamental level\u2014education and training. TITLE VII, SECTION 747: READ YING THE NA TION'S HEAL TH CARE WORKFORCE Public Health Emer gency Pr eparedness: A Policy Primer examines central questions r egarding the Nation's public health system in the wake of Septem\u00ad ber 2001: \"Who should be r esponsible for providing a public health r esponse in the event of an emer gency? What r esour ces ar e needed to be prepared? How can the nation ensure an adequate r eturn on its investments in public health?\"35 This National Health Policy Forum publication str esses that preparation for health emer \u00ad gencies such orism esponse activities: r egulation of envir onmental conditions and food and water supplies, plans for emer \u00ad gency medical and public health eaks of illnesses, epidemiological inves\u00ad tigations of diseases, and laboratory analysis in support of surveillance and epidemiology. The majority of these activities involve coor dinating efforts, training the pub\u00ad lic and private sectors for impr oved prepar edness, and building partnerships among important constituents, including primary care medicine and public health. 36 Bioterrorism has highlighted the potential, the impor \u00ad tance, and, indeed, the necessity of joint efforts of health care practitioners, the public health sector , and the public. Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress 13 Primary care providers and dentists ar e integral to the development of an effective public health infrastruc\u00ad ture in the United States. They interact with the public on a direct basis, are the source of r eports used for surveillance, and are usually the first to note unusual patter ns of disease and illness. They also act as impor\u00ad tant channels for communication of medical infor ma\u00ad tion and are ideally situated to mediate health concer ns among public health pr ofessionals, the public, policymakers, and administrators. Effective collaboration between public health pro\u00ad fessionals and primary car e medical and dental provid\u00ad ers entails systemic changes to facilitate that collabora\u00adtion. Public health needs to better understand the challenges facing primary care physicians, physician assistants, and dentists, and these health professionals need more public health skills. Currently, most primary care medical and dental pr oviders receive little train\u00ad ing in public health or community-based health care. Further , as noted by Dr . Nicole Lurie, more faculty and clinical role models who are committed to pub\u00ad lic health objectives in their practices and teaching are needed. W ithout such models to illustrate and teach public health practices, students and r esidents repeat the prevailing models. 7 However , recruiting and r etaining clinician-educators are difficult because of the traditional demands of r esear ch expected of faculty and the lack of parity between faculty sala\u00adries and clinical practice incomes. 26-27 Programs that train primary care medical and dental pr oviders es\u00ad tablish professional priorities and critical competen\u00ad cies that providers ar e expected to have as they go into practice. The current landscape of health and health threats in America indicates the wisdom and necessity of expending ef forts and resources to in\u00ad clude public health competencies in medical and den\u00adtal education. MODELS OF COLLABORA TION OF PUBLIC HEAL TH AND PRIMAR Y CARE MEDICINE/DENTISTR Y The need for greater collaboration of public health and medicine has been the focus of many or ganiza\u00ad tions and individuals who have a vision of a healthier Nation enhanced by prevention-oriented and popula\u00adtion-based health care. Reports have addressed the untapped potential of this collaboration and have iden\u00ad tified useful models of collaboration between public health and primary care medicine or dentistry. While agreement is unanimous regar ding the immense ben\u00adefits that r esult fr om the inter face of primary care and public health, consensus is fragmented r egarding the kinds of partnerships needed to enable a successful unification of primary car e and public health.37 According to r ecent studies, the model of medical training in academic health centers needs r eform if these centers are to r emain competitive and effective in a changing health car e delivery system, especially with managed car e. Health car e in teaching hospitals is more expensive than care in non-teaching hospitals, and payers assume only a portion of this incr eased cost. Thus, training programs ar e faced with addressing fi\u00ad nancial constraints while maintaining their missions of quality teaching, research, and clinical car e. 38-40 Stud\u00ad ies also indicate the need for health car e training pro- grams to be mor e diverse, more population-based, and more community-oriented, including the need to in- corporate and rewar d community physicians as faculty members.26, 41-42 The events following September 11, 2001, have made imperative the creation of more structur ed and institutionalized collaborations between public health and primary car e and have placed this agenda in the forefront of medical and dentistry training. Although collaborative models exist, few medical or dental pro-grams have r equired all their students to obtain public health competencies or to gain experience in clinical practice with underserved communities and disadvan\u00ad taged populations. 22 Further , few faculty have public health competencies or experience in providing health care to the underserved and the disadvantaged.7 Nev\u00ad ertheless, existing models can pr ovide important les\u00ad sons for medical and dental programs seeking to pre- pare trainees to appr oach patients both as individuals and as members of a community and/or population group. Summarized below are r eports of lessons lear ned and best practices in collaborative efforts at the na\u00ad tional, State, and/or community level and in medical and dental education: King's Fund Symposium on Primary Care and Public Health As Ros Levenson and Lucy Johnson observe, pri\u00ad mary car e providers \"ar e generally committed to im\u00ad proving health in their communities, but they ar e hav\u00ad ing to cope with enor mous workloads in their for mative stages.\"43 The 1999 King's Fund Symposium met to examine the relationship of primary car e and public health, including the opportunities and problems in 14 Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress developing proficiencies of primary care providers in promoting public health. At this Symposium, \"a con\u00ad viction [emer ged] that it was not a huge step from look\u00ad ing at the health of a practice population to wider is- sues of public health across practices. However , this optimism was tempered with a sense of realism about the complexity of issues and the competing priorities for resource allocation.\" 44 The Symposium also dis\u00ad cussed and r ecommended \"the development of new and differ ent partnership models thr ough the public health research agenda . . . . [T]his should include work on the collaboration between primary car e practitio\u00ad ners and others (including the lay community) within a social model, rather than a medical one.\" 45 The pr os\u00ad pect of reframing the relationship of public health and primary care medicine on a social model entails some restructuring of the training of health pr ofessionals. The Symposium also agreed that \"or ganizational support is essential for the ef fective implementation of new r oles and r esponsibilities in primary care.\"46 Medicine/Public Health Initiative The American Medical Association (AMA) supports the integration of public health and medicine and has a section on clinical and public health practice and out- comes and a Public/Private Partnership Subcommit\u00adtee that seeks to encourage collaborative partnerships among academic medical centers, schools of public health, and medical schools. 47 In fact, the alliance of the AMA and the American Public Health Association (APHA) illustrates perhaps one of the best examples of a collaboration of public health and medicine. Since 1994, both have been involved in the Medicine and Public Health Initiative (MPHI), which \"is devoted to the joining of Medicine and Public Health, the fields that focus r espectively on individuals' and population health, in a search to explicate problems and produce innovative solutions to deal with the health needs of the people of the United States.\" 48 The MPHI has seven major goals, excerpted below: Engaging the community Changing the education process Creating joint r esearch ef forts Developing a shared view of health and illness Working together in health care provision Jointly developing health care assessment measures Creating networks to translate Initiative ideas into actions.48 Comprised of 55 member or ganizations that include public health and medical associations and leaders in the public and private sectors, the MPHI uses small grants to encourage collaborations of public health and medicine. 18 Cooperative Actions for Health Program Linked to the MPHI ar e the Cooperative Actions for Health Pr ogram (CAHP), a grant-funded program sponsor ed by the AMA, the APHA, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF). The monograph Lessons Learned in Medicine and Public Health Collaboration indicates that the purpose of the CAHP is \"to build, support and strengthen collaboration be- tween medicine and public health to improve the health of the public.\" The program provides grants for col\u00ad laborative projects in medicine and public health, de\u00ad velops communications networks for infor mation ex- change, and identifies and collaborates on the health priorities of the AMA and APHA.49 In 1998-1999, the CAHP sponsored 19 site projects that provided three key lessons lear ned: phy\u00ad sicians need to incr ease their knowledge about public health, professionals working in public health need to know mor e about the challenges facing physicians prac\u00ad ticing medicine, and strategies and support ar e needed to sustain collaborations between public health and medicine. 50 The New Y ork Academy of Medicine evaluated the CAHP and recommended the following guidelines for both public health and medicine to pursue to help es\u00ad tablish an effective alliance between them: \"Promote the adoption of or ganizational policies to support ongoing relationships\" among public health affiliates (PHAs) and medical societies (MSs) and among these or ganizations and community public health agencies. \"Reduce the curr ent between f/officers of PHAs and MSs in medicine/ public health/community collaborations.\" \"Be patient\u2014relationships take time to build!\"51 Lessons Learned in Medicine and Public Health Collaboration also stresses that \"as the U.S. health care system has developed, there have been few in\u00ad centives for collaboration and interaction between medicine and public health.\" 52 Further , health care Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress 15 systems have perhaps unconsciously cr eated barriers to collaborative ef forts. T o transfor m these barriers into bridges, incentives are needed.13, 18, 52 These motiva\u00ad tors may include policy changes, innovative curricula and training for health car e professionals, and col\u00ad laborative assistance that increases proficiencies in primary care medicine and dentistry. Further , form\u00ad ing collaborations is only one part of the desired objective. These partnerships also need to be sus- tained.51 Ther efore, any collaborative initiative should consider long-ter m as well as short-ter m planning and outcomes. Florida Medicine-P ublic Health Initiative In addition to a national Medicine/Public Health Ini\u00ad tiative, many States have a State-level Initiative. For example, the Florida Medicine-Public Health Initiative was begun when the Florida Medical Association re\u00adceived a grant from the RWJF . The Initiative conducted focus groups in four Florida r egions and then convened a Florida Medicine-Public Health Summit attended by members of various stakeholders, including academi\u00ad cians, public and private health care providers, and State legislators. These delegates developed and supported a set of \"Summit Priorities and Recommendations,\" summarized as follows: Encourage more collaboration of medicine and pub\u00ad lic health, both in communities and medical educa\u00ad tion. Provide communications and infor mation to em- power individuals to make decisions about their health. Promote increased access to health care thr ough collaboration of medicine, public health, and the community. Develop medical and public health leadership to improve the health of Florida's populace. In carrying out its objectives, the Florida Medicine- Public Health Initiative fosters collaborative efforts within the context of the State's economic, health, and legis\u00ad lative environments. 53 Models of Medicine and Public Health Collaboration Project Dr. Roz Lasker , in the monograph Medicine and Public Health: The Power of Collaboration , reports on public health and medicine collaborations identified through solicited requests for infor mation about such collaborations fr om medical and public tions, gover officials, and participants in founda\u00ad tion-sponsor ed pr ojects. Responses resulted in a data- base of 414 collaborations between medicine and public health entities and/or other community or ganizations. Upon analysis of this database, the collaborations were organized and categorized accor ding to six different \"syner gies\" that illustrate a variety of innovative ap\u00ad proaches to medical/public health collaborations. 54 The monograph and an electronic version of the Pocket Guide to Cases of Medicine and Public Health Collaboration describe these six syner gies: \"Impr oving health car e by care with individual-level support services\" \"Impr oving access to car e by establishing frame- works to pr ovide care for the un- or underinsured\" \"Improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of care by applying a population perspective to medical practice\" \"Using clinical practice to identify and address com\u00admunity health problems\" \"Strengthening health promotion and health pro\u00ad tection by mobilizing community campaigns\" \"Shaping the futur e direction of the health system by collaborating ar ound health system policy, health professions training, and health-related r esearch.\"55-56 The sixth syner gy includes models of collaborative efforts in training, education, and research in the health care professions. These models include the following kinds of collaborations in medical education and training: Incorporation of \"a cr oss-sectoral perspective . . . in the curriculum of health professions degree pro- grams\" Establishment of dual-degree programs, such as those providing MD/MPH degr ees Establishment of for mal ties between programs of medical and public health education Establishment of connections between \"medical and public health practice sites and/or other or ganiza\u00ad tions in the br oader community\" Provision of \"cross-sectoral education or training\" to pr ofessionals \"opportunities . . collaborative confer encing.... \"56 16 Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress Lasker notes that \"while students, residents and fac\u00ad ulty in health professions institutions participate in many collaborations . . , only a portion of these cases bring the two health sectors together for the explicit purpose of impr oving education and training. Nevertheless, al\u00ad most 100 collaborations fall into this category . . . . \" She adds that most of these collaborations involve medical students and that the extent of these collabo\u00adrations varies considerably. Some programs offer stu\u00ad dents options to become involved in community-based service, to take elective public health-oriented courses, or to do r otations that provide public health exposure to students. Other pr ograms \"incorporate a broad per \u00ad spective in the school's mission or structure, instituting courses, r otations, or practica that are required of all students.\" 22 Programs that integrate public health into their curricula prescribe a set of competencies for all students and indicate their commitment to a medicine/ public health alliance. Roadmaps to Clinical Practice Recognizing the critical need for partnerships be- tween health care practitioners and public health pro\u00adfessionals, the AMA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have collaborated to create a se\u00ad ries of monographs for physicians and other health car e providers. The series, entitled Roadmaps to Clinical Practice , provides practical guidance to medical prac\u00ad titioners for incorporating disease prevention and health promotion into their medical car e. 57 The first mono- graph in the series, entitled Primer on Population- Based Medicine , suggests that impr ovements in the Nation's health can be achieved \"thr ough pr evention activities in the physician's office and the community.\" It adds, \"A population-based perspective, whether con\u00adsidered at the medical practice or community level, is especially helpful when addressing chronic disease management . . . . Physicians need to identify and ad- dress factors in the patient's family and community that contribute to enhance their patient's primary care treat\u00ad ment.\"58 The monographs address the need to maxi\u00ad mize delivery of services.57 Medical Schools Objectives Pr oject Although health pr ofessions training pr ograms ar e beginning to incorporate preventive medicine into their curricula, a survey conducted by the Association of Teachers of Pr eventive Medicine and the Health Re- sources and Services Administration (HRSA) revealed many gaps, especially in population-based health.59 In 1997, these or ganizations convened a task force of medical educators to help plan desired educational com\u00ad ponents needed to foster the knowledge and, mor e importantly, the application of pr eventive medicine in health professions students and residents. This task force recommended strategies for medical schools to add or enhance pr evention in their curricula, to encourage proficiency of students in pr eventive medicine, and to ensure training and development of faculty in preven\u00adtive medicine. This group also composed a list of 12 core competencies or minimum expected outcomes in prevention for under graduate medical education. These core competencies include clinical pr evention training as well as quantitative skills. The Association of Ameri\u00ad can Medical Colleges recommends that students of all medical schools know how to apply pr evention strate\u00ad gies in their practices. 60 These recommended compe\u00ad tencies pr ovide a basis for consistent prevention train\u00ad ing for all students in health professions. Turning Point Turning Point is a national initiative that seeks to build and alter the public health infrastructure. It is \"founded on the idea that diverse groups working to\u00adgether can better identify and influence the deter mi\u00ad nants of health.\" 61 Created by the W . K. Kellogg Foun\u00ad dation (WKKF) and the R WJF, Turning Point works at the community level, \"building broad community sup-port and participation in public health priority-setting and action.\" 62 The partnerships fostered by T urning Point's activities have helped maximize the resour ces of the constituents involved. Accor ding to What T urn\u00ad ing Point T ells Us: Implications for National Policy , \"Turning Point's small financial investment in commu\u00ad a big retur n.\" Further ,\"Part\u00ad nerships expanded participation in and ownership of public health and br oadened the very definition of pub\u00ad lic health, as reflected in mor e in-depth assessments of community needs and health, incr eased capacity, and policy and or ganizational change in T urning Point T urning Point's contri\u00ad butions to public health indicates the potential benefits of collaboration in communities using inter disciplinary approaches and gaining grassr oots support for a pub\u00ad lic health agenda. In 2001, in W ashington, D.C., the T urning Point Forum convened constituents who had been awar ded grants to rural, urban, and tribal communities in 14 States. At that meeting, Barbara Sabol, T urning Point program dir ector for the WKKF , stressed the increas\u00ad ing importance of building public health capacity in our health care system: \"The principle that everybody Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress 17 has a stake in public health is now well established and will affect public health and policies in the future.\"64 Although Sabol assumes a vast acknowledgement of the importance of public health, the gaps in our public health infrastructur e and in the lack of adequate public health training in medical and dental education sug\u00ad gest otherwise. The construction of public health ca\u00ad pacity must be strategic and sustained. The T urning Point community partnerships exem\u00ad plify best practices that can be used as role models for the Nation. One such example is Cheryl Boyce's story of the origins of the Ohio Commission of Minority Health. As the head of a State task force on Minority Health, she was asked in 1986 to deter mine the rea\u00ad son for health disparities between Ohio's minority and majority populations. When she failed to discover the answers in quantitative statistics, she used qualitative methods and asked 2,000 local citizens \"about their community pr oblems and solutions.\" She discovered \"ineffective pr ograms, fragmented health car e and money allocated without assessing public health needs.\" As a result of her findings, Ohio shifted its focus from treatment to pr evention of disease and for med the Ohio Commission on Minority Health, which \"exists to insti\u00ad tutionalize culturally appropriate health promotion and disease prevention pr ograms.\" 65 Boyce's experience reveals the importance of including individuals and or \u00ad ganizations in local communities as stakeholders in collaborative efforts between public health and primary care medicine and dentistry. Best Practices in Dental Education Numerous barriers to dental health car e exist. In fact, Oral Health in America: A Report of the Sur \u00ad geon General indicates the extent of gaps in access to dental care, especially among those who have little or no dental insurance. 66 To overcome barriers in dental health care, dental schools need \"to pr ovide an educa\u00ad tional experience that exposes students to a wide array of clinical experience while expanding access to car e for underserved populations.\" 67 These experiences pre- pare students to be mor e culturally sensitive and in- crease the likelihood that they will later work with vul\u00ad nerable populations or underserved communities. The r eport Best Practices in Dental Education 2001 notes, \"eliminating the marked oral health dis\u00ad parities present in many populations will necessitate the combined efforts of academic institutions and com\u00ad munity-based or ganizations.\" 67 This r eport summarizes the challenges faced by schools of dentistry as they prepar e their students to enter practice. These chal\u00adlenges include \"expectations of the parent institution and the practicing community, meeting the needs of the underserved, utilizing infor mation technology most effectively, and ensuring adequate numbers of quali\u00ad fied faculty to meet the teaching, resear ch, and service mission of the dental school . .\"68 Despite these chal\u00ad lenges, a number of dental programs have incorpo\u00ad rated public health into their mission and into the train\u00ad ing of their students. For example, the Boston University School of Den\u00ad tal Medicine illustrates the integration of community- based education into the dental curriculum. Students receive instruction in communications and ethics along with their dental training. During their Applied Profes\u00ad sional Experience, they ar e paired with practicing den\u00ad tists who serve as mentors while students gain clinical practice as their mentors' dental assistants. As the stu\u00ad dents acquir e clinical knowledge, they begin to provide dental car e in community clinics. They may serve in sites pr oviding dental care to underserved populations, including community health centers, hospital dental clin\u00ad ics, or school-based clinics. The pr ogram is deemed successful because of a committed network of faculty members based in the communities. The program's positive outcomes include exposing dental students to patients in underserved ar eas, increasing the number of students who later practice in underserved ar eas, and pr omoting resear ch in dentistry.67 Another exemplary dental program with public health in its mission is the University of Connecticut School of Dentistry, which is the major pr ovider of dental care for children eligible for Medicaid in Con\u00adnecticut. The school also serves Medicaid-eligible adults, children enr olled in Headstart programs, and handi\u00ad capped adults in central Connecticut. This program reports an annual 50,000 visits for all dental patients served by the School in its clinics. 69 Other dental pr ograms, such as those at the Louisi\u00ad ana State University Health Sciences Center School of Dentistry, the Medical University of South Carolina College of Dental Medicine, and the University of Iowa School of Dentistry, provide community-based care through mobile dental clinics. These mobile units at- tempt to over come access barriers to dental care and are extr emely successful. Louisiana State University's Tooth Bus, for example, was booked two months in advance after operating for only six months.70 The American Dental Association awarded the University of Iowa's Geriatric Mobile Unit its prestigious Geriatric Oral Health Car e Award in 1999. This program also won an awar d the following year from the University 18 Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress of Iowa Council on Disability Awareness.71 The Mobile Dental Outreach pr ogram at the University of South Carolina reports the following goals: \"sensitizing den\u00ad tal students to oral health car e needs and concer ns of people in an underserved community setting, impr ov\u00ad ing access to dental care to multiple populations, serv\u00ading as a visible r ecruitment tool for minority students, and involving the college with health programs in an interdisciplinary setting.\" 72 Recognizing that best prac\u00ad tices in dental education include public health practices, these outreach units pr ovide applied clinical training for students and r esidents. The University of Florida (UF) College of Dentistry has been involved in community service-based training since 1977, when it began a rural clinic affiliated with the local health department in Mayo, Florida. In the early 1990s, with the development of general dentistry residency pr ograms in Jacksonville and St. Petersbur g, the College of Dentistry began pr oviding dental care to these communities fr om clinics owned and operated by the College. In 1995, with the cr eation of the Uni\u00ad versity of Florida Statewide Network for Community Oral Health, the College expanded opportunities for resident training and increased access to Florida's underserved population. The Network is a collaboration of the UF College of Dentistry, the Florida Dental Association, and com\u00ad munity-based affiliates and health car e organizations that provide education and/or health car e to underserved populations. In addition to operating three college-owned facilities, the Network provides exten\u00ad sive dental car e through various affiliates across the State, including community health centers, county public health departments, homeless shelters, and hospitals. Both r esidents and predoctoral students work in 12 sites, and the College is negotiating with additional sites that would increase access to dental car e for underserved communities. Funding for the Network is derived from various sources: T itle VII, section 747 grants; general college revenues from the State; the Florida Depart\u00adment of Health; statewide Ar ea Heath Education Cen\u00ad ters; and donations. The State Department of Health funding comes dir ectly fr om the State's dental public health ar m and links the College's programs with the State's public health infrastructure. Responding to resear ch that links low birthweight babies with untr eated periodontal disease in pregnant women, the College's newest venture, funded by the State Department of Health, is in Gadsen County, a rural community just northwest of the State capital, Tallahassee. This county has the highest incidence of low birthweight/preter m births in the State. One den\u00adtist and support staf f provide dental care fr om a two- chair dental clinic in a local community health center there. State funding will be used to develop pr oper in\u00ad frastructure to support the development of long-ter m dental car e in the community. 73 Policy Academy for State Of ficials on Improving Oral Health Care for Childr en The National Gover nors' Association (NGA), in rec\u00ad ognition of the importance of dental health and the numer ous barriers to accessing quality dental health care, authorized the Center for Best Practices to imple\u00ad ment the Policy Academy for State Officials on Im\u00adproving Oral Health Car e in Children. The first Acad\u00ad emy, initiated in 2000 and involving eight States, was so successful that two more Academies have been held, with a total of 23 States participating. The Academy brings together teams of individuals and or ganizations having an inter est in and the capacity to addr ess ac\u00ad cess to dental health care within a State. 74 An example of State involvement in the Academy is Florida's initiative to incr ease access to dental care for its childr en, in which the University of Florida's College of Dentistry participates. Florida's appr oach illustrates a typical State r esponse to the problem of access to dental car e. Key participants in Florida in\u00ad cluded the public health sector , repr esented by public health dentists employed by the State Department of Health and local county health departments, and the primary car e community, r epresented by dental mem\u00ad bers of the Florida Dental Association and dental hy\u00ad gienist members of the Florida Dental Hygiene Asso\u00ad ciation. In addition, the Florida team included educators from the State's two dental schools, policymakers from both State gover nment and academia, a r epresenta\u00ad tive fr om the State community health centers, and, most importantly, key elected of ficials from State legislative committees addr essing health care, public health fund\u00ad ing, and public health policy. To participate in the Academy, a State has to apply and demonstrate the commitment of the Gover nor and other stakeholders to find solutions to its dental health problems. Florida submitted a plan with a \"vision of the state of Florida to improve the oral health of chil\u00ad dren.\" Following Florida's acceptance and preliminary work, the NGA hosted a retr eat with team members from several States in addition to a gr oup of outside consultants who had expertise in developing and imple\u00ad menting Statewide dental health pl ans. The NGA ex\u00ad perts also pr ovided post-retreat advice and consultation. Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress 19 Prior to and following the r etreat, the Florida team met several times to develop a long-ter m strategic plan and subsequent action steps to impr ove oral health among the State's children. The plan's goals illustrate the comprehensive natur e of this approach and the value of developing such an inclusive team. Assessment, access, education, and support are all included in the State's four -prong plan: 1. Implement a Statewide oral health surveillance system. 2. Increase access to oral health care. 3. Increase community- and school-based preventive and education programs. 4. Increase community and gover nmental awareness and support.75 Best Practices in Physician Assistant Programs A number of physician assistant training pr ograms emphasize community- and population-based training and inter face with public health through their clinical practices. The pr ograms described below receive T itle VII, section 747 funding and illustrate the public health strides that can be made with that support. The physician assistant program at Stanfor d Uni\u00ad versity serves Califor nia's unique and diverse commu\u00ad nities through recruitment and clinical placements. Hav\u00ading a goal of retur ning graduates to their communities when training is completed, Stanford's pr ogram actively recruits and trains students from medically underserved communities. Based on the principle that students should be trained with the populations they will serve when they graduate, Stanford's physician assistant train\u00adees ar e assigned exclusively to community-based clini\u00ad cal rotations. Many of these clinics serve non-English-speaking, high-risk patients. Califor nia is home to more than one third of all U.S. legal per manent residents (recent immigrants and those eligible for naturalization) and to lar ge Latino and Asian populations that fre\u00ad quently lack access to health car e, have limited English proficiency, and experience high rates of poverty and unemployment. T o increase access to health car e, Stanford's physician assistant program utilizes T itle VII, section 747 funds to support clinical placements in which students pr ovide car e for r efugees, migrant workers, rural residents, and Native Americans. 76 At the University of Colorado, all physician assis\u00ad tant trainees serve in clinical rotations with medically underserved populations. Students also have an op\u00ad tion to take a rural track, which r equires a four -month block rotation in a rural setting. One quarter of the program's students elect to take this track, and 60 percent of students in this track practice in a rural area upon their graduation. The program has devel\u00ad oped innovative curricula to meet needs of rural popu\u00ad lations and has won a Colorado Commission Awar d of Excellence. 77 The University of Kentucky's physician assistant program also emphasizes rural health car e, especially for rural HIV patients. In addition to training its stu\u00ad dents, this program pr ovides training on rural HIV is- sues for practicing physician assistants nationwide through teleconfer encing. The program has also de\u00ad veloped a CD-ROM containing the didactic portion of the rural HIV health care training. Through innovative technology, this program has extended public health practice by training hundr eds of health professionals, including physicians and dentists, on HIV issues for rural patients.78 The University of W ashington's MEDEX Northwest physician assistant pr ogram serves the states of W ash\u00ad ington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. T o re\u00ad cruit students from rural communities and urban underserved clinics and to meet the needs of place- bound older students, the MEDEX pr ogram Spokane, W ashington\u2014a r egional center of small towns. Clinical placements ar e located throughout the five-state region and include commu\u00ad nity health centers, Native American r eservations, and Federally designated rural health clinics. About 40 per - cent of the graduates of MEDEX practice in medically underserved ar eas. 76 Among the youngest of the Nation's physician as\u00ad sistant programs is that of the University of New Mexico. This program has already made great strides to ad\u00advance a public health agenda in the State. Many of New Mexico's lar gely rural population lack health care access. This pr ogram has as its mission service to the State's rural and underserved populations. The first graduating class of eight students all serve these populations. Clinical r otations involve both rural and urban training, but students often work in ar eas lack\u00ad ing basic health care facilities. States one program r ep\u00ad resentative, \"One of our clinics has a P A [physician assistant] who has to r ow across a river to get to the tiny town she works in. Another has a P A who is not only the only health care practitioner , but is also 20 Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress everything else\u2014the ambulance driver , the pr ograms play an in\u00ad creasingly important r ole in providing access to health care and extending public health practice. CONCLUSIONS Title VII, section 747 should continue its pursuit of desired health outcomes for the Nation and its support for training the Nation's primary health car e workforce. Because access to health car e is a critical public health function, expansion of core T itle VII, section 747 fund\u00ad ing is needed to fulfill the purposes of the program: to enhance the availability of a well trained primary car e medical and dental workforce, to pr ovide health care for vulnerable populations and underserved communi\u00adties, and to pr omote and ensure diversity among pri\u00ad mary care physicians, physician assistants, and den\u00ad tists. Further , educational initiatives among students and clinicians in the health professions are needed to in-crease public health knowledge and skills and to facili\u00ad tate collaboration with the public health workforce. The recent bioterrorism events have made mor e appar ent than ever before the increasing need for public health and primary care medicine and dentistry to work closely together to prepar e for health emer gencies. In fact, this event is the culmination of a series of factors indi\u00ad cating that medical car e should focus more of its ef\u00ad forts on preventive, community-based, and population-based medicine. Issues such as incr easing costs of health care, shifts in health care delivery, an incr easingly ag\u00ad ing and culturally diverse population, and unforeseen health events such as bioterr orism, emer ging infections, and drug-resistant infections all conver ge to make the collaboration of medicine and public health not just desirable, but necessary. The training and education of medical pr oviders and dentists help establish discipline-specific core compe\u00ad tencies, ideologies, and practice patter ns. Consequently, by supporting the incorporation of public health com\u00ad petencies in the classroom and in clinical applications, Title VII, section 747 can help achieve a closer alliance of public health and primary care medicine and den\u00ad tistry. Collaborative models exist, although few medical or dental pr ograms have required all their students to attain public health competencies or to gain experi\u00adence in clinical practice in underserved communities and among disadvantaged populations. Nevertheless, models can pr ovide important lessons for medical and dental pr ograms seeking to pr epare their students to approach patients both as individuals and as members of a community or population gr oup. The importance of T itle VII, section 747 in achiev\u00ad ing the immediate and long-ter m objectives of an alli\u00ad ance of public health and primary car e medicine and dentistry cannot be under estimated. The Advisory Com\u00ad mittee recommends that T itle VII, section 747 be funded to sustain the increased access and diversity that it has already accomplished. Further , because health care providers need adequate preparation to fulfill their criti\u00ad cal role in addressing public health emer gencies, T itle VII, section 747 should be used to incorporate public health competencies in the training of primary car e providers and dentists. This educational emphasis on prevention and public health skills and clinical applica\u00ad tions for medical and dental students and r esidents will also have the added dividend of extending life and the quality of life by r educing preventable illnesses, disabili\u00ad ties, and other adverse health outcomes. Meeting the gr owing challenges that face primary care education without under mining the effectiveness of curr ent programs r equires an annual appr opriation of $198 million, as indicated in the 2001 r eport of the Advisory Committee.2 RECOMMEND ATIONS I. TO AVOID UNDERMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT PROGRAMS , TITLE VII, SECTION 747 REQUIRES CONTINUED SUPPOR T AND AD\u00ad DITIONAL FUNDING . Title VII, section 747 has been instrumental in cr eating a diverse, br oadly competent primary car e medicine and dentistry workforce for the Nation. Expansion of cor e Title VII, section 747 funding is needed to fulfill its pur \u00ad poses: to train a supply of primary care physi\u00adcians, physician assistants, and dentists to provide health car e to American communities, especially to disadvantaged populations and underserved communities that might lack access otherwise, and to promote diversity among primary car e medical and dental providers. Title VII, section 747 has had dramatic impacts on primary care medical and dental training and on the health care pr oviders who graduate from programs awarded T itle VII, section 747 funding. Medical and dental training pr ograms funded by Title VII, section 747 have developed innovative Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress 21 curricula in HIV/AIDS, geriatrics, managed care, domestic violence, genetics, culturally competent care, and rural health.3 Family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, physician assistant, and general and pediatric dentistry pro- grams have developed and expanded due to T itle VII, section 747 support. T itle VII, section 747 has also helped increase primary care r esearch, which makes primary care medicine a m ore at- tractive career option for r esidents and impr oves t he quality of primary care among patients.3 Primary car e medicine, physician assistant, and dentistry programs supported by T itle VII, section 747 have emphasized service of their graduates in medically underserved communities and among disadvantaged populations. In 1998, 42-56 per - cent of graduates of these programs entered prac\u00ad tice in underserved communities, compared to a mean of 10 percent of U.S. health professions graduates overall. Further , data for 1998 indicate that 35-50 percent of graduates of programs sup- ported by T itle VII, section 747 repr esented mi\u00ad nority or disadvantaged groups, compared to a 10 per cent minority r epresentation among the U.S. health professions workforce overall. 1 Evi\u00ad dence indicates that these graduates are five times more likely to practice among underserved com\u00ad munities and disadvantaged populations. 6 Contin\u00ad ued institutional and fiscal support is needed to sustain these achievements of increased health care access and increased proportions of minorities in the health pr ofessions. II. TRAINING AND EDUCA TION TO DEVELOP ES\u00ad SENTIAL PUBLIC HEAL TH COMPETENCIES SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED FOR ALL PRIMAR Y CARE MEDICINE , DENTISTR Y, AND PHYSICIAN ASSIST ANT PROGRAMS SUPPOR TED BY TITLE VII, SECTION 747. To prepare a health car e workfor ce to r espond more ef fectively to ongoing health concer ns and public health emer \u00ad gencies, public health training needs to become a part of primary care medicine, physician assistant, and dentistry education. T o facilitate development of these competencies, programs should initiate the following activities: A. Define minimal competencies needed for providers to respond to popula\u00ad tion-based health concer ns, including bioterr velop these competencies; and estab\u00ad lish procedur es for assessing these competencies in trainees. To help guide programs, a list of \"Core Competencies in Disease Prevention and Health Promotion for Under graduate Medical Education\" has been established by the Medical School Objectives Project, convened by the Association of Ameri\u00ad can Medical Colleges. 24 Similarly, the Ameri\u00ad can Dental Education Association has devel\u00ad oped a list of cor e competencies that incorporates community-based health educa\u00ad tion and pr omotion competencies needed by dentists entering practice.25 B. Develop educational modules to help train primary care physicians, physi\u00adcian assistants, and dentists to r e\u00ad spond to public concer ns, in\u00ad cluding and other emer ging health problems. Educational modules and simulations are important tools for applied lear ning and dissemination of in\u00ad creasingly complex subject content. T o pre- pare students for events that can only be an\u00ad ticipated, such methods create virtual approximations of actual events. C. Encourage collaboration of Federally funded programs training public health professionals and T itle VII, section 747-funded programs training primary car e medical and dental pr o\u00ad viders. Interdisciplinary ef forts that cr oss tra\u00ad ditional program boundaries are important for creating needed bridges between public health and primary care. Such collaborations serve as models and maximize effectiveness of pub\u00adlic funds. D. Encourage resear ch between public health faculty and medical and den\u00adtal faculty to facilitate collaborative practices in primary car e medicine and dentistry. Cross-disciplinary collabo\u00ad rations model and facilitate alliances between public health and primary car e and illustrate interdisciplinary teams, syner gies, and best use of joint r esour ces. E. Create leadership training courses that focus on developing alliances between public health and primary care medicine and dentistry. Leadership is requisite for facilitating change within train\u00ad ing pr ograms and communities. Faculty and 22 Advisory Committee Report to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to Congress trainees skilled in facilitating and leading alli\u00ad ances between public health and primary care medicine and dentistry ar e needed to ensure successful collaborations. F. Develop incentives for r ecruitment, development, and support of faculty who have training and experience in public health and who have provided health care to underserved communi\u00ad ties and disadvantaged populations. Public health-oriented faculty are needed to serve as role models for trainees and to de\u00ad velop curricula that utilize their expertise and experience, yet studies indicate various diffi\u00adculties involved in r ecruiting and r etaining cli- nician-educators. 26-27 G. Encourage faculty development pro-grams that link primary care medical and dental faculty with the public health community. Lifelong lear ning and institutional support for faculty ar e consider ed important characteristics of quality medical edu\u00adcation pr ograms. 28 To develop faculty who have public health competencies and who can model those competencies for trainees, faculty devel\u00ad opment should include opportunities for com\u00ad munity-based and population-based practice. H. Ensur e that public health training for primary car e physicians, physician as\u00ad sistants, and dentists is both didac\u00adtic (classroom based) and experiential (applied). Educational methods instilling public health competencies need to be both classroom based and field based. Students learn by observing and doing, not just by hear \u00ad ing. Faculty development should also include both classr oom and field experiences to en\u00ad hance faculty's public health knowledge. I. Encourage accrediting de\u00ad velop measur es that ensur e up-to-date public health training for all levels of learners (i.e., students, r esidents, Few incentives curr ently exist to en- courage primary car e medical and dental education programs to incorporate public health into their curricula. However , policies can offer those incentives.7 Requiring public health competencies for pr ogram accredita\u00ad tion would compel medical and dental pro- grams to implement coursework and clinical requir ements into their training. J. Encourage collaborations with pro- grams funded by sources other than Title VII, section 747. Many pr ograms that fall outside the purview of T itle VII, sec\u00ad tion 747 ar e involved in public health at some level, including social work and legal profes\u00ad sions pr ograms. T itle VII, section 747 pro- grams should seek collaborations with these programs, some of which provide models of interdisciplinary ef forts, such as those achieved in pr eventive medicine r esidencies and bioinfor matics programs. III. ALL PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS , DENTISTS , AND PHYSICIAN ASSIST ANTS SHOULD BE EDU\u00ad CATED AND TRAINED IN KNOWLEDGE MANAGE \u00ad MENT USING INFORMA TION TECHNOLOGY TO ACCESS AND COMMUNICA TE INFORMA TION ABOUT PUBLIC HEAL TH ISSUES . As more infor \u00ad mation becomes available on the W eb, primary care providers and dentists need to be able to ac\u00ad cess and use this infor systems enhance surveillance, coor dination of patient car e, and management of emer ging pub\u00ad lic health issues within communities. They can be used to track patients, maintain disease registries, and electronically submit r eports of reportable ill\u00ad nesses. Further , the Inter net and e-mail ar e ideal for communicating and disseminating infor mation. IV. EXAMPLES OF TITLE VII, SECTION 747 PRO- GRAMS THAT SUCCESSFULL Y TRAIN PROVID \u00ad ERS WITH BROAD PUBLIC HEAL TH COMPETEN \u00ad CIES SHOULD BE WIDEL Y DISSEMINA TED TO COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST . The Health Re- sources and Services Administration should iden\u00ad tify and disseminate infor mation about pr ograms that successfully produce trainees demonstrating strong public health competencies. Model train\u00ad ing programs having successful public health out-comes illustrate what approaches work best and what problems must be over come. References 23 REFERENCES 1 United States.

HRSA PUBLIC HEALTH AND BIOTERRORISM PROGRAMS AND PRIMAR Y CARE CLINICIANS BIOGRAPHY Jeffrey Dunlap has nearly 20 years of service dedi\u00ad cated to improving the public's health. He received his B.A. degree in political science and inter national r ela\u00ad tions from Syracuse University and his M.S. in public health from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While at Chapel Hill, Mr . Dunlap r eceived a Pub\u00ad lic Health Service T raineeship and was recognized as a Chancellor's Scholar . Upon completing his studies, Mr . Dunlap r eceived an appointment as a Pr esidential management inter n (PMI). During his tenur e as a PMI, Mr . Dunlap enjoyed a variety of assignments with the Heath Car e Finances Adminis\u00ad tration, U.S. Agency for Inter national Development, and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), where he was assigned to the Public Health Service's In\u00ad teragency Committee on Infant Mortality and the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality. At HRSA, Mr . Dunlap has served as an analyst in the Mater nal and Child Health Bur eau's Healthy Start Initiative and also served in the Bur eau of Primary Health Care's National Health Service Corps program. He also provided leadership to the Bureau of Primary Health Care's managed car e technical assistance ac\u00ad tivities and served as a senior analyst in HRSA's Cen\u00ad ter for Public Health Practice. As senior advisor to the Associate Administrator for Field Operations, Mr . Dunlap spearheaded r eorganiza\u00ad tion efforts and led the Agency's Bor der Health Initia\u00ad tive. In September 2000, he was appointed Deputy Director, Division of Public and Allied Health with the Bureau of Health Professions, wher e he reengineered the Division into the Center for Public Health. In Octo\u00adber 2001, Mr . Dunlap was appointed to lead the Bureau's new Division of State, Community, and Pub\u00ad lic Health, where he oversees a variety of interdiscipli\u00ad nary training programs. Mr. Dunlap has been recognized with several awar ds, including the Administrator's Special Citation for Out- standing Per formance on four occasions, twice indi\u00ad vidually and twice as a member of working groups. He was also selected by HRSA to serve as a Fellow to the Council of Excellence in Gover nment and currently participates as a Senior Fellow. Mr . Dunlap r eceived the Secretary's Award for Distinguished Service for his work on bor der health. He is currently a Fellow with the Public Health Institute. HRSA PUBLIC HEAL TH AND BIOTERR ORISM PR OGRAMS AND PRIMAR Y CARE CLINICIANS (Summar y from transcript) by Jef frey Dunlap The Health Resour ces and Services Administration (HRSA) is seen as the \"access agency\" that seeks \"to assure the availability of quality health care to low- income, uninsured, isolated, vulnerable, and special needs populations to meet their unique health care needs.\" The strategies for that assurance of health care include eliminating barriers to care, assuring quality of care, eliminating health disparities, improving public health, and improving health care systems. HRSA has a new Division of State, Community, and Public Health, which has as one of its char ges the building of bridges between public health and primary care. HRSA's Bureau of Health Pr ofessions seeks \"to in- crease health car e access by assuring a health pr ofes\u00ad sions workforce that meets the needs of the public.\" The Bureau uses selected strategies to accomplish this objective: Developing the health pr ofessions workforc e through resear ch, analysis, and planning Improving the distribution and diversity of health professionals to rural/urban underserved ar eas Improving the quality of health pr ofessions practice and education Focusing on key twenty-first century health profes\u00ad sions issues, including geriatrics, genetics, and bioterr orism. 30 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers JEFFREY DUNLAP HRSA's unique role carries over into emer gency preparedness. In fact, HRSA's r esponses to today's public health challenges are agency-wide, not r estricted just to the Division of State, Community, and Public Health or the Bureau of Health Pr ofessions. HRSA bureau programs actively participate and contribute to these efforts. HRSA is involved in impr oving readiness for health emergencies and emer ging health threats through a number of avenues: hospitals, clinical training, and existing networks. The agency assists hospitals to be- come better prepar ed through support of a hospital prepar edness pr ogram, hospital emer gency response, and and decontamination pr ograms. HRSA's Hospital Prepar edness Program, which is headed by the Mater nal and Child Health Bureau, works with States to assur e that the Nation's hospitals have the equipment and training necessary to respond ap\u00adpropriately to bioterr orism and mass casualty inci\u00ad dences. The budget for FY 2002 is about $135 mil- lion. The pr ogram is also in the President's 2003 budget for $235 million. HRSA's Hospital Emer gency Response Program, which began soon after September 11, allocated $40 million to help compensate for hospitals' lost r evenues directly attributable to terrorist attacks. The Hospital Infrastructur e Laboratory Decontami\u00ad nation Pr ogram, dir ected by HRSA's Office of Special Programs, helps provide adequate hospital lab capac\u00ad ity in the Nation by helping with hospital infection con\u00ad trol and with the purchase of protection and decon\u00ad tamination equipment. The 2003 budget provides $283 million for this pr ogram. In addition to bioterr orism, HRSA is involved in genetics as an emer ging issue. Emer ging issues ar e numerous, and many overlap and contribute to one another . HRSA also has a new program called Educational Incentives for Curriculum Development and T raining Program, headed by Neil Sampson and assisted by a task group from across the Bureau of Health Profes\u00ad sions. This program offers educational incentives for curriculum development and training programs that emphasize recognizing, tr eating, and reporting of dis\u00ad ease, including patter ns of illness with unusual mani-HRSA P UBLIC HEALTHAND BIOTERR ORISM PROGRAMS AND PRIMAR Y CARE CLINICIANS (TRANSCRIPT SUMMAR Y) festations and symptoms. In 2003, this pr ogram has a budget of $60 million. The inter disciplinary natur e of the program dem\u00ad onstrates the appr oach we are taking with programs across the Bur eau\u2014\"the need to bridge and work acr oss all the divisions ..., all the pr ograms, and all the disci\u00ad plines.\" The Division of State, Community, and Public Health is a \"bridge division or the glue division. W e try to put things together .\" The bioterrorism curriculum effort attempts to do just that. The Educational Incentives for Curriculum Devel\u00ad opment and T raining Program emphasizes \"the devel\u00ad opment of a health car e workforce that has the knowl\u00ad edge, skills, and abilities\" to respond to bioterrorism events. The health care workfor ce should be pr epared to \"recognize the indications of a terrorist event in their patients,\" \"tr eat their patients in a safe and appropri\u00ad ate manner ,\" and \"rapidly and ef fectively alert and en- gage the public health system in the event of such an emergency.\" This program bridges public health and primary car e, makes needed linkages, and prepar es health car e providers to inter face with the public health systems if emer gencies due to terrorism should occur . Further , HRSA's involvement in improving the readi\u00ad ness of the Nation's health car e infrastructure utilizes existing networks such a s Community Health Centers, Primary Car e Organizations (PCOs), the National Health Service Corps, Public Health T raining Centers, and Ar ea Health Education Centers (AHECs). The network of about 700 Community Health Centers in about 2,300 sites serves appr oximately 12 million people. In a bioterrorism event, these Centers will be important because of the medical vulnerability of the populations they serve. Around 50 PCOs exist and are housed in the Of\u00ad fices of the State Health Officers acr oss the Nation. They ar e critical links between primary care and public health and also would play an important role in bioterr orism attacks. The National Health Service Corps is an additional important link for accessing public health systems in rural areas. Corps clinicians will also be trained to be \"fr ont and center\" in case of bioterrorism emergencies. Similarly, about 40 new Commissioned Corps Officers ar e being prepar ed to be out in com\u00ad munities r eady to respond to emer gencies. Currently, 14 Public Health T raining Centers cov\u00ad ering 42 States ar e funded across the country. This Training Center pr ogram is new, but will serve as an APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 31 JEFFREY DUNLAP infrastructure to help bridge primary care and public health. The Centers provide outreach and public health training to primary care clinicians and facilitate an in\u00ad terface between public health and primary care. Also, 45 AHECs exist in 42 States and direct 170 community-based AHECs across the United States. These AHECs ar e central to the pr ovision of continuing education and training needed for pr oviders. Inter discipli\u00ad nary appr oaches are stressed in these training pr ograms that annually impact about 150,000 providers. Although funds have not been appr opriated for bioterr orism activities in the AHECs, they nevertheless are conducting various activities to enhance bioterr orism response and preparation. For example, the Univer \u00ad sity of Connecticut AHEC has created a database of health car e providers in the State. This database in\u00ad cludes contact infor mation, specialties, and skills in case providers need to be deployed in an emer gency. Initi\u00ad ated in r esponse to the Olympics, the Utah AHEC has developed an early detection system. North Car olina's AHEC does broad-based training that links with health systems in the State. In Norther n Virginia, which has pockets of underserved populations lar gely due to lan\u00ad guage barriers, the AHEC worked with providers to help them addr ess multicultural populations speaking diverse languages. Much good curricula exist already. One of our tasks is to locate best practices and best models to use. Fol-HRSA P UBLIC HEALTHAND BIOTERR ORISM PROGRAMS AND PRIMAR Y CARE CLINICIANS (TRANSCRIPT SUMMAR Y) lowing up on the public services announcements that were available in different languages during the Florida Super Bowl, the Florida AHEC initiated special train\u00ad ing for community health centers. The training, at- tended by 160 pr oviders, addressed rural communities and the special needs of those populations. Currently, a modular resource acr oss four years of medical education is being produced that will assist fam\u00ad ily medicine and other medical school faculty in teach\u00ad ing pr eparedness in the event of bioterrorism. The Fam\u00ad ily Medicine Curriculum Resour ce Project is also developing a W eb-based bioterr orism module to in- crease student competence across the four years of medical education. In addition, the Ambulatory Pediatric Association has for med a regional subgroup on bioterrorism, and our AHEC pr ograms ar e also for ming workgr oups. Keeping track of the numerous activities in the gover n\u00ad ment is dif ficult, even across the T itle VII pr ograms, but we want to do this work to reduce duplication and access best practices. The terr orist attacks of September 11 and the an\u00ad thrax cases that followed challenge us to find ways to work together to meet the needs of our communities. HRSA believes its training infrastructure is critical in addressing those needs and in linking public health with clinical health. 32 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 33 David Sat cher, M.D., Ph.D. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010: THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICINE BIOGRAPHY Dr. David Satcher completed his four -year ter m as the 16th Sur geon General of the United States in Feb\u00ad ruary 2002. He also served as Assistant Secretary for Health from February 1998 to January 2001, making him only the second person in history to have held both positions of Sur geon General and Assistant Sec\u00ad retary of Health simultaneously. In January 2002, Dr . Satcher was named the dir ec\u00ad tor of the new National Center for Primary Care at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Geor \u00ad gia. He assumed the post in September 2002. Dr .

His mission is to make public health work for all groups in this Nation. 34 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers DAVID SA TCHER HEAL THY PEOPLE 2010 : PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC HEAL TH AND MEDICINE (Summar y from transcript) by Dr . David Satcher Listening to the proceedings thus far has led me to reflect on the years that I served on HRSA or HRSA staff advisory committees. In 1986, I was appointed to the Council on Graduate Medical Education and was appointed Chair when President Bush was elected. Service on the Council on Graduate Medical Education led me to be involved with the then current admini\u00ad stration's health refor m strategy, which r esulted in my appointment as Director of the CDC and, later , Assis\u00ad tant Secretary for Health and Sur geon General. I am pleased to be able to join you to discuss the issue of improving the public's health by enhancing the primary car e/public health inter face in the United States. When I served as Dir ector of CDC and Dr . Lee Fielding was Assistant Secr etary for Health and Donna Shalala was Secretary, we started a project with the American Medical Association and the American Pub\u00adlic Health Association called Partnership Between Public Health and Medicine. The idea was to improve the partnership between public health and health care, an effort that still continues, although not vigorously. At a meeting of deans in Chicago in 1996, Donna Shalala told a story that attempted to explain why this partnership is so important. She said public health and medicine ar e like two trains traveling on parallel tracks through a community. On one side, medicine looks out the window and sees patients with their various diseases in need of tr eatment. On the other side, pub\u00ad lic health looks out and sees populations and opportu\u00ad nities for health pr omotion and disease prevention. The only problem, of course, is that it is the same commu\u00ad nity. Public health and health care need to get on the same train. That analogy is truer today than it was then. The critical challenges we now face demand that pub\u00ad lic health and health care be on the same train as we work with communities throughout this country. We want to be reminded of September 11th for two reasons: One is that September 11th and the sub- sequent anthrax attacks put into perspective the need for this partnership mor e than anything I have witnessed in recent years. What became very clear after Septem-HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010: THEPARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTHAND MEDICINE (TRANSCRIPT SUMMAR Y) ber 11th was the weakness in the public health infra\u00ad structur e. I define the public health infrastructur e as having at least thr ee components. The first component is the public health service at the Federal, State, and local level. Many issues emer ged after September 11th r e\u00ad garding the str engths and weaknesses of the Public Health Service and the communication or lack of it among the dif ferent levels. The second component of the public health infra\u00ad structur e is the people who provide car e to popula\u00ad tions on the fr ont line. Physicians, dentists, phar ma\u00ad cists, nurses, and many others on the front line taking care of patients are a critical part of the public health infrastructur e. Just how critical this health car e component is be- came very clear after September 11th to the extent that people on the fr ont line were able to r ecognize unusual symptoms and unusual presentations of dis\u00adeases. W e were able to get on top of the anthrax at- tack very early. The people on the fr ont line complained that they did not r eceive needed infor mation fr om the Public Health Service in a sufficiently timely manner to be able to make diagnoses. Clearly, her e was a situation in which these two segments needed to have been coop\u00aderating and training together for a bioterrorist attack. At one time, we had satellite confer ences all over the country. W e reached about 400,000 to 500,000 clinicians in these satellite confer ences. What would have happened if, when we wer e doing the so-called bioterr orism training, we had used the satellite confer \u00ad ences instead of having confer ences that perhaps a total of 5,000 clinicians attended over a period of two or three years? It became clear that we wer e not taking seriously the fact that the public health infrastructure that must respond to this kind of attack must be included in train\u00ad ing. These two segments must be pr epared, as well as one other component\u2014the general public. It became very clear after September 11th that, to the extent that the general public is prepar ed or unpre\u00ad pared for any kind of bioterrorist attack, we ar e able to respond. Anxiety prevails when the general public is unprepared. It is har d to get cooperation fr om the public if they lack the infor mation they need. The same people who may not be practicing good public health habits such APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 35 DAVID SA TCHER as thoroughly cooking meats and washing their hands are the citizens who ar e also the subjects of bioterr orism attacks. These are the thr ee components of the public health infrastructure: the public health service, the health car e providers, and the general public. T o the extent that we can str engthen the public health infrastructure by doing mor e at every level, including a lot more com\u00ad munity education in local communities, we can strengthen the public health infrastructur e. Many of us feel that out of September 11th and the anthrax attacks ought to come a better appreciation for public health on the part of Congress, State legisla\u00ad tures, and local communities. If that appreciation oc\u00ad curs, it will be a very good thing. I am going to talk about a national prescription for building the next generation of healthy people. That is what Healthy People 2010 is all about, even though it is for a decade. The question is how do we promote the health of the American people using this planning strategy? The Sur geon General's r eports have played an im\u00ad portant r ole in the Nation's health, including the one that gave rise to Healthy People and that was released by Julie Richmond in 1979\u2014 Health Pr omotion and Disease Pr evention . As Assistant Secretary for Health, I think our major contribution to Healthy People was, in fact, the ten leading health indicators that had never before been a part of Healthy People . Incorporating these indicators was an attempt to say that, if we ar e to be successful with Healthy People , we have to have something that the American people can understand. You cannot communicate 467 objectives but you can communicate ten leading health indicators. One of the greatest opportunities someone has as Sur geon Gen\u00ad eral is to use the credibility of that Of fice to develop reports and communicate dir ectly with the American people. The first Sur geon General's report was in 1964 from Dr. Luther T erry on smoking and health. When you think about the impact of that report and of the many Surgeon General's reports on smoking that have fol\u00ad lowed it, it is clear that the Sur geon General's Office has a tremendous opportunity to make a dif ference through this communication. We continued the legacy of for mer Sur geon Gener \u00ad als in releasing three r eports on smoking and health: HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010: THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTHAND MEDICINE (TRANSCRIPT SUMMAR Y) Racial and Ethnic Issues in Smoking and Health , Reducing T obacco Use , and Women and Smoking . We also ventured into areas that had never been addressed befor e by a Sur geon General, especially in mental health, suicide pr evention, and oral health. The response to those reports especially is amazing. Healthy People is in its thir d decade, going back to 1979. It r epresents a tr emendous opportunity because probably, there is no process like it in which we involve grassroots communities thr oughout this country and in which decisions about the priorities, goals, and objec\u00adtives for Healthy People have input nationwide. Some communities are well or ganized ar ound Healthy People . These communities have their own objectives under the two goals put forwar d in Healthy People 2010 . Community involvement in Healthy People is a tremendous process itself. I really enjoyed traveling over the country, visiting r egions, and speak\u00ad ing to community groups about the Healthy People we developed. It is a comprehensive set of national ten-year health objectives. It is indeed a very collaborative pr ocess. Perhaps the most important thing is that it is designed to measure pr ogress over time, to be accountable, some- times painfully so, in r eporting on Healthy People . I have had to r eport on it many times, and it is sometimes painful to report that you have made little progress. The beauty of accountability, however , is that, once you put yourself on the line and say, \"this is what we plan to do, and this is wher e we plan to be five years from now, ten years fr om now,\" then you can be held accountable. The gr eat thing as a Nation is that when we make these commitments, we can be held accountable. I am not sur e I know anybody who has read it, but in case you have not read it\u2014the whole document\u2014it is a public health document that is part strategic plan, part national health data report, and part textbook on public health priorities. For the first time, we did a summary because we have two volumes of Healthy People 2010 . They were so lar ge that Donna Shalala, when I presented them to her, stood up on them so she could equal my height and make a point. Donna was good at making points. She was making the point about how much material is in Healthy People 2010 . 36 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers DAVID SA TCHER We issued the summary, and we also issued the CD- ROM for the first time. In using the CD-ROM or going to the Inter net, you can find and look at any area of Healthy People 2010 in detail. Healthy People 2000 had more than 300 objec\u00ad tives. For 2010, there wer e 467. I lear ned a lesson because I was committed to r educing the number of objectives. What I lear ned in that pr ocess is that when- ever you bring on new areas like visual and hearing disorders, disability, public health infrastructur e, or health communication, every area brings a set of ob\u00ad jectives. Objectives also bring resources, so having a lot of objectives is not necessarily a bad thing, even though I thought that I was going to r educe them. Fail\u00ad ing to do so led us to be very committed to the ten leading health indicators. The number of objectives has grown over the years since 1980 with Healthy People 1990 , which had about 236 objectives, to the 467 objectives in Healthy People 2010 . This Healthy People had two goals that captur e the major challenges we face in public health and health care over this decade. The American society is aging in the sense that the fastest gr owing gr oup of people in this country consists of people over age 65. Ther e are 35 million people over 65 years of age, and we project that, by 2030, 70 million people will be over 65 years of age. There are four million cases of Alzheimer's today, and ther e will be more than 14 million by 2050 unless things change dramatically or unless we come up with an intervention that we have not yet found to curtail this problem. In 1976, only 500,000 cases of Alzheimer's had been diagnosed. By 2000, ther e were four million cases, and the number is gr owing at a very rapid rate as our society ages. We decided that it was important to emphasize not only the years of life that people live, but also the qual\u00ad ity of those years. Improving quality of life needs much work. If you think about how we deal with the older population in this country, we have a tendency to push people aside after they r each a certain age. That qual\u00ad ity of life is not good for their health, and it is not good for public health, so we have to addr ess that. We have to addr ess some of our values as a society. We have to focus on issues that bother people as they get old, including low back pain and depr ession. Be- cause of our social situation especially, we see dramatic HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010: THEPARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTHAND MEDICINE (TRANSCRIPT SUMMAR Y) increases in depr ession and many other problems that are pr eventable in the elderly. W e tried to make the point that these wer e not diseases of aging, but wer e problems occurring because of what we failed to do in terms of public health and health care. The other point important to make here is that qual\u00ad ity of life issues ar e not just about older people. Issues related to quality of life start with life itself, certainly in utero. Babies have experiences in uter o from which they never r ecover in ter ms of quality of life. Whether expo- sure to poor nutrition, alcohol, or crack cocaine, in uter o experiences can impact quality of life for the r est of life. We also did a r eport on breastfeeding, which makes a great differ ence in quality of life, not only in child- hood but thr oughout life. Every day, we lear n mor e about the impact of breastfeeding on the health of people. Quality of life issues begin with life, and they continue thr oughout life. The second goal for Healthy People 2010 acknowl\u00ad edges that, as a Nation, we ar e becoming increasingly diverse. That diversity ought to be one of our major strengths, but we have to work at making diversity a strength more than we have in the past. In 1997, Pr esident Clinton, in a Califor nia com\u00ad mencement addr ess, talked about a race initiative to improve race relations. He asked every Department to find a strategy for enhancing race relations in this coun\u00ad try. W e had been struggling with priorities in our De\u00ad partment and having many debates. W e decided to move toward a commitment to eliminate racial and eth\u00adnic disparities. It is a very bold commitment because, to achieve it, many drastic changes must take place. A partnership between public health and primary care medicine and dentistry is a mandate if we ar e ever to achieve this goal. It has to happen. I would go fur \u00ad ther and say that universal car e has to happen\u2014uni\u00ad versal access, universal coverage. We are not going to achieve these goals unless those events occur . When you set bold goals, you set yourself up for failure, which is why some people do not want to set such goals. Y ou must define what you have to do and why it is so important to do. These goals ar e in clear perspective. In looking at the first goal, we must look at health across the years, which we have started to do. When you look at aging, it is like the W orld Health APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 37 DAVID SA TCHER Organization's definition of health: it is not merely the absence of disease, but the presence of complete physi\u00ad cal, mental, and social well being. When we look at all people, we must view them that way. T o what extent are we working to make sure that they have well being in all three of these ar eas? We have made much pr ogress in public health. In 1900, the overall life expectancy in this country was about 47. At the time, it was about 49 for whites and about 34 for African-Americans. By the year 2000, the life expectancy in this country had increased by 30 years, and we attribute most of that increase to public health and prevention. In 2000, the life expectancy for whites was approaching 79, and for African Ameri\u00ad cans, 72. On one hand, the gap narrowed from about 15 years to about seven years, but there was still a significant gap. Events like improved sanitation, immunizations, and development of antibiotics had a major impact, espe\u00ad cially on the health of children. When you have those kinds of interventions, the most vulnerable in our soci\u00ad ety benefit the most because they are suffering the most from lack of interventions. Poverty breeds infectious diseases and, therefor e, people who live in poverty and who are able to get immunizations will certainly expe\u00ad rience a tremendous boost in life expectancy. That is why universal access is so critical for elimi\u00ad nating disparities because the people who suffer most from a lack of access are minorities and the poor , and they will benefit the most when we have it. Although everybody will benefit, the ones who will benefit the most are those who are most vulnerable because they are suffering the most. We actually announced the initiative to r educe health disparities before Healthy People 2010 was an\u00ad nounced. W e were responding to the request that ev\u00ad ery cabinet head should develop a strategy to support the race initiative. W e had been talking about this goal for some time, and soon after I became Assistant Sec\u00ad retary for Health and the Sur geon General, we r eported to the Pr esident that we wanted to make this commit\u00ad ment. He was very enthusiastic about it, and in April of 1998, he announced the initiative to eliminate dispari\u00ad ties in health. W e were then able to fold that goal into Healthy People 2010 . When we announced the initiative in 1998, we de\u00ad cided that we needed to focus on ar eas in which we HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010: THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTHAND MEDICINE (TRANSCRIPT SUMMAR Y) had enough data that we could measur e wher e we were, where we wer e going, and where we had the facility to make a dif ference. W e identified six ar eas, including infant mortality, breast and cervical cancer , and car dio\u00ad vascular disease. These ar eas are interesting because they differ fr om one another . Infant mortality is cer \u00ad tainly dif ferent from cardiovascular disease, and all of them ar e different fr om immunization, which is a health service intervention. AIDS is the only infectious disease in the six areas, but it is perhaps the world's greatest pan\u00ad demic. By 2020, it will have killed more people than any other disease in the history of infectious diseases. We never intended to stop with this group of six areas that we initially came up with. When Healthy People 2010 came out, we made it clear that ar eas like asthma would also be very important. I deliver ed a commencement addr ess Saturday at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry, a school of dentistry that is leading the way, along with several other dental schools, in pr ograms to eliminate dispari\u00ad ties in oral health. The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Resear ch at NIH has funded five centers for disparities resear ch and oral health. The University of Michigan in conjunction with the City of Detroit has developed the major pr ogram to work toward eliminating dispari\u00ad ties in oral health. The pervasiveness of the goal of eliminating disparities far beyond the six initial ar eas is important for Healthy People 2010 . The Institute of Medicine was asked to help put to\u00ad gether a list of leading health indicators that would cap\u00ad ture the essence of Healthy People 2010 . They r e- turned 12 to us, and Nicole Lurie chaired a steering committee that r educed them further to ten. W e wanted the number to be small, no more than the number of fingers on our hands. W e struggled with the decision to reduce them, but came up with ten leading health indicators. These br eak down into health system indicators and lifestyle indicators, although injury, violence, and envi\u00ad ronmental quality ar guably may fall into another cat\u00ad egory. Each of these ten leading health indicators has one or more measurable objectives associated with it. The indicators cover five health systems and five lifestyles. The health systems ones are inter esting, and, obviously, access is the overriding one. If you stop with that one, you would cover most of the other indicators. 38 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers DAVID SA TCHER Access to quality mental health care is a major issue as Congr ess struggles today with parity of access to mental health services. T o end discrimination in cover - age of mental health services in this country is a major challenge that we face. Medicaid and Medicar e both discriminate in ter ms of coverage for mental health services, so many issues ar e involved. Several barriers are associated with access. The oral health report probably demonstrated these barriers more than any r eport we did, although we attempted to address access issues in each of our reports. We have seen so much progr ess in the oral health of the American people, yet about 20-25 per cent of childr en and older Americans suffer significant oral health problems. Every year , 51 million hours of school are missed because of toothaches and tooth decay. Thirty percent of people over age 65 today wear dentures, despite the fact that the majority of Ameri\u00ad cans middle aged and younger will maintain their natu\u00ad ral teeth throughout their lives. Still, 30 per cent of people over 65 wear dentur es. That means they have trouble chewing, speaking, and smiling\u2014all activities that we take for granted but that ar e difficult for people with poor oral health. We also have such poor dental insurance coverage. Forty million people are uninsur ed for health car e, but 108 million people lack dental insurance. Only 60 per - cent of people who have insurance from their work- place have insurance that covers dental care. Medicaid's reimbursement for dental car e is so poor that most dentists would prefer not to have anything to do with it. Only one in five childr en on Medicaid saw a dentist the year befor e we released this report. That's how bad it is. In Geor gia, a State legislator took the oral health report to his colleagues, and they tripled r eimburse\u00ad ment for Medicaid services\u2014not doubled, but tripled it. Many positive results have occurred because of these reports, and that's always gratifying. Y ou hate to see these reports just end up on shelves. In addition to being uninsur ed, there are many underinsured people, including older people who can- not affor d prescription drugs, the underserved that you have discussed a great deal, the underr epresented that you deal with all the time\u2014all of those factors impact upon access. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010: THEPARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTHAND MEDICINE (TRANSCRIPT SUMMAR Y) There are also the uninspired\u2014people who just do not have time to car e about their health. They have other priorities, so the uninspired represents the untrusting. There are good reasons why some people do not trust the health system, including the public health system. There are also the uninfor med. When we went out to implement the Childr en's Health Insurance Pr ogram, it became obvious that many people eligible for Medi\u00ad caid did not know they wer e eligible, so being unin\u00ad formed is also a barrier to access. There are many uninsured people, and Hispanics are most likely to be uninsur ed, almost one in thr ee. But worse, almost 50 per cent of Hispanics report that they have no personal pr ovider . All these issues r equire involvement at the commu\u00ad nity level\u2014a partnership between those who treat indi\u00ad vidual patients and those who look at populations, which we have not seen in the past. The national strategy for suicide prevention was about implementing pr ograms that impact upon com\u00ad munities in the belief that if we did, we could in fact reduce suicide in this country. I will close with this story. For some of you, this is an old story because it makes the point that needs to be made about the continuing gap between what we know in this country and what we do. We know a lot. W e have the best technology. W e have the best r esear ch enterprise, yet on so many indi\u00ad ces, we fall very low when compar ed to other coun\u00ad tries, lar gely because of the tremendous gap that exists between what we know and what we do. This story that I got from Neal Lane is about a man who was traveling across the country in a hot air bal\u00ad loon and suddenly realized that he was lost, so he de\u00ad cided that he would lower the balloon to see if he could spot some r ecognizable landmark. He lowered the balloon and did not see anything that he recognized, so he lowered it further . When he got to about 30 feet above ground, he saw a man work\u00ad ing in the field below, so he yelled, \"Wher e am I?\" The man in the field said, \"Y ou're in a hot air balloon about 30 feet above gr ound.\" The man in the balloon said, \"Ar e you a scientist? You sound like somebody who works in science.\" The APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 39 DAVID SA TCHER man on the ground said, \"I am a scientist, but how did you know that?\" The man in the balloon said, \"Be- cause what you have told me is technically correct, but is of absolutely no use to me right now.\" The man on the ground said, \"Y ou sound like a policymaker .\" The man in the balloon said, \"I am a policymaker . How did you know that?\" The man on the ground said, \"Because you don't know wher e you are; you don't know where you're going; in fact, you'r e in the same position you were when we met, and now you're blaming me.\" Over and over again as we looked at these various areas\u2014mental health, suicide prevention, oral health\u2014 the gap between what we know and what we do is wide. It will only be filled if ther e is a true partnership between public health and health care of the kind we have never seen before in this country. Public health has to infor m health care in ter ms of surveillance and vice versa, but providers have to have the opportunity and the incentives to practice health promotion and disease prevention. The obesity report made that point mor e than any other we did. It showed that, for issues like the potential effects of physical ac\u00ad tivity and the actualities of what people do in ter ms of HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010: THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTHAND MEDICINE (TRANSCRIPT SUMMAR Y) nutrition and physical activity, the gap is very wide, and physicians and dentists and others complain that they do not have time to talk to people about nutrition. Americans have no incentives to exercise. T oday, over 60 percent of the population ar e overweight, in\u00ad cluding 27 percent who are obese. Y ou can see what has happened just since 1970. The report on obesity points out that while we know that programs of physi\u00ad cal activity and good nutrition can reduce the onset of type 2 diabetes by more than 56 per cent, we do not have a system that supports these pr ograms. W e do not even pr ovide physical education for K thr ough 12. I want to make very clear my opinion that public health has this br oad-based responsibility. While health care providers ar e on the front line taking care of pa\u00ad tients, public health has got to work with the school system. It has to work with the worksite. It must work with the media. Community systems that impact the lives of people must infor m them and also support the development of programs that can impr ove people's lives. That is the challenge we face. I commend you for taking on such a difficult but relevant issue. 40 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 41 Laurie Garr ett BETRA YAL OF TRUST BIOGRAPHY Laurie Garrett is the only writer ever to have been awarded all thr ee of the Big \"Ps\" of jour nalism: the Peabody, the Polk, and the Pulitzer . Her most r ecent books, The Coming Plague and Betrayal of T rust, explore key developments in global health and disease prevention issues. Both have received widespr ead critical and popular acclaim. Betrayal of Trust, in particular , documents the decline of the glo\u00ad bal public health infrastructure. Over the years, Garr ett has also contributed chapters to numerous books, in\u00ad cluding AIDS in the W orld, edited by Jonathan Mann, Daniel T arantola, and , Oxfor Emer gence of Infectious Diseases , ed\u00ad ited by Mary E. W ilson, New Y ork Academy of Sci\u00ad ences, 1994. She is a power ful advocate for mor e force\u00ad ful and proactive r esponses to thr eats to human health. She has written for many publications, including Foreign Af fairs, Esquir e, Vanity Fair , Los Angeles Times, The W ashington Post , and Current Issues in Public Health . She has appeared fr equently on na\u00ad tional television pr ograms, including ABC Nightline , The News Hour with Jim Lehr er, The Charlie Rose Show, The Oprah W infrey Show, Dateline, The In\u00ad ternational Hour (CNN), and Talkback (CNN). Garrett also has delivered innumerable invited speeches to pub\u00ad lic and professional or ganizations. Ms. Garrett graduated with honors in biology from the University of Califor nia in Santa Cruz. She attended graduate school in the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology at UC Berkeley and did research at Stanfor d University in the laboratory of Dr . Leonar d Herzenber g. During her Ph.D. studies, she started re- porting on science news at KPF A, a local radio station. The hobby soon became far more interesting than graduate school, and she left graduate school to pur \u00ad sue jour nalism. At KPF A, Ms. Garr ett worked in management, in news, and in radio documentary pr oduction. A docu\u00ad mentary series she co-pr oduced with Adi Gevins won the 1977 Geor ge Foster Peabody A ward in Broadcast\u00ad ing, and her other KPF A production ef forts won the Armstrong and CPB A wards. After leaving KPF A, she worked briefly in the Cali\u00ad fornia Department of Food and Agricultur e, where she assessed the human health impacts of pesticide use. She then went overseas, living and working in south- ern Europe and sub-Saharan Africa and freelance re- porting for Pacifica Radio, Pacific News Service, BBC- Radio, Reuters, Associated Press, and others. In 1980, Garr ett joined National Public Radio (NPR) and worked out of the network's bur eaus in San Fran\u00ad cisco and later in Los Angeles as a science corr espon\u00ad dent. During her NPR years, she was awarded by the National Pr ess Club (Best Consumer Jour nalism, 1982), the San Francisco Media Alliance (Meritorious Achieve\u00ad ment Awar d in Radio, 1983), and the W orld Hunger Alliance (First Prize, Radio, 1987). In 1988, she left NPR to join the science writing staff of Newsday , wher e she r emains today. Her Newsday reporting has ear ned several awards, includ\u00ad ing the Newsday Publisher's Award (Best Beat Reporter , 1990), Award of Excellence fr om the National Asso\u00ad ciation of Black Jour nalists (\"AIDS in Africa,\" 1989), Deadline Club of New Y ork (Best Beat Reporter , 1993), First Place from the Society of Silurians (\"Breast Cancer ,\" 1994), and the Bob Considine A ward of the Overseas Pr ess Club of America (\"AIDS in In\u00ad dia,\" 1995). During the academic year 1992-93, Ms. Garrett at- tended Harvard University as a visiting Fellow in the Harvard School of Public Health. She is a member of the National Association of Sci\u00ad ence W riters and served as the or ganization's Presi\u00ad dent during the mid-1990s. 42 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers LAURIE GARRETT BETRA YAL OF TRUST (Edited transcript) by Laurie Garr ett Our task is to look at the relationship between pri\u00ad mary car e and public health and to do so in the age of bioterr orism. Historically, examining this r elationship is a difficult task. Primary car e\u2014medicine generally\u2014 and public health have been at odds in this country, often almost in a state of policy war fare. Going back to colonial days in America, there was no real concept of public health, but the idea of im\u00adproving the health status of the whole population came down to pr otecting populations from epidemics. The key players tended to be r eligiously inspir ed physicians. In the earliest colonial days, we think of Cotton Mather , for example, the first person to stand up and call for universal smallpox vaccinations. Smallpox vac\u00ad cination at this time, being before Jenner , was not pleas- ant. With the dawn of the ger m theory era in the 1870s and 1880s, we suddenly had the basis for the cr eation of the discipline of public health based on identifica\u00ad tion of microbial disease and containment of its spread. From the very beginning, implementation of public health law was str ongly opposed by or ganized medi\u00ad cine. The American Medical Association (AMA) and its predecessor or ganizations staunchly opposed almost every early initiative taken to control the spread of in\u00ad fectious diseases in this country. For example, when Her man Biggs, one of the true heroes of the dawn of the public health era in America, tried to institute tuberculosis name identification quar \u00ad antine and treatment in New Y ork City, it was the phy\u00ad sician or ganizations and primary care physicians who opposed it so staunchly that it went all the way to the State Supr eme Court, which upheld the right of the City of New Y ork and its public health agencies to cre\u00ad ate a registry of those who had tuberculosis. Why was it opposed? Because it was per ceived as interfering with the entrepr eneurial nature of primary care at that time. No one was opposed to giving the names of poor people with tuber culosis. They wer e opposed to giving the names of their paying clients because they did not want any competing physicians to know the names of their paying clients. BETRA YALOFTRUST (EDITED TRANSCRIPT ) It was not about civil liberties. It was about compe\u00ad tition. The same thing happened in 1877 when ther e was a smallpox epidemic in Minnesota, and the first real public health leader in the State of Minnesota, Charles Hewitt, tried to bring it under contr ol through the first quarantine identification barricade system to be set up for smallpox contr ol in North America. Again, it was or ganized medicine that tried to op\u00ad pose him\u2014refused to give the names of patients. How- ever, once it worked and he could demonstrate that it was working, the State Legislatur e took control and ordered physicians to follow his rulings. As we move into the twentieth century in 1919 Califor nia\u2014and very few people know that the State of Califor nia in a popular election voted for universal health care and to create a universal health care sys\u00ad tem in the State\u2014or ganized medicine for med an un\u00ad holy alliance. I say that with the absolute literal meaning of un\u00ad holy alliance, with the Christian Scientist Chur ch mov\u00ad ing to block universal health car e in Califor nia. T ogether , they coined the ter m that has come to be most often pejoratively applied to universal health care, \"social\u00ad ized\" medicine, and successfully r eversed the popular State vote in a second popular State vote. In 1920 in Los Angeles County, which is in yet another major financing crisis for public health, ther e was only one hospital in the county, and it was a very small, fledgling facility, LA County General. With the massive size of this county and the rate of population growth, ther e was a desperate need to create an infra\u00ad structur e of public health clinics spread thr oughout this county. Over and over again, the public health leadership of the city and county tried to get the county board of supervisors to allocate the funds. They wer e quashed and squashed r epeatedly throughout the 1920s and into the 1930s by the American Medical Association, which labeled it unfair competition. We have a long history that takes us up to 1947, a historic tur ning point that r eally decided this struggle between gover nment and public health agencies or serv\u00ad ices and the private physician or or ganized physicians with a balance sheet decidedly on the side of or ganized medicine. That was the Hill-Burton Act of 1946. The Hill-Burton Act had the intention of moder niz\u00ad ing hospitals nationwide, pr oviding Federal funds to APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 43 LAURIE GARRETT bring hospitals up to speed, to build x-ray machines and what was then considered state-of-the-art facilities. The Hill-Burton Act fundamentally changed the power structure. First, it immediately became obvious that physicians who were not affiliated with a Hill-Burton-improved hospital were of lower prestige and esteem in their community. Second, it increased the power of the specialist so that, suddenly, the primary care physician was ancil\u00ad lary in the system and the r eal stars started to rise. They were the entirely hospital-based physicians who had specialties r elying on all the fancy new equipment that the Federal gover nment had paid to put in place. This shift to a hospital-based power structure fun\u00ad damentally altered the clout of public health because it meant that the entire focus was on the hospital, not on the community at lar ge and not on the notion of the primary care physician working out of a stor efront in each little town or each neighborhood. Those people were quickly beginning to disappear . A thir d point touched on in Dr . Satcher's r emarks related to the great racial divides in health marker achievements in our society. The Hill-Burton Act was used to fund construction of segregated hospitals. Throughout the United States, \"whites only\" hospitals received the most Hill-Burton money. Some of the landmark cases that went to the United States Supreme Court and that for med the basis for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in ar guments put forwar d by then V ice President Hubert Humphrey on the floor of the Senate focused on African-American individuals who died in parking lots outside of emer gency r ooms in segr egated Hill-Burton-funded hospitals that denied them car e. Nothing could be further from the model of public health than denying someone admission to an emer \u00ad gency room on the basis of race. Clearly, a dichotomy had been achieved that was of sever e proportions. When I was writing Betrayal of T rust, I was very conscious as I was laying out this very detailed history of how we have reached the sorry state of our public health infrastructur e nationally and globally that many of my remarks wer e going to rub the wrong way for organized medicine. The historical record is the historical r ecord. It is hard to ar gue with it, but, nevertheless, or ganized medi-BETRA YALOFTRUST (EDITED TRANSCRIPT ) cine in this country has never been a big ally of public health, nor would it be likely to find Betrayal of T rust, I thought, a welcome achievement. It was to my astonishment and wonder fully heart- warming surprise to find I was really quite wrong. When I began to go on the lecture cir cuit after r elease of the book and to do grand rounds at medical schools, I sud\u00addenly r ealized just how angry primary car e physicians are in this country\u2014so angry that they ar e willing to entertain public health and think about that notion of a trust. The task now is to figure out wher e the lines ar e and how everything is r eally defined. Not how they have come to be defined inaccurately and mistakenly in the latter half of the 20th century, but what consti\u00ad tutes appropriate definitions of primary care and pub\u00ad lic health as we go into the 21st century. I like to think of public health as a trust enter ed into between the citizenry and the gover nment. The citi\u00ad zenry on its side of the trust says we will abide by those restrictions and health guidelines laid down by gover n\u00ad ment in the voice of public health, and we will pay our taxes to fund that ef fort. That will include agreeing to be vaccinated when indicated, to let strangers come onto our pr operty and inspect our well water , to have auto emission checks on our automobiles, to wear seat belts, and so on. On its side of the trust, gover nment says we will spend money, and that money will be spent to try to ensure the highest possible standards of safety for your air, water or food supply, your children in their schools, and, generally, population-based health. In that trust, primary medical car e delivery obviously plays a role, but what you all will need to explor e in greater depth is exactly where that role fits, wher e the overlaps are, and where the unique positions ar e. We have reached a point in the United States where we have to look at wher e we stand as a healthy soci\u00ad ety, not just the Healthy People report's goals and so on, but also the failur es to achieve past goals laid out in Healthy People . We have never achieved the goals of a single Healthy People report as a society, yet we ar e the biggest spender in the world on health. Last year , according to the Health Car e Finance Administration (HCF A), we spent $1.3 trillion on health in America, constituting 13.3 per cent of our Gr oss 44 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers LAURIE GARRETT Domestic Product (GDP), yet we ranked 24th in the world in disability-adjusted life expectancy and at the very bottom for infant and child mortality achievements in the wealthy world. In contrast, Japan far outlives us and has far out- achieved us by every health marker , and it spends only 7.8 percent of its GDP on health. The UK far outstrips us on all health markers, yet it spends only 6.3 percent of its GDP . HCF A forecasts that by 2010, at our cur - rent rate of health inflation spending, we are going to hit almost 16 per cent of our GDP . You have to ask yourself what's appropriate. Do we want to spend one out of four dollars of our GDP on health? Is that an appropriate ceiling? It is an insane situation when our spending is so out of sync with our achievement levels. Clearly, being out of sync has a lot to do with the fact that we're spending\u2014depending on whose num\u00ad bers you look at\u2014between 30 and 32 percent of our health dollars, $1.3 trillion, on the final 30 days of life and less than two percent on anything that could by the broadest definitions be categorized as public health. We know what has made the difference in life ex\u00ad pectancy in the 20th century. Dr . Satcher said it him- self. It's been basic classic public health interventions, community health-based interventions, yet where we put our dollars is on the exact opposite end. We also have a real cr edibility pr oblem. There have been some questions before about what you would do with curricula and so on. Let's step back for a mo\u00ad ment. In 1993, I was a Fellow in the Harvard School of Public Health, and the first day I arrived, I wandered around. I was in that huge complex that many of you probably know very well on Huntington in Boston. There are the giant white marble structures, one after another , that constitute Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals. I'm looking for the School of Public Health, and I can't find it. I finally see this run-down, beat-up old stucco build\u00ad ing that has an air intake over the motor pool so that everybody in the whole building has carbon monoxide poisoning by 4:00 in the after noon in the School of Public Health. I thought, \"That says it all. The money's over there, not over her e. The prestige is over ther e and not over here.\" That translates, as you get down to the local level, into the dollar for dollar relationship. Y ou want to be BETRA YALOFTRUST (EDITED TRANSCRIPT ) an MD, MPH, and go work in public health? Y ou can expect a top salary in, say, Omaha, Nebraska, of $55,000. Whoopee. Springfield, Illinois, wants a county health director , an MD, Ph.D., for $65,000. Now, what would the local major hospital be offering for the head of the hospital? Stock options plus what, a million dollars a year? This skewing in salary says a gr eat deal about the level of respect. According to the American Public Health Associa\u00ad tion, the average salary for a health commissioner in the Nation is under $100,000 a year . Those are lar gely individuals expected to be dually degr eed as an MD and either an MPH or Ph.D. We were willing to live with all this until anthrax came along. As a Nation, as much as public health might bellyache, ther e really was no challenge funda\u00ad mentally to the situation until anthrax happened, and suddenly members of Congr ess said, \"W ow. There's this thing called public health infrastructur e, and we don't have one.\" Congr ess, as I'm sure anybody here in W ashington knows, likes quick fixes. They wanted to believe that by ordering the rapid manufactur e of smallpox vaccine stockpiles and mass purchase of ciprofloxacin, the threat of bioterrorism was taken car e of. Then it dawned on them that you have to have people who know how to administer smallpox vacci\u00ad nations. Y ou have to have the capacity to mobilize a population, to have them line up in an orderly manner , to keep track of who has and has not had a vaccina\u00ad tion, to track side effects, and to be able to know who may have had a lethal r esponse to the smallpox vacci\u00ad nation. All of a sudden, you've conjur ed up the need for an infrastructure that does not exist. No city in this Nation, including mine, New Y ork, which is pr obably the most public health-activated city in the country, could right now do mass smallpox vac\u00ad cinations under the dur ess of an actual event. If given a few weeks to spread it out, New Y ork could do it. The last time we had the necessity was 1947 when a traveler who had been in Mexico and had acquir ed smallpox on his jour ney came to New Y ork City as a tourist and visited everything from the Statue of Liberty on up before succumbing to smallpox. At that time, coming right out of W orld W ar II, pub\u00ad lic health had a lot of power and r espect in the APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 45 LAURIE GARRETT community. It had certain legal instruments at its hands that no longer exist for almost any public health de\u00ad partment in the entire United States. It was able to order mass vaccination. In less than six weeks, 6.5 million New Y orkers were vaccinated against smallpox. That is not a goal that could be achieved at this moment anywhere in the Nation. W e are not even wher e we were in 1947. The other key point that suddenly is dawning on people in Congress as they contemplate the Fiscal Y ear 2003 budget appropriations is that numer ous studies have been done\u2014the key one is pr obably the Meltzer study fr om the Centers for Disease Control and Pr e\u00ad vention (CDC) about four years ago\u2014that look at the relationship between the speed with which primary car e physicians identify the emer gence, the deliberate re\u00ad lease\u2014they would not necessarily know it was deliber \u00ad ate but the emer gence of an epidemic\u2014and the ca\u00ad pacity to respond and the subsequent cost and life lost. The Meltzer model looked at a cropduster that had the appr opriate nozzle sizes, not the ones Ashcr oft grounded in September . In other words, one had been used to distribute Bacillus Genesis and was now being used for distribution of anthrax bacilli on a population of 100,000 people on a nice calm evening with mul\u00ad tiple passovers by the spraying plane. In that model, if physicians correctly identify the presence of anthrax in a timely fashion and alert their public health system, which then responds in a timely fashion so that within 24 hours of release, ther e is a commencement of pr ophylaxis tr eatment of the popu\u00ad lation, you can keep deaths down to 5,000 at a cost of about $128 million. However , the more likely scenario is that at least six days would elapse before widespread r ecognition and response. At that point, in the Meltzer model, you have 35,000 dead, and it has cost the community $26 bil\u00ad lion to deal with the pr oblem. Clearly, that has prompted some need to see how you cr eate a relationship between the observant pri\u00ad mary care physician and the public health infrastruc\u00ad ture in a true two-way manner . The other thing that we have to look at from this past Fall that should be an eye-opener is that we have absolutely no idea how many millions of Americans went in for ciprofloxacin. W e do know that lots did BETRA YALOFTRUST (EDITED TRANSCRIPT ) because the whole national stockpile of cipr ofloxacin was gone by October 10th. We have no idea and no ability to track what has happened to or ganisms that were exposed to cipro through inappr opriate use last Fall. W e do know one thing. Lots of doctors wr ote prescriptions. Why? How could they possibly justify doing that? How could they possibly justify writing prescriptions for which ther e was no medical indication for such a power ful and vital antibiotic as ciprofloxacin? Number one, if you'r e going to say, \"Oh, my favor \u00ad ite patients I don't want to die of ger m war fare. I'm going to write them a prescription without any medical indication whatsoever ,\" why didn't you use doxycycline? Why did you go to ciprofloxacin? What that said was that there is a huge primary care population that needs some educating. Number two, because we do not have any recipro\u00ad cal relationship between the prescribing physician and the tracking surveillance public health communities, we have no idea who all those people were and no ability to track them and deter mine how much drug resistance we have foster ed. W e do have some models to look at. Cipro was intr oduced by the national health care system in the UK as treatment of choice for gonorrhea in 1991. This is with appropriate indication, a moti\u00ad vated patient population, and a very clear pr otocol for use. Despite those factors, Lancet recently published a study based on Scotland's experience of a steady in- crease in drug resistance, and now mor e than five per - cent of the gonorr hea population is r esistant to cipro. That is with appr opriate use. China, accor ding to Dr . Stuart Levy at T ufts Univer \u00ad sity, has seen its cipr o resistance go from zero detect- able to 60 per cent in five years in the E. coli popula\u00ad tion. There is good reason to believe that we per formed great folly last Fall, but we have no ability to answer the question. I think that alone ought to be quite an eye-opener . Just this week in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report is a report on invasive str ep pneumo\u00ad nia. The r eport is interesting because the intent is to focus on laboratory methods for identification. It notes that less than half of all medical microlabs in the Na\u00ad tion curr ently per form mine 46 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers LAURIE GARRETT whether or not drug-resistant strep pneumonia is in their hospital populations. But mor e interesting to me was that they now esti\u00ad mate that 63,000 cases of invasive str ep occur in the United States annually, resulting in 6,100 deaths. Of those cases, 25 per cent involve penicillin-r esistant strep; 14 percent are multi-drug r esistant. This is part of a lar ger pictur e of what we are see\u00ad ing that ought to r equire ur gently a much mor e inti- mate relationship between the primary car e physician- prescribing population and the public health surveillance population. Overall, it is an old story. W e are losing the efficacy of our antibiotics. It has reached a crisis point already. It's not, \"Oh, my goodness. Some day, they won't work.\" They alr eady are not drug-resistant bacterial noso\u00ad comial r eport of 2001, during the 1990s, 40 million hospitalizations occurr ed in which an individual nosocomially acquired a bacterial infection, 2 million of which wer e drug resistant, and 100,000 of which were lethal. That already constitutes a public health epidemic- level catastrophe. Steven Palunbi at Harvar d Univer \u00ad sity estimates that Staphylococcus aur eus resistance alone is costing us close to $33 billion a year in lost productivity, loss of life, and excessive treatment ne\u00ad cessity. Overall, we have seen infectious disease incidents increase in America at a time when we thought we could lock the book on infectious diseases. Again, a CDC study estimates that, between 1980 and 2000, the numbers of Americans coming down with sever e infectious disease doubled. When I say sever e, I mean requiring hospitalization, which is now at about 170,000 hospitalizations for infectious diseases. Another place of needed inter face is Semmelweiss sanitary practices. What we are seeing is that the diffi\u00ad culty of hospital ecology is rising, obviously in lar ge part because of our aging population. More and more people have very complicated chronic disease problems. They ar e in the hospital with heart problems, but they have underlying diabetes. Perhaps two years ago, they underwent chemotherapy for some for m of cancer . We have got these patients now clogging up our hospital r ooms. They are on mul-BETRA YALOFTRUST (EDITED TRANSCRIPT ) tiple IV drips, catheters, shunts, every imaginable bridge between their exter nal ecology and inter nal ecology. Then, we have a nursing shortage, and we are push\u00ad ing our nurses to work har der and harder on more pa\u00ad tients and to do it all faster . We are not reimbursing managed car e for a lot of hospital tests. In fact, the physician is being ur ged to minimize the number of lab tests he or she or ders. Ther e is mor e and more operat\u00ad ing in the blind. Do we have a drug-r esistant or ganism here, or is this just a really sick patient with no immune response? Should I just go ahead and shoot in the dark? Or do we actually send to the lab and find out what the resistance patter ns are that are floating ar ound in our hospital? What we see clearly is that we have a br eakdown in standar d universal pr ecautions in our hospital environ\u00ad ments. An inter esting study published in Lancet last year compared United States and European hospitals. Those that underwent extensive full-year -long, staff-wide training\u2014 I mean just drilling it in\u2014achieved 81 per - cent infection contr ol, meaning that they got 81 per - cent compliance acr oss the board thr ough all proce\u00ad dures. In typical U.S. hospitals, only 12 percent achieved infection contr ol. W orse, 40 per cent is the average compliance level in U.S. hospitals. As we ar e interested in dentistry her e, I'll r emind you that it is practically a blink of an eye in time ago that we had the Acer case in Florida. Remember Kimberly Ber galis? How could we for get? The Acer case in Florida in which six patients seeing the same dentist came down with a genetically identical strain of HIV. Acer succumbed without giving us his records or much infor mation. The key point her e is how vigor ously many dental organizations opposed imposition of universal precau\u00ad tions and with what anger many oral sur geons insisted that what r eally ought to be done is to test the entir e patient population and not tr eat the ones that ar e HIV positive. It is not that long ago that we had orthopedic sur \u00ad geons showing up in space suits because they did not want to risk getting HIV rather than understanding universal precautions and recognizing that risk is al\u00ad ways there. It is not just HIV . It is hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and on and on, and it ought to be everybody's mandate to make the hospital ecology the safest possible ecology, APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 47 LAURIE GARRETT not just for the health pr ovider but for the entir e pa\u00ad tient population, visiting family members, and the com\u00ad munity at lar ge. There is an obvious place to increase relations between public health and primary care and secondary and tertiary care. We have some acute shortages of instruments used by primary care services for public health good as well as individual good, the most outrageous being our pertus\u00ad sis-diphtheria-tetanus vaccine shortage and, every year , our later and later availability of flu vaccine. Globally, we are in desperate need of meningococcal vaccine. We have now a thr ee-years-long-running meningi\u00ad tis epidemic in W est Africa. W e now have an epidemic in West Africa of yellow fever for the first time in sev\u00ad eral decades, and it tur ns out we ar e out of yellow fever vaccine. There is an obvious bridge there between primary care and public health in ter ms of bringing pressure to bear to identify the reasons for these shortages and try to come up with appr opriate legislative and policy ini\u00ad tiatives that could stop gap these pr oblems. We have the possibility of the infusion of an ex\u00ad traordinary amount of cash into public health in the next 24 months. If the Bush budget pr oposal goes through for FY 2003, we are looking at about a billion dollars suddenly available for States and localities to improve public health. This is all with bioterrorism as the framework. It is a good news/bad news story. The good news is that finally somebody in political power recognizes that there is a need for public health infrastructure, that ther e is a crisis that calls for that need on a more immediate basis, and that it is going to take some money. The bad news is that there is always the threat that it is going to skew everything to one pr oblem, bioterr orism, as if that problem exists in isolation, as if there wer e no overlaps, as if it had nothing to do with the health of populations as a whole on an ongoing basis. I already am hearing now from public health de\u00ad partments all over America of staff members who do nothing but go to bioterr orism meetings all day, every day. I hear fr om hospitals the same complaint: \"Our infectious disease staff is constantly in bioterrorism meetings.\" That's great, but who's tracking HIV and other infectious diseases? BETRA YALOFTRUST (EDITED TRANSCRIPT ) That also poses a problem because, for public health to have a str ong infrastructural response to bioterrorist threat, public health has to be able to work with its counterparts in law enforcement. Public health has credibility pr oblems in many of the underserved com\u00ad munities of this country alr eady. And to the degree that public health and primary car e are seen as wed\u00ad ded to police forces or the FBI, credibility will be even harder to maintain in communities that feel they ar e targets of the police and the FBI on an ongoing daily basis. So, finally, wher e does that take us? What do we need? As I said before, primary car e physicians are angry right now. They have taken salary cuts. They have seen their workload incr ease. They have had a loss of control, even down to literally what procedur es they are allowed to per form on individual patients based on that patient's insurance company's pr ovisos. And they are seeing frustrating community-based health pr oblems that they cannot alone address and that they ar e not getting reimbursed for taking the time to try to address. For example, everybody involved in HIV care has seen this sur ge of unsafe sexual practices among men who know they are HIV positive but have decided that drug tr eatment is making them feel terrific, and it is not really a lethal disease, and the heck with it. They are back out ther e, and they are spreading drug-resis\u00ad tant strains of HIV and primary infection. The obvious solution that would benefit both public health and individual patients is for primary car e physi\u00ad cians to take time when HIV patients come back for another blood work-up and perhaps a change to an- other protease inhibitor in their cocktail, or what have you, to r emind them of their social r esponsibility\u2014that they are a member of a society and they must use a condom every time they have sex with a partner . No exceptions. Physicians don't get r eimbursed for that time. Our society does not reward the doctor who takes another 20 minutes to lecture that patient and try to make that patient be part of a social envir onment. So we have a real failur e here, a system failur e, as Dr . Satcher put it. What would make some dif ferences? I would love to see mor e concretizing of some initial bridges put in place last Fall because of anthrax in New Y ork and because of W est Nile virus. 48 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers LAURIE GARRETT I would love to see things like daily communications between public health and emer gency rooms, infec\u00ad tious disease departments, hospital director's of fices, and primary car e physician offices infor ming of out- break tr ends, of drug r esistance trends, with a r eal re\u00ad ciprocal flow of infor mation that is concretized. There is also a r eal need to look at several of these computer algorithm systems to see which ones will work for syndr omic surveillance in hospital settings and clini\u00ad cal settings so that it is possible not to have to wait for individuals to become so sick that we are r eferring lab samples to the CDC to deter mine if it is anthrax. Putting in computer systems that can spot syndromic patter ns emer ging in hospitals in a community and having that analysis available in r eal time to both pub\u00ad lic health analysts and health providers would go a long way towards cr eating better bridges and a more rapid awareness in surveillance of what's going on. A sense of intellectual parity and mutual respect will go even further . It is hard to have intellectual parity when you do not have economic parity. It is har d to see eye to eye between communities that have a his- tory of tension. Unless there can be some sense of mutual r espect, public health and primary car e are al\u00ad ways going to be at odds. I will just close with one final anecdote. When Kathy Nguyen, a medical clerk at Manhattan Eye and Ear , BETRA YALOFTRUST (EDITED TRANSCRIPT ) came down with inhalational anthrax, CDC and the New Y ork City Health Department swooped in both at her hospital and at Lennox Hill, wher e she had gone for tr eatment. They immediately started per forming nasal swabs on a randomized population group and conducting swabs at her worksite to deter mine poten\u00ad tial extent of exposur e. I have never run acr oss an angrier potential patient population than the physicians working at Manhattan Eye and Ear and Lennox Hill, all of whom insisted, \"But they didn't swab me.\" Now, what is a nasal swab during an outbr eak? It is not diagnostic. It is not going to tell you that you have or have not been exposed to anthrax. It is pur ely a surveillance epidemiological tool. The fact that the physician population could not understand that and that they raised true anger with some thr eats of lawsuits against the CDC and the City Health Department tells you how wide the gap of un\u00ad derstanding is. Her e was epidemiology on one side and individual car e on the other side, and the two just were not communicating. Interestingly, the postal workers seem to have un\u00ad derstood what the nasal swapping was much more rap- idly than did the physician population. That illustrates just how wide the gap might be and tells us also what some of our tar get might be. APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 49 Doug Campos-Out calt, M.D., M.P .A.

THE CHALLENGE OF REFORMING EDUCA TION T O IMPR OVE ACCESS TO UNIFIED INTERDISCIPLINAR Y PUBLIC HEAL TH SER VICES FOR PEOPLE IN UNDERSER VED RURAL AND URB AN COMMUNITIES by Doug Campos-Outcalt Introduction Public health and primary care ar e natural allies. Both ar e mor e effective and achieve more when they work collaboratively, but collaboration often does not occur . Each field has evolved separately, is taught in separate colleges, and is practiced in dif ferent settings and systems with dif ferent incentives and goals. What I hope to do in this article is suggest ways we can begin to bridge these separations. I will first sug\u00adgest a definition for public health, which will serve as the foundation for the rest of the discussion. It will in\u00ad clude not only what public health is and does, but also what it is not. I will then describe suggested roles for primary car e clinicians in systems that enhance col\u00ad laboration and will finish with a pr eliminary set of skills and knowledge for dif ferent levels of expertise and with training options for achieving them. I will admit from the outset that many of these ideas are in an early stage of evolution. I am sure the discus\u00ad sions at this meeting will help refine them. 50 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of TION TO IMPRO VEACCESS TO INTERDISCIPLINAR Y PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES FOR PEOPLE IN UNDERSER VED RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES What is Public Health? Public health is the discipline that pr omotes and protects the health of the whole public. The Core Pub\u00ad lic Health Functions Steering Committee, established by the Public Health Service, constructed a list of 10 essential public health functions, shown in T able 1 (See page 53).1 These 10 functions allow public health to prevent epidemics and the spread of disease, pr otect against environmental hazar ds, prevent injuries, pro- mote healthy behaviors, r espond to disasters and assist in recovery from disasters, and assur e the quality and accessibility of health services. The Institute of Medicine Work Group on the Futur e of Public Health condensed these functions into thr ee broader areas of responsibil\u00ad ity: assessment, policy development, and assurance.2 Public health is not and should not be equated with publicly funded safety net health care. While safety net health care is an important function and contributes to better overall public health pr oviding medical services to those who lack access to other sources of care is a medical system function, based on a medical model of individual car e. Public health is population based; the patient is the entir e community. Equating public health with safety net medical serv\u00ad ices causes two pr oblems. It obscures the main func\u00ad tions of public health, so that the many public health activities, which are actually more important in achiev\u00ading improved overall community health status, are un\u00ad der-recognized and under-appreciated. It also causes, like it or not, a lack of support for public health among those who do not need these safety net services. Public health has been undervalued the past half century be- cause many in society cannot see its relevance to them. In a way, public health has been a victim of its own success; the more a disease or condition is controlled or improved, the less obvious is the need for the inter \u00ad vention. The fundamental tool of public health is epidemiol\u00ad ogy. The classic public health approach to a problem is to use epidemiology to first study and define it and find the cause, then to intervene to address the cause, and, finally, to evaluate to see if the problem improves. The interventions available include laws, regulations, product design, immunization, antibiotics, taxes, and education, to name a few. This list makes some un\u00ad comfortable. It smacks of gover nment and gover nment interference. The r eality is that many public health ac tivi\u00adties often involve gover nment and gover nment inter \u00ad ference. The factor that frequently deter mines what public health is able to accomplish is how much inter \u00ad ference with individual freedom the public is willing to accept in or der to improve the health and protection of the whole community. Public health has historically involved using police powers to pr otect the commu\u00ad nity. The public wants public health officials to have and to use these powers when necessary, but not to abuse them. While education to affect individual and community choices is an important tool, the sad truth is that, in many instances, the mor e individual choice can be elimi\u00ad nated from the equation, the better the outcome will be. This seems so counter -intuitive to our individualis\u00ad tic American values that mer ely stating it often evokes hostile r eactions. But let me provide some illustrations. At the end of the last century, the Centers for Dis\u00ad ease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of articles on major public health accomplishments of the past 100 years .3 The list includes what some ex\u00ad perts consider to be the interventions that have been the most important in impr oving the public's health: immunizations, contr ol of infectious disease (which has been due to sanitation, clean water , and impr oved liv\u00ad ing conditions), motor vehicle safety, consumer prod\u00ad uct safety, food safety and impr oved nutrition, fluori\u00ad dation of water , cardiovascular disease reduction, tobacco control, and healthier mothers and babies. A close look at the accomplishments on this list and study of the methods used to achieve them will show that very few depended on individuals making corr ect choices. Do we allow individuals to decide to build or buy houses without sanitation and clean water? Do we allow parents to decide if their childr en should be im\u00ad munized before attending public school? (Although more complex than time allows us to explore, the thrust behind school immunization laws, despite individual opt- out options, is to compel immunization.) Do we edu\u00adcate employers about work place safety and then leave it to them to do right? One of the major challenges facing public health today is chronic disease. Much of the bur den of chr onic disease is caused by individually chosen lifestyles or a series of choices over time. The public is willing to ac\u00adcept only so much gover nment inter ference with these choices. The only tool left to us is education, which will APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers EDUCA TION TO IMPRO VEACCESS TO INTERDISCIPLINAR Y PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES FOR PEOPLE IN UNDERSER VED RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES achieve some benefits, but not to the degree possible if there were a r egulatory or legal impact point. This new frontier for public health will be a continuation of the constant tension between the right of the individual and the good of the community. The major difference is that, other than the economic impact of chr onic dis\u00ad ease, these individual choices do not affect others, and, consequently, ther e is much less traction for the ar gu\u00ad ment that choice should be limited. The Inter face of Primary Car e and Public Health Public health involves the care of the community; primary car e involves the care of individuals. But the community consists of a number of individuals, so syn\u00ad ergy should be possible. The most effectively integrated system of public health and primary care I have ever seen was the Maricopa County Department of Health in the early 1980s. It consisted of 12 primary car e clinics, located throughout the county, and the Public Health Depart\u00ad ment, located in central Phoenix. The clinics were un\u00adder the direction of the Public Health Department and provided one-stop shopping for all public health serv\u00adices in a primary care setting including the W omen, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, well child care, immunizations, pr evention services for adults, preven\u00ad tion-oriented primary care services, family planning, prenatal care, tuber culosis (TB) tr eatment, and sexu\u00ad ally transmitted disease (STD) treatment. Each clinic had a public health nurse who pr ovided home health care and follow-up as needed. The nurse also served as a social worker and as someone with a finger on the pulse of the community. Such public health nursing has recently been pr oven to be a very ef fective intervention with long-ter m community and individual benefits . 4, 5 The Public Health Department supervised the car e in the clinics and provided clinical guidelines and the latest recommendations fr om CDC to the clinicians. If a community outbr eak of infectious disease occurred, the clinics were the locations where individuals wer e sent for evaluation, tr eatment, and immunizations, all under the direction of public health officials who wer e in close contact with the clinicians. Regular training was provided for the staff on public health topics and on primary car e clinical updates. Unfortunately, the system was dismantled. When Arizona initiated a Medicaid pr ogram in 1982, it started with a pr e-paid, capitated system in\u00ad volving competitive bids fr om private and public sys\u00ad tems. Since its beginning, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System has been administered by a sepa\u00ad rate State agency having little concer n for public health issues. Its r ole is to oversee the medical care provided by managed car e companies. Maricopa County for med a managed care health plan and competed with the private sector . The clinics were taken out of the Public Health Department and given to the County Hospital and Health Plan to ad- minister . Over time, the public health functions wer e physically r emoved from the clinics, and patients left the system, choosing private providers. (I am not im\u00adplying that these two trends ar e causally r elated.) T o- day, there is in one building a Department of Public Health that provides categorical clinics for TB, STDs, family planning, and r efugee health care. Immuniza\u00ad tions ar e provided in shopping malls, chur ches, and the like, sporadically at each location. No general pub\u00adlic health nursing remains. The 12 clinics pr ovide medi\u00ad cal care only. This story is an example of a nationwide tr end of the public sector decr easing or eliminating its health care responsibilities and of public health remaining as an inadequately funded function. The new appr ecia\u00ad tion for the importance of public health, r esulting fr om the events of the Fall of 2001 and the r eality of the threat of bioterr orism, of fers some hope that the pub\u00ad lic health infrastructur e will be augmented. This im\u00ad provement can be used for dual purposes\u2014bioterrorism prepar edness and other important public health func\u00ad tions. It will not, however , solve the problem of the uninsur ed and underinsured. Public health now must find ways to for m collabo\u00ad rative relationships with systems of care and providers. I use the word \"system\" purposefully. The literatur e is quite clear that to impr ove pr ocess and outcomes, sys\u00ad tems, not individual practitioners, need to be ad-dressed. 6-9 Public health should work with systems and the clinicians that practice in them to for m collabora\u00ad tive r elationships that benefit both. Here again, the threat of bioterr orism may provide the impetus. Prior to 9-11-01, at least in our community, hospitals and 52 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of TION TO IMPRO VEACCESS TO INTERDISCIPLINAR Y PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES FOR PEOPLE IN UNDERSER VED RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES health plans had little inter est in any real collaboration with the Public Health Department, but they now have much interest. This opportunity should not be lost. The Role of Primary Car e Clinicians in Public Health Primary car e clinicians and public health staff have different jobs that requir e different skills. It is my belief that we should not try to make public health workers out of primary car e clinicians. Public health should work with clinicians to make their contribution to the health of the public mor e effective and to incr ease their col\u00ad laboration with public health staff. What exactly should the public health role of pri\u00ad mary care clinicians be? I can think of five primary func\u00ad tions: 1. Implementing recommended pr eventive serv\u00ad ices. 2. Serving as the foundation of the surveillance system. 3. Appr opriately referring to the public health department. 4. Accepting referrals from the public health department. 5. A voiding counter -public health activities. Counter -public health activities include incorrect treatment for TB and STDs (and ar guing about it when it is pointed out); lack of r ecognition of diseases or the potential for diseases of public health importance (e.g., not knowing that rash and fever might be measles or rubella); failure to report r eportable diseases; lack of infection control measur es; communicating inaccurate information to patients or , worse yet, to the public; and der ogatory remarks about the public health de\u00ad partment. To help clinicians with this per ceived role, I suggest four levels of public health expertise: basic, inter medi\u00ad ate, advanced, and leadership. All primary care clini\u00ad cians should have basic expertise. Inter mediate exper \u00ad tise could be the goal of those having mor e direct involvement with public health, such as sentinel clini\u00adcians and health plan medical dir ectors. Advanced train\u00ad ing would be advisable for those serving as consultants or community-based medical dir ectors to public health departments. Those aspiring to public health leader - ship should have advanced training. The knowledge and skills to be taught for each level ar e contained in Table 2 (See pages 54-55). The options for achieving these levels should in\u00ad clude the standard approaches plus new methods to assist those who ar e practitioners with time constraints. The array of possibilities includes full- and part-time fellowships, r esidencies, W eb-based courses, telecon\u00ad ference courses, and on-site practical experiences. Benchmarks of achievement could include standard degrees (e.g., Bachelor's, Master's), Board certification, and other ability-based certificates. Conclusion Public health and primary car e are natural allies in the struggle to impr ove health. For the two fields to work pr oductively and collaboratively, each must un\u00ad derstand what the other does. I have tried to pr ovide a description of what public health is, what it is not, and how public health and primary car e can be integrated. I have advocated for the training of individuals and for interventions with systems to impr ove per formance. I have suggested four levels of public health expertise for primary care clinicians and listed the skills and knowl\u00ad edge needed to r each them. Finally, I have listed a few ways in which training can occur . I expect that in this workshop, we will debate and impr ove these ideas and begin to elaborate on the details.

W ard, Ph.D., R.N. THE CHALLENGE OF REFORMING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE TO FOSTER THE DELIVER Y OF PRIMAR Y CARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH INTERDISCIPLINAR Y TEAMS BIOGRAPHY Dr. Debbie W ard is associate pr ofessor and vice chair of the Department of Community Health Care Sys\u00ad tems and an adjunct associate professor in W omen Stud\u00ad ies at the University of W ashington in Seattle. After obtaining a Bachelor's degree in gover nment fr om Oberlin College, she worked as a home health aide in rural Connecticut. She then ear ned a Master's degree in nursing from Y ale University and a Ph.D. in health policy from Boston University, where she was a Pew Doctoral Fellow. Early in her career , she trained and practiced as a family nurse practitioner in the inner city clinic of the Yale-New Haven Medical Center and as a solo geriat\u00ad ric practitioner in a public health department in Hart- ford. Her resear ch and practice inter ests include public health policy and politics, unpaid and low-wage caregiving, and health service delivery in the United States. Dr. Ward is involved both locally and nationally in the changing for mat and content of health service de- livery. She has been active in applying practical com\u00adputer skills and W eb-based instruction to professional education and has received several awards for outstand\u00ading teaching, both fr om Y ale University and the Uni\u00ad versity of W ashington. In addition to teaching about health politics, policy, and systems, she is director of the de T ornyay Center on Healthy Aging and is a mem\u00ad ber and immediate past chair of the consumer -elected board of trustees of Group Health Cooperative, the Pacific Northwest's pioneering health maintenance organization. With Dr . Daniel Lessler , she co-directs a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-sponsor ed curriculum project to foster collaboration between academic medi\u00adcal centers and managed care or ganizations. The project is designed to improve both health education and pa\u00adtient care by health care professionals. This Partner - ships in Quality Education pr oject, entitled T ake Car e to Lear n: Teaching Clinical Car e Management, focuses not only on the improvement of primary car e medical education, but also on the design of new appr oaches to prepare nurse practitioners and medical students for collaborative interpr ofessional practice. As a leader in inter disciplinary education and prac\u00ad tice, Dr . Ward is also a cor e faculty affiliate of the Uni\u00ad versity of W ashington Center for Health Sciences Interprofessional Education, which supports interprofessional education and r esearch across the University of W ashington Health Sciences and Infor \u00ad mation Schools. THE CHALLENGE OF REFORMING EDUCA TION AND PRA CTICE TO FOSTER THE DELIVER Y OF PRIMAR Y CARE AND PUBLIC HEAL TH SER VICES THROUGH INTERDISCIPLINAR Y TEAMS by Bobbie Berkowitz and Debbie W ard Introduction We want to thank Dr . Denise Rogers and the Advi\u00ad sory Committee on T raining in Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry (ACTPCMD) for inviting us to write to and subsequently meet with you. Let us tell you a little about ourselves to establish our bona fides or at least give some plausibility to our speculations. Bobbie Berkowitz speaks fr om the standpoint of both public policy and public health. For merly a deputy director of the W ashington State Health Department, Bobbie has several current r oles, one of which is directing the T urn\u00ad ing Point Program Office for the Robert W ood Johnson Foundation (RWJF). Turning Point is an initiative to \"transfor m and strengthen the public health infrastructure\" to enable States, local communities, and their public health agencies to respond to the challenge of pr otecting 58 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers DEBBIE WARD THE CHALLENGE OF REFORMING EDUCA TION AND PRACTICE TO FOSTER THE DELIVER YOF PRIMAR Y CARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH INTERDISCIPLINAR YTEAMS and improving the public's health in the 21st century (Nicola, Berkowitz, and Lafronza, 2002). A regular visi\u00ad tor and consultant to the public health agencies of vir \u00ad tually every State, Bobbie is uniquely well infor med about the public health enterprise. Debbie W ard is a nurse and has two sight lines into health care relevant to your purposes: one is as the immediate past chair of the Board of Group Health Cooperative, a leading not-for-profit health maintenance or ganization (HMO); the second is as co-principle investigator (PI) of an inter - professional training grant, part of the RWJF Partner - ships in Quality Education program. W e hope our back- grounds and various experiences make us helpful contributors to your deliberations. The Issue You want to address the challenges of refor ming education and practice to foster collaboration and co\u00ad operation between public health and primary car e. Recent public health emer gencies loom lar ge in the public consciousness (and in the motivations for open\u00ad ing the public purse), but as V ictor Sidel, for mer Presi\u00ad dent of the American Public Health Association (APHA) and pillar of Physicians for Social Responsibility has exhorted, the focus on bioterrorism runs the risk of under cutting the more substantive goals of public health (Sidel, 2002). These long-standing and still unmet goals include addr essing multiple deter minants of health, especially social and environmental factors, as well as population-center ed issues in both acute infectious dis\u00ad eases and chronic illnesses. Some History Your concer ns with building collaboration between the primary care enterprise and the public health en\u00ad terprise have important predecessors. The R WJF launched the Medicine/Public Health Initiative near the beginning of 1994 with the goal of promoting collabo\u00ad rative interactions among medical and public health professionals. This initiative was the catalyst for the creation of the Pocket Guide to Medicine and Public Health Collaborations (Lasker , Abramson, and Free- man, 1998). The Pocket Guide is a comprehensive look at case studies of investments and commitments to cross-sectoral collaboration between public health and medicine. The Medicine/Public Health Initiative was led by the American Medical Association and the APHA . These two national or ganizations understood that they each had a stake in improving the health of the public. They also had a stake in providing leadership to the disciplines of medicine and public health in for ming alliances in practice, education, and r esearch that would lead to new ways of facing the challenges in health and health care. Lasker (1997) pr oposed a set of actions oriented toward collaboration among the medicine and public health sectors based on the work of the Medi\u00ad cine/Public Health Initiative: Increase awareness and understanding of strategies for medicine and public health collaboration among medical and public health pr ofessionals. Legitimize the collaborative approach among health professions in medicine and public health. Provide the individuals practicing in the fields of medicine and public health with tools to help ini\u00adtiate and sustain collaborative relationships. Identify and addr ess barriers to cross-sectoral col\u00ad laboration in policy. In 1996 another significant development in collabo\u00ad ration occurred: the implementation of T urning Point: Collaborating for a New Century in Public Health, an initiative funded by the R WJF and the W . K. 2002). Like the Medicine/Public Health Initiative, Turning Point was built on the pr emise that collabo\u00ad ration between the public health enterprise and the multi-faceted illness care system was not mer ely nec\u00ad essary but imperative for impr ovement in the public's health. The T urning Point initiative was created for the purpose of str engthening the public health infrastruc\u00ad ture through the collaboration of the many stakehold\u00ad ers in the health and health care system. Public health, health care, community-based agencies, business, faith- based or ganizations, educational entities, and gover n\u00ad ment agencies have collaborated in planning and stra\u00ad tegic development of health system impr ovements in 23 States and numer ous agencies throughout the Na\u00ad tion. T o be successful in strengthening the public health infrastructure, it has become evident that leadership from the health care and public health disciplines is necessary so that true collaboration can occur . Even APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 59 DEBBIE WARD THE CHALLENGE OF REFORMING EDUCA TION AND PRACTICE TO FOSTER THE DELIVER YOF PRIMAR Y CARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH INTERDISCIPLINAR YTEAMS more significant is the realization that the principles of collaborative leadership ar e important to develop and sustain public health systems change. Collaborative lead\u00adership empowers stakeholders to advance ongoing as\u00adsessment of the challenges and opportunities faced by medicine and public health, to develop a shared vision of how the future of health and health care could look, and to share planning, decision making, and resourc es among stakeholders. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report Improving Health in the Community: A Role for Per formance Monitoring (Durch, Bailey, and Stoto, 1997) also called on the many stakeholders in the health and health car e system to engage in partnership opportunities. These opportunities would be aimed at the development of community-based health improvement strategies that could operationalize a broad definition of health and a comprehensive conceptual model of how health is ac\u00ad tually produced. One of the many recommendations from this report included this strategy for education: \"Educational programs for pr ofessionals in public health, medicine, nursing, health administration, pub\u00ad lic management, and related fields should include com\u00ad munity health impr ovement pr ocess concepts their curriculum for preservice and midcar eer students.\" Given these initiatives, r eports, and r ecommenda\u00ad tions, what sorts of proposals might your Advisory Committee craft? A Wealth of Pr ofessions to Collaborate First, you have myriad disciplines on which to call. One list might include dentistry, medicine, nursing, nutrition, occupational therapy, phar macy, physician assistant programs, physical therapy, public health, and social work. If you add bioinfor matics to the list, you would have the make-up of a four -year ef fort in interpr ofessional training at the University of W ashing- ton. Originally funded by the University President's of\u00ad fice, this group has received subsequent funding from the Macy Foundation and Health Resources and Serv\u00ad ices Administration (HRSA). The addition of bio\u00ad informatics to the list is key and may be one particular channel through which to build particularly effective collaboration, as multiple disciplines are looking to new modes and understanding of infor mation collection and transfer . Your workgroup is specifically considering the question of how to use new technologies in fostering collaboration. W eb-based curricula are one obvious example, and the collaborative effect is, of course, en\u00adhanced if such curricula are the pr oduct of interprofes\u00ad sional work groups. Your workgr oup asks how to accomplish r ole defi\u00ad nition as multiple players are br ought together . From our experience in interpr ofessional work, it is useful to lay out for all players the statutory and pr ofessional association language that defines each profession. But having once laid out the legal and pr ofessional bound\u00ad aries, much subsequent team building is requir ed to blur those boundaries and make true collaboration oc\u00adcur. The function of the team may be best established in relation to the problem being addressed (e.g., ad- dressing diabetes or per forming a community assess\u00ad ment). Then there is r oom for negotiation of roles. It is our experience that coming together ar ound specific projects, with limited attention paid to roles and maxi- mum attention paid to repeated opportunities to work together , has led to sincere appreciation of role variety and the now reflexive behavior of tur ning to colleagues for answers rather than trying to supply them all alone. Your very committee, of course, is clearly bounded, with some pr ofessions in and others outside your legis\u00ad lated spher e. Your November 2001 report states that \"inter disciplinary,\" in your language, is limited to the occupants of your silo: \"The Advisory Committee wishes to str ess that 'interdisciplinary' in this context means training and practice appr oaches involving more than one medical discipline, medical disciplines work\u00ading with physician assistants, medical and dental disci\u00adplines working together , or any combination of the above\" (ACTPCMD, 2001, p. 7). But for the purposes of this new r ound of proposed collaboration, this limi\u00ad tation can no longer hold. Ar e you enjoined from mak\u00ad ing explicit a commitment to the lar gest possible interdisciplinarity? Do you place your constituencies at risk of losing money from T itle VII if your pr ofessional boundaries are br eached? Promising Strategies HRSA B ASED In the long ter m, separate silos of funding for health care professions cannot help but thwart the develop ment of the teams long felt to be essential to impr oved pub\u00ad lic health and illness car e. Partnerships will not be built 60 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers DEBBIE WARD THE CHALLENGE OF REFORMING EDUCA TION AND PRACTICE TO FOSTER THE DELIVER YOF PRIMAR Y CARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH INTERDISCIPLINAR YTEAMS until these silos ar e opened, if not crumbled. HRSA itself r ecognizes this issue and has funded interpr o\u00ad fessional pr ojects such as a grant for Interprofessional Leadership in Patient Safety, which we now have at the University of W ashington. The Request for Pro\u00ad posals mandated the inclusion of at least nursing and medicine in the education of faculty, who, in tur n, would educate their trainees in patient safety. Funding mechanisms that mandate interpr ofessional collaboration should be promoted. Just as HRSA man- dated nursing and medicine to work together in the patient safety arena, so could it be mandated that train\u00ad ing grants in primary care, for example, include com\u00ad munity assessments carried out by collaborative groups of primary car e providers and public health experts. Potential HRSA-sponsor ed activities could include this sampling: Training grant opportunities with collaboration man- dated between public health and primary care train\u00ad ees, including cross-or ganizational planning and operations Short courses or institutes for public health and pri\u00ad mary car e professionals Epidemiology updates (or primers) for primary car e professionals and evidence-based medicine or chr onic illness care updates for public health pr ofessionals Sponsorship of the development and testing of in\u00adnovative curricula in public health for primary car e providers Funded opportunities for joint clinical work as a part of residency training, including experiences based in public health agencies Creation of academic health center data centers that could bank public health and health services data for joint exploration by faculty and students from multiple health professions. OUTSIDE HRSA In the world of private foundations, RWJF is pursu\u00ad ing the goal of interpr ofessional training in their Part\u00ad nerships in Quality Education pr ogram (PQE) (www.pqe.or g). The program office, headed by Dr . Gordon Moor e, has led several rounds of funding. One was to give small amounts ($30,000 over two years) to multiple training programs for nurse practitioners (NPs) and residents. While the two professionals did not nec\u00ad essarily work together in the pr ojects (which were in- tended to incr ease trainees' abilities to work in man- aged care settings), it did bring the pr ogram leaders together for joint awar dee meetings and the subsequent fostering of collaboration. PQE later awarded lar ger amounts in a r ound of funding aimed exclusively at interprofessional gr oups. Debbie W ard has been a PI in both varieties: a small grant, which enabled the im\u00adproved education of NP students in managed car e set\u00ad tings and a lar ger grant co-led with a physician col\u00ad league. In this latter effort, the intent is to improve the care of diabetic patients by resident physicians and NP students in primary care settings. While this model does not explicitly include public health, it nonetheless mod\u00ad els collaborative training thr ough modest awar ds ($300,000 for a two-year training grant). In arranging for our pr oject to bring primary care medical students together in clinic settings, we have encounter ed multiple, on-the-ground barriers to interprofessional care. For example, the Medicar e rules for resident precepting place demands on physician preceptors such that they cannot pr ecept NP or physi\u00ad cian assistant students in addition to resident physicians. These experiences lead us to realize that building interprofessional teams calls for boundary cr ossing at many levels. Whether it is ACTPCMD or some other group actively promoting collaboration between public health and health care, the following could be at- tempted: Work with professional or ganizations like the Ameri\u00ad can Academy of Family Physicians to encourage collaboration as a professional standar d of practice. Work with certification and educational or ganiza\u00ad tions like the accrediting bodies for schools of pub\u00adlic health to mandate collaborative experiences as a part of professional and educational accr editation. Work with trade associations such as the American Association of Health Plans (the lar ge managed care trade gr oup) to build public health consciousness into the mission of health plans. Begin work with the smaller trade associations of non-pr ofit HMOs to encourage publicly minded or \u00ad ganizations to build alliances with community and public health agencies. APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 61 DEBBIE WARD THE CHALLENGE OF REFORMING EDUCA TION AND PRACTICE TO FOSTER THE DELIVER YOF PRIMAR Y CARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH INTERDISCIPLINAR YTEAMS Movement toward the objectives and recommenda\u00ad tions of the initiatives we recounted\u2014initiatives that call for the collaboration among health and health car e professionals\u2014has been slow. Clearly, there are sig\u00adnificant barriers that must be taken into consideration. Challenges Several sets of challenges face the fostering of the delivery of primary car e and public health services through interdisciplinary teams. One is related to the nature of the thr eats to population health. A second relates to the values and nor ms of public health and health car e. And a third reflects the decentralized, acute- care focus of the majority of health care expenditures. The r esponsiveness of health and health care to threats to health can be gauged in part by examining our pr ogress on the health objectives for the Nation as described in Healthy People 2010 (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 2000). Berkowitz, Ivory, and Morris (2002) reviewed the Healthy People 2010 document for those objectives for which the health sta\u00ad tus data showed a decline away from the tar get goals. The results of this review included a number of indica\u00ad tors that require a system-wide approach for improve\u00ad ment e.g., asthma in African Americans, blood lead concentration, and mater nal mortality rates. A system wide approach, as suggested by the IOM Report Im\u00ad proving Health in the Community (Durch, Bailey, and Stoto, 1997) would begin with a coor dinated assess\u00ad ment at the community level to deter mine the popula\u00ad tions at risk, the extent of the problem, and opportuni\u00adties for improvement. Such examination of community health status can best be done by an inter disciplinary team having expertise in population health, preven\u00ad tion strategies, and clinical management of acute and chronic disease. An interdisciplinary team of public health and primary care providers having the training to examine community health status and develop evi\u00ad dence-based strategies for improvement partnered with community members could make a power ful contribu\u00ad tion to managing these national objectives. The values and nor ms of public health and health care repr esent potential barriers to creating these kinds of inter disciplinary teams. Integrating functions among public health and health car e systems, such as data collection and analysis and managing population health status, has made limited progr ess. The integration and interaction of public health and health car e would be most useful at the community level. Halverson, et. al., (1997) have developed a model for how this integra\u00ad tion might occur . The authors r ecommended that op\u00ad portunities be developed in which health plans and public health can exchange knowledge and expertise and for m alliances to deliver health services to a de- fined population. W elton, Kantner , and Katz (1997) noted, however , that these types of models face chal\u00ad lenges because of differing perspectives between pub\u00ad lic health and health care, such as a conceptual gap between primary care physicians and public health pr o\u00ad fessionals r elated to practice, critical health problems, and the focus of interventions. Additionally, critical barriers exist at the policy and financial levels. The financing mechanisms of U.S. ill\u00ad ness car e are growing in their perversity. The predicted move to defined contribution is not yet taking place, but the retr eat to fee-for -service (although discounted) is rapid and pr ovides a str ong underpinning for a sys\u00ad tem of professional silos and uncoordinated care. The growth of boutique medicine, the dispr oportion of r e- sources spent on phar maceuticals, and the continuing anachronism of an acute-care modeled system all point to the difficulties in achieving focus on the health goals of the Nation. This makes your job both har der and more ur gent. We hope we can be of some assistance in your delib\u00ad erations. Refer ences Berkowitz, B. (2000).

STRA TEGIES TO ADDRESS ACUTE AND CHR ONIC PUBLIC HEAL TH ISSUES THR OUGH PRIMAR Y CARE PROVIDERS by Nicole Lurie Introduction For over two decades, health and public health pro\u00ad fessionals have struggled with ways to create a better interface between medicine and public health. Numer \u00ad ous challenges have been issued, and numerous pro- grams have been implemented. Schr oeder and Showstack challenged academic health centers to be- come mor e responsive to the health needs of their com\u00ad munities, and that challenge was embodied in the Health of the Public Pr ogram.1 The American Public Health Association and the American Medical Association, among others, for med the Medicine and Public Health Initiative. Social medicine pr ograms, primary car e train\u00ad ing pr ograms, and a variety of nursing, phar macy, and other health pr ofessions programs have all tried to train professionals with dual responsibilities to populations and individual patients and to function at the inter face of care of individuals and of what most consider to be public health. These ef forts are not without their successes. T rain\u00ad ing of physicians has become mor e primary care and outpatient oriented, and many medical schools now incorporate a population health perspective in their curricula. Simultaneously, the practice environment has been changing. Inter disciplinary training and practice are mor e common, although they continue to be slow to evolve. Mor e providers practice in gr oup practice 64 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers NICOLE LURIE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS ACUTE AND CHRONIC PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THROUGH PRIMAR Y CARE PROVIDERS settings and as part of managed care or ganizations. Both pr oviders and health systems have been held in\u00ad creasingly accountable for impr oving preventive car e and maintaining the health of populations of patients in addition to individuals, and they have risen to the challenge, however incompletely. However , all is not well with primary care and pub\u00ad lic health. The terr orist attacks on the United States and the anthrax incidents that followed highlighted the continued disconnects between the public health and health delivery system. The public health system was, in itself, unpr epared to r espond to many aspects of the crisis, and this lack of prepar edness highlighted the degree to which the infrastructur e was ill equipped to perform basic functions of surveillance and health pro\u00ad tection. The health car e delivery system was only par \u00ad tially challenged by these episodes because relatively few people requir ed acute car e. There were few survi\u00ad vors of the W orld T rade Center attacks and, although highly publicized, few cases of anthrax. Sur ge capac\u00ad ity, disaster response capability, and provider pr epared\u00ad ness wer e (fortunately) not tested. Nonetheless, it be- came clear that, on a systems level, not only is our public health system in disarray, but it is not well linked to the delivery system. Communication be-tween health and public health systems was often poor, and r eliable infor mation was often impossible for providers to obtain. These events left us with a number of challenges and opportunities and with what is likely a small window of time in which to build upon the increased attention devoted to these issues. This meeting discusses \"strategies to address acute and chr onic public health issues through primary car e providers\" in the context of training. This issue is not new. The mer e fact that it needs further discussion af\u00ad ter so many years of educational refor m suggests that we need a new approach. In this paper I review oppor \u00ad tunities for primary care and public health training in the health pr ofessions education process and describe the kinds of \"acute and chr onic public health issues\" that could be addressed in either training or practice. I then identify some attributes of practices that might lead to a better inter face, and I note some opportuni\u00ad ties for change. Although much of the literature ad- dresses the training of physicians, this paper is not in- tended to focus only on medical practice, but to serve as a basis for br oader discussion. The Primary Car e Training Pr ocess Simply stated, there ar e four major periods during which education can have an impact upon the public health awareness of physicians: prior to medical school, during medical school, during r esidency and specialty training, and thr ough lifelong lear ning while in practice. As recently as a decade ago, some students enter \u00ad ing medical school were unable to type or use a com\u00ad puter. This situation has dramatically changed. Simi\u00ad larly, many students enter ed medical school with little awareness of or experience with working in the health delivery system. This too has changed, particularly as public health experience and even coursework are seen as desirable attributes of successful applicants. This phenomenon highlights the opportunity for the admis\u00adsions pr ocess to influence the public health prepar ed\u00ad ness of entering students: prefer ential treatment could be given to applicants with public health backgr ound or experience, or matriculating students could be r e\u00ad quired to complete coursework or field experience prior to their first year . To some degree, this public health preparation is happening alr eady; many medical students matriculate having completed a public health degr ee. While, on the sur face, such exposure seems like a pr omising av\u00ad enue for increasing public health orientation of physi\u00ad cians, w e are not aware of data to suggest that these students behave differently in practice than those who have not had such training or exposure. Further , we note that even if students enter medical school with a greater public health orientation, there has been little in the way of systems change to incent or sustain such behavior , either in residency training or in the practice environment. Under graduate health pr ofessions training (i.e., medical, nursing, dental school) of fers the next oppor \u00ad tunity to incr ease the public health orientation of emer g\u00ad ing primary care providers. W ithout question, most medical schools have incorporated primary car e and population health curricula, ranging from coursework to training and community/public health pr ojects. Medi\u00ad cal students spend mor e time in ambulatory settings now than in any time in recent history. However , it is the rare practice setting that participates in surveillance, has electronic links to a health department, or places empha\u00ad sis on a major public health concer n in the community. APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 65 NICOLE LURIE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS ACUTE AND CHRONIC PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THROUGH PRIMAR Y CARE PROVIDERS Thus, while students may be predisposed to consider public health perspectives, they rarely spend signifi\u00ad cant time with role models who are doing so. The idealized primary care preceptor is someone who has broad knowledge and excellent communica\u00ad tion skills, runs an efficient practice, is a lifelong lear ner, and has in place at least basic quality assurance tools (such as pr eventive care reminders). The occasional provider might participate in a practice-based research network in which data are reported, collected, and ana\u00adlyzed. However , precious few r ole models work in a health department, have a functional system for report\u00ading reportable diseases, have electr onic links to hospi\u00ad tals or health departments, or have disease registries in their practices. Hence, students are rarely exposed to preceptors whose behaviors link public health and clini\u00ad cal practice. Numerous pr ograms have placed students in public health settings for rotations of varying lengths, and the Centers for Disease Control and Pr evention (CDC) has run a program for medical students based on the Epi\u00ad demic Intelligence Service (EIS) model . 2 In a number of programs, students have ear ned MPH degr ees while in medical school. Calls and e-mails to several promi\u00ad nent pr ograms as well as to the CDC failed to uncover outcome infor mation about what such lear ners are ac\u00ad tually doing in practice. Residency r emains lar gely unchanged. It is a time of steep lear ning curves, time pr essure, and sleep dep\u00ad rivation. Although residents spend mor e training time in ambulatory settings, they face the same paucity of role models as students and are themselves ill prepar ed role models for under graduate students when it comes to public health. Despite the evolution of evidence-based medicine, public health is still seen as the \"soft stuff\" in most teaching settings, especially when compared to impressive rescues in intensive car e units and highly sophisticated procedur es. Most hospitals do not them- selves fulfill the kinds of public health responsibilities we are considering, so, again, the sites in which people learn in residency ar e not modeling the kinds of behav\u00ad ior we wish to pr oduce. The final opportunity to impact the public health perspectives of pr oviders is when they are in practice, hopefully as lifelong lear ners. Here, pr oviders might benefit from new educational experiences or from the influence of the public health responsibilities of the sys\u00adtems in which they practice. Alter natively, they may become part of a practice-based r esear ch network (PBRN) in which they ar e expected to track and report certain conditions or tr eatments. T wo recent r eports provide some encouraging evidence about practice set\u00ad tings. One indicates that some sentinel managed car e organizations have higher rates of reporting chlamydia than the historical rates of private practitioners, sug\u00adgesting that systems approaches may be successful in this regard. 3 The other suggests that sentinel physician networks and PBRNs could be effective vehicles for fulfilling public health r esponsibilities. 4 However , the glass is only half full; most health plans have not yet achieved the per formance of the sentinel plans stud\u00ad ied. Data from PBRNs suggest that incr eased time pres\u00ad sures decrease the reporting rates from these practices, raising concer ns that effective surveillance based on such networks could fall apart during a crisis or when increased pr oductivity is demanded. In sum, the trajectory fr om preprofessional educa\u00ad tion to practice provides r ealized op\u00ad portunities\u2014required curricula, r equired projects, clerkships in well functioning systems or in health de\u00ad partments, and ambulatory r otations in practices that actually \"do\" public health. While these training meth\u00ad ods pr esent opportunities, evidence of long-ter m im\u00ad pact of such programs on practice behavior is lacking. What Ar e the Acute and Chr onic Public Health Issues W e Wish to Addr ess? While r ecent events have focused us on infectious disease surveillance, acute and chr onic public health problems have been with us for some time. Prior to considering further changes to health pr ofessions edu\u00ad cation, we should seek to define the kinds of public health issues we wish to see addressed in primary car e. Is our goal that primary care providers will take a popu\u00ad lation perspective, by which we most often mean un\u00ad derstanding the patient and his/her pr oblem in the context of the epidemiology of disease and the com\u00ad munity and cultur e in which he or she lives? Do we mean getting better at primary, secondary, and ter \u00ad tiary pr evention in primary care practice? Clearly, we have made great strides in each of these ar eas. Rarely have these successes come through the efforts of in\u00ad dividual practitioners\u2014rather , they have been achieved through the twin drives of health system accountability and quality, both of which have resulted 66 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers NICOLE LURIE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS ACUTE AND CHRONIC PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THROUGH PRIMAR Y CARE PROVIDERS in the development and use of systems to achieve the desired outcomes. Or are we talking about participating in surveillance or disease registries? If so, is such participation time sensitive, or can it rely on retr ospective or delayed re- views of claims of billing infor mation? W ould the re- porting process require a physician to master a com\u00adplicated new technology, or could the process be made user friendly and lar gely error pr oof? A mechanism with built-in delay may be easier for primary care practices to handle and may be more than sufficient to develop an asthma registry or a surveillance system for heart disease, diabetes, or injury. It may even be sufficient for much infectious disease r eporting, such as for TB, HIV, or STDs. It is not sufficient, however , when it is important to detect a \"signal\" event rapidly or when quick reaction times ar e needed, such as in the case of a terr orist incident with biological, chemical, or nuclear threats. Two other responsibilities of primary car e practitio\u00ad ners include staying up to date and remaining ready. Both are important in considering acute and chronic health problems and become even mor e relevant in considering terrorist incidents. Current systems encour \u00ad age neither . Continuing medical education as a mecha\u00ad nism to change practice behavior has repeatedly been shown to be ineffective, although requirements for ef\u00ad fective lear ning have been defined. Even without time pressure, many pr oviders ar e unable to access real-time reliable infor mation, such as practice guidelines when a patient is in front of them. Deter mining how to evalu\u00ad ate and tr eat a case of suspected anthrax r equires ready access to state-of-the art infor mation, especially in a rapidly changing environment. A final dimension of practice is quality. The quality literature compellingly demonstrates the importance of system change and of highlighting a volume-outcome relationships.5 The latter is particularly salient as we consider the health security context in which clinicians are expected to deal with r elatively rare events for which a state of continued pr eparedness and suspicion is re\u00ad quired. A challenge will be to practice in cost ef fective ways while deciding which hoofbeats represent mor e than horses. Curr ently, ther e are no widespread pri\u00ad mary care models that maintain readiness or that use hypothetical practice situations to prepar e for an un\u00ad known reality. Disaster drills by first r esponders and emergency car e providers are as close as we come; primary car e providers ar e usually excluded from or are too busy to participate in such exercises. What Attributes of Practice Might Lead to Better Public Health-Oriented Behaviors? The health services literature pr ovides some insight regarding both the practice of prevention and provider behavior change.5 First, it suggests that both are mor e likely to occur when we do not rely on the behavior of individuals, but instead implement systems and pr oc\u00ad esses that facilitate such practice. Examples include computer -generated r eminders, standing orders for nurses to administer flu shots, and a \"vital signs\" stamp to encourage smoking cessation. Increasingly, team- based car e is becoming essential to such systems. Sec\u00ad ond, feedback regarding practice patter ns, reporting results, and quality impr ovement mechanisms lead to improvements in pr eventive health practices. Electr onic medical r ecords and embedded decision support ar e key elements of such systems. In the domain of r eporting, at least two practice attributes seem essential. First ar e the motivation and time to report (assuming a diagnosis is made). PBRNs provide encouraging models in this ar ea, although, as discussed above, data indicate that completeness of r e- porting is diminished when pr oviders are busy. As we do not for esee a time when providers are less busy and, in fact, they could be even mor e time pressured in the event of an epidemic, this issue should be taken seriously. Second, automated systems that ar e able to detect \"signals\" or prompt providers to r eport will also be key. These systems will need to be built \"ar ound the prac\u00ad tice\" rather than r equiring the practice to adapt to them and should not r equire new behaviors (even additional keystr okes for data entry), if possible. Unfortunately, many of these systems are still in the experimental stage. Third, financial incentives have consistently been demonstrated to change provider behavior . Other than the pr ovision of \"bonus payments\" for achieving high rates of pr eventive care, we ar e as yet unaware of fi\u00ad nancial incentives that have been developed to encour \u00ad age disease reporting, either for acute or chr onic dis\u00ad ease, or to encourage any other public health-oriented behaviors. APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers 67 NICOLE LURIE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS ACUTE AND CHRONIC PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THROUGH PRIMAR Y CARE PROVIDERS Finally, the legal and regulatory system in which practice exists has been demonstrated to change be\u00ad havior . This context may provide some additional op\u00ad portunities to improve public health behaviors, although it is not likely to lead to short-ter m improvements. Wher e Are Opportunities? As the focus of this confer ence is education, it seems logical to examine opportunities in the educational pr oc\u00ad ess. However , given the history of educational efforts, these may not be the right venue for change. Further - more, evidence r egarding system change demonstrates clearly that training (or interdisciplinary collaboration) without incenting and sustaining system change is likely to fail. Hence, the remainder of this section identifies areas in which new activities may af ford opportunities for success. Information systems: Improved infor mation sys\u00ad tems will be the backbone of quality improvement and public health prepar edness. Having an Inter net- linked computer in every practice site should become a condition of participation in Medicare or should be a requir ement for licensing. This r egulatory ap\u00ad proach can be supplemented by decision support tools for practice (leading to improved quality and increased pr eventive behaviors) and will ultimately support opportunities to improve surveillance. It will also incr ease the likelihood that providers can ac\u00ad cess r eal-time, reliable infor mation in the event of a public health crisis. T o be maximally ef fective, clini\u00ad cal and public health infor mation systems will need to be linked. Educational opportunities: Education aimed at learning new infor mation and keeping current will be essential. These educational opportunities should be lear ner center ed and competency based and should use well established principles of adult edu\u00adcation. System incentives should be developed to make such education desirable. Failing that, some level of competency-based education could be a con\u00ad dition for license r enewal or accreditation within a health system. Such education could build, in part, from the infor mation technology backbone and could serve as the basis for the practice required to main\u00ad tain a ready state of awar eness. Practicing primary care physicians, especially those who are key opinion leaders in their communities, could have opportunities for experiential lear ning in health departments. These activities will need incen\u00ad tives and system support, as it is difficult for most providers to leave their practices. For example, they might be supported by locum tenens arrangements paid for through public health funds and tied to train\u00ad ing-the-trainer commitments. If implemented, such programs should be evaluated to deter mine whether they achieve the desired effect. Similarly, individuals who practice in public health departments could do \"rotations\" thr ough primary car e practices to better understand the cultur e and opportunities of those practices and to enhance interpersonal r elationships. Experiential lear ning opportunities for students, resi\u00ad dents, and faculty could be enhanced, although data on experiential lear ning indicate changes in attitudes. Whether they lead to other desir ed behaviors, is un\u00ad clear. If these ef forts are to bear fruit, they must be supported by changes in the practice envir onment that support such behaviors. Outcomes of joint degree (MD/MPH) programs should be evaluated to deter mine whether they are meeting desir ed objectives and to see if appropriate changes to these programs should be made in the spirit of continuous quality impr ovement. Similar ef\u00ad forts should be made with CDC pr ograms aimed at student and r esident lear ners. Learners Need Envir onments that Model Appropriate Behaviors and Attitudes Attributes of primary care practices and hospitals that appropriately link practice and public health should be defined. All teaching hospitals should implement such practices, both for better public health practice and for assuring that lear ners (students and r esidents) are lear ning in settings that model the appr opriate be\u00ad havior . Hospitals able to achieve excellence in this ar ea might be designated \"magnet hospitals for public health,\" much like those hospitals that have achieved excellence in nursing car e. Similar efforts should be undertaken for ambulatory training sites. It is likely that in each case, these ef forts can develop from the infra\u00ad structur e already in place to support quality improve\u00ad ment efforts. Primary car e practices will need to have systems in place to support increases in public health behaviors. Information technology is key and has already been discussed, and additional means of support should be explor ed. Models of practice or ganization to support 68 APPENDIX A :Biogr aphies and Presentations of Speakers NICOLE LURIE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS ACUTE AND CHRONIC PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THROUGH PRIMAR Y CARE PROVIDERS public health practices (that ar e not linked to individual patients) will need to be developed and will likely re- quire interdisciplinary teams for surveillance, report\u00ad ing, and follow-up. For example, an individual in each practice could be r esponsible for readiness exercises or for assuring the execution of the r eporting function (even if automated). All systems will need to develop mechanisms of accountability, which will likely involve feedback regarding per formance from public health de\u00ad partments. Mechanisms to finance such systems will need to be developed, or they will fail. Whether pri\u00ad mary care visit reimbursement should incorporate sup- port for these functions or whether other mechanisms should be developed should be the subject of debate. Regardless, application of quality impr ovement meth\u00ad ods to impr ove preventive car e has been shown to be successful, and the potential to use them to expand public health pr eparedness should be investigated. Con\u00ad sideration should also be given to recent trends in pri\u00ad mary care. Curr ently, applicants for pr imary car e train\u00ad ing programs are at an all-time low. Increased responsibilities for primary care pr oviders, without ap\u00ad propriate support, could have the unintended effect of making primary care practice even less desirable. Efforts to expand the public health awareness of physicians in practice are not new. T raining and edu\u00ad cation over the last two decades has enabled us to \"talk the talk.\" Without appr opriate incentives and compr systems change to promote public health be\u00ad haviors in practice, further educational ef forts are not likely to get us to \"walk the walk.\" Refer ences 1 Showstack, J., Schroeder , S., et al.

WORKGR OUP CHARGE FROM THE ADVISOR Y COMMITTEE Workgroup A will addr ess how to train primary car e providers to foster impr oved access to unified, inter - disciplinary public health services in underserved ru\u00ad ral and urban communities (should include inter discipli\u00ad nary programs that str ess collaboration to meet goals). Issues to be consider ed include the following: a) What is the role of training pr ograms in improving access? b) How should curricula/programs be designed and/ or expanded? c) What successful models and examples of commu\u00ad nity-based activities should be examined that meet the need of improving access by combining pri\u00ad mary car e education and training with public health? d) What changes in faculty structur e and overall infra\u00ad structur e might be needed to design, develop, and/ or expand such programs? e) What ar e the barriers to accomplishing this objec\u00ad tive? (e.g., payments to r esidents only in hospital settings, etc.). f) How should primary car e training programs pro- vide education that will focus on public health con\u00ad siderations relating to improving A - Impr oving Access The Char ge Following introductions of W orkgr oup members, this group examined their char ge: how to train primary care providers to foster impr oved access to unified, interdisciplinary public health services in underserved rural and urban communities . The group decided to address all parts of the char ge, focusing on the overall objective of education pr ograms to foster impr oved access, to go beyond traditional notions of clinical train\u00ad ing that takes place in a community setting, and to incorporate mor e sensitization to existing barriers to access and leadership training. Access: Graduate Outcomes and Programs' Pr ovision of Car e Discussion ensued regar ding the definition of \"im\u00ad proving access,\" whether it entails training people to go out to work in areas needing impr oved access as well as access provided through the training program itself. The gr oup agreed that improved access includes both. Although T itle VII, section 747 programs ar e being evaluated based on graduates who eventually work in underserved communities, the pr ograms themselves are points of access for health care. In fact, pr ograms improve access by pr oviding students with opportuni\u00ad ties to work with diverse or underserved populations. Otherwise, training would be less effective when gradu\u00ad ates go out to pr ovide care to underserved communi\u00ad ties or populations. One group member mentioned Califor nia's medi\u00ad cal education program funded by Song/Br own legisla\u00ad tion. Studies have documented the amount of real-time care provided by r esidency programs to Califor nia's underserved populations. Although studies discussing outcomes of health professions graduates have sug\u00adgested mixed r esults regar ding percentages of gradu \u00ad ates who work with underserved communities and popu\u00adlations, the educational programs themselves are serving the underserved, and those pr ograms are perhaps the ones that are most dependent on receiving grant money for educational enhancement. This pr ovision of care by the programs themselves gets little attention and has not been used as a defense for Title VII, section 747. One member noted that serv\u00ad ice pr ovided by programs might not be str essed be- cause funding emphasis in primary car e has been pre- residency, yet residency pr ograms probably pr ovide the most direct car e. On the other hand, for dental pr o- grams, most T itle VII funding goes towar ds residency programs, although many dentists go dir ectly into prac\u00ad tice and bypass r esidency. A physician assistant faculty member noted that physician assistant programs also pr ovide a good deal of dir ect care to underserved populations because of requir ed rotations in underserved clinics. In fact, pro\u00ad viding car e is an incentive for r eceiving federal grants. Role of T raining Pr ograms in Impr oving Access The gr oup discussed the r ole of training programs in improving access, especially in improving access on a long-ter m basis. A dental representative in the group noted that many factors affect access and influence the marketplace but ar e beyond programs' control. Another observed the per ceived discrepancy of having 40 per - cent of graduates who work in underserved areas be\u00ading compared to 100 per cent of the National Health Service Corps who practice in underserved areas. The latter, observed another , have only a two-year r equire\u00ad ment for such service. Another member noted an addi\u00adtional complicating factor: inter national medical gradu\u00ad ates serve in underserved ar eas to satisfy immigration requir ements; thus, these students af fect quantitative outcomes. However , she added, once those r equire\u00ad ments are met, these graduates do not necessarily r e- main in underserved ar eas. IMPORT ANCE OF ADMISSIONS One member stated that probably the most impor \u00ad tant factor deter mining whether graduates work in underserved ar eas is the population admitted to the program. A number of clinics\u2014homeless clinics and other clinics for underserved populations\u2014have been started by the ener gy of medical students reaching out to the underserved. The question was raised about whether such experiences could be tied to T itle VII because much ener gy is present in medical students at the pr e-resident level. This member also mentioned that, from his experience, r esidents who serve underserved populations during r esidency appear to want to finish residency so that they can serve a dif ferent population. Only those r esidents truly committed to caring for the underserved continue their residency experience into their practices. Programs could do a better job of selecting residents who want to r emain in underserved ar eas. APPENDIX B: Workgroup A -Impro ving Access 71 DEFINITION OF THE UNDERSER VED The group discussed the issue of how the definition of \"underserved\" is closely related to the measures used to evaluate successful outcomes. One member noted that suggestions have been made to look at the underserved as population-based, not geographic, so that provider service to Medicaid patients or those sup-ported by public programs can also be consider ed in outcomes. Another member added that the definition of \"underserved\" needs to be the most liberal possible and mentioned a Philadelphia clinic that failed to qualify as serving an underserved ar ea because it was only a mile from a major medical center , yet no other pr ovider was available to serve that particular community. Another noted that without emer gency r ooms in the teaching hospitals, a void would exist in health care in some communities, although a primary car e setting could eas\u00ad ily address that community's needs. MORE COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PROGRAM SERVICES /EXPERIENCES A pediatric primary care Committee member noted that more experiences were needed in primary care, that programs that had specialties often referr ed out problems that primary car e providers could addr ess. Programs should designate themselves as primary car e and be mor e complete in providing primary car e train\u00ad ing. MORE FACUL TY ROLE MODELS PRACTICING COMMUNITY -BASED MEDICINE The group discussed at length the issue of the im\u00ad portance of providing role models for students. One member noted that in some pr ograms, the physician who is out in the community, who has no teaching affiliation, is not consider ed to be a model for educa\u00ad tional purposes. In fact, training programs are often isolated from clinicians who may be pr oviding first-rate delivery of services to the community. Pr ograms should selectively identify available, willing primary car e pro\u00ad viders who practice quality care. Another member noted that being a role model has become more difficult during r ecent years. He added that not only managed care but also primary care has been under pressure to see more patients and do mor e paperwork than in the recent past. Health car e provid\u00ad ers are struggling with an old model to do a new job. Several group members noted that students pick up very quickly on how disgruntled the workfor ce is. NEED FOR DEVELOPMENT OF MODELS BY PROGRAMS One member mentioned that if primary care was identified as the specialty leading the way in training\u2014 that is, providing very practical infor mation tools\u2014those who gravitate to this specialty could use these tools \"robustly in caring for communities\" and could gener \u00ad ate excitement in primary car e. The gr oup then addr essed the issue of whether train\u00ad ing institutions should find models and help students connect with them or whether the programs should develop those models. One member str essed the need to develop models and added that an ar ea for T itle VII grants should be developing curricula using in-formation technology to improve car e. A Commit- tee member made the point that, because of produc\u00ad tivity pressures, primary care faculty at training institutions ar e not leading the way in developing new practice models. NEED FOR CULTURAL COMPETENCY The gr oup began discussing needed competencies to incr ease access, and one Committee member men\u00ad tioned the need for cultural competency so that practi\u00ad tioners who go into underserved ar eas are comfortable serving in those ar eas. The question ar ose regarding whether students need specific courses or whether they develop cultural competencies by serving in such areas. One member stated that cultural competency should be part of curriculum and that students must have some experience in cultural competency. Faculty also need that training. Faculty development in cultural compe\u00ad tency is more important than ever befor e. This Com\u00ad mittee member str essed that many faculty are not fr om communities such as inner city underserved ar eas and may have no experience in addressing minority or dis\u00ad advantaged populations. A dental Committee member added that cultural competency, at least in dental education, is mor e modu\u00ad lar, packaged through r ole playing and artificial situa\u00ad tions as opposed to real-life experiences, which is what a Title VII training program can pr ovide. The gr oup leader observed that didactic training is modeled experientially in the clinic: students might lear n about heart failur e didactically and then go into the clinic to see how to respond to it. Cultural competence probably should be handled similarly, that is, with both didactic and applied training. 72 APPENDIX B: Workgroup A -Impro ving Access The pediatric primary car e Committee member agreed and suggested that cultural competence training should also be inter disciplinary. Most often, training is focused on the direct provider , but others, such as so\u00ad cial workers, need to be involved as well. Inter discipli\u00ad nary training could also be part of curricula. The discussion evolved to examples of pr ograms that could be models, and one group member men\u00ad tioned that having a diverse student body would help solve some of the pr oblems, but most pr ograms have a non-diverse student population. This physician assis\u00ad tant faculty member noted that some physician assis\u00ad tant pr ograms, to win grants, r equire that a certain percentage of their admissions committee be of diverse backgr ound or have experience with working with underserved populations. Discussion ensued about how pr ograms could best address cultural competency. A Health Resour ces Serv\u00ad ices Administration (HRSA) repr esentative mentioned that HRSA's outcome measur es include measures of minority and disadvantaged students entering the pro- gram as well as minority faculty. Programs that incr ease those percentages come closer to the tar get outcomes. The measur es currently pertain to graduates who go to underserved areas. Only for new programs is the popu\u00ad lation served considered. A mor e problematic issue that is not measured concer ns the length of time graduates remain in those ar eas. Design and Expansion of Curricula/ Programs The gr oup moved to the second part of their char ge: \"How should curricula/pr ograms be designed and/or expanded\" to address the public health/primary car e gap? What should pr ograms do to incr ease the public health/primary car e inter face? POPULA TION-BASED AND COMMUNITY -BASED APPROACHES One Committee member mentioned that he would like to see community-oriented primary car e practitio\u00ad ners, that is, have primary car e providers who make community diagnoses and addr ess problems on a com\u00ad munity level. He added that \"population-based medi\u00adcine\" is a new label for a similar perspective. He also noted that as a family practitioner with an MPH, he was concer ned with obesity epidemics and other is- sues in Healthy People 2010 . He stressed that the inherent inter face of primary car e and public health is much better than attempting to mer ge two disparate cultur es. INTERF ACE THROUGH TEACHING HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 AND HEALTH INDICA TORS This Committee participant added that, rather than injecting public health training into a primary car e pro- gram, it would be better to use principles of commu\u00ad nity-oriented primary car e or population-based medi\u00ad cine so that the primary car e workforce would be mor e involved with health indicators at the community level. He mentioned his own experience as a small-town pr o\u00ad vider who educated the local junior high school about AIDS pr evention, conducted smoking education, and addressed general priority issues of the community. Working with public health officers was not a pertinent issue for him because he was located in an area remote from the county health department. He str essed that primary car e programs should probably be focused at the level of teaching Healthy People 2010 as a way to bring primary car e and public health together . CURRICULUM REFORM TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEEDS A visitor fr om the National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research at NIH mentioned a model be\u00ad ing used by the Robert W ood Johnson Foundation project to intr oduce dental students to public health early in their training. Applicants for these grants must integrate public health courses into their curricula, and students must spend 60 days in community clinical experience. She str essed that by the time trainees gradu\u00ad ate, if they have not been exposed to underserved com\u00admunities and disadvantaged populations, they may not want to make lifestyle changes to serve in those com\u00ad munities. She also added that dental schools are be- coming accessible only for the affluent because of both cost and student selection and that many schools no longer have a community health pr ogram or staff. She believes that admissions, curriculum\u2014both di\u00ad dactic and experiential\u2014and role models all need to come together to incr ease the public health orienta\u00ad tion of dental training. A HRSA representative mentioned the Meharry Medical College's pur chase of an inner -city hospital. The College's need to serve the population of that com\u00ad munity is driving r eform of the curriculum to incorpo\u00ad rate public health because trainees and faculty must relate to the community. The question was raised r egarding how training in\u00ad stitutions should acquir e faculty who have those kinds of community experiences. One dental member be\u00adlieved that institutions should incorporate faculty with community-oriented approaches incrementally. The APPENDIX B: Workgroup A -Impro ving Access 73 perfect faculty role model probably does not exist. At the same time, if trainees receive public health train\u00ad ing, but fail to observe it being applied by practitioners in the field, they will assume that their training was wasted. He added that r esidency might be the best venue for developing public health orientation because residents serve in communities. Developing an infra\u00adstructure at the r esidency level and bringing it down to the pre-residency level may be the most effective strategy. One member mentioned that for his own program in Iowa City, Iowa, the curriculum is not so much the issue. Residents serve in an urban setting and see a diverse faculty tr eating patients. W ith a diverse faculty, race is less visible to residents and is per ceived as a non-issue in medicine. ACCESS AS PART OF A LARGER SYSTEM PROBLEM , NOT JUST POINT OF ACCESS The gr oup leader wondered if public health/primary care and access are two separate issues or whether they ar e linked. Is public health training necessary to increase access? One gr oup member stated that intro\u00ad ducing population-based health as a focus of training is important if we expect to make a difference in the way people view their car eers. Another added that access has a public health dimension, not just a primary car e dimension. He mentioned a primary care physician in West Texas who has an open door policy and is faced with the economic r ealities of having a 60 percent Medicaid patient population and trying to meet over - head. Economics is a negative driver , but training can affect someone's commitment regarding which pa\u00ad tients they will or will not see. Another Committee member added that students are for ced to make those decisions when they come out of school with massive debt. How much public health or access burden can someone handle on top of education debt and a car payment? One member observed that, in her community, find\u00ad ing dentists who serve children funded by Medicaid is difficult. Her State has a low reimbursement rate, and attempts to make reimbursement equal to those of other States have been unsuccessful. Another wondered if Title VII could be a catalyst to approach this lar ger problem: to help practitioners think of themselves as part of a system and to help them understand their community resour ces. The gr oup leader observed the lar ge difference be- tween the practitioner who is a sole provider in a com\u00ad munity and one who is not. He added that in an urban setting, the underserved have anonymity, but in a rural area, the underserved would be obvious, and the one who fails to serve them would also be appar ent. One gr oup member mentioned the reality of com\u00ad munities that lack health care\u2014programs that are closed, public health clinics that do not pr ovide direct patient car e. She stressed the need to incorporate a component of training to help people want to go out and pr ovide r eal primary care. NEED FOR DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS The discussion evolved to whether the development of a social consciousness is really what is at issue. One member noted that although economics is important, attitude is critical. H e added that if medical training fo\u00ad cused on the Healthy People 2010 initiatives, then po\u00ad tentially public health and medical/dental sectors could begin to operate in the same space without mer ging. Although much discussion addressed bioterr orism, an even mor e serious crumbling of the public health infrastructure is likely to occur . The group leader noted that the bioterr orism phenomenon is interesting be- cause everyone assumes that the important thing is detecting the first case and then intervening to prevent a massive outbr eak. However , our food is also vulner \u00ad able, not only to someone tampering with it, but also to food-handling mistakes. For example, several pri\u00admary care providers detected salmonella, and then someone noted that the people with the salmonella were all drinking orange juice from the same manufac\u00ad turer. Creating bridges to solve such problems is what population-based medicine is all about. OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERF ACE BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH AND PRIMAR Y CARE MEDICINE / DENTISTR Y One gr oup member noted that we could see public health as a big cir cle and primary car e/dentistry as another , and the V enn diagram brings them together . What is the common center that T itle VII, section 747 can focus on? COMMUNITY PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERIENCES FOR TRAINEES One Committee member mentioned the Family Practice Residency Program at Lehigh V alley Hospi\u00ad tal. Every r esident class has to do a major Community Outreach Partnership Center (COPC) pr oject, and each resident has to do an individual r esearch project as well. 74 APPENDIX B: Workgroup A -Impro ving Access The projects involve topics such as domestic violence, violence pr evention, tobacco, or obesity in the com\u00ad munity. The residents take pride in the outcomes of these projects and ar e enthusiastic about this work, which is clearly meaningful for them. Another member pointed out that they have gone beyond the didactic approach and carried out an experiential r esponse to a problem, so if pr esented with the situation again, they have a dif ferent way of appr oaching it. DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS THAT AUTOMA TE DETECTION AND SURVEILLANCE A Committee member noted that most training pr o- grams fail to address public health at all. Many trainees do not even know which diseases ar e reportable. The labs do the reporting for physicians. Another member noted that because of a host of issues that may accom\u00ad pany identification of patients with reportable diseases, the physician prefers not to do the r eporting. The prob\u00ad lem, he noted, is with infor mation management, which does not work well if a human being has to do it. He anticipated the advance of delivery systems so that the quantification and r eporting of certain infor mation is automated. JOINT RESEARCH AGENDAS FOR SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SCHOOLS OF PRIMAR Y CARE MEDICINE , PHYSICIAN ASSIST ANTS , AND DENTISTR Y The group leader mentioned that faculty of schools of public health and colleges of medicine and dentistry should work together to develop systems to meet the needs of both. One group member noted that befor e 9/11, the public health world had been moving to- wards chr onic disease intervention, and primary car e needed to move there as well, to r edesign its care model because it has been based more on acute car e. But now we ar e moving back to an acute care model, and the two models ar e different. The gr oup leader acknowledged the difficulty of find\u00ad ing a dual use for bioterr orism and chronic disease pre\u00ad vention, a pr oblem facing the public health community if so much funding goes into bioterrorism. He is con\u00ad cerned about planning for and training students to be in systems that may never occur . If the systems ar e separate, maybe the best use of money is to help the two disciplines find ways to make the systems work better together . One gr oup member noted that, unfortunately, rar ely did programs even in the same university work together . Perhaps resident programs might go out into commu\u00ad nity settings, but most disciplines fail to collaborate. Another member mentioned that various models exist in which the notion of \"inter disciplinary\" has meant health car e training for everyone, but then individuals go back to their silos. No good models exist in which interdisciplinary programs have been put together well. The gr oup leader observed that although public health faculty and clinician faculty might work together for research purposes and design systems that could benefit both, inter disciplinary educational practices have many impediments, including time schedules, dif ferent buildings, and differ ent accreditation standar ds. Joint r esearch endeavors, a physician assistant fac\u00ad ulty member observed, might work, depending on who picks up the indir ect costs, but it is dif ficult to cr oss boundaries and collaborate because of logistics such as costs. One member added that silos tend to be populated with like-minded people or those with traditional mind- sets. T itle VII, section 747 money will not gr eatly af\u00ad fect those boundaries, but may stimulate some experi\u00ad mentation. Some discussion ensued about the potential for reformulating primary car e funding and the need to incr ease funding dedicated to T itle VII, section 747. Public Health Competencies for Primary Care Medicine/Dentistry Education The gr oup arrived at a list of cor e competencies that every clinician needs: Immunizations Surveillance Relationships with local, State, and Federal agen\u00ad cies, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Management of illnesses such as sexually transmit\u00ad ted diseases, tuberculosis, and food-bor ne illnesses Reporting r eportable diseases and conditions Management of animal bites Accurate reporting of vital statistics (e.g., complet\u00ad ing a death certificate) Referrals to community resourc es Roles in emer gencies and disasters recommendations APPENDIX C: - Interdisciplinary Teams for Public Health 75 APPENDIX C: WORK GROUP B - INTERDISCIPLINAR Y TEAMS FOR PUBLIC HEAL TH WORKGR OUP MISSION Address how to train primary care pr oviders to foster the delivery of primary care and public health services through interdisciplinary teams ADVISOR Y COMMITTEE ON TRAINING IN PRIMAR Y CARE MEDICINE & DENTISTR Y MEETING May 13-14, 2002 WORKGR OUP SESSION B WORKGROUP LEADER Debbie W ard, R.N., Ph.D. ADVISOR Y COMMITTEE PARTICIP ANTS Thomas G. DeW itt, M.D. Ronald D. Franks, M.D. Ronald Mito, D.D.S., FDS RCS (Ed) Carlos A. Mor eno, .H. Maxine A. Papadakis, M.D. Justine Strand, M.P .H., P .A.-C WORKGR OUP CHARGE FROM THE ADVISOR Y COMMITTEE Workgr oup B will focus on how to foster the deliv\u00ad ery of primary car e and public health services thr ough interdisciplinary teams. Issues to be addressed include the following: a) What are the advantages of using inter disciplinary teams? b) How can we define the roles of team members from different professional disciplines and integrate their activities? c) What can be done in training to foster the use of interdisciplinary teams? How can conditions be set up to foster interdisciplinary team approaches among residents, other trainees, and practitioners? d) How can behavior be changed in this direction through the curriculum or through experience in the practice setting? e) What barriers must be overcome in discipline-spe\u00ad cific schedules and rules, accr editations, structure of insurance r eimbursement for services, State and/ or Federal regulations, health car e organization rules and/or structur es, etc.? How should systems be reengineered to accomplish the use of interdisci\u00ad plinary teams? f) How can new technologies be applied to foster in\u00ad terdisciplinary collaboration and integration of pub\u00ad lic health considerations into primary care educa\u00ad tion, training, and practice? 76 APPENDIX C: Workgroup y ofWorkgr oup B\u2014Inter disciplinar yTeams f or Pub lic Health The Char ge Following introductions, the group examined and sought to clarify their char ge: how to foster the deliv\u00ad ery of primary car e and public health services thr ough interdisciplinary teams. They discussed the idea of the inter face between public health and primary car e medicine and dentistry as well as the role of bioterr orism at that inter face. One gr oup member described bioterr orism as bringing into stark relief the idea that primary car e and public health fail to interact. An op\u00ad portunity now exists to incr ease linkages between pub\u00ad lic health and other health care pr ofessions. Another member added that T itle VII, section 747 can be used to help create a syner gy that maximizes both systems and that the group's char ge was to make suggestions about how to maximize systems through inter discipli\u00ad nary means. DEFINITION OF INTERDISCIPLINARITY The group attempted to clarify the role of interdisciplinarity, that is, whether T itle VII, section 747 should be looking at interdisciplinary education or at service thr ough interdisciplinary teams. One member noted that the aim of T itle VII, section 747 was not only to encourage pr oviders to inter face with the pub\u00ad lic health sector , but to get systems to communicate with one another . Further discussion clarified that \"in\u00ad terdisciplinary\" in this context means public health and one of the disciplines supported by T itle VII, section 747. The group agreed that, to avoid unnecessary con\u00ad straints that fail to consider local conditions of training programs, thinking in ter ms of broad interdisciplinarity is best. Education to Enhance the Inter face Between Public Health and Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry PUBLIC HEALTH TRAINING AS PART OF CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCA TION The gr oup addressed how T itle VII, section 747, with its limited funding, could best enhance the inter - face between public health and primary care medicine and dentistry. One suggestion was to use continuing medical education (CME) to incorporate public health training. The question was raised as to whether all T itle VII, section 747 funding would be dedicated to this issue or whether additional monies would be r equested. One member wondered about the feasibility of mer g\u00ad ing T itle VII and T itle VIII funding to be used for en\u00ad hancing this inter face. NEED FOR NEW MODELS TO INCREASE INTERDISCIPLINARITY AND INTERF ACE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH Further clarification of the char ge stressed the need to put together systems, not just individuals. For these systems to connect ef fectively, programs must go be\u00ad yond the boundaries of their silos, and inter disciplinary teams ar e one way to connect silos. Programs apply\u00ad ing for grants would be expected to incorporate com\u00ad ponents in their training to obtain the desired outcomes of increased inter face of public health and primary care medicine and dentistry. T o train a primary car e medi\u00ad cine and dentistry workfor ce to be part of a system working with a public health system requires new models or an extension of already existing models. SELECTION OF STUDENTS INTERESTED IN PUBLIC HEALTH One Committee member mentioned his pr ogram in which medical students volunteer to serve in rural communities, spending one day per week during their first two years and part of their junior year of clerkship doing a r otation in a community. Students are selected into the pr ogram based on their interest in rural medi\u00ad cine and are thus self-motivated. They are alr terested in rural medicine. NEED FOR EXPERIENTIAL INTERDISCIPLINAR Y PUBLIC HEALTH TRAINING A representative from the Public Health Founda\u00ad tion commented on a pr ogram in Kentucky in which public health students and medical students volunteer ed at a Salvation Ar my clinic that provided fr ee services funded by State money, which was matched by the University. The students wer e not trained together but were trained in the broader concepts of public health, including leadership. He added that understanding pub\u00adlic health helps primary car e providers better utilize time because they know what kinds of assistance health de\u00ad partments can provide for their practices. A group member summarized the idea that to improve the health of at-risk populations, public health needs to be involved in primary care medicine and dentistry. APPENDIX C: Workgroup B - Interdisciplinary Teams for Public Health 77 NEED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCA TION FOR DENTAL RESIDENCIES A dental member of the group noted the void in public health education in dentistry. Although it exists in the pre-doctoral curriculum, two thirds of graduates go directly into practice as opposed to r esidency train\u00ad ing. He mentioned his personal experience of writing grants to attract applicants into r esidency training for both an Academic Health Center and a community- based center , and the community-based experience had problems attracting applicants. He added that dramatic changes have to occur in dental training for public health to become more central. A mandatory Post Graduate Year-1 (PGY -1) for dental trainees would help, but den\u00ad tistry resists that requirement. A group member suggested that per haps a popula\u00ad tion-based appr oach to improving dental health, both didactic and experiential training, would be fea\u00ad sible or maybe a residency requirement having certain competencies would be appr opriate. BARRIERS TO INTERDISCIPLINAR Y PUBLIC HEALTH TRAINING IN PRIMAR Y CARE MEDICAL AND DENTAL EDUCA TION A Committee member mentioned some barriers to interdisciplinary education or approaches within insti\u00ad tutions, including discipline-specific schedules, rules, and accreditation r equirements. Unless public health train\u00ad ing is r equired, it would be voluntary, which would make it more difficult to incorporate. A gr oup member noted that if competencies were written into a systems train\u00ad ing approach, faculty would teach population-based health care methods that could be applied later in practices. The group leader encouraged the group to arrive at a more complete list of barriers because they would be useful to grant writers. She added an example at the University of W ashington in which a group of interdis\u00ad ciplinary professionals fr om an array of health car e dis\u00ad ciplines met, but were unable to put together a course for everyone because of a lack of a mutually agr eeable time for scheduling a course. A Committee member mentioned that although technology can deliver the infor mation, getting every- one together in the same room is important for social\u00adization purposes. Another noted that the health infor \u00ad mation sciences have a W eb-based curriculum, so the material is available, but whether the on-line course (without socialization) changes people's thinking is ques\u00adtionable. A physician assistant faculty member agreed, noting that parts of physician assistant training can be accomplished on-line, but the socialization piece is important. Another added that this social interaction of trainees is in fact pr ofessional development. One member added that live interaction is part of the \"hid- den curriculum.\" Students lear n from what they see, not just what they ar e told, which is a problem with on- line curricula. NEED FOR UTILITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH INTERDISCIPLINAR Y PRACTICES FOR TRAINEES Students need to see an action, which is a problem with inter disciplinary practices. If students fail to see a logical outcome of employability with inter disciplinary practices, teaching it is going to be ineffective. Another member noted that at his institution, medical students attend br own-bag seminars and receive cr edits for at- tending them. He suggested that similar strategies could be employed to convey public health infor mation at least to first- and second-year students. If they saw utility in the infor mation, they would attend lectur es built ar ound public health. One member added that these practices work for volunteer students from his pr ogram. Students are in\u00ad terested in lear ning how to go from A to B when they go out into practice. He added that, in general, the hidden curriculum says that the primary car e physician works in the office making diagnoses and that some- one else does the rest. That model is hard to replace, although some exceptions exist. He mentioned a pri\u00ad mary car e physician in a rural community with whom some students work. The students wer e exposed to a tape of a woman who had called about domestic vio\u00ad lence, and the primary care physician asked students what they would do as a physician in that situation. This physician stimulates students, although in another training situation, the primary care physicians are not truly connected with the community and the pr ogram is disintegrating. NEED TO REINFORCE DIDACTIC TRAINING The gr oup leader noted that placing students in prac\u00ad tices failing to support the principles they were taught created barriers and fruitlessness. A Committee mem\u00ad ber noted that the education envir onment needs to r e\u00ad inforce the principles stressed. CONFLICT BETWEEN ACCREDIT ATION EQUIREMENTS AND MANDA TED TRAINING The gr oup leader suggested that to address the bar \u00ad rier of accreditation r equirements, connections could be forged with the accr editing agencies to help promote 78 APPENDIX C: Workgroup B - Interdisciplinary Teams for Public Health interprofessional practices. A gr oup member indicated that barriers exist if mandates are potentially impos\u00ad sible to fulfill. For example, training all students with the School of Public Health as opposed to exposing a percentage of students to concepts thr ough lectures and courses is an unrealistic goal. Another example is attempting to mandate interdisciplinary training among different disciplines. T raining dental students, physician assistants, or medical students in public health concepts is possible without getting into accr editation issues and other barriers. A potential problem emer ges if, to get Title VII monies, programs must mandate something that opposes accr editation r equirements. NEED FOR CORE COMPETENCIES The r epresentative of the Public Health Foundation noted that currently in public health, a set of core com\u00adpetencies is being created and will be incorporated into learning objectives so that a basis for cr edentialing workers is developed. These competencies could be incorporated into lear ning objectives at a general level for primary care medicine, physician assistant, and dental pr ograms. From his experience, medical students fail to connect public health practice with their own work. The core competencies and desired knowledge outcomes could provide a model. Following some discussion of the discipline-specific levels of these competencies, one member summed up that, for primary car e medical and dental training, models of development ar e needed. T rainees need to understand and recognize when the public health sec\u00ad tor needs to be called, but they do not need to acquir e all public health skills. NEED FOR EXPERIENTIAL TRAINING AND COOPERA TION AMONG ADMINISTRA TORS One group member described his own experience in a communications course that was designed for train\u00ad ees in several health professions pr ograms. The first year was not totally successful because students felt that the course was too didactic and lacked a str ong experi\u00ad ential component. The second year was more success\u00adful because students wer e able to interact with patients and see the r elevance of the course to their own ca\u00ad reers. One of the most important factors in the success of this program was the cooperation of the Deans of the three schools involved. Their leadership ensur ed coordination of schedules for all three schools. In this instance, the patient was the community, differ ent yet similar to an individual in the interactions a practitio\u00ad ner has with it. NEED FOR TIME TO DEVELOP SUCCESSFUL TRAINING Another member mentioned his concer n that al\u00ad though peer reviewers for T itle VII, section 747 grant applications may expect a certain set of outcomes im\u00admediately, curriculum refor m and development of suc\u00ad cessful pr ograms take time. It is extr emely difficult to coordinate schedules of trainees fr om dif ferent pr o- grams, but it can be done some of the time. The group leader stressed the need for experiential opportunities and per haps having standar dized patients to af firm outcomes. One member observed that the apparent concer n for HRSA was not so much how well students wer e being trained or what their attitudes, skills, or behav\u00ad iors ar e, but whether the pr ograms ar e successfully graduating people who meet certain criteria. Another member noted that programs too fail to measur e skills, attitudes, and behaviors. SCHEDULING BARRIERS FOR INTERDISCIPLINAR Y PROGRAMMING A physician assistant faculty member mentioned her work with a Macy grant in which medical students and physician assistant students worked together . Putting together teams fr om differ ent programs has to be co\u00ad ordinated according to schedules. If the programs are on block schedules, block lear ners are put together in one site, and longitudinal lear ners ar e placed to\u00ad gether at another site. Although interdisciplinary train\u00ad ing occurs, certain programs cannot train with other programs. PROCESS -BASED AND OUTCOME -BASED GOALS One member noted that per haps the interdiscipli\u00ad nary goal should be both process-based and outcomes-based. That is, pr ocesses should be in place to lead to desired outcomes, but outcomes need to be measured to deter mine success. NEED FOR FACUL TY TO TEACH PUBLIC HEALTH TO PRIMAR Y CARE AND DENTAL TRAINEES One gr oup member wonder ed wher e programs would find faculty to teach this public health/primary care discipline to medical and dental trainees. He stressed the need for strong faculty role models. Fac\u00ad ulty of primary car e medical and dental programs are usually trained in academic centers accor ding to spe\u00ad cific models, so without someone who can model bridg\u00ad ing the disciplines, the training will be ineffective. APPENDIX C: Workgroup B - Interdisciplinary Teams for Public Health 79 MERGING TITLE VII AND TITLE VIII F UNDING One gr oup member mentioned the Genetics Inter - disciplinary Faculty T eam T raining (GIFTT), which is an innovative interdisciplinary training pr ogram using both T itle VII and T itle VIII funds, which is rarely done. She suggested the possibility of mandating inter -pro\u00ad fessional cooperation, whether short courses or sum\u00ad mer institutes, to encourage interdisciplinary work. NEED FOR AND APPROACHES TO FACUL TY TRAINING Another member added that faculty development programs are also important to help faculty bridge gaps between disciplines. Such programs could be for mal ones in which physician, physician assistant, nursing, and dental faculty, as well as faculty fr om programs such as social work, could be involved. However , these programs must be put together . The kind of pr ogram that would prepar e the model interdisciplinary public health/primary care/physician assistant/dental faculty would perhaps entail a new specialization in academia, such as might be offered through a fellowship. These fellowships would pertain to populations or problems within populations and might include sociologists or legal specialists as much as biomedical specialists. One gr oup member questioned the objective of fac\u00ad ulty training. He noted the cost of $1.2 million for train\u00ad ing three or four fellows over a period of three years and wondered whether faculty training would be fo\u00ad cused on training a few who would then bring the in-formation back to programs or whether the idea was more limited to training the masses at the mar gin. One member suggested that, instead of concentrat\u00ad ing on trainees early in their programs, it might be better to use continuing education to get people who already know their disciplines to work together for public health. Changing curricula is hard, and greater impact may be derived fr om training people who are truly in\u00ad terested in public health and who ar e in positions of influence. Strong leaders can lead curricular change. One member noted that most faculty would want more training in public health principles, although pr ob\u00ad ably not an MPH or Fellowship, and that T itle VII funds could be used to help with that faculty development. The gr oup discussed the possibilities for Executive MPH courses and the importance of the scope of training\u2014 whether short-ter m or long-ter m. One member noted that both could be options and both had value. The Public Health Foundation r epresentative noted that the public health sector was seeking to get some type of certificate or accreditation and that distance education courses wer e successful because students can obtain cr edit yet have to be onsite at the program only a couple of weekends. One member mentioned that perhaps HRSA and the Centers for Disease Contr ol and Pr evention could do some joint faculty development training. However , a barrier was noted: these agencies find it difficult to work together also, so the problem of how to work jointly or inter disciplinarily exists even at gover nment levels, further highlighting the importance of facilitat\u00ading modeling at the system level. THE NEED FOR FLEXIBLE TRAINING OPTIONS The gr oup discussed the idea of keeping options open r egarding the length and kinds of training to be developed. One member noted that one month might be sufficient to help gain knowledge of issues, but for the majority, one month is not enough time to make much pr ogress. Opportunities for a two-pr onged ap\u00ad proach ar e needed. MODEL PROGRAMS Some discussion ensued regarding whether the pre\u00ad ventive medicine residency could serve as such a model or whether teaching could occur acr oss disciplines, such as physician assistant faculty teaching physical diagno\u00ad sis. The gr oup leader mentioned another potential model, a new bioinfor matics program, which, among other things, has trainees from different disciplines us\u00ad ing data sets for dif ferent multidisciplinary uses. She observed the need for better systems infor mation to captur e more detailed infor mation, including interven\u00ad tions by pr oviders other than physicians. Such systems are important for deter mining the true cost of car e as opposed to what gets billed to the physician. The Public Health Foundation repr esentative stated that the discipline of public health practice seems to summarize the kind of pr ogram that covers health dis\u00ad parities, biostatistics and infor matics, management, leadership, and other issues pertinent to communities. He str essed the importance of being sure to include the public health community in whatever model is used to avoid r ecycling traditional primary car e services. Another Committee member noted the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation model, which, over a pe\u00ad riod of about ten years, pr ovided a well trained group 80 APPENDIX C: Workgroup B - Interdisciplinary Teams for Public Health of leaders who became deans, department chairs, and other influential leaders who ar e making an impact. A similar model in the primary care/public health mode could have a similar long-ter m impact. A Committee member noted that, given the barri\u00ad ers, the reality is that T itle VII would have to be the mechanism to redefine programs so that some move\u00adment would occur towards finding ways to facilitate interdisciplinary efforts to bring more public health prac\u00ad tices into primary car e medical and dental services. Models of pr ograms exist, and the objective of bringing more public health, mor e sociology, mor e legal aspects into training fits into the T itle VII, section 747 venue. More Inter disciplinarity Among T itle VII, Section 747 Disciplines A member noted that she would like to see mor e interface among the various T itle VII disciplines\u2014phy\u00ad sicians, physician assistants, and dentists. Thus far , these programs ar e not working together , but this objective also fits into T itle VII, section 747. Request for New Title VII, Section 747 Funding for Public Health Competency Development A Committee member suggested that perhaps a separate pool of funding is needed for a new public health emphasis in primary care medicine and den\u00adtistry training programs. The group discussed the pros\u00ad pects of having programs curr ently funded replaced by this new emphasis, r esulting in no funding gain. They advocated r equesting new funding for new program development and emphasized that faculty development would be a good investment of resources because fac\u00adulty members influence many students. That influence fans out over time as students move into practice. Building a Public Health Infrastructur e The gr oup stressed that funding derived to support bioterr orism was really dual-purpose money: building a public health infrastructur e is important and worth attaining.

Specifically, the group discussed the definitions of acute and chronic public health issues and the lear ners in\u00ad volved in needed training. Overlap of Public Health and Chr onic Disease Management One Committee member noted that the proportion of the workload of primary care pr oviders has increas\u00ad ingly been devoted to chronic disease pr oblems. He wonder ed how the training of primary care pr oviders should relate to the public health community, espe\u00ad cially because of the overlap of public health and chronic disease. The gr oup leader suggested that health de\u00ad partment practices ar e variable, but her health depart\u00ad ment i s involved in defining parts of training, especially around chronic disease management and surveillance. She str essed the need for the gr oup to define a chronic public health issue. She asked, if a practitioner has a community full of diabetics, would appr oaches be dif\u00ad ferent than those used in the office? One member suggested that the group's char ge was to deter mine ways that training could enable primary care physicians and dentists to be better equipped to address chr onic diseases such as diabetes, hyperten\u00ad sion, HIV/AIDS, and asthma within communities and populations. Another indicated that the role of public health departments is preventive, especially befor e someone is diagnosed with a chronic disease. CONNECTIONS BETWEEN DENTISTR Y AND CHRONIC DISEASE AND PUBLIC HEALTH A dental member of the group mentioned that for dentistry, the issues seem to be provision of care for diseases known to be chr onic, such as dental caries and periodontal disease. He noted the gr owth of litera\u00adture about the relationship between periodontal dis\u00ad ease and low-weight pr emature babies. Studies are il\u00ad lustrating those connections, and he cited a dental project addr essing rural migrant workers in a Florida county that has a high prevalence of low birthweight/ pre-ter m babies and no dental care. This project is a public health pr ogram having cost savings. IMPORT ANCE OF PROVIDER ROLES IN COMMUNITY INTER VENTIONS To illustrate providers' lack of public health train\u00ad ing, a Committee member noted an example of a De\u00ad troit physician who was asked by the media what strat\u00adegy she would be using to addr ess the dispr oportionate number of obese people in Detr oit. This physician was stymied and believed she had not been trained to ad-dress such problems. The group leader noted the Air For ce as an example of bringing together a gr oup of professionals to ad- dress high rates of suicide in this branch of the Ar med Forces. Instead of leaving it to physicians to treat de\u00ad pression, the Air For ce addressed the pr oblem as a community problem. Air For ce personnel are now trained to r ecognize depr ession, and commanding of\u00ad ficers ar e responsible r ecognizing and ensuring treat\u00ad ment for psychosocial str ess. This community interven\u00ad tion ar ound a chronic pr oblem has led to the Air For ce's having the lowest suicide rates of any of the Ar med Services. Similarly, the Air For ce has designed inter \u00ad ventions such as physical fitness for family members of enlisted personnel and thus has taken a community approach rather than just treating individuals. Another example of community-level intervention in chronic disease is North Car olina's Project Reach, in which exercise pr ograms and walking groups ar e organized and also reinfor ced thr ough social support. This intervention is linked back to primary car e provid\u00ad ers. Such community interventions, public health in\u00ad volvement, and construction of disease r egistries r e- quire a change in health policy. APPENDIX D: Workgroup C - Acute and Chronic Public Health Issues 83 Public Health T raining in Primary Car e Medicine and Dentistry The group decided that their char ge included stu\u00ad dents, residents, and faculty as trainees or lear ners. Discussion also evolved ar ound whether community physicians should be included in training, especially for advancing public health agendas. The group leader noted that continuing public health education and con\u00adtinuing medical education were opportunities to change the system to make public health more ef fective. She stressed the need for alterations in the practice envi\u00ad ronment and for incentives if public health consider \u00ad ations were to take more precedence. INCENTIVES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH TRAINING The gr oup considered whether certification could provide incentives for developing competencies and what r ole accreditation could play in encouraging or\u00ad ganizational competencies. One member noted that requiring a public health module for certification by boards would be one way to ensure training in this ar ea. The difficulty might lie in convincing the boar ds that such a requirement would be beneficial. Similarly, if residents were required to have public health knowl\u00adedge to pass boards, faculty would teach public health. Incentives are needed to ensur e that public health knowl\u00ad edge in primary care medical and dental training is broadly disseminated. A dental member agreed, add\u00ad ing that convincing chairs, pr ogram directors, and other faculty that public health should be incorporated would be easier if the Dental Association requir ed it. Another added that, even at the pre-resident level, some requir e\u00ad ments wer e in place, but not enough to change behavior . One member noted that he had just been recerti\u00ad fied, and no knowledge of public health or knowledge of impr oved service to the community was expected. Requirements for boar d certification would at least en- sure education, if not changes in behavior . A physician assistant (P A) representative suggested that public health education could be incorporated into continuing medi\u00adcal education (CME) credits. P A training requires a cer \u00ad tain number of credits in differ ent subject areas, so public health could be included. CME would be a means of reaching those already practicing. ROLE OF BIOTERRORISM IN PUBLIC HEALTH TRAINING Some discussion ensued r egarding the importance of bioterrorism as a priority for funding, and concer n was expressed that perhaps the health care commu\u00adnity is chasing the latest fad as opposed to trying to address mor e long-ter m problems, such as lung can\u00ad cer. The group leader pointed out that to pr epare for a response to bioterrorism, an infrastructure has to be built, and systems need to change. That infrastructur e and systems refor m can be used to meet primary car e needs and public health pr oblems. One member noted that funding might not be de- voted to primary car e, but rather to something like tech\u00ad nology, drug companies, or detection systems. The negative side to approaching public health needs through bioterrorism is the risk that the money ad- dresses that threat to the detriment of support for pro- grams addressing other critical public health pr oblems, such as hypertension scr eening. Variable Public Health Priorities and Programs Acr oss States Noted one member , States approach public health issues differently and have different priorities. The group leader noted that those differences wer e especially true for bioterrorism. Each State has its own surveillance system, and States do not necessarily communicate with one another . Even immunization registries ar e limited because of the failur e of States to exchange infor ma\u00ad tion. One member suggested that a key competency should be practitioners' knowledge of how to access information about their State public health systems. The gr oup further discussed the lack of coordina\u00ad tion of local and State public health systems, which tend to be idiosyncratic. A challenge for health car e professionals is to lear n how to work with and inte\u00ad grate all the dif ferent systems because city, county, and State health departments often fail to communicate even in one locale. One member noted the need for primary care providers to assess, not only their communities, but also their public health departments. Training for Community-Based and Population-Based Health Car e HIV/AIDS One gr oup member wondered what training is needed to help trainees af fect behaviors of a culture, population, or community, not just individuals. The group leader noted the failure of the public health sys\u00ad tem to addr ess communities in which lar ge numbers of people did not know their HIV status. Some discussion evolved pertaining to who has responsibility for HIV/AIDS community services and education. One member noted 84 APPENDIX D: Workgroup C - Acute and Chronic Public Health Issues that non-profit or ganizations provide most HIV/AIDS community-based education and services. Another stated that, although early in the AIDS crisis, agencies had gr eat impact, particularly in the gay communities, young men now appear to be taking more risks and assuming that the crisis is over . Another noted that in Louisiana, a pr oblem was emer ging with a differ ent population\u2014young adolescent women, many of whom are scr eened for HIV because they are pregnant. They are unaware of their status and risk and may not re\u00adceive HIV education because many ar e no longer in school. NEED FOR TRAINING IN REPORT ABLE DISEASES The gr oup discussed what should be taught r egard\u00ad ing reporting of reportable diseases. Currently, noted one member , her institution does not stress reporting to residents because a nursing surveillance system ex\u00ad ists, and the physician merely signs the r eport. NEED TO KNOW WHEN PUBLIC HEALTH SHOULD BE CALLED Another issue of discussion was the notion of when to get public health involved and what needs to be taught and modeled regar ding inter face with health depart\u00ad ments. The gr oup leader noted pr oviders' need to know when and how to contact the health department\u2014 where the threshold is for concer n before calling in assistance r egarding a possible epidemic or outbreak. NEED FOR AUTOMA TED REPORTING SYSTEMS The group str essed that trainees need to know mechanisms for r eporting reportable diseases. The group members recognized a need for automated re- porting as much as possible. An infor mation technol\u00ad ogy system needs to be able to pick up culture r esults, report reportable illnesses, and keep practitioners ap\u00ad prised of what is being reported. These infor mation systems should be able to maintain surveillance of syndromic incidents because providers may not r eadily pick those up. Nevertheless, educating r esidents about reporting diseases increases their awareness of report\u00ad ing issues. Communication between Public Health and Primary Car e/Dental Pr ofessions The group discussed the need for mutual communi\u00ad cation between public health and primary care and dental providers and stressed that public health needs to keep practices infor med regarding outbreaks in their communities. A lack of coordination and a lack of de-fined r esponsibilities make it difficult to know who should take the lead during outbr eaks. Equally impor \u00ad tant, public health systems need to pr ovide feedback to providers regar ding reports of diseases. A Centers for Disease Control and Pr evention (CDC) representative noted that she is working on an agr eement between the CDC and the Association of American Medical Colleges that will help pr omote understanding between public health and clinicians. TRACKING REPORTING OUTCOMES FOR PROVIDERS The gr oup leader noted a need for better tracking of outcomes of practitioners, not just short ter m, but also long ter m. Do those clinicians who r eceive an MPH do anything differ ently in their practices? Reporting rates ar e not good, even for managed care systems having infor mation technology in place. When human beings must report, r eporting falls apart because prac\u00ad titioners get so busy. The gr oup consider ed the impli\u00ad cations of these r eporting problems for education and for practice. Cultur es of Public Health and Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry One member also noted the cultural differ ences between public health and clinical medicine and den\u00ad tistry and suggested that public health training must come fr om those who have a personal understanding of it. How these two cultur es can come to understand one another is analogous to how one becomes cultur \u00ad ally competent in any cultur e not one's own. However , one member noted, medical or dental training alr eady contains so much content for students to lear n to en- able them to become competent clinicians that chang\u00ad ing pace and lear ning about communities will be dif fi\u00ad cult. The challenge is to begin, just as it was in teaching communication skills. The goal is to work ar ound con\u00ad straints so that a per fect model can eventually be achieved. The CDC r epresentative noted that these problems entail two dif ferent issues: the dif ferent cultur es involved and the content that trainees need to lear n. What do students and r esidents need to lear n to enhance their knowledge and skills and to affect their attitude about a different pr ofessional or social culture? She observed that even professional gender gaps exist and indi\u00ad cate a need for cultural competencies across gen\u00ad ders. Further , she asked, what do public health prac\u00ad titioners need to know to understand clinicians, and what do clinicians need to know to understand the APPENDIX D: Workgroup C - Acute and Chronic Public Health Issues 85 role of public health departments? T raining should ad- dress two issues: teaching how these systems can work together and teaching how to addr ess a topic as a shared responsibility. One gr oup member noted his view that public health and primary care practitioners ar e not as far apart philo\u00ad sophically as one might think, but that specialists ar e more pr one to be isolated from the public health com\u00ad munity. A dental member of the group noted that den\u00ad tistry has issues of failed understanding between den\u00adtistry and public health. He described a meeting in which his college was to establish a community-based clinic in Pensacola because of a lar ge indigent population that had not seen a dentist in three years. The Dental Society was unawar e of the data and the problem in the community. Addressing Acute and Chr onic Conditions in Primary Car e Medicine and Dentistry The group discussed acute and chr onic disease cri\u00ad ses. One member noted that physicians ar e trained neither to think in ter ms of community health nor to think about bioterrorism as a sour ce of illness. The concer n was expressed that providers need to consider the possibility of bioterrorism as a sour ce of illness with- out making it too much of a cause for suspicion. The group compiled the following examples of acute and chronic conditions: Acute Conditions Chronic Conditions HIV/AIDS TB STDs Suicide West Nile V irus Violence Emerging Infections Bioterrorism Injur y Meningitis Other Infectious Diseases Hypertension TB Obesity Asthma Oral Health Cancer Cardiovascular Disease Substance Abuse Diabetes Low Birthweight Smoking One member suggested that acute conditions were easier to teach than chronic ones because students can be actively involved in the r eporting of sexually transmitted diseases or tuberculosis. Engaging stu\u00ad dents in lear ning about chronic conditions such as hypertension or obesity, however , is more dif ficult. The group discussed whether competencies for ad-dressing these conditions should be specific or gen\u00ad eral, and the general consensus was that content knowledge should be specific but prevention and rec\u00ad ognition of problems should be general because each community is unique. As the group discussed what information providers need to be taught to address these conditions, the gr oup leader stressed that pub\u00ad lic health similarly should be examining what profes\u00adsionals should be taught in relation to primary care medicine and dentistry. The group agr eed that providers need to know about epidemics, r esistance patter ns, the general epidemiol\u00ad ogy of diseases in their communities, and the pr os\u00ad pects of changes in that epidemiology\u2014for example, the way HIV evolves in various populations. They need to know how to access that infor mation and also to know to access it. NEED FOR UPDATES FROM PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE Discussion ar ose concer ning the need for providers to stay up to date and awar e of new illnesses and out- breaks in their communities, which necessitates updates from public health surveillance. The group noted that the public health department should automatically send updates. Just as providers ar e required to r eport infor \u00ad mation for public health surveillance, public health should be r equired to send reports of that data to pro\u00ad viders. States should make it easy for providers to know the epidemiology of communities in r eal time and should perhaps supply a disk with software needed to for mat providers' computers to receive disease report updates. The gr oup leader noted too that not only providers should be infor med, but also the public, perhaps through a weekly newspaper column. NEEDED COMPETENCIES The group discussed desir ed competencies for lear n\u00ad ers, including knowledge of reportable diseases and recognition of diseases, including anthrax. How does one teach or lear n how to have the right amount of suspicion without going overboard? Further , not just trainees, but also pr oviders need to review this knowl\u00ad edge periodically to stay up to date on public health 86 APPENDIX D: Workgroup C - Acute and Chronic Public Health Issues information. Besides knowledge of infectious diseases, there needs to be knowledge of how to r ecognize and properly refer patients who are victims of violence and suicide attempts. W ith these conditions, the need to interface with other community agencies, such as law enforcement or batter ed women's shelters, is impor \u00ad tant. Lear ners need to know infor mation and national standar ds. Fur \u00ad ther, certain competencies exist that all lear ners nationwide should have. NEED FOR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SYSTEMS IN PRACTICES The idea that practices also need inter nal infor ma\u00ad tion about their epidemiology was also discussed. Prac\u00ad tices are essentially systems within systems. This dis\u00ad cussion evolved to the general competency of communication with peers, professionals, and patients. Further , the role of systems is critical to successful pri\u00ad mary car e and dentistry, and these systems ar e put in place through collaboration. Any education efforts to develop public health competencies in providers ar e limited without assurance that other parts of the inter - face ar e in place. CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT A group member noted that tr eatment of chronic diseases at present is based on a newer model than that used in the r ecent past. The group leader sug\u00ad gested that chronic disease competencies ar e really chronic disease management\u2014deter mining a con\u00ad tinuum of care that goes beyond the 15 minutes the patient spends in the pr ovider's office\u2014and that pr o\u00ad viders need to be awar e of the stages of change that patients may go through so that providers can deter - mine what incentives are needed to manage a patient's chronic illness. Providers need to know what they can provide patients in their offices versus what commu\u00ad nity r esour ces can provide. T reating chronic diseases entails an ongoing relationship with patients, unlike acute illnesses. One gr oup member wondered how one delineates a public health function versus c hronic disease man\u00ad agement and noted that funding often deter mines responsibilities. For the purposes of T itle VII, sec\u00ad tion 747 funding, trainees should lear n how to find out what their community is doing and what r esources are available. Further , trainees need to have infor ma\u00ad tion about their practices. As health car e is becoming a buyer's market, it is even more important for practices to have that infor mation. A Refor med Lear ning Envir onment Produces A Refor med Practice Envir onment The gr oup discussed the idea that if the lear ning environment wer e changed to reflect certain compe\u00ad tencies and expectations, then the practice envir on\u00ad ment also would change because a new kind of pro\u00ad vider would appear . However , knowing how to teach these competencies is dif ficult, and outcomes ar e hard to measure. The gr oup noted the importance of infor mation technology to profile patients and to provide evidence of outcomes. They also discussed issues of practice guidelines, public health goals, especially for acute ill\u00ad nesses, and leading health indicators for chr onic ill\u00ad nesses. They noted differences i n consequences. If pr o\u00ad viders fail to meet goals, they suffer no consequences as opposed to consequences from not meeting Health Plan Employer Data and Infor mation Set (HEDIS) guidelines. Community Assessment Community assessment has not been part of edu\u00ad cation for providers but needs to be. Community links between public health networks and pr oviders lead to stronger interactions between the networks and pro\u00ad viders and also increase awar eness of or ganizations available for referrals of patients. A Health Resour ces Services Administration (HRSA) representative noted that an essential part of training should be making train\u00ad ees aware of local and culturally related health car e needs, providers' role in the process of improving com\u00ad munity health, and their partnership with public health. One way such training has occurr ed in the past has been through model pr ograms in particular geographic areas or among specific populations. Need for Assurance of Ef fective Health Systems The group leader suggested that perhaps a health system check was needed to ensur e that systems are in place. Realistically, a pr ovider is unable to pr ovide the best car e to patients without being able to connect them to outside r esources. But having systems in place has to be a process impr ovement system, not merely moti\u00ad vated by ineffective penalties. The Public Health-Oriented Pr ovider As the gr oup attempted to summarize proficiencies desired by trainees, that is, what kind of provider they APPENDIX D: Workgroup C - Acute and Chronic Public Health Issues 87 wanted to pr oduce, the P A representative summarized the notion of \"a provider knowledgeable about the health issues of his or her community, who is in con\u00ad stant communication or pr etty regular communication with other providers and with the public health sys\u00ad tem.\" Further , this gr oup stressed that to ensur e that the training would be effective and useful in practice, providers need to demand that their practice settings support them to do the kinds of community activities needed. Core Competencies in Public Health The group discussed the body of knowledge that should comprise public health training for primary care practitioners and dentists. Practitioners would be mor e inclined to use public health interventions if they have such a core body of knowledge. The consensus among the group members was that any training or education must be requir ed and incorporated into the curriculum, and the curriculum must stay curr ent. Further , as the group leader stated, to teach residents and students effectively, the lear ning environment and clinical envi\u00ad ronment must also practice what is taught. One member suggested developing the needed com\u00ad petencies and then figuring out the training needed to arrive at those competencies. Another key point was that the competencies need to be part of lifelong lear n\u00ad ing and lifelong practice and should be skills, not just knowledge. After much discussion, the gr oup compiled the fol\u00ad lowing list of core competencies needed to addr ess acute and chronic public health issues ef fectively: Staying up to date and r emaining ready Understanding the epidemiology of one's commu\u00ad nity and practice in real time Recognizing patter ns of illnesses and understand\u00ad ing which agencies and individuals to seek for an\u00ad swers Knowing and applying pr eventive strategies Understanding health behavior and change Comprehending and utilizing new pr eventive man\u00ad agement guidelines Understanding quality guidelines (i.e., HEDIS) Understanding group practice skills leading to ef\u00ad fective group and team functioning Acquiring infor matics skills for access and use of information technology (e.g., W orld W ide W eb, practice data, Palm-held Digital Assistants, and other handheld technologies) Understanding the dimensions and functions of one's local public health system Acquiring publi c communication skills and leader - ship training Training Methods The group believed that educational methods should be both classroom-based and experiential or applied: CLASSROOM -BASED TRAINING Faculty development in public health issues for cor e and community-based faculty Review of reportable illnesses using case-based ex\u00adamples Clinical knowledge Knowledge of r eportable behaviors Review of local epidemiology of both acute and chronic health pr oblems Review of national epidemiology, including Healthy People 2010, highlighting local comparisons with national data and objectives History of new diseases, such as those r esulting fr om HIV and W est Nile V irus, to convey r ecognition of sentinel events and new clusters Knowledge of the public health infrastructur e, State and local public health departments, and safety net resources EXPERIENTIAL TRAINING METHODS Field trips to public health departments to reinforce an overview of public health and its infrastructure Case-based discussions focusing on key problems in primary car e practice Creation of practice-based registries for both acute and chronic public health pr oblems Obtaining input fr om content experts Organizational case-based discussions focusing on organizational changes, public health leadership 88 APPENDIX D: Workgroup C - Acute and Chronic Public Health Issues development, and awar eness of cost-effectiveness using simulation modules Experiences in public health settings for practica Site visits for water treatment, food safety inspec\u00ad tions, mosquito control, contact tracing, home vis\u00ad its with public health nurses, and community-based settings, including safety net providers Development of useful infor mation technology sup- ports and infor mation tech\u00ad nology resourc es Participation in satellite br oadcasts about public health pr oblems Recommendations 1.

Funding should be designated to find and dissemi\u00ad nate existing curricula in public health/primary car e. 3. Appropriate means should be found to mer ge public health pr ogramming funding (CDC/HRSA fund\u00ad ing) with T itle VII, section 747 funds to promote interdisciplinary pr ograms. 4. Programs r eceiving T itle VII, section 747 funding should incorporate public health training into fac\u00ad ulty development, including core faculty and com\u00ad munity preceptors. 5. Both classroom and experiential teaching modules in the area of public health should be developed and disseminated. 6. Successful infor mation technology modules for public health training should be developed and dis\u00ad seminated. 7. A clearinghouse for successful public health edu\u00ad cational programs should be for med. 8. Reinforcing policies should be developed to insur e up-to-date public health training (e.g. licensur e; accreditation; CME requirements; and r equirements for the Residency Review Commission, Liaison Committee on Medical Education, and Advanced Cardiac Life Support). 9.
