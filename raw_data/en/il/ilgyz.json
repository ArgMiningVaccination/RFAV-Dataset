It is a sea cave in the Isle of Capri, off the coast of Naples in southern Italy. Sunlight passing through the water naturally illuminates the cavern creating a blue reflection. The entrance is only open about 30 percent of the time as it requires calm seas and low tides. The entrance is so small that visitors must lie down in a small row boat to fit through the opening, but once inside the play of light and water makes this a spectacular sight.

You are about to take the first step in enjoying what will surely be an exciting and challenging tour in southern Italy. You may have heard many things about duty in Naples, and we encourage you to search these pages for information that can help you with the vast differences between life here and life in the United States. Duty in Italy offers opportunities of a lifetime. This goes for travel, recreation, professional development, education and more. The key to enjoying a successful tour lies in remembering that living in Italy is not like living in the United States. The customs, culture and way of life here are significantly different than what you are accustomed to. Houses and apartments are constructed differently; electric power and utilities are different; shopping, driving and dining are all different. Some people find it hard to adjust, but embracing the food and the warmth of the peo - ple you meet will help you make the transition. The key to a successful tour in Italy lies in your willing - ness to learn and adapt to the differences you encounter. Benvenuti a Napoli Welcome aboard and Benvenuti to beautiful Napoli! This guide will help answer many of your questions as you begin what we hope is an exciting and fulfilling tour for you in Southern Italy.

Profile of Italy Italy has a total land surface of about 116,000 square miles (slightly larger than the state of Arizona), with the Apennine Mountains serving as a geographic di - vid ing line between the east and west coasts. The Alps define Italy's northern border. The northern provinces experience cold winters with rainfall in the spring and summer. Central and southern Italy enjoys a climate moderated by the Mediterranean Sea with cool, rainy win - ters and moderate weather during spring and fall, while heat creeps north from Africa in the summer. Italy's economy is more industrialized and technology-based in the north and agricultural in the south, even though the southern regions host several small- and medium-sized industries. Major indus trial products are iron, cement, tool machinery and automobiles. Wine, cheese and other food products are also important to the Italian economy. Tourism is a key industry for all of Italy, and visitors from around the world come to marvel at its history and architecture and to enjoy its culture and food. For centuries, Naples has served as a The historic Trevi Fountain - located in the heart of Rome - is a popular tourist destination. Constructed in 19 BC to supply water for the ancient Roman Baths, it was featured in the 1960 lm \"La Dolce Vita\" by Federico Fellini, which starred Anita and Marcello Mastroianni. Photo by MC1 Daniel Barker Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Benvenuti a Napoli4center for the exchange of goods, services, customs and cultures. Traders, travelers and explorers from throughout the Mediterranean region found the climate here enviable, and with its central location and fertile soil, this region con - tinually attracts new citizens. The ancient city of Pompeii lies just south of the city, and Cuma, believed to be the earliest Greek settlement in Western Europe, sits just outsi - de Naples. Italian History & Government Italy is largely homogeneous linguistically and religiously but is diverse culturally, economically and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe - about 200 people per square kilometer (490 per square mile). Although Roman Catholicism is the majority religion - 85 percent of native-born citizens are nominally Catholic - all religious faiths are provided equal freedom before the law by the constitution. Italy proclaimed its unification in 1861. From 1870 until 1922, Italy was a constitutional monarchy with a parliament elected under limited suffrage. During World War I, Italy renounced its standing alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary and, in 1915, entered the war on the side of the Allies. In 1922, Benito Mussolini came to power and installed a fascist dictatorship termed the Corporate State. The king remained titular head of state. Under Mussolini, Italy remained a fascist dictatorship between 1922 and 1945. Italy allied with Germany and declared war on the United Kingdom and France in 1940. In 1941, Italy - with the other Axis powers, Germany and Japan - declared war on the United States and the Soviet Union. Following the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, the King dismissed Mussolini and appointed Marshal Pietro Badoglio as pre - mier. The Badoglio government declared war on Germany, which quickly occupied most of the country and freed Mussolini, who led a brief-lived regime in the north. An anti-fascist popular resistance movement grew during the last two years of the war, harassing German forces before they were driven out in April 1945. In 1946, Italy became a republic, and in 1948, Italy's government became a democracy with a president, prime minister and a parliament. The president of the republic is elected for seven years by the par - liament and a number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who chooses the other ministers. The houses of par - liament are popularly and directly elected by a proportional represen - tation system. Both houses are elected for a maximum of five years, but either may be dissolved before the expiration of its normal term. Currently, the president of the republic is Sergio Mattarella, and the prime minister is Paolo Gentiloni. Italy's government is run by a coalition of its numerous political parties, and since World War II, Italy has been governed by more than 40 separate coalitions. The leader of each coalition government is selected to serve as prime minister. Each new government in Italy is faced with numerous and frequent demands for change. These demands manifest in the form of strikes or demonstrations that are generally nonviolent. As a U.S. and NATO representative, you should stay away from involvement in any political demonstration. The Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) prohibits your involvement of any political demonstration or campaign. During a political campaign, banners and posters are displayed throughout the city, and it is a serious offense to tear down or deface any of this material. Historical Naples According to legend, the Greek colony Neapolis was founded around 600 B.C., springing up around the tomb of the siren Parthenope. Although taken by the Romans in 327 B.C., the city retained good relations with Athens. The city was considered to be a rich cultural center, and many affluent Romans maintained a winter residence in the area of what is today known as Napoli, or Naples. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Naples was occu - pied repeatedly by other European peoples. Gothic, Byzantine and Lombard influence was felt in Naples, and under the Dukes of Naples (763-1139), the city enjoyed a period of independence. In 1140, Naples fell under rule by Swabian and Norman kings that lasted until 1266, a date that marked the beginning of Angevin and Aragon rule. In 1504, Naples became a province of the Spanish Kingdom. With the exception of two brief upheavals by the Partenopean Republic in 1799 and rulers Giuseppe Bonaparte and Gioacchino Murat from 1806 to 1815, Naples remained the capital until the liberation of Italy by Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1860. After the subsequent unifica - tion of Italy, the people of Naples voted for annexation into the new Kingdom of Italy. http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 5Naples Today A major Mediterranean seaport, Naples has retained much of its ancient beauty and splendor. Medieval castles and classic ruins exist side-by-side with the industrial ele - ments of the city. As you travel around the city, you will see mesmerizing juxtapositions of modern-day life with ancient customs and beliefs, as well as some truly entertaining \"only in Naples\" scenes that give this city its unique char - acter. Despite problems of overcrowding, sanitation and unemployment, Neapolitans maintain a pleasant, optimistic outlook on life. It is to your advantage to maintain a similar outlook when you arrive and begin to experience their cul - ture. As a visitor, you have a rare opportunity to experience and adapt to life in Italy. Combine this spirit with the fasci - nating variety of people and activities, and you will begin to understand what makes Naples such a magical place. Naples is a large metropolitan area, and its downtown is similar to that of any major city with respect to crime and safety. Theft exists in and around the Naples area, but by following common sense and personal safety precautions that you'll be briefed on when you arrive, you can avoid being a victim. Naples and its surrounding communities total about four million people, and the unemployment rate hovers over 20 percent, according to government estimates. About half of the workforce consists of professional services, followed closely by industrial production. Agriculture is also a por - tion of the workforce, but significantly smaller. Culture Shock \"Culture shock\" is defined as a state of bewilderment and distress experienced by an individual who is suddenly exposed to a new, strange or foreign social and cultural environment. It generally sets in after the first few weeks of arriving in a new setting. Although culture shock doesn't happen to everyone, it is considered a normal, predictable reaction. Everything is different, including the language, the customs, the telephone and the transportation. This is actually a great opportunity for learning and acquiring new perspectives. You may feel sad or lonely. Your sleep may be out of sync and you or your family members may feel angry or irritable. You may begin to develop a sense of insecurity or inadequacy. Much of what you've heard or assumed about your new environment may not reflect reality or meet your expectations. These are normal symptoms associated with the huge change in your life, and it is important to realize that these feelings are temporary, even if they last for a few weeks or even months after arrival. Eventually, you will begin to adapt and understand many aspects of the new culture, and develop a sense of balance as you settle into your job and your routines. Some deal with culture differences quickly and easily, while others need more time. Do not try to do too much all at once. Set your own pace and keep an open mind. Here are some strategies for combating stress: Be patient and go easy on yourself and others. Develop a hobby. Remember the good things you already have. Learn to be constructive. If you encounter an unfavor - able situation, avoid it next time. Include regular physical activity in your routine. This will help combat sadness and loneliness in a constructive manner. Exercise, swim or take an aerobics class. Take time to relax and/or meditate. These activities have proven to be positive for people experiencing stress. Allow yourself to feel sad about the things that you have left behind, but maintain contact with your friends and family. This will give you a feeling of belonging and help reduce loneliness. Begin to integrate with your new culture. Learn the lan - guage. Volunteer in community activities that allow you to practice that language. This will help you feel less stress and more useful at the same time. Remember, you are not alone. Each week many new people arrive in Italy and are faced with the same trans - itional challenges. Pay attention to relationships with your family and with people at work. If you feel stressed, look for help. There is always someone or some service available to help you. Lean on them. If you're having problems, your command and the Fleet and Family Support Center are excellent resources. Look at this assignment as a rare opportunity. Most Piazza del Plebiscito is the largest public square in Naples. It is flanked to the east by the Royal Palace of Naples and on the west by the church of San Francesco di Paola, and is located near the world-famous San Carlo Theater and the Galleria Umberto I. Photo by MC1 Theron J. Godbold Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Benvenuti a Napoli6people who visit Italy do so in a rush and see the country from the inside of a bus or train. Your experience will offer you a more accurate view of life in Italy, and here you will find friends and experiences that will last a lifetime. You do not have to become an Italian, nor should you expect your attempts to become Italian to be easy or quick. Italians expect you to be different, and they acknow - ledge that Americans have their own way of doing things. This is only made possible by mutual respect and under - standing. The Neapolitan Way Even other Italians recognize that Neapolitans have a character all their own. They seem to talk constantly, using arms and hands to animate conversations and emphasize viewpoints. They press forward during conversations, and their idea of personal space is significantly less than what Americans consider comfortable. Neapolitans are passionate about everything and every - body. When you first arrive in Naples, you may get the impression that you have walked into the midd - le of a vast family quarrel, or if the mood is right, a comic opera. One of the most noticeable cultural differen - ces in Naples is the concept of time. After you are here for a while, you will realize that the Neapolitan pace of life is not as rushed as that of Americans (although driving may be the exception to that rule). Many Neapolitans like to postpone one thing in favor of something they consider more pressing. You may feel the impact of the concept of time when you first call to have a mechanic fix your car or a plumber fix your leaky faucet. This does not mean the Neapolitans don't like to work. It is simply that they know that the world is not going to end if your leaky faucet is not fixed today because something more impor - tant comes up. That something may be a family obligation. A long history of kings and king - doms, revolutions, plagues and wars has pro - bably contributed to a lifestyle of patience, good humor and close family ties. It could be said that while Naples has been occupied by many different empires and coun - tries throughout its history, it has never been conquered. Something of the independent and unique spirit of Naples has endured through the ages to create the city and the people that today share their home with you. Italian Language The Italian language is one of your greatest assets in making this tour fun and rewarding. Without it, you are excluding the best avenues to an exhilarating experience. Nothing flatters people more than the knowledge that a for - eigner has made an attempt to learn their lan - guage. Once you break down the language bar - rier, you will find a whole new world opens up, ready for your exploration. You don't need to become a seasoned linguist to be understood. No matter how fractured your Italian, the host will be patient and appreciative of your attempts. You will be more successful in any situation - shopping, traveling, meeting neighbors - if you try to speak Italian. Although you will usually find someone who speaks English in the larger city shops, those who insist on always seeking out someone who speaks English not only will irritate and alie - nate, but will constantly feel insecure and frustrated. Remember, too, that Italy was once a collection of city- states under separate rule, and dialects abound, often sounding very different than the Italian you may learn in class. Although local expressions and pronunciations may be puzzling, Italian is the national language, and if you learn it, you will be understood. Language courses are available to those assigned to Naples, and tuition assistan - ce may be available. Check in with the Navy College Office on arrival, and the staff can help you choose a course to fit your needs. Italian-owned schools of language and private tutors are also available. A pocket dictionary or phrase book is a valuable tool http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 7 Opposite the world-famous San Carlo Theater is the Galleria Umberto I, the most elegant shopping mall in Europe. Photo courtesy of NSA Public Affairs even before your arrival, and a basic familiarity with words and phrases will make your transition into the local com - munity much easier. \"America in Italy\" Your tour of duty in Naples will make you more than an American tourist. You will be a resident of Italy, and as such, a representative of both America and the U.S. military for - ces. The importance of providing a positive image is obvious. Your responsibility to help provide such an image extends to your daily interactions with your neighbors, shopkeepers and other Italians you may encounter. Your job as a diplomat will be made easier if you attempt to learn and understand the language and customs of the host nation. Military Community Your orders have brought you to one of the world's most diverse and active communities. At one time or another, you will associate with members of all branches of the American military and also with foreign military collea - gues. Often you will perform both U.S. national and inter - national functions. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was esta - blished in 1949. Today there are 28 permanent representa - tives to the North Atlantic Council: Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Since the treaty was signed April 4, 1949, in Washington, D.C., the United States has stood by its com - mitment to its NATO allies. That's why you are here today. Allied Joint Force Command (JFC) Naples Allied Joint Force Command (JFC) Naples was activated on March 15, 2004, when its predecessor command, Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH), was deactivated after nearly 53 years of successful activity in support of peace and stability in and around its designated area of responsibility. At the operational level, the new NATO command struc - ture consists of two standing Joint Force Commands: one at Brunssum, Netherlands and one in Naples, Italy. In addi - tion, a smaller Joint Headquarters was activated in Lisbon, Portugal. Allied Joint Force Command Naples celebrated the offi - cial opening and ribbon cutting ceremony at the new JFC Naples headquarters located in Lago Patria, Giugliano, Naples on December 13, 2012. The position of Commander, JFC Naples is held by a U.S. Navy four-star admiral. Currently, the Admiral has operational responsibi - lity for NATO missions in the Balkans and the Mediter - ranean Area of Responsibility. Commander, JFC Naples is also Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe. Twenty-two NATO nations contribute to the JFC Naples integrated military staff: Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. Several partner nations are also represented within a Partners for Peace staff element. Allied Joint Force Command Naples is one of two Joint Force Commands in the NATO Command Structure. The activation of JFC Naples was a part of NATO's transformation aimed at adapting the allied military structure to the operational challenges of coalition warfare, to face the emerging threats in the new millennium. Photo courtesy of JFC Public Affairs Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Benvenuti a Napoli8 There is no time to waste in getting ready for your move to Naples. A move overseas requires months of preparation, and the sooner you have orders in hand, the sooner you can get started. This section will provide you with some of the details and answers to some of the most commonly asked questions on moving overseas. It cannot be overemphasized that you should immediately contact your sponsor since he or she is your first link to your new command. Constant communica - tion between you and your sponsor will make your move easier for your family and eliminate needless worries and frus trations. Your sponsor should send you a Welcome Aboard package and provide you with useful infor - mation to ensure your transition to life overseas is as smooth as possible. Provide your sponsor with accurate information on yourself and your family. In the summer months, it is not uncommon for long waiting lists for temporary accom - modations, so send the following to your sponsor as soon as possible: Leave address and phone number (tran - sient email address also recommended); Dates/times/flight numbers for your arrival; Family size, ages of children and any special considerations; Child care needs; Pets you may be bringing. If you haven't heard back from your sponsor in a few days, contact your new command immediately. Overseas Screening You should immediately begin the process of overseas screening for you and your family as soon as you have orders in hand. The overseas screening process is designed to identify personnel or family members who have medical conditions or illnesses that cannot be treated by the U.S. Navy Hospital (USNH) Naples due to the lack of medical speciali - sts. For example, service members with conditions such as cancer, autism, chronic mental illness, cardiac insufficiency, rheumatology, advanced pulmonary disease and neurologi - cal disorders cannot obtain specialty care at USNH Naples. The facility is small and does not offer these services. Additionally, medications for some conditions may not be available at the hospital pharmacy. Please check medica - tion availability with the pharmacy at 081-811-6225 prior to your transfer. The overseas screening process, if done prop erly, identifies personnel and family members who would be at increased risk if they were assigned to Naples. Overseas screening is required of active duty service members and their families. Civilians, contractors and Department of Defense personnel seeking employment in Naples are highly encouraged to have an overseas screen - ing. This will ensure any specialty care you may require will be available to you. This typically consists of medical examinations, inocula - tions and an interview with a command representative. Additionally, if you or one of your family members has a change in your medical condition after com - pletion of the overseas screening, notify your command at once. You should contact your respec - tive medical facility to begin the overseas immunization series far enough in advance so a last minute rush is avoided. Having to get several shots at once can be painful, espe - cially for children. An \"International Certificate of Vaccination\" (PHS Form 731) is required and will be issued before leaving the United States once you have completed the required shots; booster shots are given as required at USNH Naples. PHS Form 731 is a \"Yellow Card\" that all immuni - zation clinics should carry. All active-duty service members and their dependents are encouraged to have an updated version of the Yellow Card. At times, personnel find themselves in need of special - ized care that can only be obtained in the Italian commu - nity. If you suspect you may need special care, contact the USNH Naples Patient Administration Department at DSN 629-6215 or Commercial 081-811-6215 to inquire if the ser - vice is provided and if insurance is accepted. Passports, Visas and Sojourner Permits Military personnel may enter Italy on official military orders and with a military ID card. For security reasons, Preparing for Transfer http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 9 personal travel should be conducted with a tourist pass - port instead of a military ID card. Generally, non-NATO countries require passports for military personnel. If your new duties in Naples require you to travel on official busi - ness to countries requiring an official passport, coordinate with your new command to obtain an official passport. Tourist passports are obtainable through the American Consulate in Naples. See your command's travel represen - tative for current information. All military dependents and DoD civilians, including chil - dren, require a passport and a Missione visa for entry into Italy. Thus, all military spouses, civilian component mem - bers and family members must obtain a Missione visa and an official or no-fee passport prior to their entry into Italy. Military family members, DoD civilians and their respective family members must request and receive the visa through their travel office or from the nearest Italian Consulate prior to their departure from the United States. Visas require several weeks to obtain, and you cannot obtain a visa once you arrive in Italy. It is strongly recom - mended you start this process early so that your entire family may transfer with you. If you have a Letter of Intent from your detailer, you can begin the process. For additio - nal information on visa requirements, see the Bureau of Consular Affairs website at http://www.state.gov/travel or check with your local NAVPTO or travel office. Obtaining the appropriate visa after arrival in Italy is impossible, and most situations would require a return to the United States. Dependents who are citizens of European Union coun - tries do not require a visa. See http://www.usis.it/visa/ for additional information regarding Italian visa requirements. Non-U.S. dependents may travel on their country pas - sport, although non-U.S. dependents should consult with the Italian Embassy to determine if any further documenta - tion is required for their entry into Italy, which is usually determined by the dependent's country of nationality. Within eight days of their arrival in Italy, all military family members and DoD civilian employees and their family members are required to apply for a Sojourner Permit, the Permesso di Soggiorno. This document is issued by the Italian government. A Sojourner Permit is a confirmation of your legal resident status in Italy, much like an American Green Card. If you do not have a visa upon arrival in Italy, you cannot obtain a Sojourner Permit. It is different from a visa, which is merely an approval for entry into the country. Italian law requires all foreign personnel working or living within Italy, other than an active-duty service members under military orders, to apply for a Sojourner Permit within eight days of arrival in Italy. All applicants over 14 years of age must apply in per - son, as each person's signature is required at the time of application. Part of this procedure is the requirement to fin - gerprint individuals aged 18 and older. As part of the Area Orientation process, the Region Legal Service Office, Europe Africa, Southwest Asia (RLSO EURAFSWA) assists in the preparation and oversees the acquisition of the Sojourner Permit for all personnel atta - ched to U.S. Navy commands in the Naples area. Army and Air Force personnel stationed at JFC must apply for Sojourner Permits through the Carabinieri at the JFC Provost Marshall's Office, Building L. Before you travel to Italy you must have all necessary documents for the permit - specifically, a Missione visa Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Preparing for Transfer10 U.S. Naval Support Activity Naples is host to more than 50 separate commands and approximately 8,500 personnel.

It is vital to work with your sponsor and new com - mand to ensure that you have all the necessary documents before you detach. Civilians should always carry their Sojourner Permit and passport when traveling to other countries. While commu - ting in the local area, it is a good idea to carry a photo - copy of your Sojourner Permit in case you are stopped by police. Military members should, of course, always carry their military ID cards with them. Power of Attorney A power of attorney may be necessary if the service member will be absent from home for extended periods of time. A power of attorney may be tailored and limited to accommodate particular individual needs. There are two types of powers of attorneys: general and special. General powers of attorney are powerful documents and should only be used in limited circumstances. A judge advocate can provide advice on whether to get a general or special power of attorney. In most cases, a special power of attorney can be drafted that will protect the maker and will authorize the holder to complete all required business. Finally, if you need a power of attorney for the purchase of a vehicle registered through MVRO, you must complete the required initial paperwork before the power of attorney can be drafted. If you need a power of attorney, visit the Region Legal Service Office EURAFSWA at Capodichino, located on the first floor of the Admin. II building. No appointment is need - ed to obtain a power of attorney in Naples. Rations The sale of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages (other than beer and wine) is controlled by ration cards. The command holding your service record will issue you the ration card for tobacco products and alcoholic bevera - ges. Your spouse receives a separate ration card. Eligible DoD military and civilian personnel are entitled to a monthly allowance of tax-free gas coupons. Tax-free gas coupons are available with the intent of providing sufficient tax-exempted fuel for home-to-work travel. The monthly ration and type of fuel is determined by the engine size, engine base horsepower and type of fuel required by the member's primary vehicle, which must be registered at the Motor Vehicle Registration Office (CMVRO). The criteria uti - lized to ascertain the member's allowance is the following: Engine size Monthly fuel Monthly motor oil allowance (liters) allowance (liters) Up to 668 cc 100 4 669 to 1,119 cc 200 2,883 cc 300 8 Above 2884 cc 400 8 Motor scooters that are registered as the primary vehi - cle are entitled to 60 liters of fuel a month, whereas motorcycles, which also must be registered as the primary vehicle, receive the same allowance as a vehicle, however may not exceed a maximum of 200 liters per month. Tax-free gas coupons can be purchased at the custo -mer service desk at the Navy Exchange, and are valid for unleaded or diesel fuel at authorized gas stations. The only gas stations authorized to accept tax-free gas coupons are AGIP and ENI stations. You may be requested to show identification prior to the gas station accepting the gas coupons. This is a preventive measure that is in place to avoid illegal usage of tax-free gas coupons. Gas stations are both self-service and full service. If the attendant fills up your vehicle ensure he fully understands that you want \"litri\" (liters) and not euro. It is not common practice to request \"litri.\" Once you have ensured the number of \"litri\" you requested has been pumped, then you must duly fill out the appropriate gas coupons. Gas coupons must inclu - de signature, plate number and the date. Selling, bartering, lending or giving coupons or the pro - duct itself to any person is prohibited, as is buying or bor - rowing coupons from any person. Illegal use of coupons is a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and Italian fiscal law. What Should I Bring? In Italy, an unfurnished apartment or villa is just that, unfurnished. Sometimes that could mean no clothes clo - sets, screens or medicine cabinets in the bathrooms. In these cases, you may be able to purchase these items from the previous tenant, but for the most part setting up a house in Italy will cost more than in most places. Use this list to decide what you will put into storage before coming to Italy. Reported cases of housebreaking and theft of personal property (including motor vehicles) are not uncommon. Consideration should be given to sto - ring items of great sentimental value or items of high value that are unnecessary to have during an overseas tour. Keep in mind that there are no safety deposit boxes availa - ble on the military installations. Contact your Personal Property Office to get more infor - mation on storage provided by the government during an overseas tour. The following are some suggestions concerning indivi - dual types of household appliances and fixtures. Once again, ask your sponsor if your individual questions are not answered here. Light fixtures: American lamps can be adapted to Italian current simply by replacing American bulbs with Italian ones and by using an Italian adapter. American and Italian lamps are available on the economy and from the Navy Exchange. Medicine cabinets: Available locally, both new and used at a reasonable cost. You can request your landlord to install them when negotiating your housing contract. Beds and mattresses: If you have them, bring them. Beds and mattresses are available at the Navy Exchange. Beds and mattresses are also available on the economy but are different sizes than American beds. Carpets / Rugs: In a move to Italy, rugs often become a major expense. Floors here are hard tile or marble. Bring all the carpets and rugs you own. If you don't already have rugs, you may want to buy a few inexpensive room-size carpets (9x12 feet, 9x15 feet, etc.). Average-quality rugs and padding in standard sizes are available at the Navy Exchange. Also, Middle Eastern rugs are often sold by ven - dors at the Navy Exchange retail center. A wide variety of rugs can be found on the Italian economy, too. http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 11 Draperies: Drapes from your last home probably will be too short here because of the high windows and ceilings. You can purchase fabric on the economy or it can be mail- ordered from the United States. You may not require dra - pes because the \"persiane\" (black-out blinds that raise and lower much like hurricane shutters) are standard in most Italian dwellings. Carpentry tools and do-it-yourself equipment: If you have them, bring them. A limited selection is available through the Navy Exchange. Tools purchased on the econ - omy will come in metric sizes. The Auto/Wood Skills Center at the Support Site does have a great selection of tools to use on site. Desks, dressers and other storage: Anything that can be used to store things will come in handy. In your new home, there will be many areas where you can put small tables, desks, dressers and chests. Most homes do not have closets. Air conditioners: It is recommended that you do not bring an air conditioner. Dehumidifiers: Naples can be very damp, particularly during the winter months. A dehumidifier will help make your home easier to keep warm and avoid mildew problems. They are usually available in the Navy Exchange and on the economy. Microwaves:Keep in mind that microwaves are provided as part of the Partial Full Tour Furnishings Program from the Housing Warehouse. Microwave ovens sold in the United States are generally 60 cycles and cannot be converted. Unless specifically designated 50/60 Hz, they cannot be used without damage to the magnetron tube. Units sold in the Navy Exchange are 50/60 Hz and are ready to use with a tran - sformer. When you are returning to the United States, they may be adjusted to 60 Hz for stateside use. Small Electrical Appliances: Generally speaking (except for hair dryers, toasters and electrical clocks) small electri - cal appliances adapt to use on transformers. Items with 220 volts are available on the economy. Electrical Clocks: Plug-in clocks are not practical because they will not keep accurate time due to the 50 cycle current (the hands travel five-sixths of an hour every 60 minutes). Also, many areas experience brief power outages that will throw the time off. Wind-up or battery powered clocks are your best bet. Television: A multi-system TV can receive Italian signals. To receive all of AFN's channels you will have to get a decoder. One decoder is provided by the Housing Office as part of the Partial Full Tour Furnishing Program. Additional decoders can be purchased from the Navy Exchange. The sound system of the Italian television broadcast is on a different frequency than the United States. With a minor adjustment of the receiver, you may be able to pick up the Italian sound, but the picture will appear in black and white. The Navy Exchange has a com - plete stock of antennas, amplifiers and multi-system TVs available. If you plan to use your TV only for DVD or VHS formats then conversion is not required. Radio: A portable radio is invaluable. Electric models work well, but if you experience electrical outages, the por - table should be there as a back-up. Radios with AM/FM bands are best. The clock portion of clock radios will not work because of the difference in current. Lawn mowers: Several years ago, it was unheard of for Americans to bring a lawn mower to Naples because everybody lived in apartments overlooking the Bay of Naples. However, with the exodus to the suburbs, more families live in villas with lawns. New lawn mowers are available at the Navy Exchange on a limited basis. Some common replacement parts are available, but due to the variety of models manufactured, it is recommended that if you ship your mower, you also ship extra blades, plugs and \"tune-up\" kits. Lawn furniture: Even with an apartment, you may have balconies or rooftop access and will be able to use lawn furniture. The Navy Exchange carries an assortment of lawn furniture, and wicker furniture is available locally on the Italian market. If you want to buy some high quality lawn items, Italy is famous for export - ing a wide variety. Bicycles: Because of the traffic, it is unsafe for young children to ride bikes in city streets. However, most suburban areas have relati - vely quiet streets where bicycles can be safely ridden. You can also enjoy bike riding at the Support Site, Carney Park and Caserta's Royal Palace. Bicyles are available for rent at the Navy Outdoor Recreation (NOR) Center at Carney Park. Civilian clothing: All members of your family should plan to dress as they would at any military installation located where there are four seasons. Winter in Naples can be cold and damp, so be prepared and bring along extra warm clothing. Due to high fuel costs and the necessity for good ventilation, temperatures in most dwellings are kept lower than many families are used to. Sweaters and other warm clothing items are essential for inside wear in winter. Europeans tend to dress more formally than Americans. Our host country nationals expect us to dress like Americans, but extremely informal clothing reflects poor taste on our part. If in doubt as to what to wear, the safest rule is to \"overdress,\" and you will fit right into any situation. Personal Property Shipment Upon receipt of orders to the Naples area, including Rome, it is recommended that you immediately contact the nearest Personal Property Shipping Office (PPSO) or visit the DoD Household Goods portal at www.move.mil to arrange for shipment of your personal property. The PPSO or the DoD Household Goods Portal will be able to provide specific information about entitlements, mode of shipment, transit times, etc. Once you arrive in Naples take all copies of documenta - tion covering your shipments, including your automobile, to the PPSO to get started. The Personal Property staff will provide information regarding the delivery and claims of your house hold goods. Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Preparing for Transfer12 Household goods:Depending on the origin, it usually takes 65 to 85 days for household goods to arrive in Naples from the continental United States and 100 to 160 days to arrive from elsewhere. Naples is not a weight-restricted area, so you may ship your full weight allowance. But remember: unaccompanied baggage, storage lots and shipments to a designated place are all included in this weight allowance. Unaccompanied personnel E-3 and below need to contact their sponsor prior to shipment of household goods. Contact with your sponsor is important in order to determine which household good items are neces - sary in Naples and which will be better to store or ship to a designated place. Through the Loaner Furniture program in Naples, you'll be able to get furniture and some appliances to use until your household goods shipment arrives. Unaccompanied baggage or express shipment: De - pending on the origin, it usually takes 45 to 60 days for express shipments to arrive in Naples from the continental United States and 75 to 100 days to arrive from elsewhere. Your unaccompanied baggage should include neces - sary clothing, uniforms, linens and blankets, dishes, pots, pans, essential kitchen utensils, an iron, an ironing board, small collapsible cribs, play pens, strollers, small televi - sions, stereo sets and professional books, papers and equipment. No furniture items may be included in unac - companied baggage shipments. Temporary storage: In connection with your shipment of household goods and unaccompanied baggage, should it be necessary to delay the delivery of your personal pro - perty shipments upon arrival in Naples, you will be authori -zed an initial 90 days of storage at government expense. If it becomes necessary to exceed the 90 days, you must contact the PPSO and request additional storage in wri - ting. Another 90 days may be granted if all requirements are met. These additional 90 days of storage applies only to military. Civilians must have command approval for additional 90 days and amendments to their orders autho - rizing the additional 90 days must be issued. Non-temporary storage (NTS): Orders to any overseas duty station may entitle you to non-temporary storage at government expense for the duration of the overseas tour. NTS is only authorized for military assigned to government quarters when property is excess to their quarters. NTS is not authorized for military living in economy quarters or civilians living in economy or government quarters. Privately owned firearms: Shipping of any kind of wea - pon is absolutely prohibited. The Italian government has imposed a ban on shipment of privately owned firearms to Italy. Privately owned firearms include any weapons that are designed for or can be readily converted to be used for attack, defense, sports, games or hunting by driving a projectile through the barrel. This includes air pistols, air rifles and firing replicas of antique firearms. Additionally, the ban includes other weapons, such as spring-opening knives, fixed bowie knives, straight-edge razors, brass knuckles, blackjack devices, cans with sharpened points, pipes, chains, slings and any other similar weapon which may be used for assaulting a person. Italian law states that pocket knives may be carried, but the blade must not exceed two inches in length. Failure to comply with http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 13 this requirement will result in the return of the firearm to the United States at member's expense, possible confi - scation by Italian authorities and payment of fines to the Italian government. Claims: All household goods and unaccompanied bag - gage shipments fall under the Full Replacement Value (FRV) Protection. For personal property lost, damaged or destroyed while in the care of the transportation service provider (TSP), the member can recover whichever is grea - ter: $5,000 per shipment or $4 times the weight of the shipment in pounds, up to a maximum of $50,000. An important difference between depreciated value cover age and FRV is that with FRV, the member files his or her claim with the TSP rather than with the Military Claims Office (MCO). As before, the member records loss or damage on DD Form 1840/DD 1850 (for damage or loss discovered at delivery) or the DD Form 1840R/1850R (for damage or loss discovered after delivery). If you are filing a claim, the DD 1840 or DD 1850 must be turned into the PPSO within 70 days of delivery of the shipment. PPSO will stamp and return the form. You have 75 days from the date of delivery to notify the carrier or TSP using the DD 1840 or DD 1850, and nine months to complete the claim with the carrier under the Full Replacement Value system. You must use the Defense Personal Property System (DPS) to file all claims. For details visit www.move.mil Shipping your privately owned vehicle (POV): Military and DoD civilians are entitled to ship one POV overseas at government expense (see section on automobiles for more information). The vehicle you ship enters Italy free of import duty. When turning in your POV for shipment, it is extremely important to ensure the vehicle identification number shown on documents matches the physical description shown on the POV. An error may constitute delay in receiving the vehicle or prevent registration. Additionally, there are no restrictions as to color, age, dimensions or special lighting of POVs imported. Vehicles shipped must be in mechani - cally safe operating condition and must undergo a detailed safety inspection before registration. Estimated transit times are 45 to 60 days from East Coast ports, 55 to 90 days from the Gulf and 75 to 90 days from West Coast ports. Importation of motorcycles: All mopeds, motorcycles, motorbikes and motor scooters shipped with your household goods (HHG) enter Italy duty free and must be registe - red with the Motor Vehicle Registration Office prior to delivery. Members must ensure that the transportation service provider (TSP) adheres to the following procedures during their pack out: All mopeds/motorcycles shipped with HHG must be packed in a separate container. Crate must be properly marked on the outside of the crate that this shipment contains a motor cy - cle/moped. Inventory must include type, year and make of motor cycle/moped and serial/chassis number. Member must mail orders, Government Bill of Lading (GBL), stateside title, registration (in service member's name) and inventory to the Naples Personal Property Shipping Office, Attn: Motorcycle Clearance, PSC 808 Box 42, FPO, AE 09618-0042. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the return of the motorcycle or moped to the United States at member's expense, confiscation by the Italian Customs Authority and payment of fines, duties or taxes as determi - ned by the Italian government. Importation of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), three-wheelers and off-road motorcycles is highly discouraged. Property Insurance Italian landlords do not carry insurance against fire, theft or water damage to the building, apartment or the tenant's hou - sehold furnishings. Unless you have renter's insurance, you could suffer loss or damage that would be difficult to recover, even after long and costly litigation in the Italian courts. Reported cases of housebreaking and theft of personal pro - perty (including motor vehicles) are not uncommon. Americans, as well as Italians, learn to be security conscious and evaluate the precautions taken to safeguard their pro - perty. Consideration should be given to storing items of great sentimental value or items of high value that are unnecessary to have during an overseas tour. You are strongly encoura - ged to take out private insurance or update your current policy, if you have one. Keep in mind that there are no safety deposit boxes available on the military installations. If a theft of your property has occured, you may file a claim with the United States government for reimburse - ment. However, there are limitations on the amount that can be paid. Information concerning claims is available from the Naval Legal Services Office. Pets The The Navy Lodge facility at the Support Site in Gricignano does not have a kennel. There is a small Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Preparing for Transfer14 amount of pet-friendly lodging available at the Navy Lodge, but it is in limited supply, so be sure you or your sponsor call to reserve well in advance. Pets may be housed in local (off-base) animal boarding facilities, or you may also consider leaving your pet with your sponsor or a friend. Per night kennel rates average about 10 to 15 euro per pet and cannot be filed with your travel claim. Kennel fees are non-refundable. Coordinate arrangements with your sponsor prior to arriving to mini - mize the stress on you and your pets. If you rent an apartment on the local economy, most landlords allow pets. Residents who live in government quarters are allowed to have two indoor micro-chipped pets (cats or dogs) that are spayed or neutered. It is important that you notify the housing office and your sponsor about what kind of pets you plan to bring with you to Italy. The base instruction prohibits the boarding of any pets weighing over 70 pounds and there are some breed restrictions. You can bring your pet to Italy with you on Air Mobility Command (AMC) flights on a space-available basis. There is an excess baggage fee and only a limited number of pets may be shipped on each flight. AMC will not ship any pets weighing more than 150 pounds. Be sure to inform the personnel department that schedules your flight to Italy that you will be traveling with a pet. There is a limit of two pets for each family, dogs and cats only, and you must provide the proper travel containers. There is no quarantine period in Italy, but you will be required to have a current rabies immunization record on your animals. The pet must have had the rabies shot not more than 12 months and not less than 30 days prior to arrival in Italy. In addition, a veterinary health certificate with the following data is required: personal identification of the owner and a detailed description of the animal atte - sting to its good health. This certification is good for only 10 days from the date of examination and must be certified by an official veterinary service. If your pet is old, requires special treatment or long-term medication, it is recommended that you not bring your cat or dog to Naples. No special diagnostic facilities are avail - able. If your pet has a special health problem, have your sponsor contact veterinary services to determine whether or not adequate care is available. Banking and Credit Cards In Italy, you will rely on cash much more than you did in the United States. Though you can use American Express, Visa and Mastercard at most shopping centers, hotels and restaurants, you'll quickly discover that many do not accept credit cards or those that do are having a technical problem running your card. You cannot use gas credit cards. The Navy Exchange takes Master Card, Visa, American Express and Discover. There are various banks and ATMs both on and off base. Here are some on-base options: Capodichino Banco di Napoli (Bldg. 450). Community Bank (Capo Landing). Navy Exchange Minimart cashier: euro or dollar sales. Rates are close to the daily exchange rate. Outside of Admin II, there are also three ATMs available: Banco di Napoli dispenses only euro, Navy Federal dispen - ses U.S. currency, and Community Bank gives both. Outside of the Air Terminal is a Community Bank ATM that dispenses euro and dollars. Support Site Navy Federal Credit Union maintains a full service office at the Navy Exchange retail complex. Navy Exchange cashier: euro or dollar sales. Rates are close to the daily exchange rate. There are three ATMs at the Support Site: The Italian ATM inside the Navy Lodge across from the elevators dispenses euro. Navy Federal ATMs located outside of the Navy Lodge and outside the Navy Exchange retail center, near the main doors by the movie theater, dispense dollars. Allied Joint Force Command Naples: Banco di Napoli. Postal Matters One of the closest and strongest ties to loved ones in the United States is the mail. Fortunately, mail service is relatively quick and efficient despite being overseas in Naples. Postal services in Naples are spread out over a wide geographic area with a mail control activity at Rome's International Airport, and post office services at Capodichino, Gricignano (Support Site), JFC, Gaeta and Latina. Naples-area military post offices provide the following services: General delivery service (mail call); Stamp sales and postal money orders; Pick-up point for accountable mail; Mail directory-locator services; USPS claims and inquiry services; In- and out-processing of patrons; Mail receipt and mailing services. As an authorized military postal service patron, it is your responsibility to inform all correspondents of your correct mailing and forwarding address prior to leaving your present duty station. You should obtain your new address for your new command from your sponsor and notify all your correspondents at least six to eight weeks prior to checkout. Your new address should contain all of the following information: Full name, rank and rate Name of Command: PSC and Box Number: PSC XXX Box XXXX (PSC and Box number) is equivalent to a street address) 15 FPO and Zip Code: equivalent to a city; AE is equivalent to a state) It is extremely important to NOT add \"Naples\" or \"Italy\" to the mailing address to avoid misrouting of mail into the Italian national postal system. It currently takes an average of five to seven days for a first class letter or priority parcel to reach the United States. For best results, ask friends to use Priority Mail when mail - ing your items. For time sensitive matters, Express Mail Military Service is available to and from NSA Naples. Magazines, newspapers, catalogs, non-profit book rate etc., can take six to eight weeks by container ship. Packages sent by Parcel Post will also take this long to arrive. Lastly, do not mail perishable foods or meats, plants, soil matter, tobacco, firearms of any kind or alcohol to or from Italy. Only U.S. currency is accepted at the post offices, with the exception of the Gaeta postal operation, which is a cashless operation. You may use personal checks for the exact amount of purchase and major credit cards and bank debit cards. You cannot purchase money orders with per - sonal checks or credit cards. You may use traveler's checks to purchase all services, provided purchases total at least half the amount of the traveler's check.

Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Preparing for Transfer16 Getting Settled Area Orientation With With your arrival into Naples, one of the first things you'll go through at your new duty station will be the Naples Area Orientation (AO). In an effort to make things efficient and convenient for newcomers, everything is centrally located at the Support Site during this orientation, except for a one-day field trip, during which transportation, guidance and assistance are provided. Check with your command sponsor or the Fleet and Family Support Center (FFSC) for the current Naples Area Orientation schedule. AO Week Snapshot Below is a snapshot of what to expect during Area Orientation week. Unless otherwise noted, all AO events occur at the Support Site Reel Times 2 Movie Theater. The first day of AO always starts on a Friday unless the rotator (MAC flight) is late. Then it will begin the next busi - ness day. Mass check-in (active-duty Navy only) will be conducted and newcomers will need to bring the following: Four copies of endorsed orders All receipts from your travels Flight itinerary and port of call message (if applicable) One copy of Page 2 if you have dependents (military only) All medical and dental records (military only) One copy of driver's license One copy of passport photo page All family members passports U.S. civilian hires must report to their respective HRO no later than the start of the next business day after arrival or at the date/time previously coordinated with their HRO. Newcomers and sponsors are encouraged to ask their sponsors or the Fleet and Family Support Center (FFSC) for the latest schedule. The FFSC can be reached at DSN 629-4896 or Commercial 081-811-4896. Some topics covered at AO: Housing Essentials Brief: Economy/Government/BEQ School Liaison Officer TRICARE Preparation Brief Legal Postal/Personal Property Motor Vehicle Registration (MVRO) TRICARE/Medical and Dental Check-in Fire Prevention Operation Preparedness Emergency Management Disaster Prep Safety MVRO AFI Driver's License Test Navy Exchange FFSC Services/Ombudsman Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Environmental http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 17 Most new arrivals who report to Naples will land at the Capodichino Air Terminal. Photo by MC1 Daniel Barker NCIS/SAVI Sojourner Relations The FFSC staff offers Intercultural Relations (ICR) class - es for newcomers in conjunction with Area Orientation. This two-day class is mandatory for all U.S. Navy person - nel. All family members and non-Navy personnel are encouraged to attend. The first day is classroom training spent in the Reel Times 2 Movie Theater. The class helps participants understand and adapt to the Italian culture by learning basic Italian phrases and customs, how to use local transportation, shopping tips and dining information. All of which helps newcomers overcome any culture shock they may experience from living in a new country. The second day consists of a field trip to help familiarize participants with the city of Naples, the public transporta - tion system and the wonderful Italian culture. FFSC offers a variety of follow-up classes to promote participation in the local culture, such as \"How to Make Limoncello,\" \"HandGestures,\" \"How To Make Italian Desserts,\" \"Easy Italian\" and many more. Housing One of the most pressing set of questions as you prepa - re for a tour in Naples or Gaeta likely deals with housing. This section will help answer those questions, as well as point out some information about housing and utilities in Italy - information you can use throughout your entire tour. The Housing Service Center (HSC) assists DoD military, Allied Forces, civilian and contractor personnel in locating housing in the Naples area. The HSC has main offices at the Gricignano Support Site and in Gaeta. Housing also has a one-stop center at Capodichino and a warehouse in Teverola. Assignment Policy Military Families: All E-1 to O-6 accompanied service members are subject to Direct Assignment and are re quired to apply for housing and be placed onto the waiting list. Upon arrival, military personnel may request to reside in the local economy. A certificate of non-availability (CNA) will be issued if less than four military family housing units are available in the member's waiting list category. If more than four units are available, you will be assigned to government quarters. For those who have been assigned a local sponsor, please have your sponsor contact the housing office and provide them with your arrival date as soon as possible. Visit the housing office's Facebook page, NSA Naples Housing, for more information. Navy Lodge Navy Lodge Naples, located on the Support Site, offers 96 guest rooms and 24 villas. Guests enjoy free weekday issues of \"Stars & Stripes,\" free on-base phone calls, an AM/FM clock radio, an iron and ironing board, cable TV, a kitchenette, a DVD player, a flat panel TV, vending ma - chines, a hair dryer and free Wi-Fi access.

Photo by MC1 Daniel Barker Government Quarters Government quarters assignment is based on your family composition and pay grade. Your unit will be furni - shed with appliances and loaner furniture, if needed. You or your sponsor can obtain needed items from the Loaner Locker at the Fleet and Family Support Center until your express shipment arrives. Single or unaccompanied E-1 to E-4 service members will reside in Bachelor Enlisted Quarters. Civilian employees will receive a check-in briefing from the Human Resources Office (HRO) regarding your entitle - ments for Temporary Quarters Subsistence Allowance (TQSA) and Living Quarters Allowance (LQA). Phone numbers and email Commercial: 011-39-081-811-4466 Email: M-NA-NSAHSG-Admin-GS@eu.navy.mil Facebook: NSA Naples Housing All 971 family housing units are located on the Support Site. The hou - sing units are constructed as either six- or 12-plex apartment buildings. Each building is designated for either officer or enlisted personnel. Apartments are configured as two- bedroom, three-bedroom and four- bedroom units, with two bathrooms and are equipped with central heating and air conditioning, a laundry room with a washer and dryer, a microwave oven, a dishwasher, a refrigerator, a gas stove, and both 110-volt and 220- volt electrical receptacles. The AFN satellite system and ADSL internet access are available in each home. Economy Housing If you are given the option to live on the economy, your first stop will be the Showing Services branch at the Housing Service Center (HSC). The Showing Services staff maintain a database of available rental properties throughout the Naples area. Many of the properties have pho - tos provided by the landlord. Showing tours may be set up with a counselor who will orient you to the many areas of Naples and explain your options in selecting your new home. You may also register and view available rental properties at the Navy-sponsored refer - ral website www.Homes.mil. Once registered, you will be able to search for available proper - ties based on your desired criteria information. Checking In at the Housing Service Center You must complete a check-in briefing, which provides important information regar - ding services such as TLA requirements, government housing, Showing Services, and the economy house-hunting process. This will be done during the Area Orientation Housing Brief, normally on a Friday. During the brief, you will need to apply for a \"Codice Fiscale,\" the Italian equivalent of a Social Security num - ber. This is required to sign a lease and establish utility services. Note: You may only view homes with the Housing Office Showing Staff, or an authorized agent who is on the approved list provided by the HSC. Use of an unapproved individual is a violation of NSA policy and will result in ter - mination of TLA and non-certification of OHA. Economy housing consists of a wide variety of duplex, townhouse and single-family (villa) dwellings. Although some properties may be furnished, the majority are unfur - nished. Tenants are typically expected to provide their own appliances, however these are provided as part of the Navy's Partial Full Tour Furnishing (PFTF) program. If you find an available house that suits your needs, you may put the property on hold at the HSC. This is called a regular hold, and it gives you two working days to exercise your option: you can either set up an appointment to nego - http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 19 The Navy Lodge Naples, located on board Support Site, offers 96 guest rooms and 24 villas. Photo by Gary Nichols tiate a contract hold, or release your hold and let someone else take the property. All regular holds are automatically released after two working days unless you request an extension. During these two days, you may continue to look at other houses. Only one regular hold extension is permitted per property. Once you decide you want a particular rental property, notify the HSC immediately to schedule a pre-contract lease negotiating session with your prospective landlord. Once you contact the HSC, the property will be placed on contract hold. A contract hold differs from a regular hold in that you are no longer permitted to look at other properties. You are making a firm commitment to the landlord for that prop - erty. To break this commitment, you must submit a written statement to the housing office supervisor for review and approval stating why it is necessary for you to cancel the contract hold. Once the landlord has completed the required registra - tion of the property, a pre-contract appointment is sched - uled. At the time of pre-contract signing, you may negotia - te with the landlord a fair price for the house you have cho - sen, as well as any extra amenities you would like to have in the house (air conditioners, screens, ceiling fans, etc.). Please understand that you are not permitted to negotiate new construction to the landlord's house or luxuries (i.e., swimming pools, gazebos, fountains, apartments, kit - chens, maid service, or minor yard maintenance). An HSC referral counselor will assist with translating and preparing the pre-contract. Once a pre-contract is signed, if the property has not been inspected within the last three years, it will be referred to the housing office inspectors for inspection. All houses listed with the Housing Office must be registered and go through a safety and security inspection before an appoint - ment can be scheduled for a contract lease signing. This is for customers' protection to make sure the property they have chosen meets all Italian rental standards, as well as housing department regulations and standards before move-in. Once a house has passed inspection, the counse -lor will contact the custo - mer and make the neces - sary arrangements for the contract lease signing appointment. Lease Negotiations Language barriers can make communication with local landlords a problem. The HSC staff will liaise with the landlord, schedule main tenance services, answer utility billing ques - tions, review discrepancies, and conduct lease amend - ments and termination ser - vices in English and Italian. If applicable, your housing counselor will enter you into the home-fuel rationing system at the Navy Exchange. You may also elect to have your utility ser - vices activated through the Navy Exchange's Residential Services for a small monthly fee. During the lease signing appointment, you are required to have one month's cash Euro which is paid to the Navy's General Services Fund as a deposit against damage. Prior to move in, you must also pay the first month's rent to the landlord. All rental payments must be made electronically. The security deposit money will be returned to you, minus any outstanding utilities owed, at the end of your tenancy. Signing the Lease To remain eligible to receive your housing allowance and housing services, including loaner furniture and loaner appliances, you must negotiate your lease through the housing office. If you do negotiate a lease on your own, you will disqualify yourself from these substantial benefits. This policy applies to both military and civilian personnel. Helpful Housing Tips All of your allowances are paid in dollars. Your rent and other housing expenses will require payment in euro. Fluctuation in the exchange rate is not uncommon. It is important to keep this fluctuation, or the potential for it, in mind when determining which house will be right for you. For further information, please refer to the \"Allowances\" section found in this chapter. A lease is a legal binding agreement. Once you sign a lease, the fact that you did not know about certain discre - pancies within the premises typically is not justification to break the lease. Thoroughly check the property prior to signing the lease. Pets Residents of government housing are allowed two indoor micro-chipped pets (cats or dogs). Note that dog breed restrictions and a weight limit of 70 pounds does apply. There are no quarantine periods for animals brought into Naples. Additionally, there are no kennel options on base. The Navy Lodge has a limited supply of pet friendly rooms, so contact the Navy Lodge for availability or check with your sponsor before bringing pets. Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Getting Settled 20 With its spacious, comfortable rooms, your stay - no matter how long or short - at the Navy Lodge on board Support Site is sure to be an enjoyable experience . Photo by Gary Nichols Electricity All government housing is equipped with both 110V and 220V electricity, therefore your U.S. standard appliances and electronic equipment will be useable. In the local com - munity, you will be provided with two transformers to con - vert the common 220V to 110V. Remember the 220V/50Hz is converted to 110V/50 Hz, so whether you live on the Support Site or the local economy, clocks and timers will not be accurate. Surge protectors are strongly recommen - ded to help protect your electronics. Water All economy leases negotiated through the housing offi - ce have a bottle water clause, which require the landlord to provide up to 4 litres per person/per day of bottled water. Except for those living at the Support Site and Capodichino, bottled water is recommended. Loaner Furniture During the lease contract signing appointment, you will also arrange for the delivery of your Partial Full Tour Furnishings (PFTF) and loaner furniture. Loaner Furniture: To bridge the delay between your move in and the arrival of your furniture, the housing office offers items for your use on a temporary basis. Loaner furni ture includes beds, nightstands, dressers, a loveseat, armchairs, end tables, a coffee table and a dining table with chairs. These are available to both accompanied and unaccompanied personnel. You may keep loaner furniture until your household goods arrive or for 90 days, whichever comes first. Extension requests must be approved through the housing office. Partial Full Tour Furnishings (PFTF): The Navy Housing PFTF program is available to all DoD military and civilian personnel with a transportation agreement. You will be provided with all of the items listed below at no cost during your tour. The following items are provided with govern - ment quarters and are available upon request to economy housing residents: Refrigerator Gas stove Washer/dryer (gas and electric available) Microwave oven Voltage transformers (two - not applicable for government quar - ters) Wardrobes (one per family mem - ber and one extra for military member) Carbon monoxide detectors AFN decoder (not applicable for government quarters) You should not have any of the above items shipped to Italy. American appliances - stoves, refri - gerators and washers - are not com - patible with Italian electricity. You can bring your small appliances, such as coffee pots, blenders and frying pans, which will work with the transformers included in the PFTF. Lamps and telephones will also work with adaptor plugs. All lamps require Italian light bulbs, which are sold at the Navy Exchange and at stores in the local economy. Most Italian lightbulbs use the same size base as American ones; they just configure differently for the 220 volts. Your House and Security Naples is a large city with relatively high unemployment. House break-ins and theft are not uncommon. You can take several steps to protect yourself and your property from this type of loss. Arrange for irreplaceable or sentimental items to be stored in the United States while you are stationed in Italy. If your TV is stolen, you can always get another. If your wedding pictu - res are stolen, you may not be able to replace them. Review your insurance needs and arrange for renter's insurance. This protects you from having to pay large replacement costs for items. Consider shopping for a policy that will pay replacement value for your property. After you've moved in, check to see if your parco has a neighborhood watch program. Join it, or help start one if one is not in place. Get to know your neighbors, whether they are American, Italian or another nationality. House break-ins occur mostly during the day; if your neighbors are home during the day, they can help watch your place. Inspect your windows and door locks periodically. If they seem weak, worn or deficient, contact your land - lord to replace them. Don't hide a key outside the door, under mats, flower pots or over doors. Do not leave spare keys inside your home. If a burglar breaks in through a window, don't make it easy for him to walk out the front door with your TV. Always lock your doors and windows and turn on your home alarm, even if you are just going to the corner store or to work in the backyard or garage. Never leave your key in the lock of a door or shutter. Burglars have the ability to turn the key and unlock the door/shutter from the outside. If you think a burglar is in your home when you arrive, don't go inside. Go to a neighbor's house and call NSA http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 21 Naples Security at Commercial 081-568-4911. They will dispatch the Carabinieri. NSA Naples Security is unable to directly respond to disturbances occurring on the economy due to lack of jurisdiction. However, they can have Italian authorities dispatched to your location and have Italian local nationals on staff who can assist you with filing a report. Do not allow strangers into your home. Ask your land - lord to notify you of any scheduled repairs or mainte - nance. If you're not sure if a repair person is supposed to be there, don't let him or her inside. Close and lock your garage doors. Do not advertise your possessions or allow easy access to your home through a door that cannot be seen from the road. Be alert for unusual activity or unknown people loitering in your neighborhood. Contact NSA Naples Security at Commercial 081-568- 4911 if you see a crime taking place. (For non-emer - gency assistance, call 081-568-5638/5639.) Leave a radio or TV on when you leave home. This gives would-be burglars the illusion that someone is at home. Separate your car and house keys so no one can dupli - cate your house keys if they are in possession of your car keys. If you own expensive jewelry, don't hide it in an obvious place like a clothes drawer or under a bed. Keep the outside of your house well lit at night, espe - cially near windows and doors. If you go out at night, leave some lights on inside. Do not leave ladders unsecured outside your home; this could allow burglars easy access into an upstairs window. Do not trust your driveway gate. Many \"locked\" gates can be popped in seconds by even the most inexperi - enced burglar. Buy a sturdy chain and heavy lock to give better protection. Vacation Security Strategies If possible, arrange for someone to house-sit while you are gone. Invest in clock-timers to turn lights off and on at certain times. Have a friend keep up with your yard work and drop by your house occasionally if you can't get a housesitter. Move your valuable items so they can't be seen from the windows. Do not leave items on your porch, balcony, terrace or lawn. Mold /Mildew Damp weather and local home designs contribute to mold and mildew problems. To help prevent against mold and mildew, you should ventilate your home during nice weather days. You are also encouraged to open your bath - room window during and after all showers or baths. Small amounts of mold caused by excess humidity can be cleaned with a bleach and water solution. Excessive mold, or mold caused by water infiltration, should be report to the HSC immediately. Allowances Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) and Cost Of Living Allowance (COLA) Advance OHA: This entitlement is to pay for your first month's rent and deposit. To apply for this, you will be given the appropriate forms from the housing office during the signing of your pre-contract. These will need to be signed by a housing official and your commanding officer or officer in charge. Overseas Housing Allowance: The Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) is paid to service members who live in privately leased housing at their overseas duty station. Residents of government quarters do not receive OHA. Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Getting Settled 22 Naples celebrates each New Year's Eve with a blanket of thousands of reworks, which collectively are bright enough to light up the Bay of Naples and nearby Mount Vesuvius. Photo by Lt. Ryan Tillman OHA consists of two main components: rent, and utility, along with recurring maintenance allowance. The rent portion of OHA is computed based on your actual rent up to a maximum amount determined by your rank and whether you are accompanied or unaccompa - nied. The rates are based upon actual rents reported by service members and are set to cover the rent paid by 80 percent of service members with command-sponsored dependents within each pay grade. You are not limited by your rental ceilings; however, if your rent is above the ceil - ing, you pay the difference out of your base pay. The Utility and Recurring Maintenance (URM) allowance is provided to help defray expenses paid to utility compa - nies and for maintenance. The URM is based upon the 80th percentile of all data supplied in the annual OHA Utility Survey. The allowance for rent and URM are added together and appear as one allowance on your leave and earnings statement. Moving in Housing Allowance (MIHA) is a one-time pay - ment to help you pay for items such as light fixtures, toilet seats, extra cabinets, wardrobes, electrical transformers and adapters, screens security systems, and so on. It is designed to cover the cost of items you must purchase to make your privately leased housing safe and comfortable. It is not paid to members who occupy government-leased quarters or move into furnished properties. You must apply for MIHA after you have signed your lease. The rates for the individual components of OHA for Naples, Italy are determined by data supplied by service members living on the economy; therefore, it is important to maintain complete records of rent and utility payments. Keep a file with all of your receipts and a notebook to record all your expenses for rent, utilities, repairs and maintainance, as well as what you spend to make your house ready to live in. If you do, you will have accurate figures to report when it is time for the annual OHA survey. For the latest rates for OHA and MIHA, visit http://www.defensetravel. dod.mil/site/ohaCalc.cfm. Cost of Living Allowance: Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) is paid when the cost of living is higher at an over - seas duty station than in the United States. COLA helps to pay for things you buy on the economy that are more expensive than comparable items back home. The COLA index is a percentage that represents the difference between the cost of a \"market basket\" of goods and ser - vices in Naples and the United States. A COLA index of 110, for example, means that prices in Naples are 10 per - cent higher than in CONUS. This does not translate into a 10 percent increase in your paycheck however, because COLA is calculated based on your average spendable inco - me - total income minus housing expenses, taxes, savings, life insurance, gifts and contributions, and whether you are accompanied or unaccompanied. The amount of COLA that you receive depends on your rank, length of service and number of family members. IMPORTANT NOTE: Because OHA, COLA and MIHA rates are set in euro currency and service members are paid in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the exchange rate will cause your paycheck to vary. When planning your budget, you cannot count on a particular dollar figure each pay - check. It is more prudent to focus on the amount of euro you will need each month for rent, utilities and other expen - ses. The Defense Travel Management Office closely moni -tors changes in the exchange rate and resets the rate so that under- and over-payments are zeroed out over time. Overseas Housing Allowances and Overseas Cost of Living Allowances are available at http://www.defensetra - vel.dod.mil/site/allowances.cfm. Rates are usually updated every two weeks. Naples Community Health Awareness In response to concerns from U.S. personnel regarding potential health impacts of waste management practices in Italy's Campania Region, U.S. Navy Region Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia requested in late 2007 that the Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center conduct the Naples Public Health Evaluation (NPHE). The purpose of the study was to determine if there were any potential public health hazards to U.S. personnel from exposure to air, tap water, soil and soil gas while residing in the Campania region of Italy. The Navy established health protective policies based on the study's findings to protect the health of U.S. per - sonnel and their families, which includes bottled water advisories and health protective lease clauses. The NPHE found the potential health risks for living off- base can be mitigated by following established risk-man - agement actions. The enduring health protection policies are as follows: Maintain tthe July 2008 bottled water advisory for U.S. personnel living off base. Maintain the New Lease Suspension Zone (NLSZ) areas, http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 23 based on U.S. Navy and Italian environmental sampling data. In these zones, U.S. Navy personnel are not per - mitted to sign new rental home leases. Maintain the NPHE website and the U.S. Navy Regional Water Quality Board. Maintain the health-protective U.S. Navy lease clauses for private off-base rental homes: - Landlords provide up to four litres per person/per day of bottled water. - Landlords are to clean and disinfect domestic water hold ing tanks every six months. The U.S. Navy will continue to share data with desig - nated Italian public health officials. Throughout the Naples Public Health Evaluation, the U.S. Navy established health protective policies and took immediate action, when necessary, to protect the health of U.S. personnel and their families. The risk management analysis determined that many of the health protective policies established during Phase I and Phase II will continue, as well as new policies implemented to ensure continued health protection. The Phase I and II reports, along with fact sheets addressing commonly asked questions are available through a link on the Naval Support Activity Naples website at www.cnic.navy.mil/ Naples. If you have a concern about your specific health risk and how the study relates to you, please contact the U.S. Naval Hospital Naples at DSN 629-6299 or Commercial 081-811-6299. Living in Italy Living in Italy can be a unique and rewarding experien - ce, but you'll find that many things in Italy are different from what you've become accustomed to in the United States. The following information points out some of these aspects that relate to running a household in Italy. Electricity in Italy is 220 volt, 50 cycle. This is different from the U.S. standard of 110 volt, 60 cycle. This means that you will need a transformer or converter to use your U.S. appliances. Additionally, a surge protector is strongly recommended for all applian - ces. For those living in government quarters, the units are provided with American 110-volt,50-cycle electricity. Your lamps will work if you use Italian light bulbs. Your clocks that plug in will not keep accurate time due to the difference in cycle. You may want to use battery- operated or wind-up clocks. Heating your house safely during winter in Naples is a must. The climate in winter is like the Northwest coast of the United States - wet, rainy and sometimes cold. Although it very rarely snows in Naples, the surrounding mountains do get snowfalls. When searching for a home during the summer, keep the eventual cost of heating in mind. Bombolas are gas tanks used to power many Italian homes. They are efficient, convenient and relatively inex - pensive, but if you don't use them properly they can be deadly. Improperly ventilated bombolas can produce car - bon monoxide. Please ask for proper safety and installa - tion instructions before using a bombola for the first time. Italy, like the United States., puts a chemical into the otherwise odorless natural gas to give it a noxious smell and alert you to leaks, but you must take care to install the bombola correctly. The bottles come with a valve on top for opening and closing, and a nozzle that comes out of the side of the top. This is connected to a regulator valve, which is connected to a special rubber hose, which leads to your heater, dryer, etc. The safest arrangement is where your bombola is out - side, connected to a hose that leads into the house. Check the hoses and clamps periodically; replace anything worn. Hoses, clamps and regulators are sold at the Navy Exchange and at Italian hardware stores. Check the regulators for any signs of wear, especially for nicks or deformities around the fitting that goes on the bombola nozzle; get a new one if you have any doubt. When you connect the regulator to the bombola, always use a cork washer (these are provided with the bombola; if you don't get one, ask for one). Use a new cork washer each time. DO NOT re-use these washers, as gas could leak out around an old one. Tighten the regulator with a wrench (the threads are counter-clockwise). Hand tightening is not enough to prevent a gas leak. Check all the connections with a mixture of dish liquid and water - bubbles indicate a leak. NEVER use a match to check for gas leaks. Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Getting Settled 24 Arches are an integral part of architecture in Italy, both historical and present day. Throughout the country you can nd elements of this design whether in famous Pompeii, bustling Rome or in ruins underground. Photo by MC1 Daniel Barker If you get your bombola from a gas station or delivery service, it will have been inspected for safety. But it is still prudent to check it out, particularly the nozzle leading to the regulator. If the threads are damaged or the bombola looks unsafe in any other way, don't accept it - demand another one. Most bombolas should be \"bled\" before you hook them up. This is because even with the most careful filling method, a little air may still enter the bottle. Take it outside, point the nozzle away from you, and open the top valve for a few seconds. Obviously, don't smoke while you do this, and don't do it near the barbecue or anything else that can cause a spark. Both kerosene and bombola hea - ters heat with an open flame. Consequences of this include, of course, the fire hazard, but also that the flame burns the oxygen in the air and creates carbon dioxide and car - bon monoxide as well as water vapor. Therefore, never use such a heater in an unventilated space. Cracking open a window in the room seems to defeat the purpose of running the heater, but losing a little heating efficiency is better than losing your life to asphyxiation. If you or a family member starts to exhibit symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning (dizziness, headaches, dis - orientation, etc.), get out of that room and into fresh air, and call the hospital or have a neighbor do so immediately. Also - and this cannot be emphasized enough - never, never go to bed and leave a space heater on. Even an electric heater has a potential to be a fire hazard. Also, as an added precaution, you should turn off the top valves on your indoor bombola overnight. The NSA Fire Department gives bombola safety training, and the department should be consulted if you have any questions. Some of the clothes dryers given out under the Partial Full Tour Furnishings program are electric-gas ones. The timer, controls and the tumbler motor are electric and the heat is provided by gas. If you don't have a connection to a bulk source - not unusual in Italy, as most Italians don't have dryers - you will have to connect it to a bombola, a metal tank similar to those used for gas grill units. Utilities When you live on the local economy, Italian companies will provide all of your utilities, including telephone service. The utilities vary according to the unit you choose. Information about the utility requirements and payments will be given to you during the house hunting process. Your utilities and telephone will be set up when you sign your lease. The housing office will assist you through the installation process, but the housing office does not have control over the local utility or telephone companies. Appointments for installation will be arranged according to the utility company's requirements. The service may not meet your expectations, and most newcomers obtain a mobile phone. If at any time during your stay in Italy you have problems with your utilities or telephone, the Navy Exchange Residential Services Office can help you communicate with the company to resolve them. http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 25 Residential Services Office at the Navy Exchange The Naples Navy Exchange (NEX) Residential Services Office offers quality of life services for residents living in Naples. Residential Services offers customers living on the econ - omy tax-free electricity, phone and Internet contracts, plus home heating gas delivery and Culligan water home delivery. Customers using the NEX Residential Services Office do not pay Italian taxes, resulting in up to 22 percent savings on utilities. On-base residents are offered Internet service, Culligan water home delivery, and expanded TV service, which includes 30 Sky channels, plus pay-per-view and AFN. Everyone can apply for a \"Telepass\" at the NEX Residential Services Office. This service, similiar to Easy Pay or Easy Pass in the U.S., allows you to pay highway tolls electronically without stopping at a toll booth. This is a quick and time- saving way to travel on toll roads all over Italy. You pay later with your cre - dit card or bank card. Residential Services associates speak both English and Italian. Bills are in English and paid in U.S. dollars at the NEX. You may also request automatic billing. Water, Sewage and Garbage Service Most landlords keep these ser - vices in their names and figure them into your rent or parco fees. If you find a place where these are to be in your name, ask housing office personnel for assistance in billing procedures. Be aware when looking for a house that a bottled water advisory is in effect for all U.S. personnel residing in the Campania region. Bottled water is provided by your landlord via a clause in your lease. Bottled water should be used for drinking, cooking, oraly hygiene, pets, etc. Also, check to see if the house you are interested in has a water reservoir and make sure the pump works. In the suburbs especially, the water pressure can get very low during summer days. A water reservoir will fill at night when there is pressure, and the pump will pump water from the reservoir when the pressure drops. If your house doesn't have this arrangement, you could face long spells without water during the summer. Your lease agreement will state that your landlord is responsible for cleaning the reservoir every six months; it is incumbent upon the resi - dent to hold the landlord to this requirement. If your land - lord fails to comply with this clause, you can contact the Housing Office for assistance. As many of the houses rented by Americans are in the suburbs, many have septic tanks instead of being con - nected to city sewers. Emptying the septic tank can be either the responsibility of the tenant or the landlord. This can be brought up at the housing office at your negotiation session. Make sure you know how to check the tank and who to call to have it emptied (usually the landlord will call the company he or she uses). You may want to have the landlord empty the tank before you sign your lease; this can be brought up at your lease pre-negotiation session. Check to see where you should put your garbage and when the collection days are, as well as any limits on what can be collected. In single-family dwellings, you usually put the garbage just outside your gate. In apartment complexes, there is usually a dumpster or two nearby for you to use. Many towns have mandatory recycling and may require the use of specific bags. You may be subject to a fine if you do not comply with the towns trash/recycling requirements. If you leave the garbage outside your gate, you should invest in a dog-proof container of some sort; otherwise, local dogs and cats can spread your garbage around. Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Getting Settled 26 During a tour of Italy one will come across many vineyards and wineries. Almost every region of Italy produces its own varieties of wine, with 20 major growing areas. Tours of local wineries are offered often through USO, MWR and other agencies. Photo by MC1 Daniel Barker The military community in the Naples area is spread out, so a car may be a necessity. Transit time for pri - vately owned vehicles (POVs) to be shipped from the United States to Naples can be up to three months. Rentals are expensive, but there is a substantial used-car market here . The used-car market, however, tends to be above the price of what you would expect to find in the United States. This is particulary true for automat ic trans mission cars, since most locals tend to drive cars with manual transmission. Italian public transportation, bus, train, taxis and Navy-sponsored shuttles are also available. Shipping Your POV The Personal Property Shipping Office provides infor - mation on how to arrange for shipment of your POV. Military and DoD civilians are allowed to ship one POV overseas from the United States at government expense. The shipped vehicle enters Italy free of import duty (tax). The Italian Ministry of Finance (Customs) authorizes DoD and NATO personnel to register up to three POVs for each sponsor during a tour. Second and third vehicles (including motorcycles) may also be shipped to Italy free of import duty (tax), at the owners expense, and are subject to annual Italian road taxes. When turning in your POV for shipment, you must ensure that the vehicle identification number (VIN) shown on ship - ping documents matches the physical description of the POV. An error may cause a delay in receiving the vehicle and prevent Allied Forces Italy (AFI) registration of the vehicle. There are no restrictions for imported POVs, however. they must be sound mechanically and undergo a safety inspection when they arrive before they can be registered. Estimated transit times are 45 to 60 days from East Coast ports and 55 to 90 days from Gulf and West Coast ports. The purchase of a large new car just before leaving the United States is not recommended, but if you have a newer automobile and would incur costs by disposing of it, by all means bring it. Driving conditions in Naples are not what they are in the United States, so a big car will be more difficult to negotiate through narrow Italian streets and under congested, erratic driving conditions. Only two U.S. insurance companies are authorized to insure U.S. vehicles shipped to Italy: USAA and GEICO. Both companies have offices in the United States, and it is recommend that you coordinate an insurance policy prior to your arrival if you plan to ship your vehicle. Importation of Motorcycles The Italian Department of Motor Vehicle defines a motor vehicle as either an automobile or a motorcycle with engine power exceeding 1.5 HP and engine size exceeding 50 cc. Therefore, in accordance with DoD rules, you can ship one motorcycle or moped with your household goods, but you must pay Italian road tax when it arrives and is registered. AFI plates will be not issued for those less than 50 cc.; however, Italian Moped Plates will be issued in such cases. All mopeds, motorbikes and motor scooters shipped with household goods are entered tax free, but must be licen - sed and registered with the base Motor Vehicle Registration Office (MVRO) prior to use on the road. To effectively clear customs by local port officials, all mopeds or motorcycles shipped with household goods must be packed in a separate container (Container #1). The crate must be properly marked on the outside of the crate that this shipment contains a motorcycle or moped. A copy of the title and registration, the member's orders, GBL and inventory regardless of destination must be sent to Personal Property Shipping Office, Attn: Motorcycle Clearance, PSC 808 Box 42, FPO, AE 09618-0042. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the return of the motorcycle or moped, confiscation by Italian Customs authority, fine or penalty and payment of importation fees. Note: Imporation of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), three- wheelers and off-road motorcycles is highly discouraged. Automobiles & Motorcycles http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 27 Driving in Italy is more challenging than in the United States because trafc here is less regulated and road conditions are more hazar - dous. Photo by MC1 Daniel Barker AFI Vehicle Registration Each service member, DoD civilian or contractor is authorized a maximum of three vehicles per tour in the local Motor Vehicle Registration Office (MVRO). When you register your vehicle with MVRO, the vehicle will be entered into the AFI Vehicle Registration System, and you will be issued Italian cover plates free of charge. You will be requi - red to pay a one-time fee of 20 euro per vehicle. If you register more than one vehicle, the second and third vehi - cles are subject to Italian road taxes, which are. based upon the size of the engine and age of the vehicle (Euro Classification) ranging from five to 100 euro per month. Each year, one month prior to your registration anniversary month you will be required to revalidate your registration before you can receive your tax-free petroleum products. Upon receipt of any re quired fees, MVRO will update your vehicle registration and renew your tax-free petroleum ration. All vehicles must meet the criteria set forth in the NSA Naples Instruction 11240.19G (privately owned vehicle registration) and the NSA Naples Instruction 11240.26D (privately owned vehicle inspection). Vehicles failing to meet inspection criteria will have gas rations suspended until appropriate repairs have been made. To comply with the Status of Forces Agreement, all regis tration services must be done in the name of the sponsor. Local hires and dependents are not granted Allied Forces Italy (AFI) vehicle registration privileges. If the pre - vious title or registration is in the name of the dependent, you will be required to transfer ownership into the name of the sponsor. This will not affect ownership of the vehicle when you return to the United States. Documents required for registration: Valid original vehicle title, previous registration or certifi - cate of origin (with no liens or with written authorization from the lien holder acknowledging vehicle description, location and amount and term of lien); Proof of insurance (originals only); AFI driver's license; Proof eligibility: docu - ments/safety inspection; Applicable registration fees (\u20ac20 and road taxes, if applicable); DoD civilians are required to furnish a stamped copy of their orders from HRO, DoDEA Employees are required to provide DD FORM 1614, and Contractors required to provide a valid DOCPER letter Documents the sponsor will receive after registration: Original Military Registration and Certificate of Title of Motor Vehicle; Italian (cover) license plates; Petroleum products authorization. Motorcycles/Mopeds To operate any motorcycle or other two-wheeled vehi - cle, the registered owner/operator must be 18 years of age and have a motorcycle endorsement on his or her U.S. license. Before registration and licensing, all individuals must show evidence of successfully completing an appro - ved motorcycle safety course here in Naples, if they do not have a previous stateside endorsement. Driver's License Any person desiring to drive in Naples must have a cur - rent U.S. driver's license or a valid license from another country. As stipulated in the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), eligible drivers must obtain an AFI driver's license by attending a local traffic safety driving course and passing a 48-question road sign test. The exam, along with the Alcohol and You test, is given during Area Orientation immediately following the mandatory Local Driver Safety Orientation Briefing. Your AFI driver's license will be valid for five years as long as you maintain a valid ID card. AFI driver license pri - vileges are not authorized for members separating or reti - ring overseas, so please plan according ly. We highly recommend you renew your U.S. license before coming to Italy. (Do not assume your state has a military exemption or extension clause ; check with your local Department of Motor Vehicles or Department of Licensing to be sure.) If you plan trips to other European countries, an interna - tional license, available through AAA offices, is required. Note: Regardless of U.S. licensing, individuals under 18 are not allowed to drive in Italy. For more specifics, see NAVSUPPACT INST. 11240.29D. Gasoline and Oil Gasoline and oil are made available to DoD personnel in Italy on a tax-free basis at a substantial discount over the local market prices. Rationed coupons are sold through various Navy Exchange outlets in the Naples and Gaeta areas. These tax-free gasoline coupons help make fuel pri - ces here comparable to those in the United States. The basis for tax-free gasoline is the sponsor's need to commute from home to work as an official duty. The ration amount and fuel type depend on the primary registered vehicle's engine size, engine base horsepower and fuel requirement. Your monthly tax-free fuel authorization is either 100 liters, 200 liters (for an engine above 660 cc), 300 liters (for an engine above 1200 cc) or 400 liters (for a 6- cylinder engine above 2465 cc). Rations for motorcycles may not exceed 200 liters per month. The intent of this tax-free fuel ration is designed to allow no less than 1,000 kilometers of tax-free travel each month. For most registrants, your tax-free fuel ration will accommodate your transportation needs. Purchasing Gas The use of gas coupons is only authorized at AGIP and ENI stations. When purchasing gas, be aware of the per - son filling up your vehicle. Most gas stations are full-servi - ce. After you pull up, the attendent will often direct you forward using the word, \"Avanti.\" Once you have stopped, tell the attendant how many \"litri\" you want, then sign your coupons after the attendant fills up the vehicle. Coupons must in clude signature, plate number and date. Selling, bartering, lending or giving coupons or the product itself to any person, or buying or borrowing from any person is prohibited. Illegal use of coupons is a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and Italian fiscal law. Registration of vehicles propelled by propane or meth - ane gas is not allowed at the moment. Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Automobiles & Motorcycles 28 Spare Parts Supply of parts and maintenance for American cars is often inadequate. It is a good idea to include spare parts for your vehicles in your household goods shipment, as many items are not readily available through the Navy Exchange and auto parts are expensive on the Italian market. Basic items and information to ship: Detailed maintenance manual; Two sets of spark plugs; Four oil filters and four air filters; Two sets of belts; Name and address of mail source for parts; One complete set of brakes. DO NOT ship extra parts - or anything of value - in the car itself, as items may be missing by the time the vehicle arrives. MVRO issues IVA exemption forms for vehicle repairs. Not all firms accept them, so ask before the repairs take place. Auto Insurance Vehicle insurance for the Naples area is expensive; the cost depends on the vehicle's make, model and year, and age of the driver. Vehicles shipped at government expense cannot be released for registration and use without proof of valid insurance. Third-party liability insurance is manda - tory in Italy for all automobiles, trucks and two-wheeled vehicles, including mopeds. Policy conditions and premiums are established by law and are standardized throughout the country. Premiums vary according to the horsepower of the vehicle and the location of registration. If a vehicle has been insured with only minimum coverage, liability for death or injuries to passengers in that automobile is not covered. To provide this insurance, the owner must specifically ask the insurance agent for coverage. Comprehensive and collision coverage are not included in the compulsory insurance; they are optional and must be requested. In addition, comprehensive and collision cove - rage is not always available through Italian insurance com - panies. Check with your insurance company and the neare - st government transportation office concerning insurance coverage during shipment overseas. It is a good idea to have new policies become effective upon arrival of the vehi - cle in Italy. GEICO and USAA are available on Support Site. Purchasing, Selling and Scrapping You can purchase new American cars, as well as foreign models, from various sources on and off base. Make sure that any car you buy has all the equipment required for registration and for driving on base, including seat belts and child protective restraints. Automobiles other than Italian made, when bought in Italy, are imported duty free and deliveries can be made to Naples. In addition, when buying Italian cars you are exempt from paying the Italian government excise tax. Please keep in mind, that your automobile must meet U.S. specifications in order for you to ship it back to the U.S. The sale of AFI-registered vehi - cles, purchased locally or shipped to Italy at government expense, are subject to the following restrictions: You are prohibited from selling your vehicle to Italian or other European nationals on the local economy. http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 29 You can sell your POV to assigned NATO personnel who are eligible for AFI vehicle registration privileges (except Italian military); You can sell your vehicle to eligible U.S. personnel who have AFI vehicle registration privileges. The vehicle you import, if you are not shipping it back to the United States, must be properly disposed of prior to your departure from Italy via one of the following methods; Sale to another AFI-eligible registrant; Driving to your new European duty location (restrictions apply); Shipping your vehicle to your new duty loca - tion via government contract or commercial shipping company; Scrapping the vehicle with the MVRO under Italian customs supervision; Nationalization and payment of value added taxes (VAT) and importation fees (30 percent or market value) for member sepa - rating or retiring in Italy. Note: If you're on vacation or out of the local area and your vehicle becomes inoperable due to acci - dent or mechanical failure, contact MVRO immediately. Your vehicle cannot be salvaged locally without the payment of customs taxes (VAT and importation) and customs brokers fees which are cost prohibitive. Call MVRO for details and assistance with Italian customs laws if you must scrap your vehicle - MVRO will save you thousands of dollars! Vehicle Rental Vehicle rental is available on base through EuropCar. If you plan to rent a car (after you obtain your AFI driver's license) while you are waiting for your vehicle to arrive from the United States, MVRO can issue a temporary tax-free fuel ration. This temporary ration can be used to purchase tax-free gasoline and oil coupons at Navy Exchange outlets. Restrictions apply. Contact MVRO for specifics. Once you register your primary vehicle, you can only purchase fuel coupons based on the primary vehicle's required type of fuel. For example, you cannot purchase diesel fuel coupons for a rented vehicle if your primary vehicle runs on unleaded. Motorcycles: Additional Information Riding motorcycles on Italian streets can be more dan - gerous than in the United States because traffic here is less regulated and road conditions are more hazardous. However, Italian drivers are generally more aware of motorcycles, as the motorcycle is a major means of tran - sportation here. A motorcycle may be shipped at govern - ment expense as part of your household goods shipment. However, it must be in a separate crate, as motorcycles often take long er to clear customs. Ensure that the make, model and chassis numbers are clearly marked on the inventory of your household goods. There are no provisions for storage of a motorcycle should you decide after arrival that you do not wish to drive your motorcycle. All motorcycles shipped in household goods must be registered, to include insurance and road tax for second or third vehicle, with MVRO as soon as they clear customs to avoid penalty fees after 90 days. You are required to have a motorcycle endorsement from your state on your license before you register any motorcy - cle. You must also complete a Motorcycle Safety Course administered by the NSA Naples Safety Office. The two- wheeled vehicle must be regis tered in the name of the spon - sor listed on the PCS orders. If the sponsor has no endorsement, and the spouse will be the operator, the authorization letter will state such, and the spouse will be required to maintain the required training certifications. Upon arrival it is important that you take your shipping documents for your vehicle to the Personal Property Office so that you can begin the proper custom clearance procedures. Once the vehicle has cleared customs, the member on orders must receive a Letter of Authorization from the NSA Naples Safety Office to have it registered and delivered. This letter must be obtained prior to registration of the two-wheeled vehicle. To obtain this letter, you must have an ESAMS account, show proof of a motorcy - cle en dorse ment on your license, provide a copy of any motorcycle safety course you have completed, and provide the year, make, model, engine sized in cubic centimeters and VIN number of the motorcy - cle. Per NAVSUPPACT Naples Instruction 5100.11, all new arrivals in Italy must complete the Basic Riders Course 2 or the the Advanced Riders Course within 60 days of registra - tion depending on the type of vehicle being registered. NSA Naples Safety Office has trainer bikes, scooters, helmets and gloves available and offers a free Basic Riders Course about once a month. The Advanced Riders Course is usually offered twice a month and the Basic Riders Course 2 is offered once a month. The Basic Riders Course is accepted by most states for the purpose of obtaining a motorcycle endorsement. To enroll in a motorcycle safety course, call Commercial 081-568-3147 or 081-568-5594. There are some popular locations where scooter or moped rentals are available. It is obligatory per OPNAVIN - ST 5100.12 series that active-duty military who ride a motorcycle, scooter or moped on or off base must have completed a motorcycle safety course and are licensed by MVRO Naples. NSA Naples Instruction 5100.11B allows active duty, DOD/DON civilians, spouses and dependents to obtain a motorcycle endorsement from MVRO Naples by attending the Basic Riders Course and the Advanced Riders Course. An authorization letter from the NSA Safety Office will be issued after scompletion of both courses authorizing MVRO to issue the properly endorsed license. Helmets must meet Department of Transportation (DOT) or Economic Commission of Europe (ECE 2205) specifica - tions. Motorcycle helmets must be 5/8ths: which means the hard shell must cover the bottom of the ear. Half helmets, are not legal to wear in Italy on motorcycles 125 cc and above. In addition a reflective vest or belt is required on or off base while riding for all active duty riders and passen - gers. It is also required for all U.S. personnel riding a motorcycle or scooter to have the reflective vest or belt on while onboard the installation. Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Automobiles & Motorcycles 30 Cancellation of insurance or any other failure to maintain required coverage may be sufficient grounds for immediate termination of all registration and driving privileges. WWARNING ARNING !!Rules of the Road The following are some basic rules that govern driving in Italy. While driving you are required to have a valid AFI driv er's license, a military registration and certificate of title of motor vehicle, and proof of insurance. If any of these are lost or stolen, report it immediately. Drunken driving is an extremely serious offense in Italy. A blood alcohol level of 0.05 is positive proof of drunk driv - ing. Refusal to submit to a breathalyzer or blood alcohol content (BAC) test results in immediate loss of the license for six months, a possible fine from Italian authorities and loss of base driving privileges for one year. If you have had too much to drink, leave your vehicle and take a taxi. The Naples Area Chief Petty Officers have established a year-round service called Tipsy Taxi as a free, no-questions-asked service for those who may have had too much to drink or feel incapable of driving. Upon arrival in Naples, you will notice driving habits are considerably different from those in the United States. While at first there may seem to be no logic to the traffic patterns, a closer look will show that there are distinct rules of the road. Learning these rules and some local dri - ving customs will help you adjust quickly to driving in Naples. Because of the often congested roads and the hurried pace of the traffic, absolute alertness while driving is of the utmost importance. Due to the seemingly wild driv ing nature of Neapolitan traffic, it is not enough to only exercise the same caution in driving that you would at home. You must be more aware of the other drivers around you and what they are doing. Never believe that the other driver sees you. Search 12 seconds ahead at all times, evaluate the actions of other drivers and be prepared to execute a response to their actions in advance, rather than trying to react and finding yourself out of time and space. This will help you to avoid a traffic incident. Many intersections have no stop lights or traffic control. The vehicle on the right has the right-of-way, unless there is a stop sign. Low beams are now required by law on main highways or darker roads. Head lights should always be turned on in tunnels. Flashing headlights are also used to signal the approach to stopped traffic at crossroads or to signal slower vehicles to move right and permit a faster vehicle to pass. When a car behind you flashes its lights, move to the right lane as soon as it is safe to do so. Although some drivers may take what seem like unnec - essary and dangerous chances to gain only a few feet of road space, Italian law requires you to allow overtaking traffic to pass you. While horn blowing is technically illegal in many Italian cities, it is loosely enforced. Many people blow their horn to signal they are approaching an intersection or intend to pass. Drivers also commonly use their hazard lights to signal danger, especially in slow or stopped traffic. Do not pick up hitchhikers. Stricter DUI/DWI Laws A 2010 Italian traffic law (Legge 29.07.2010 n\u00b0 120) prohibits drivers 21 and under from having any alcohol whatsoever in their systems, meaning a blood alcohol con - tent (BAC) reading greater than .00 is a violation of the law. This also applies to drivers with less than three years of driving experience and commercial drivers who could be terminated from their jobs for driving under the influence. If a driver has a BAC reading of .05 to .08 grams per liter, fines will be levied from 500 to 2,000 euro, along with the suspension of a person's driver's license for a period of 90 to 180 days. Penalties may include detention of up to one month, or social services as deemed fit by the judge. For a BAC reading of .08 to .15 grams per liter, fines will be levied from 800 to 3,200 euro, along with suspension of a person's driver's license for a period of 180 to 365 days. Violators may be sentenced to detention of up to three months, or social services as deemed fit by the judge. For a BAC reading above .15 grams per liter, fines will be levied up to 6,000 euro, along with the suspension of a person's driver's license for a period of one to two years. Violators could face detention of up to six months, or social services as deemed fit by the judge. If in any instance a blood alcohol content test is denied, the suspect can be fined from 2,500 to 10,000 euro. Should the suspect be involved in a traffic accident, the amount levied will increase from 3,000 to 12,000 euro. For drivers under the influence of drugs, fines levied are from 1,000 to 4,000 euro, along with detention of up to three months or social services as deemed fit by the judge. Driver's license privileges will be suspended from six months to one year. Driving Without a Valid or With a Revoked License Fines range from 2,257 to 9,032 euro. Should the per - son be convicted of the same crime within a period of two years, the subject can be detained for a period of one year. Use of Cell Phones Use of cell phones while driving is not permitted unless the driver is using a speaker phone or an earpiece. Hands should not be used to operate any mobile device while dri - ving. Fines range from 148 to 594 euro. Should the person be convicted of the same crime within a period of two years, the driver's license can be revoked for a period of one to three months. http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 31 Tangenziale If you have to travel to and from work via the Tangenziale, Naples' major tollway, you will have to decide how to pay for the toll at each exit. One way through the toll currently costs .95 euro and can be paid at one of several manned booths. An alternative to physically handing over money each time is to use a \"Telepass.\" The Telepass works at all toll - booths in Italy. You can apply for a Telepass at the Navy Exchange Residential Services Office at the Support Site. You are required to have a major credit card. A monthly ser - vice fee of 5 euro is charged to your charge card account. Monthly usage charges are then deducted from your charge card account. If you're interested in obtaining a Telepass, call the Navy Exchange Residential Services Office at 081-813-5321. It takes approx - imately five to seven working days to process the request for a Telepass. Traffic Tickets During your tour, you may receive a traffic ticket. The Italian police usually issues them on the spot, but your plate number could be taken down and a ticket mailed to you at a later date. If you receive one in the mail, do not ignore it. The fine you will have to pay triples 15 days after the day it was mailed. If a uniformed Italian police officer along the side of the road is waving at you using what appears to be a lollipop stick (a red circle on a white disc), the officer is saying, \"Pull over,\" and you must do so. If you are stopped, do not be disrespectful. If a commu - nication gap exists and the officer writes you a ticket for a violation you cannot understand, accept it and bring it to the NSA Naples Security Department for clarification. Most tickets can be paid on the spot. This is legal in Italy (and in many other European countries) and not a bribe. If you elect to pay, the police officer will give you a receipt. And that is that. You'll hear nothing more about it. Keep the receipt. For the more serious traffic violations, however, the fine cannot be paid on the spot. These violations may result in a criminal charge. If you receive a notice of this nature, bring it to the Region Legal Services Office (RLSO) for advice and appropriate action or call DSN 314-626-4576. Italy has implemented the \"Tutor\" system on its highway systems. Tutor is an electronic speed control system that records the time spent to cover a given distance and cal - culates the average speed of a vehicle. A person exceeding the speed limit by 40 kilometers per hour to 60 kilometers per hour will be fined from 370 to 1,458 euro, and driver's license privileges will be suspended from three to six months. Should the person be convicted of the same crime within a period of two years, the driver's license can be revoked for a period of eight to 18 months. For a person who exceeds a speed limit by more than 60 kilometers per hour, fines will be levied from 500 to 2,000 euro and driver's license privileges will be suspen - ded from six months to one year. If a person is convicted of the same crime within a two-year period, the driver's license will be revoked indefinitely. Vehicle Accidents In both major and minor accidents, obey the Italian author ities. They have jurisdiction and can arrest you if you do not cooperate fully. Also, red plastic triangles are requi - red by Italian law and should be put on the road to caution other drivers of an accident. In addition, orange traffic safety vests must be worn by anyone who who must exit a vehicle that is stopped on the side of the road or in traffic. These are available at the Navy Exchange Autoport and on the local economy. They should be carried in your vehicle at all times. Under no circumstances should you argue with Italian law enforcement personnel. If you are involved in an accident, certain procedures must be followed. The procedures will depend upon whether the accident is classified as minor (no injuries or deaths in either vehicle) or major (injury or death of a passenger in either vehicle). Minor accidents: Exchange license and insurance informa - tion, and vehicle tag numbers. Don't leave the scene until information is exchanged, and obtain names and address of witnesses. Report the incident to your insurance com - pany within 48 hours. It is necessary that all accidents be reported to the NSA Naples Security Department via the Emergency Dispatch Center. If there are no inju - ries and no medical response is required, report the acci - dent by calling the non-emergency line at 081-568-5638. Note: Generally, minor accidents are a matter between individuals and their insurance companies. Major accidents: Assist the injured, if possible. Italian law requires that you render assistance to anyone injured in a traffic acci - dent, whether you also were involved in the accident or were just a passerby. Under Italian law, you may be required, when possible, to transport the injured. This should be done as rapidly and safely as possible. Your vehicle will be regarded as an emergency vehicle when you turn on your headlights, honk your horn and display a white cloth or handker - chief from the window. Call the Emergency Dispatch Center's emergency line im - mediately at Commercial 081-568-4911 and ask for help. Try to obtain names and addresses of witnesses. Remain on the scene, if able, until the accident has been investigated by NSA Naples Security personnel or the Italian police. If an accident occurs onboard NSA Naples, NSA Security police will investigate. If you are the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident that injures or kills another person, criminal charges may be initiated automatically by the investigating police, regardless of the ultimate determination of fault. Prompt notification of your Commanding Officer and the Naval Legal Service Office is important to protect your rights, and to obtain the services of an Italian attorney under contract with the U.S. government to represent you. In case of an accident, personnel having automobile lia - bility insurance with an Italian firm are required to notify that company within 48 hours of the accident. Failure to notify the company within the time period can be justifi - cation for the company's refusal to accept liability. Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Automobiles & Motorcycles 32 Law Under the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the United States and the Republic of Italy, all U.S. military personnel, members of the civilian component and their family members are subject to Italian law and come under Italian jurisdiction for most criminal offenses. As guests, we are obliged to comply with and refrain from activities inconsistent with Italian law. Specifically, we must refrain from any involve - ment in Italian politics. If you are called or summoned to appear before an Italian court in connection with any offense under Italian law, you must report the contact or summons as soon as possible to your commanding offi - cer and the Region Legal Service Office Europe, Africa Southwest Asia (RLSO EURAFSWA) and ask for assistance. There is no immunity from prosecution granted under the SOFA. The government of Italy has jurisdiction over military members, members of the civilian component and their family members in both civil and criminal actions. This may include incidents occurring on mili - tary installations in Italy. Officials from both governments cooperate in investigating and prosecuting crim inal offenses. Italian authorities have the power to arrest you. If local law enforcement officials apprehend you, the following rules should guide you: Do NOT resist arrest. Go with the Italian authorities will ingly. Promptly provide Italian police officials your name, rate/rank, organization, Armed Forces ID card (military, civilian or family member) and/or passport, com - mand point of contact and phone number. Politely request the presence of Naval Support Activity Naples security personnel, a command representative or a U.S. government-provided attorney prior to making any sta - tement. Decline to make any statement unless U.S. representatives are present. Different officials are tasked with law enforcement in Italy. The ones you will see most commonly are: Polizia (Police) - There are different branches, such as \"stradale\" (road police) and \"ferroviaria\" (railway police). Polizia perform all the usual duties as the U.S. police and usually wear green-gray or blue uniforms. Carabinieri (Gendarmerie) - This is a special corps of the Italian military which acts both as military and civilian police. They usually wear blue or black uniforms and are recognizable by the white shoulderbelt across their chest. Law and Education http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 33 Polizia perform all the usual duties as the U.S. police and usually wear green-gray or blue uniforms. Under the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the United States and the Republic of Italy, all U.S. military personnel, members of the civilian component and their family members are subject to Italian law and come under Italian jurisdiction for most criminal offenses. Photo courtesy of NSA Public Affairs Guardia di Finanza (Finance Guard) - Comparable to the Coast Guard or border police. They wear gray or blue uniforms. Their main task is to control alcohol, ciga - rette and drug smuggling. They are also in charge of customs, and they enforce tax payments in general. The Guardia di Finanza has a navigation school in Gaeta. Vigili Urbani (City Police) - Their main duty is the enforcement of traffic laws within city limits, as well as sanitation, price control and issuing of vending licenses. Any law enforcement agent may perform his duty in civilian attire, in which case, it is sufficient for law enforcement to show an ID card. In Italy, public servants (such as train and bus conductors or drivers, postmen, firemen and even soccer referees) are con - sidered public officials while performing their duty. To strike or offend one bears the same penalty as striking or offending a policeman or any other public official. In Italy this is a very serious offense. Selling tax-free items - All items stocked by the Navy Exchange and Commissary are imported into Italy free of Italian taxes. Tax-free importation is possible because the goods are certified as reserved for the exclusive use of the U.S. military forces, certain approved NATO allied forces, members of the civilian component and their family mem - bers. Selling or giving these items to anyone who is not an authorized user of exchanges or commissaries is illegal and a serious offense under U.S. and Italian law, and will result in prosecution. If you are ever solicited to obtain items for unauthorized persons (this includes NATO tax- free fuel coupons), report the incident to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Criminal Jurisdiction The NATO Status of Force Agreement (SOFA) recog - nizes the jurisdiction of the United States over its military personnel in the performance of their assigned duties. Under the SOFA, the United States may conduct court- martials in Italy under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The SOFA also recognizes the primary jurisdiction of the host nation (Italy) over most criminal offenses that occur in Italian territory. All military members, members of the civil - ian component and their family members are subject to Italian jurisdiction for criminal offenses. The SOFA also spells out the rights to be accorded to military members, civilian employees and family members who are subjected to criminal trial in Italy. At any trial of a military member, a member of the civi - lian component or a family member, the SOFA guarantees the following rights: As prompt and speedy a trial as is provided to the cit - izens of the host nation; To be informed of the charges before trial; To compel the attendance of witnesses in his or her defense who are located in Italy; To have the services of a competent interpreter; To communicate with a representative of the U.S. government; Normally, to have a U.S. government represen - tative present at the trial. The Region Legal Service Office Europe, Africa Southwest Asia (RLSO EURAFSWA) is responsi - ble for monitoring all criminal trials in southern Italy involving U.S. personnel. In some circum - stances, RLSO EURAFSWA will provide an Italian attorney, free of charge, for the defense of a mili - tary member, a member of the civilian compo - nent or a family member being prosecuted in the Italian criminal courts. Prompt notification to the RLSO is essential when an arrest has occurred. When you arrive in Italy, you should become familiar with the Italian laws most likely to affect you. Your command legal officer should be able to provide this information. You may also contact RLSO EURAFSWA for an appointment with an attorney for further information. Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Law and Education 34 The U.S. Consulate General of Naples is located along the waterfront at Piazza della Repubblica. Photo courtesy of U.S. Consulate Naples Claims and the Protection of Personal Property The Military Personnel and Civilian Employee's Claims Act (Personnel Claims Act) is a federal statute that authori - zes payment of claims filed by military personnel and DoD civilian employees for property losses occurring at places of assigned duty or in assigned quar - ters. Economy housing is considered to be assigned quarters. Claims are generally pay - able when property is damaged or lost due to natural disasters, vandalism or theft, pro - vided claimants did not contribute to the loss through their own negligence. Moreover, claims are also payable for damages or losses to household goods while such goods are shipped from prior duty sta - tions to Naples. On the other hand, claims are not payable if the claimant is an ordi - nary resident in Italy. Personnel claims for Navy per - sonnel should be filed with the Office of the Judge Advocate General, Code 15. All claims must be filed no later than two years from the date the claim accrues. Normally, a claim accrues on the date the incident occurs, or in the case of household goods shipments, on the date of delivery. See http://www. jag.navy.mil/organization/ code_15_packets_forms.htm for more information. The adjudication of a claim under the act requires a num - ber of steps: First,a \"proper claimant\" must file the claim. The Personnel Claims Act authorizes payment of claims sub - mitted by DoD personnel. That means the DoD employee must personally sign the claim, unless the member has given a power of attorney to someone else and a certified true copy of the power of attorney accompanies the claim. Second,the loss must be \"inci - dent to service.\" As indicated at the beginning of this section, \"incident to service\" overseas is defined as including both the assigned duty station as well as the living quarters, whether it is assigned government quarters or privately leased or owned quarters. Claims for losses that occur while on leave or liberty away from the assigned quarters are generally not payable. Third,the adjudicating authority must determine if the claimant's use, possession and safeguarding of the property was \"reasonable, useful or proper under the circumstances at the time of the loss.\" Examples of problems under the \"reasonable - ness\" test include losses of cash or expensive jewelry from quarters. Jewelry, watches, and other highly pilferable items must be safeguarded by extra security measures above and beyond a locked residence. Safes, locked security che - sts or other extra security measures are sometimes used. In shared quarters such as barracks, the \"double lock\" rule applies. That is, in addition to the door to the room being secured, the claimant must also secure high value items separately in lockable chests, safes or other storage vessels. Common sense should be your guide in exercising reason - able care to safeguard your property. When leaving quarters unoccupied, all doors and windows should be locked, and shutters should be closed and locked. Theft claims cannot be paid if the thief gained entry through open or unlocked doors or win - dows. If you are victim of a burglary, con - tact the NSA Security Department, regardless of where you live in the Naples area. Security will provide a police report, which must be includ ed with any claim. Given the high number of thefts that occur from parked, locked vehicles, no valuables should be left in them. Vehicles are simply not a proper place to store valuables. Fourth,the claimant must establish ownership and value of all property for which a claim is submitted. Household goods shipment inventories, purchase receipts, owners manuals, photographs or videos of the property are all excellent evidence of owner - ship. Purchase receipts that also provide proof of value are especially useful for high-value items. Other acceptable sources in determining the value of claimed items include catalogs and written estimates from commercial busines - ses dealing in the product in question. Fifth,for household goods shipments, the adjudicator must determine if the claimant completed the Joint Statement of Loss or Damage at Delivery (DD Form http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 35 1840/1840R) and submitted it to the shipper within 70 days of delivery of the household good to the new residence. This is a vital requirement. If the form was filed correctly, the U.S. government will be able to hold the shipper accountable for damages and losses. If the form was not filed correctly, the claims officer is required to reduce any award to the claimant by the amount the government would have recovered from the shipper. Failure to file this form with the PPO can reduce your potential claim to nearly zero. This is a vital requirement. When visiting Naples, as with any large city, or when tra - veling on crowded buses or trains, be aware of the likelihood of pickpocketing or purse snatching. Make a habit of carrying only the amount of money you need. It may also be helpful to carry some of the money in a different location on your person. Be cautious of wearing flashy jewelry or wat - ches. It only takes a moment for a clever thief to take them. Further information about Navy claims procedures and regulations can be obtained from the Claims Division of the Region Legal Service Office EURAFSWA. Complaints and Denouncements In the event you wish to file a complaint or press charg - es against an individual, it is advisable to first notify the NSA Naples Security Department. It is also advisable to seek the assistance of the EURAFSWA Region Legal Service Office if legal advice is needed. All crimes need to be reported to NSA Naples security personnel first, no matter the severity, whether it is a bur - glary of your home or a theft or vandalism of your vehicle. When it's time to file a complaint with local Carabinieri or Polizia di Stato, the NSA Naples Security Department has qualified interpreters who can assist you. These interpret - ers are available 24 hours a day. Call security at 081-568- 2207 or 081-811-4269. Beware of making a false accusa - tion because this in itself is a serious offense. Drugs and Alcohol Drug and alcohol laws are different in Italy than in the United States. Under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, military members, civilian employees and family members are subject to Italian laws regarding drugs Hundreds of families in \"Central Park\" - a large open space on board Support Site - during Summerfest, one of many annual events hosted throughout the year that is enjoyed by community members.

While the drinking age in Italian society may be more lenient, the penalties for drunk and disorderly con - duct or DUI are not. NSA Naples establishes the drinking age for Navy-controlled clubs and facilities within the NSA area of responsibility. Drunk driving is a serious offense under Italian law. A blood alcohol level of 0.05 is sufficient for a DUI conviction in Italy. Immediate impoundment of a driver's vehicle, suspension of his or her license, heavy fines and a trip to jail should all be expected. Although there is a legal minimum age to buy alcohol, the law is rarely enforced and alcoholic beverages are sold on the Italian economy to anyone old enough to carry them. Italian children seen with alcohol are most likely buying it for their parents. However, Italians as a rule are not heavy drinkers. The use, importation or distribution of drugs is an extreme ly serious offense in Italy. Pre-trial confinement of up to two years while evidence is gathered is permitted under Italian law. Probational liberty may continue up to a maximum of two years from the date of release from confine ment. In rare cases, an actual trial can occur almost four years after initial arrest. Marriage U.S. armed forces personnel wishing to marry a foreign national outside the United States must apply for permis - sion. The NSA Chaplains Office and the Region Legal Service Office EURAFSWA can provide information. A religious sacrament of marriage or church wedding is performed only after the civil marriage has been accom - plished. See the chaplain for assistance in planning a reli - gious wedding. Roman Catholic marriages may take up to six months of preparation. All those desiring to marry in Italy need to plan ahead. Various programs for marriage enrichment are available through the chaplains. Chaplains provide marriage and pre-marriage counseling. EDUCATION AND CYP P ROGRAMS Naples Child and Youth Programs Child and Youth Programs (CYP) are for children of ac - tive duty members, DoD civilians, reservists, DoD contrac - tors (if permitted to use MWR facilities) and retired military members. The CYP program options are designed to meet the varied needs of children and youth in our communities through the programs listed below. Child Development Centers Naples offers two Child Development Centers (CDCs) in Naples: one at Capodichino and one at the Support Site. Each center is staffed with caregivers trained in early childhood development techniques and who offer develop - mental activities in accordance with guildelines published by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. All technician aides are trained in CPR, first aid http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 37 and in developmental practices. The CDC environment is appropriate for each child's age level, and the program of services provides high quality child care. The Naples CDCs reflect the Navy's commitment to providing only the high - est quality care for your child. The Capodichino and Support Sites CDC's provide Child Development Care for infants through preschool age, and offers full-day care weekdays from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (Capo) and 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Support Site). Drop-in care is available at either CDC location on weekdays. Reservations for drop-in care can be made up to 30 days in advance. Sponsors may make reservations for new arrivals before the 30-day mark, allowing parents to attend Area Orientation upon their arrival in Naples. For those who don't make reservations, both CDCs welcome registered children on a space-available basis. Cost for CDC services is calculated on a sliding scale based on total family income. The Child and Youth Programs Division can estimate charges over the phone, but the actual costs are calculated directly from the parents' leave and earnings statements. Drop-in care is a fixed charge at $4 per hour. Child Development Homes The demand for childcare services is sometimes far greater than the CDC can provide. Another care option in Naples is the Child Development Home (CDH) program. These in-home care providers help fulfill the needs of the community by offering children individualized quality care in government-owned or government-leased quarters. While each CDH provider is essentially an independent business enterprise, they operate under the guidance of the MWR Child Development Program and NSA Naples. Before joining the program, each potential CDH provider completes rigorous training. The homes are inspected and approved by Preventive Medicine, the Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program, Family Services, Family Advocacy, the Fire Department and the MWR CDH Director. You, too, could also provide this valuable service to the community. If you have a love for children, this may be an excellent opportunity for you. School Age Care A before - and after-school program is offered at the Youth Center in the Village Forum at the Support Site. The program is affiliated with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and 4-H.

Employment Key Employment Eligibility Restrictions Italian law restricts U.S. citizens' ability to secure jobs on the local economy. Additionally, the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) in Italy establishes hiring restric - tions for the U.S. civilian component. Those who are in Italy as a result of their affiliation with the U.S. armed forc - es are limited in their ability to accept jobs on the Italian economy. However, employment opportunities with federal entities and some non-federal entities (such as Navy Federal Credit Union) are often available. Naples hosts an array of DoD and Department of the Navy commands with employment opportunities for eligible civilians. The DoD has established various preference programs which affect job competitions. Two programs that assist active-duty and civilian compenent dependents in obtain - ing federal employment are the Military Spouse Preference Program and the Family Member Preference Program. Family members of contractors are not eligible for such preferences. Additionally, for many U.S. civilian component positions, veterans also receive a hiring preference. Frequent Vacancies Employment opportunities are available at DoD Dependent Schools (DoDDS) for teachers, teacher aides and substitutes. Various commands have opportunities for office automation clerks, cashiers, child development assi - stants, recreation aides and similar positions at the GS- 03/04/05 grade levels.

Civilian employment outside of the continental United States (OCONUS) is limited to five years. Dependent employees hired OCONUS may be exempt from this limi - tation. However, appointments are tied to the sponsor's tour of duty. Depending on the availablity of funds, there may be a seasonal dependent youth employment program. Eligible students must have a Social Security number. Employment eligibility rules applicable to the U.S. civilian component apply to this program. Finally, interested applicants should consult the applica - ble job announcement for specific position classifications and restrictions.

Following is a list of shopping-related Italian words and phrases. Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Shopping & Dining Out60 Often, it takes Americans some time to get used to bar - tering. Americans are used to going to stores and paying whatever price is marked on the item. While that is true of Italian stores, in the markets - the rows of stalls set out in alleys or back streets - you can buy almost anything for any price you and the seller can agree upon. Food items and fruit and vegetable prices are not haggled over very much. The buying and selling of items becomes much more involved, intricate and exciting when you barter. You and the vendor have to agree on a price. If you pay the price marked or the one the vendor first mentions, he or she will gladly take your money, but probably would have settled for less. One warning, though: if you offer a certain price and after haggling, the seller agrees to it, you are not legally bound, but by custom you are expected to pay the agreed price. If you don't really want it, don't keep bartering. Be certain that when purchasing items from street ven - dors, especially in some areas around Naples Central Station at Piazza Garibaldi, that what you've bought hasn't been replaced by bricks or paper-stuffed boxes after it is wrapped in paper and handed to you. Also, if deals on things such as electronics sold on the street seem too good to be true, they probably are. More than one American in the past has bought a genuine hand-carved wooden \"VCR.\" Caveat emptor - buyer beware! You may also hear other Americans talk about the \"alleys,\" like Gold Alley, Shoe Alley or Christmas Alley. These are names Americans have given to markets in cer - tain streets of Naples. Here, you usually see stands outside, but some are connected to adjacent stores, like Christmas Alley. Or the name simply comes from the street where there are many shops of a particular kind, like Gold Alley. Open Air Markets and \"Alleys \" The following is a list of some open-air and similar markets in the area, when they are open and what main items are sold. Many are on side streets and parking is a problem. The best bet is to take public transportation (see the \"Local Information\" chapter for more details) or park your car as close as you can and walk the rest of the way. If you can't find it right away, look for people carrying bags and ask, \"Dov'\u00ec il mercatino?\" Pointing should then get you there. Mercato delle Pulci:Open Sundays from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Main items: second-hand items, coins, lamps, tables and a few real antiques. Located on Via Poggioreale, near the graveyard, northeast of Naples Central Station at Piazza Garibaldi. Take the Metropolitana to Piazza Garibaldi and then walk or take a bus/trolley. Shoe Alley:Open Sunday, Monday and Friday from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. Main items: shoes, clothing and sewing material. Located on Via Marino di Caramanico. Take the Corso Malta Tangenziale exit, go straight until the first stop light, and then turn left on Via Nuova Poggioreale. Via Marino di Caramanico is the second side street off via Nuova Poggioreale. Gold Alley:Open normal shopping hours. Main items: gold and jewelry. Located on Via San Biagio dei Librai.

Christmas Alley:Open normal shopping hours except around Christmas, when shops stay open later at night and on Sundays. Located on Via San Gregorio Armeno, which connects to Via San items: presepe (nativity scenes) and figurines, which are often very elabo - rate. Naples is famous for these items. The Intercultural Relations tour during your orientation will show you where the street is. Follow directions as to Gold Alley. Thieves Alley (Mercato Duchesca):Open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Main items: clothing, sportswear and equipment, camping gear, radio and stereo gear, some furniture and furnishings. Located in the many narrow streets due west of the main train station http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 61 Nearly every town and city offers open air markets, which are a great way to nd bargains and get a taste of Italian culture. Photo courtesy of NSA Public Affairs behind the statue of Garibaldi. This is a commercial district, and most tables of items for sale are located just outside small shops. Posillipo market:Open Thursdays from 8 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Main items: luxury goods and clothing. Find great bargains on designer items. Located along Viale Virgilio, alongside Parco Virgiliano in Naples' Posillipo district. Vomero market (Mercato di Antignano):Open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Main items: fruit and vegetables, clothing, household items. Located in the Vomero section of Naples, about six blocks from the funicolari stations. From Piazza Vanvitelli, follow Via Bernini about four blocks to the north. The edge of the market will be on the left. Fuorigrotta market:Open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Main items: fruit, vegetables, fish, cheese and other foods; plus kitchen gadgets, household items and plasticware. Located directly across the street from the Cumana train station in Fuorigrotta, about six blocks from the soccer stadium. There is a small alley lead - ing to the market. This market is semi-permanent, covered with standing stalls, although some vendors drive up trucks and park them around the outside. Antiques market:Open Sunday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Main items: antiques. Located in the Villa Comunale, a city park that sits along the Naples waterfront between Mergellina and the Castel dell'Ovo. Drive, or take the Metropolitana to Mergellina, walk to the water, turn left and walk to the park. Bagnoli market:Open Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Main items: similar to the Fuorigrotta market. Located in Bagnoli in the side streets just down from the Metropolitana train station, which is about two blocks from the JFC front gate. Pozzuoli fish market:Open Tuesday through Sunday from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. Opens earlier Sunday, which is the best day to go. Main items: fresh seafood of all types. Located along the pier in old Pozzuoli, near the Tempio Serapide and the ferry and hydrofoil landings. There are also smaller suburban markets like those in Monterusciello and on Via Staffetta in Lago Patria, for exam - ple. Ask your sponsor, landlord and neighbors for details. Italian Stores Of course, Italy has many stores and shops. Italy is world-famous for some items like leather goods from Florence and glass from Venice. The Naples region is famous for its porcelain and pottery (from Capodimonte and Vietri, for example), inlaid wood (from Sorrento) and cameo and coral work (from Torre del Greco, in particular). Main shopping districts in Naples include Chiaia, Vomero and the Via Roma/Via Toledo area downtown. Many stores in Naples range from small corner shops to larger department stores like Coin. You can find super - mercati (supermarkets) and centri commerciali (shopping centers). Some, like Panorama in Formia, Ikea and Med\u00ec in Teverola, Campania Mall Reggia in Caserta, and Auchan in Giugliano are large enough to rightly claim to be U.S.-style malls. Shopping hours tend to be Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and then from late afternoon (4 or Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Shopping & Dining Out62 You will probably discover that dining out is one of the best ways to experience Italian culture rst hand after arriving in Italy. Photo by Gary Nichols 4:30 p.m.) to 8 p.m. Smaller shops tend to close in the afternoon, but shopping centers are open all day and also on Sundays. You will find some shops open on Sunday mornings in busy shopping areas such as Vomero, but smaller shops are rarely open after lunchtime on Sundays and many close for the entire day. Money Exchange There are various places to change money both on and off base. You can use two types of facilities: banks and exchange bureaus (\"cambio\"). Here are some options: Capodichino: Community Bank (Bldg. 450 across from the gym): Euro sales/check cashing. Navy Exchange cashier: Euro or dollar sales. Rates are close to the daily rate. Banco di Napoli (Bldg. 450 across from the gym, 1 st floor): Euro, dollars and other major currency sales, if you have an account. Outside of Admin II, there are also three ATMs available: one dispenses only Euro, one dispen - ses U.S. currency, and one gives both. Support Site: Navy Exchange cashier: euro or dollar sales. Rates are close to the daily rate. ATMs: There is an Italian and American ATM located outside the Navy Exchange near the main doors by the movie theater. It is possible to get dollars or euro at this location. Joint Forces Command: Banco di Napoli: euro, dollar and other major currency sales. Off Base: Shop around for the best deal, and balance convenien - ce with advantageous rates. For example, you may get a few more euros for your dollar at a cambio downtown, but if you are only changing a couple of hundred dollars or less, the inconvenience of going to the cambio probably will outweigh the advantage in rate. Also, recently more and more local banks will accept the Naval Federal Credit Union ATM card; look for the \"Plus\" sign (ask for the \"Bancomat\"). Dining Out Dining out in Italy can be a pleasurable experience. This will probably be one of the first aspects of Italian culture you encounter here, especially if you are accompanied and are living in a hotel for the first few weeks after you arrive. Your sponsor will almost certainly take you to his or her favorite spot. If they don't, ask them to do so. Although authentic Italian cooking can be found in more and more places in the United States nowadays, you will find that what you get here is not what you get at most Italian restaurants in America. You will also find that there really is no such thing as \"Italian food.\" Instead, there is a great variety of regional styles - cooking in Milan is differ - ent, in general, from that of Bologna, Rome, Naples or Sicily. Many Americans think that Neapolitan cooking is some of the best Italy has to offer, and of course any Neapolitan will swear it is true. In general, the cooking of the Naples and Gaeta regions features tomato-based sauces flavored with basil or orega - no and the ever-present garlic, and like many other parts of Italy, seafood is a featured part of the cuisine. And, yes, there are several McDonald's restaurants in Naples. Types of Eating Places There are several, distinctive types of places to eat in Naples, but the distinctions are blurring as U.S.-based life - styles permeate Europe. The following are some terms you may see, and what they mean: Bar:This is usually not a U.S.-style bar, but rather a coffee shop or espresso bar. While you can buy beer, brandy or other alcoholic beverages at Italian bars, the central part of the bar is the espresso coffee machine. Bars are frequented throughout the day, but especially in the morning when they serve pastries to go with coffee. In bars, you must go to the cashier first, tell him or her what you want and pay for it (of course, you can look at what is http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 63 Many of the world's most popular and delicious foods originated in Naples; some of these include pizza, spaghetti and parmigiana, along with varieties of local wines. Photo by Athena Plichta offered before you go to the cashier). Then take the receipt to the counter and order, leaving a small tip (usually about \u20ac0.10) with your receipt. Most Italians eat and drink stand - ing up at these places. Many places have tables and chairs, but sitting down is in effect saying you want waiter service and are willing to pay the extra charge for that service. If you do get the waiter service, it is also customary to leave a small tip for the waiter above the cost of food and drink. Pasticceria:Pastry shop. Many times they are con - nected to a coffee bar, but places listed as a pasticceria offer a wider selection of pastries. Many also serve other food besides pastries, such as varieties of sandwiches. Some places may even put \"panini\" (literally, \"little breads\") on their signs and offer a larger selection. These are excel - lent places to get a quick, inexpensive snack or lunch. Again, you pay first, then order. Tavola Calda:Literally, \"hot table.\" The closest U.S. translation would be a \"grill.\" These are more elaborate than panini shops, featuring hot dishes. Some are small with only a few choices each day. You may select what you want from a glass-enclosed display. Most have a few tables where you can sit. Some have become so elaborate that they are like U.S. self-service cafeterias, although the word \"caffetteria\" in Italian literally means a shop that sells coffee. Rosticceria:A place selling rotisserie-cooked meats, most often whole chickens. In Italian, a \"something-eria\" usually means a place that sells that \"something.\" So, a polleria is a place that sells pollo (chicken). These places are great for getting an inexpensive, very tasty lunch or dinner. In the Naples and Gaeta regions, there are many such shops along the streets and highways selling chickens that have been roasted on a spit and basted with oil spiced with sage, marjoram and oregano. Pizzeria:A pizzeria serves Naples' hallmark dish: pizza. Pizza was invented in Naples, but they are not the pizzas you typically find in the United States. They are usually individual size and come with a wide choice of top - pings. Most pizzerias also sell other foods, and many other types of restauants also advertise themselves as a pizzeria. For example, a place that calls itself a ristorante-pizzeria is telling you that, in addition to its full restaurant selections, they also serve pizza. Trattoria:A smaller, usually family-run restaurant with full waiter service. The menu is more limited, the decor usually less ornate and the prices usually lower than a full ristorante. These places are becoming rare, but can offer some of the best cooking available. Ristorante:A restaurant that offers a large selection of items on the menu and full waiter service. These range Antipasti Italian i/ Mist i/ Assortiti: A plate of mixed items; usu al ly includes sev er al veg e ta bles like zuc chi ni, egg plant, etc. mar i nat ed, grilled or fried. It also usu al ly includes olives, and small pieces of cheese. Bruschetta : Slice of bread oven-toast ed with a top ping of fresh diced toma toes, gar lic, oreg a no and other spic es, and a dash of olive oil. Caprese/Insalata caprese: \"In the Capri style.\" Most often a salad with slic es of fresh toma to layered with slic es of moz\u00ad - \u00ad za\u00ad rel\u00ad la\u00addi\u00adbufa\u00ad la es oil. Caviale: Caviar. Crocchette: Breaded di pesce/di frut ti di mare: A sea food salad con tain ing boiled squid, octo pus, mus sels, clams, etc., usu al ly served cold with a vin aigrette sauce. Melone: Melon, usu al ly of the hon ey dew or can ta loupe type. Mozzarella: A soft, white cheese. In the Naples region, it may mean moz\u00ad za\u00ad rel\u00ad la di\u00adbufa\u00ad la , not the kind we are used to on piz zas in the United States. Mozzarella\u00addi\u00adbufa\u00ad la is made from the milk of water buf fa loes, and is soft er, high er in pro tein and tastes dif fer ent . It is con sid ered a great del i ca cy. Pizzetta: Small, fried light-dough dump - lings, fla vored with a varie ty of spic es and some times filled. Prosciutto: Ham. When used alone, the word means thin ly- sliced raw-cured ham. A del i ca cy. When a dis tinc tion is made between this and other varie is called Prosciutto e melone: Sliced melon. Prosciutto e moz za rel la: Sliced ham and fresh white cheese. Salame: Seasoned and cured sau sag es, served with out fur ther cook ing. Salsiccia: Sausages that need to be cooked before eat ing. These are usu al - ly list ed in the meat sec tion instead of the anti pas ti sec tion of the menu. Seafood: Many types of shell fish also are avail able as anti\u00ad pas\u00ad ti , including clams and mussels. See the sea food sec tion for trans la tions. Antipasti (Appetizers) Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Shopping & Dining Out64 from small places to very large, ornate (and sometimes expensive) places. The Naples region has some specialty restaurants serving Chinese, Japanese, Greek, Brazilian and French cuisine, but relatively fewer than in large cities in the United States. The Italian Meal This section applies to sit-down restaurants with waiter service. Eating in an Italian restaurant is different than in the United States. Quite apart from the differences in foods, there are also differences in customs and even in how the meal is arranged. Generally the attitude in an Italian restaurant is that the table you occupy is yours for as long as you want - until closing if you desire. There is no sense of being hurried through a meal so someo - ne else can use the table. Also, mealtime in Italy is a social time, and diners take their time between courses to conver - se. To be a waiter in Italy is to be part of a respected profession. So, the waiters take pride in provid ing good service. However, they also respect the (expected) wishes of their clients and will not intrude on the socializing. For some Americans, all these things combined give the impres - sion that the service is bad. The waiters don't hang around your table asking if everything is OK; you have to catch their eye to tell them you are ready to order another course, or need more bread or want the check. The service usually isn't bad - it's just different and keyed to the Italian pace of life. Restaurants are very willing to accomodate and serve chil - dren, and you are likely to see several families eating when you are there. Most restaurants will bring extra plates so you can share your meal with your small children. Also, if you ask them, most are willing to serve the children \"mignon\" (small) portions or a \"mezza porzione\" (half portion). Mealtimes in Italy are later than most Americans are used to. Lunch rarely starts before 1 p.m., and 8 p.m. is the normal operating time for restaurants to serve dinner.

The meal is also arranged in courses - things don't ar - rive at once. The basic courses and order in which they arrive are as follows: antipasto (appetizer); primo (pasta); - bles or salad); fruit and/or cheese, dolci (dessert); and cof - fee and liqueurs. Wine, water and bread are available throughout the meal. A main dish is only that - the food you ordered. If you order veal, for example, you'll get a plate of veal. You won't get a salad or potato or other vegetable; those you have to order separately. Pasta dishes are usually described with two terms: the first describes the shape or style of the noodles and the second describes the sauce or way of preparing it. For example, the tomato and meat sauce most Americans call spaghetti is called spaghetti alla bolognese - spaghetti in the style of Bologna. Pasta is generally either boiled or baked with various ingredients. Italians cook their pasta \"al dente\" (to the tooth), cooking it shorter times than most Americans. This gives the pasta a chewy texture. Nearly every restaurant makes their sauces a little differ - ently than other restaurants. There are also regional differ - ences, so these terms should be used as general guides to what you may actually get. Also, most places have a house specialty (\"della casa\"), which is usually worth trying, but you may have to ask what is in it (for example, if you are allergic to shellfish, you would certainly want to know if the house specialty has seafood in it). The sauces are in a variety of consistencies, some very rich and heavy, others delicate and thin. Italian cooks have experimented for cen - turies with the sauces that go well with particular pasta shapes. For example, a thin sauce with shellfish will be ser - ved with spaghetti or linguini, while heavier sauces will be served with fettucine or tagliatelle. Pizzas in Naples have thin chewy crusts, and because they are usually cooked in a stone oven with wood coals, the edges and bottoms are sometimes scorched in places. The toppings tend to be thinner and usually have olive oil on them. So the flavor is not quite the same as U.S.-style pizza, but many Americans (and people of other nationali - ties) enjoy Neapolitan pizza very much.

There is one version, however, called either ripieno or calzone, which is a pizza folded over the topping and then baked or fried to make a kind of stuffed pizza sandwich. There are many different kinds of toppings with many different names, so you may have to ask what toppings a particular pizza actually has on it. In addition to the charges for the food and drinks, your bill (\"il conto\") will usually include a coperto, which is a cover charge for linen, dishwashing and bread. There may also be a servizio, which is a charge for service. When this is charged it usually runs 10 to 15 percent and covers ser - vice charges. When dining at a restaurant in Italy you are not expected to leave a 15 or 20 percent tip as is customary in the United States, even if there is no servizio charge listed on your bill. Tipping in Italy is at a diner's discretion. If you wish to leave a tip, it is customary to leave perhaps a euro for each person who dined (usually not to exceed 10 per - cent). Italians may or may not leave a tip at all.

How do you get there? This section is designed to help answer these questions. It is separated into government and public trans - portation, on-base facilities, off-base facilities and some of the sights. The last section is nearly impossible to exhaust - there is so much available that it would take several books just to cover the highlights. Public Transportation Naples has a highly developed public transportation system, encompassing buses, trolleys, subway and com - muter trains, long-distance trains, cable cars, taxis, ferries, hydrofoils and airplanes. There are also suburban and long-distance services, but these generally do not run as often or go as many places. Public transportation is not usually a viable home-to-work option for the Americans who live in the suburbs. Rather, public transportation is most useful for off-duty recreatio - nal travel. Buses You can purchase a 90-minute ticket, \"Unico Napoli,\" and use it to travel throughout Naples. Daily, weekly and monthly tickets are also available. Tickets must be bought in advance from bus terminal ticket offices, tobacco stores or news stands. Once on the bus, validate your ticket by putting it in the ticket-punching machine. Ticket collectors are few but keep your ticket until you get off the bus. It may not happen often, but there could be a time when you are asked to produce your validated ticket. If you cannot do so, you may incur a heavy fine. Because of the large number of bus lines and stops, it is easy to get confused. Directions in Naples are centered on some of the major piazzas and main streets. For example, you may be at the main train station area (Piazza Garibaldi) and want to get to \"Castel Nuovo\" (New Castle) near Piazza Municipio, so you would look for a bus that inclu - des Piazza Municipio on its route. If you have access to \"Tutta Citt\u00e0,\" a supplement to the Naples telephone directory, you can consult the listing of city bus routes. Another option is to visit the Office of Tourism's website: www.inaples.it. There are rectangular yellow or silver signs at scheduled stops that list the buses by number that stop there and also list the main areas that each bus covers. Bus stops are of two types: obbligatoria (mandatory stop) and facol - tativa (request stop). The sign at each stop will indicate which type it is. If you are waiting for a bus at a facoltativa stop, you must wave at the bus you want when you see it coming otherwise, it will not stop. There are also many suburban and long-distance routes, such as from Naples to Aversa or to the Amalfi coast. To travel these routes, you need \"Unico Campania\" tickets. Alibus For \u20ac4 one-way, the Alibus circulates Airport, Piazza Garibaldi Central Train Station and Molo Beverello, the main port in Naples (close to the Nuovo, Piazza del Plebiscito and Piazza Municipio). The Alibus runs every 20 minutes. Another alternative to reach Capodichino from the city center is route C68, which connects Piazza Carlo III in the city center with Via Fulco Ruffo di Calabria, the street with the roundabout directly outside Naval Support Activity Naples Capodichino. Local Information http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 69 From the airport, take the Alibus directly to the central station at Piazza Garibaldi and beyond to the main port, Molo Beverello. Purchase tickets on the bus. Photo by MC1(NAO) John Parker Trolleys There are few trolleys, the most useful being route No. 1. This runs past the port area, the central train station and northeast, near Shoe Alley. This route runs by many points of interest, but can take quite some time when compared to other forms of public transportation. Subway and Commuter Trains Metropolitana (Line 1):This subway system runs from Piazza Dante to Piscinola with stops at the Naples Archaeological stops Rione Metropolitana (Line 2):The main segment which runs from Pozzuoli to Gianturco in northeast Naples, Napoli tickets may be used on most means of transportation within Naples city limits. Here are most of the central-section stations and what they connect with: Pozzuoli:This station is located next to the Anfiteatro Flavio, the third-largest and one of the best-preserved Roman amphitheaters in Italy. It is a short walk away from the Solfatara volcano and the Pozzuoli port, where you can catch ferries to Ischia and Procida. Bagnoli:This subway stop is located about two blocks from the main gate at the old NATO base. Campi Flegrei:On Piazzale Tecchio where the soc - cer stadium is located. Here you can make connections to the Cumana train system, buses and trolley No.1. Only a short walk away is the Mostra d'Oltremare (the expo cen - ter) and zoo. Mergellina:This stop is near the Mergellina port in Naples. Hydrofoils to the islands can be caught two blocks away (turn right from the station and walk downhill through Piazza Sannazzaro to the waterfront). The funicolare to Posillipo is three blocks away (go to Piazza Sannazzaro, but stay to the right and head down Via Mergellina; the sta - tion is on the right-hand side of the street). Mergellina is close to the poet Virgil's tomb, which is on the hill behind the station. Villa Comunale, the site of Europe's oldest aquarium and an open air antique market, is a short walk away, as is the U.S. Consulate. Piazza Amedeo:From here, you can change to the Funicolare di Chiaia, which connects to the Vomero district. To reach the funicolare, turn left out of the station and walk uphill about 100 meters; the station is on the left. Piazza Amedeo is also close to the shopping area along Via dei Mille. Montesanto:Here you can change to the Cumana and Circumflegrea train lines, as well as the Funicolare di Montesanto. As you leave the station, walk across the small square and continue downhill on Via Olivella. Both the Cumana/Circumflegrea and funicolare stations are located at the end of this street on Piazza Montesanto. If you continue walking downhill and bear left at a small square called Pignasecca, you'll end up at the intersection of Via Toledo (Via Roma) and Spaccanapoli. If you bear right at Piazza Pignasecca, you'll reach Piazza Carit\u00e0. Piazza Cavour:The National Archeological Museum is at the west end of this square (turn right along Via Cavour as you exit the station, the museum is on the right). If you turn left when you leave the station, you'll soon reach the inter - section with Via Duomo, where the Naples Cathedral (Duomo) is located; the street is also a main shopping street. Piazza Garibaldi:The subway is under the main Naples train station. You can transfer here to the Circumvesuviana commuter train, which stops on the level just above the subway platform. On the top level is the Stazione Centrale (Central Station), where you can catch trains for anywhere in Italy and most destinations in Europe. Outside at the street level is Piazza Garibaldi, a main bus terminal. Trolley lines also run through the piazza. Funicolari:The world-famous Naples funicolari (singu - lar funicolare) are similar to cable cars. They are not quite like the ones in San Francisco that travel along city streets. Rather, they have their own dedicated tracks. There are four funicolari in Naples. Three go into the Vomero sec - tion, an elegant residential and shop - ping area, and the fourth goes into the upscale residential area of Posillipo. Centrale:This car starts at Piazza Duca D'Aosta, a small square off Via Toledo across from Galleria Umberto and near the San Carlo Opera House. It ends very close to Piazza Vanvi telli, in the heart of Vomero's business and shopping district. Chiaia:This car starts at Parco Margherita, about 100 meters from Piazza Amedeo, and ends near Piazza Vanvitelli. Montesanto:This car runs from Montesanto to Via Vomero, a few blocks from Piazza Vanvitelli. Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Local Information 70 The train system is a fast and economical way to make your way around Naples and also Italy and the rest of Europe. Photo by MC1 Daniel Barker Mergellina:This car runs from Mer gellina to Via Manzoni in Posillipo. Cumana:This train system runs from the Baia/Bacoli peninsula to Montesanto, with stops in Pozzuoli, Bagnoli (down the hill market). Circumflegrea:This train runs from Montesanto around the north of Naples to Licola and Cuma, with stops in Soccavo, Pianura and Quarto. Circumvesuviana:The main train station is located on Corso Garibaldi, just down the street from the main train station. However, you can also catch this train at Piazza Garibaldi. It has several lines that go to Ercolano, Pompei and the resort towns of Vico Equense and Sorrento. Long-distance Trains Trains connect you easily and conveniently with the rest of Italy and Europe. Depending on how many people are traveling, trains can be cheaper than driving, and in many cases (such as going to a crowded city like Rome or Florence) cause less hassle. These can be caught at the main Naples train station, as well as from stations in Aversa and Formia. Tickets can be purchased online, at the stations or from Information, Tours and Travel. Train tickets are valid for trav el on a particular train in a particular seat. You may need to make a reservation for that train; some trains can only be ridden with a reservation. There are four major types of trains, listed here in descending order of speed and cost. Examples are given of standard travel times from Naples to Rome: Alta Velocit\u00e0:Travel between major cities at 200 kilo - meters per hour (1 hour, 15 minutes). EuroStar:Travel between major cities (1 hour, 45 mi nutes). Intercity:While they are slower than AV or ES trains, IC trains have more comfortable second class cabins, and arguably more personality. Since they are older, they are likelier to be dirtier, however. Intercity \"Plus\" trains are somewhat newer and inexplicably cost less (2 hours to 2 hours, 13 minutes). Regionale (sometimes also called \"Espresso\"): These stop in every town along the way. Some are basical - ly modern commuter trains; some look like they were left over from Mussolini's regime (w hours, 16 minutes to 2 hours, 43 minutes). For overnight travel, you can reserve a \"cuccette,\" which is a train car that converts to sleeping bunks, or a sleeper car that has beds. This can often be a convenient way to travel long distances, since you don't have to pay for a hotel room that night, and you arrive first thing in the morning. On some trains (such as Intercity second class), if there is room in a compartment, you can also push together two facing seats to make a horizontal bed. Taxis Naples' taxis operate 24 hours a day, but taxi fares are very expensive compared to other forms of local transporta - tion. If you use a taxi, make sure it is a city-licensed one (it will have a Naples crest on the door and a taxi number) and use one with a meter. Insist on the meter being turned on before you get in the car. Many routes and destinations have pre-determined fixed rates. If you do use a taxi without run - ning the meter, agree on a price before you get in. Certain additions to the figure shown on the meter are legal, including fees for traveling at certain times of the day, crossing zones or city limits, carrying extra luggage, and ser - vice to and from Capodichino Airport. Tipsy Taxi For U.S. military members, the NSA Naples Chief Petty Officers Association runs a Tipsy Taxi service to prevent drunk driving incidents. This service is anonymous, and the Chiefs Mess will cover up to 150 euro for cab fare, but fees must be repaid to the quarterdeck the following day. To use the Tipsy Taxi, call the NSA Command Duty Officer at 335-825-7986 or the NSA Quarterdeck at 081-568-5547 for a taxi ride to Support Site or Capodichino. Ferries and Hydrofoils Ferries and hydrofoils depart frequently from Naples and Pozzuoli. Most routes serve the islands of Capri, Ischia and Procida and many will take you to the city of Sorrento. There are also some longer-haul ferries that run to the Pontine Islands, Aeolian Islands, Sicily and Tunisia. There are three main ferry and hydrofoil landings: Molo Beverello (the primary downtown Naples port), Mergellina port and Pozzuoli port. Ferries are cheaper, but take longer. http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 71 Airports There are four main airports nearby to consider for air travel: Capodichino Air Terminal:Military flights depart from NSA Naples Capodichino using the same runways as the civilian flights. Space-A opportunities are available, and flights go to various locations in Europe, with some going to the United States. For military flight information, call passenger services at Commercial 081-568-5283. Naples Capodichino (NAP):This is the closest and most convenient airport, although it does not have as many flights as Rome's airports. The Naples airport is lo - cated at Capodichino, where you can get flights to other Italian cities and connections for international flights. You can park your car at the Capodichino base and walk to the terminal in just a few minutes. Roma Fiumicino (Leonardo da Vinci Airport, FCO): This is Rome's major airport. Although using this airport involves getting to Rome first, it is sometimes cheaper and easier since Rome has more flights than Naples. Roma Ciampino (CIA):Formerly a military-only airport, Ciampino now caters to low-cost airlines such as EasyJet and RyanAir. It does not have direct rail connections, but there are still various relatively cheap transportation options. If driving, do not follow signs for \"Ciampino Centro\" (shown with a target), only Ciampino Airport (with a picture of an airplane). Area Sights Consider taking public transportation to the city center as the streets are narrow, traffic is heavy and parking is limited. Archeological Museum:Naples Archaeological Museum is without a doubt one of the most important archeological museums in the world. It houses principally the Farnese collection, which Charles of Bourbon inherited from the Farnese family who ruled the Duchy of Parma. The collection includes bronze statues, mosaics, paintings, furnishings and other items uncovered from the excava - tions of Herculaneum and Pompeii. Nearly every important movable item from those excavations can be found here. The museum also contains finds from other ancient sites in Campania and houses the Borgia Collection of Etruscan and Egyptian relics, as well as the Santangelo Collection of antique coins. Aquarium:This is located in the Villa Comunale on the Naples seafront. It is the oldest aquarium in Europe and contains about 20 large tanks. Capodimonte Museum:This was a hunting lodge for the Bourbon kings of Naples. It now houses the National Picture Gallery that includes many paintings by Titian, as well as several other collections. The grounds are exten - sive and contain many ancient, large trees. San Martino National Museum:This museum, housed in a former Carthusian monastery, features terraced gar - dens that provide a spectacular view of the city. Additionally, the monastery's church and cloiser feature impressive sculpture, paintings and inlaid marble decora - tion. The museum has a section of naval history, a section on the Kingdom of Naples and a collection of presepi (Nativity scenes). Duke of Martina Museum:This museum is located in the park called Villa Floridiana. It contains valuable collec - tions of European, Chinese and Japanese ceramics, as well as a collection of enamels and ivory. Naval Museum:On display are models of the Italian navy's ships and nautical instruments from the 1850s on. Royal Palace:The magnificently decorated halls and rooms contain original Bourbon furniture, paintings, stat - ues and porcelain. The palace also houses the National Library, which has several collections, including approxi - mately 2,000 papyrus scrolls uncovered at Herculaneum. Duomo:This is Naples' cathedral and a fine example of Baroque art. There are many other churches in the Naples area to visit, easily found in any tourist guide about Naples. Sansevero Chapel:This chapel contains masterpieces of 18th-century sculpture, including the Veiled Christ by Giuseppe Sanmartino. Lo Zoo di Napoli:This popular zoo is located on Viale Kennedy, near the Stadio San Paolo, where the Napoli Soccer Team plays home games. Pozzuoli Pozzuoli is a city adjacent to Naples and is where Carney Park is located. Originally the Greek city of Dicaerchia and later the Newcomer's Guide to Naples - Local Information 72 Roman city of Puteoli (where St. Paul stopped on his way to Rome - read about it in Acts 28:13-14), Pozzuoli still has ancient charm. More recently it has become famous as the hometown of actress Sophia Loren. Pozzuoli has three major hubs, which includes the porto (port), where ferries dock and the fanciest restaurants hug the water; Via Napoli (actually called Corso Umberto I or Lungomare Pertini) with its new boardwalk and dozens of sidewalk restau - rants and bars; and finally the amphitheater area, which is home to Roman ruins and smal - ler pubs. The following are some of the main sights in Pozzuoli: Tempio di Serapide:This is located near the waterfront. The grounds are closed, but the ruins can be easily viewed at any time. Because they found a statue here of the god Serapide (Serapis), early archeologists thought this was the Temple of Serapide. However, it was actually an elaborate Roman marketplace. Driving to the site is the easiest way to get there. Just take Via Domitiana to the central piazza, turn left and head down the hill to the ruins. Or take the Metropolitana to Pozzuoli station and walk. Across the street is the Pozzuoli fish market. Anfiteatro Flavio:This is the third largest Roman amphitheater in Italy after the Colosseum in Rome and the arena in Capua, near Caserta. It was once a venue for gla - diator fights. Today, many of the underground passages that were used to move fighters, beasts and scenery to the main arena remain. It is located on Via Domitiana and is open daily from 9 a.m. to dusk. The Metropolitana is the most convenient method of getting there. Just stop at the Pozzuoli station and walk from there. Vulcano Solfatara:These hot, sulfurous vents have been amazing people since ancient times; this was also the site where San Gennaro (Saint Januarius) was beheaded. Open from 8:30 a.m. until one hour before dusk. Recently, the Solfatara caused a stir when a study proclaimed it a \"natural Viagra!\" Rione Terra:This \"land district\" is the site of the original acropolis of the ancient Roman and Greek cities of Dicaerchia and Puteoli. Destroyed in the 1980s after a devas tating earthquake, many of the ancient underground ruins and 17th- and 18th-century palaces above are now restored and available for tours. It's almost an \"underground Pompeii.\" Open only on weekends from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Aversa Aversa is a town in the province of Caserta, less than 10 minutes away from the Support Site. It is an important rail junction, as well an area where the famous Asprino wine and mozzarella di bufala cheese are produced. It has many interesting monuments and churches, as well as numerous shops and restaurants. To reach Aversa from the Support Site, take bus T63R across from the main entrance of the base. The Information, Tours and Travel office sells bus tickets. Pompeii and Herculaneum These two cities, spelled \"Pompei\" and \"Ercolano\" in Italian, were destroyed when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D. In both towns, you can visit the excavated remains. Entry fees are charged. To get there, drive or take the Circumvesuviana train. The USO and Information, Tours and Travel also offer tours. Tours Tours of local attractions are available through the Fleet and Family Support Center; Morale, Welfare and Recreation; Information, Tours and Travel; and the USO. These organizations run regular tours to many local areas, http://www.cnic.navy.mil/naples 73 The ruins of Macellum (market building ) was built in the Roman colony of Puteoli (now known as Pozzuoli) nearly 2,000 years ago, and excavated in the 18th century. The base of the columns appear to be surrounded by water, but this is an example of how the ground has moved slowly up and down with the ebb and flow of magma chambers deep within the earth. Photo by MC1 Daniel Barker including Pozzuoli, Pompei, Ercolano, Sorrento, Rome and many more. There are also commercial tour agencies, that can make travel arrangements for you. Entertainment While here, a show at Naples' Teatro San Carlo is a must. Located on Via San Carlo, this theater is one of the most important opera houses in Europe. Built in 1737 (40 years earlier than La Scala in Milan) by Charles of Bourbon, it was destroyed by a fire in 1816 and then rebuilt six months later. The ballet schools of La Scala and San Carlo are the two oldest of their kind in Italy. The theater's box office is open every day (except Mondays and public holi - days) from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 4:30 to 6 p.m. The phone number is 081-797-2331/2332, but be ready to speak Italian if you call. Other major theaters are the Bellini, which often hosts shows in English, the Diana and the Teatro Augusteo. Calcio Football matches (\"soccer\" to Americans) take place at the San Paolo stadium in Fuorigrotta, near the Campi Flegrei station. While you're in Italy, you should take the time to see how soccer was meant to be played. On the tamer side of sports, horse racing takes place at a track in Agnano, not far from Capodichino. Nightlife There are too many nightclubs and discos to to list. The best way to find out what's going on is to ask around and go out and experience the Italian nightlife for yourself. Once you're out with the locals you'll find your Italian lan - guage skills getting better and your tour here whizzing by. Clubs and Organizations There is so much to see and do in this area, and one of the best ways to get out and see it all is by joining one of the many clubs or organizations in the Naples area. Whether you're into scuba diving off the Island of Capri or enjoying delicious and entertaining luncheons with an inter - national flair, there's something here for everyone. The best way to find out what is going on in Naples is to read \"Panorama\" and the biweekly Public Affairs Notes.

However, should you find yourself in a diffi - cult situation, it is best to turn to the police forces in charge of safety. An efficient, modern, integrated network with the switchboards of the various police forces, emergency services, organizations and agencies is ready to respond to emergency calls from anywhere in Italy. Access to this network is simple and quick. All you have to do is call the national emergency numbers, which are well known and easy to remember. STATE POLICE: 113 This is the single national number to report all kinds of emergen - cies such as theft, robbery or assault, or accidents and health emer - gencies. This number corresponds to the switchboard network of the state police, which operates 24/7. CARABINIERI: 112 Dialing 112 will put you through to the switchboards of the Carabinieri. In 1991, the European Union introduced 112 as the single emergency number for all member states, in order to make life easier for tourists and foreign citizens on their travels within the continent. For this reason, a reply service in a number of lan - guages is provided for calls to this number. FIRE SERVICES: 115 In the event of fire, smoke or gas leaks, you can call the fire services directly. They are present throughout Italy and can also intervene swiftly in the event of earthquakes or other disaster situations. HEALTH EMERGENCIES: 118 You can call this number from anywhere in Italy (including the islands) to alert the health care network and request ambulance transport to the nearest hospital or health care facility. A helicopter ambulance service is also available to access the more isolated or difficult to reach areas. ROAD RESCUE: 803-116 This is the ACI Road Emergency number, available to ACI mem - bers and customers who request ACI services, such as road emer - gencies, car replacement, car towage, medical assistance, through - out Italy. The number is free of charge and active only in Italy 24/7. FOREST FIRES: 1515 This is the number to call for environmental emergencies. The ser - vice is active 24/7. The Forestry Corps is in charge of safeguarding the country's environmental and landscape heritage, and deals in particular with forest fires, which are a permanent problem espe - cially during the summer months. COASTGUARD - SEA RESCUE: 1530 If your boat breaks down or you have another emergency in Italy's territorial waters, contact the national coastguard at this number.
