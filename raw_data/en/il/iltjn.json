Without being properly diagnosed and without the guidance of a qualified physician, it is unwise to try any home remedies because many remedies (home) are not proved to be effective in all cases of bleeding. If the bleeding is severe and if it is associated with a chronic illness, home remedies might just prove to be like 'rubbing salt on wound scenario', worsening the condition. I suggest an immediate appointment with doctor in case of GI Bleeding, especially if it happens repeatedly. You may try home remedies when symptoms of intestinal rupture and or shock are absent or when there are no complications associated with GI Bleeding. Anyhow it is good to try things by taking your doctors consent. Below mentioned are some of the home remedies for GI Bleeding Avoid these - Avoid foods that trigger gastric secretions like spicy and salty foods. Avoid alcohol and smoking, they increase gastric secretions and worsen bleeding High fiber diet - Eat a high fiber diet. This increases the bulk of the stools. This prevents diverticulosis and hemorrhoids which are chief causes of GI Bleeding. Water - Take good quantity of water because you are losing lot of fluids and electrolytes while experiencing GI Bleeding. If bleeding is moderate to severe, drink fluids continuously and repeatedly until bleeding stops. This avoids dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Juices - Drinks having Vitamin C with minerals and B vitamins, diluted apple or pear juice help in restoring fluid in the body and replenish the system Olive leaf extract and wild oregano oil - Olive leaf extract or wild oregano oil are natural antibiotics / antimicrobials which can be used in GI Bleeding to eradicate and eliminate microorganisms.
