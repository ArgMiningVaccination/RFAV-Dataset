Stop putting toxins in= Clear. #2. Get the toxins out = Cleanse. #3. Give the body/mind/soul what it needs to heal = Repair Clear + Cleanse + Repair= Healthy Planning Your Cleanse To have a Successful cleanse requires a little planning. Find a good time to cleanse. You need to be able to clear your schedule as much as possible. It is best to cleanse in the Spring & Fall when the weather is mild & less taxing on your body. Decide the duration of your cleanse. A longer cleanse of 1 or more weeks requires more planning & resources than a shorter cleanse of 3-7 days. It helps to have a game plan or outline for your cleanse. Daily menus & schedules are very helpful. Set reasonable goals for your cleanse. It is better to choose a more simple cleanse & be successful. Gather your materials before you start & make appointments with your chosen health care providers. Step 1: the Clearing! Stop putting toxins into your system! Clear your diet of coffee, pesticides, alcohol, refined sugar & flours, recreational & O.T.C. drugs, cigarettes, toxic cleaners & other inhalants (ex. Air fresheners). Avoid foods that cause acidity. Avoid emotional toxins, toxic people & toxic places. Eat mostly alkaline foods & AVOID Acid causing foods. Over acidity is detrimental to vital organs and produces an environment conducive to pathogens. The body must be alkaline in order for healing to occur. Natural Healing by Linda Page It is Vital to drink only purified water! Reverse Osmosis & distillation are the only ways to remove fluoride from your water. Step #2: the Cleansing Get the toxins out of your system! Every cleanse begins with the Colon. Colon cleansing is vital to ensure toxins do not get trapped in the bowel. (Toxins & toxic die off trapped in the bowel would make you very sick.) Methods to cleanse the colon: colonics, herbal & oral colon cleanse products like Oxypowder (www.globalhealingcenter.com); castor oil packs Tips for a Colon Cleanse Begin & end every cleanse with a colon cleanse. It is good to poo! Don't be scarred. Hydrocolon Therapy or Colonics are a wonderful & gentle method of clearing the large intestine.(contraindications include diverticulitis or polyps) Herbal Colon Cleanse products like Oxypowder gently clear out both the small & large intestines.(www.globalhealingcenter.com is an excellent resource for information and amazing products). Drink extra water either distilled or purified. Eat only organic produce & small amounts of whole grains during your cleanse. Juicing or even a juice fast are very helpful. Self Abdominal Massage relaxes the muscles in the belly & intestines and will help you release toxins with ease. Lymphatic Dry Brushing The lymphatic system is an important part of immunity. Lymph is a viscous intercellular liquid that carries off cellular waste & brings in white blood cells etc. Lymphatic dry brushing or skin brushing helps to circulate our lymph. It also exfoliates the skin and opens our pores to aid in eliminating toxins through our skin. This takes the pressure off our kidneys, liver & colon. It also keeps our skin healthy & beautiful. Heal and Detox with Oil Pulling: The What, Why and How Monday, March 01, 2010 by: Elizabeth Walling Here is a list of some of the benefits associated with oil pulling: - Whiter, straighter teeth - Healthy, pink gums - Increased energy - Decreased migraine headaches - Clear sinuses - Less severe asthma - Decreased allergies - Improved PMS symptoms - Regulated menstrual cycles - Better sleep - Clear skin How to Practice Oil Pulling: Traditionally unrefined sunflower or sesame oil was used for oil pulling, but today many other oils are used as well. Unrefined olive or coconut oil come highly recommended if you don't want to use the traditional oils. - Ideally oil pulling should be done first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. - About one tablespoon of oil should be used. - A couple drops of essential oil or a healing oil like oregano can be added if desired. - Swish the oil slowly and methodically, not vigorously. - Try to make sure the oil reaches every region of your mouth. - Be careful not to swallow the oil. - Continue swishing the oil for at least 10 minutes, preferably more like 20 minutes. - The oil will become very thin and foamy as you swish. - Spit the oil out and rinse your mouth thoroughly with pure water.(salt water or baking soda work better & help whiten teeth.) - Brush with a natural toothpaste afterwards. Oil pulling can be done as often as you like. Daily sessions are recommended if you have specific health problems you are trying to address with oil pulling. This traditional practice is also an excellent measure to add to your daily routine to facilitate detoxification and overall health. That's it. It's a very simple technique. Our mouths are the home to billions of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other parasites and their toxins. These types of germs and their toxic waste products cause gum disease and tooth decay and contribute to many other health problems, including arthritis and heart disease. Our immune system is constantly fighting these pathogens. If our immune system becomes overloaded or burdened by excessive stress, poor diet, environmental toxins, etc., these organisms can spread throughout the body, causing secondary infections and chronic inflammation, leading to any number of health problems. Move and sweat everyday of your cleanse!! Go on a walk. Breathe deep and swing your arms freely. Yoga, Pilates, Dance, Tai Chi, ride your bike, swimming...do anything as long as you move and breath deeply! When you feel fatigued and stressed do gentle movements. Just stretch on the floor like a cat moving because it feels good. Herbs & Supplements that help draw out toxins. Sea Greens draw out heavy metals and they help balance the thyroid. You may add dry sea greens to your soups and rice. It helps to take Kelp supplements. Spirulina & Chlorella provide rich nutrition to fortify the blood and they help the body deal with radiation, heavy metals, and free radicals. Liver supporting Herbs (often work better blended with each other): dandelion, milk thistle, burdock, comfrey leaf Vitamin C boosts immunity and helps organs release toxins including heavy metals Apple Cider Vinegar kills fungus, molds, and helps to rid intestinal parasites. It alkalizes the body and helps joints and muscles release excess lactic acid. Apples purify the blood and help soften gall stones. Triphala is an Ayurvedic herbal formula that purifies the blood and moves the bowels. It is gentle & highly beneficial for a cleanse. It comes in pill form & can be found at Natural Grocers, Whole Foods etc. Miso soup helps heal radiation damage and is a good source of probiotics. Cayenne, horseradish, and garlic are Powerful immune boosters! Castor oil packs A castor oil pack is effective in drawing toxins out of the liver & bowel and in dissolving cysts. To make a castor oil pack gently warm \u00bc cup (or a little less) of castor oil on the stove. It does not require a lot of time or heat. Be very careful not to make the oil hot!!!! (that is used for torture!) Soak a flannel cloth in the warm oil. Make certain the oil is not too hot and then place the cloth on your belly. On the right side is your liver. On the left side is your spleen and decending colon. Ladies may wish to place it over the uterus and ovaries. You may put plastic over the cloth to keep things tidy. Place a hot water bottle over the cloth and hang out for 20 mins-1hour. (I often find I do not need the hot water bottle until 10 mins have passed. If you feel a burning sensation then remove the heat. If it continues to burn then remove the cloth). Acupuncture is an extremely effective way to bring everything into balance. Acupressure uses pressure instead of needles to achieve balance. This excerpt from Acupressure Potent Points by. Michael Reed Gach will help balance your immune system. (pp.163-164) Bodywork is Very Important! Get at least one massage! Go to your Chiropractor! Here is a list of my recommended practitioners. Massage & Energy Work: Celeste Larson LMT 940-230-3949. Matt Chapman (Thai Massage) 214-202-3062 Chiropractors: Dr. Brandon Huddleston of Growth Life Studio in Oak Cliff www.oakcliffchiropractor.com The Family Chiropractic Center in Denton. Dr. Jan Nix & Dr. Chuck Tillotson (Applied Kineseology Chiropractors are great for chronic & serious health issues) 940-382-6141 Accupuncture: Dr. Yiming Wang 972-680-0121 Acupressure: Yaya foot Spa or Acupressure massage at King Spa More Advanced Cleanses After your colon cleanse you may wish to do some more specific cleansing such as a Liver/ Gallbladder cleanse, or a candida cleanse etc. There are excellent cleansing kits for each organ system. If you want to do it yourself then books like Healthy Healing by Linda Page give you a step by step cleansing program for each organ. I strongly recommend you be under the care of a health care professional if you have current health issues or when doing a more involved cleanse. Sometimes the toxins released by the cleanse can make us sick. The Healing Crisis!!! A healing crisis occurs when the release of toxins is too much for us to handle. It can result in anything from a slight malaise, headaches, nausea & rashes to more critical conditions. To avoid a healing crisis it is important to take things slow & gentle and to give the body plenty of support. Emotions play a big part in a healing crisis so I recommend using Rescue Remedy from the homeopathic Bach Flower Remedies. This brings us to step #3: Repair As we cleanse our bodies must process the stored up toxins and eliminate them. This can create symptoms such as head aches, fatigue & lethargy, depression & irritability. There are many techniques that bring us comfort as our body releases toxins. Acupressure Potent Points pp.157-158 Emotional Detox A good cleanse will release both physical and EMOTIONAL toxins. Be prepared to deal with old emotions. Techniques: see a counselor during your cleanse, keep a journal to vent all the emotional run off, use your favorite self help book & self help exercises. My favorite self help authors & books are Louise Hay You can Heal your Life. Collin Tipping Radical Forgiveness. Don Miguel Ruiz The Four Agreements Cindy Dale Energetic Boundaries. Use the homeopathic Bach Flower Essences to deal with specific emtoions, or Rescue Remedy do deal with general malaise & anxiety When crazy emotions arise, Feel them fully and then let them go (breathe them out, send them floating down the river, write them on paper and safely burn them. Step 3: Give the body what it needs in order to Heal Drink a lot of purified water, at least 8 glasses a day! You should always have a water, herbal tea, fresh vegetable juice in your hand. Move everyday! Exercise: do yoga, ride a bike, go for a swim, walk walk walk. If you can't do that then roll around on the floor. Rest. Avoid extracurricular activities. Go to bed early. Avoid people that stress you out. Get to bed early 10:30 at the latest. Our bodies heal while we sleep. Get some form of body work! Massage will help flush the toxins from your body and your mind. Chiropractic work brings you into alignment on all levels. Acupuncture, acupressure & reflexology move toxic energy out of our system. Most important is flushing your system with healthy nutrients. Everything you put into your mouth must be healing. Step 3: Repair #1 Drink a lot of purified Water to flush toxins out of the system. Flush your system in vitamins, minerals and nutrients that can be easily absorbed such as fresh vegetable juices, vegetable broths and supplements. Healthy Oils are necessary for tissue repair and healthy brains! Take a pure quality fish oil, flax oil, or hemp oil. Also take coconut oil as a supplement. Substances like activated charcoal, volcanic ash, and edible clay will draw toxins out of your tissue and then absorb those toxins so they are easily passed. I use Living Clay from Whole Foods. Molybdenum is a mineral that binds with toxins to help them pass out of you easily and safely. Probiotics help balance the good flora in your colon. Probiotics keep yeast levels balanced and help prevent intestinal parasites. Zinc is important for tissue repair and immunity. Vitamin C and all the B vitamins are important for immunity, tissue repair, and healthy brain functions. If you do not have a juicer then these shakes & soups are a good alternative. You may strain them and just use the broth or you may blend the veggies together after cooking. Here is an excellent example of a detox meal plan! My favorite EZ detox lunch or dinner is miso soup with sea greens, brown rice with sea greens & apple carrot beet spinach juice! Plan your cleanse Decide how long your cleanse will last. Set goals (what do you want to accomplish with this cleanse). Eat only organic vegetables, fruit & whole grains. Plan to make juices or broths and meals and make a grocery list. You might choose a liquid only diet for 1 day of your cleanse. Decide on a colon cleansing method Choose herbal supplements for detox. It is important to have a healthy oil, zinc, kelp, chlorella, vitamin C & B vitamin complex, liver support herbs, apple cider vinegar, a substance that absorbs toxins (Living Clay or Volcanic Ash). Gather ingredients for cleansing procedures like enemas & detox baths (sea salt, epsom salts, apple cider vinegar etc.) Gather all supplies before you start your cleanse! Make appointments with your health care providers for massage, chiropractic, acupuncture, colonics etc. Bibliography Acupressure Potent Points a guide to Self-Care for Common Ailments.
