While some people will do whatever it takes to achieve a quality night's sleep, others prefer to take a more natural approach to treat their sleep troubles. Homeopathy is a pseudoscientific system of alternative medicine based on the belief that the body can heal itself. Many scientists that practice homeotherapy rely heavily on natural substances including plants and herbs to stimulate the healing process. The practice was created in the 1700s by German physician Samuel Hahnemann. It's now regularly used in many European countries and is making its way into American culture, though some skepticism still remains. Curious to learn more about this alternative form of medicine? Keep reading to learn more about homeopathy and how it works as a viable [insomnia treatment](https://somnustherapy.com/insomnia-treatment-therapy-at-home/) option. Content How Does Homeopathy Work? The basic premise behind homeopathy is that, with the right natural ingredients and guidance, your body can heal itself. Another belief is that what creates symptoms in some people can, (when used in small doses) can treat an illness with similar symptoms by triggering your body's natural defenses. A simple example is using onions to treat allergies. Because onions make most peoples' eyes water, they can be used as a natural remedy to treat allergy symptoms, including watering eyes. Homeopathic doctors weaken these natural ingredients using alcohol or water before shaking the mixture. This process is called potentization and is meant to transfer the healing essence. Another belief of many homeopathic doctors is that the lower the dose of \"medicine\", the more powerful it is. Some remedies don't even contain a single molecule of the original substance. Most homeopathic medicine is administered using liquid drops, creams, sugar pellets, gels, and tablets. Doctors will ask a myriad of questions about your physical, mental, and emotional health. They'll then recommend a remedy that best matches your symptoms and craft a unique treatment plan. Homeopathy can treat a myriad of conditions including, but not limited to: - PMS (premenstrual syndrome) - IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) - Migraines - Depression - Allergies - Rheumatoid arthritis - Chronic fatigue syndrome - Insomnia Some doctors also use homeopathy for toothaches, coughs, colds, and to treat minor cuts and bruises. Homeopathic Remedies for Insomnia Over [70 million people](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_us.html#:~:text=About%2070%20million%20Americans%20suffer,costs%2C%20and%20lost%20work%20productivity.) suffer from some form of insomnia. Whether you're struggling to fall asleep or find yourself waking up repeatedly throughout the night, homeopathy may offer much-needed relief. The best approach to insomnia treatment includes consulting with a medical professional and using [CBT for insomnia](https://somnustherapy.com/cbt-for-insomnia-everything-you-need-to-know-2022-updated/) and other therapies. But that doesn't mean that homeopathic techniques can't be used as well to support your efforts. Here are some of the most popular forms of homeopathy for insomnia. Coffea Cruda Coffea cruda uses unroasted coffee beans to help relax the mind and promote sleep. This is a surprising approach to treating insomnia since most people associate coffee with being awake and alert. When potentized using homeopathic techniques, coffee (in small doses) can actually achieve the opposite results, providing relaxing benefits. Homeopathic doctors believe that coffee can ease a restless mind, slow down racing thoughts, and promote quality sleep. This technique can also calm an excited imagination and reduce the constant flow of information and ideas. Coffea cruda is a popular homeopathic treatment for anxiety-induced insomnia and is commonly used to soothe pain, [ADHD](https://somnustherapy.com/how-adhd-can-affect-insomnia/), headaches, and other forms of mental overactivity. Graphites This elixir is made using black lead and may help those who struggle to fall asleep and find themselves lying awake for hours at a time. It may also offer relief for sleep talkers and those who experience intense dreams or nightmares that cause you to wake up several times throughout the night. When you do finally fall asleep, it's not a deep restorative sleep but instead, a light sleep similar to when you nod off during an afternoon nap. A common side effect of this type of insomnia is daytime fatigue and the inability to focus. Some homeopathic theories claim that digestive issues and anxious thoughts may be to blame for your sleep troubles. This includes an upset stomach due to overeating or alcohol and tobacco use or ulcers. Graphites can also help balance your mood, reducing stress and irritability. Hyoscyamus Niger Nervousness and muscle twitches, like those associated with Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), can make it impossible to fall and stay asleep. If you're facing insomnia brought on by these symptoms, a homeopathic doctor might recommend hyoscyamus niger. This plant is also referred to as henbane, or stinking nightshade, and is poisonous in large doses. In small doses, however, it may reduce alertness, nervous thoughts, and muscle twitches. It's also commonly used in homeopathy to treat overactive children who experience frightening dreams, visions, or other fears. It may even ease teeth grinding at night and sleep-talking in some people. This homeopathic technique promotes drowsiness and can help users achieve deep sleep. Cocculus Indicus Cocculus is a form of medicine commonly used to [treat motion sickness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/cocculus). When discussed in relation to homeopathy, cocculus indicus is used to treat similar symptoms like headache, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and diarrhea. It's believed that this medicine can help ease the effects of long-term sleep deprivation in some people. Cocculus indicus is used to treat insomnia stemming from physical or mental exhaustion and in those who are plagued by constant worrying, especially about those they care about. If you feel perpetually worn out but not tired enough for sleep or experience inconsistent sleep patterns due to working night shifts, this homeopathy approach might help. Like other remedies on this list, cocculus indicus can also reduce the frequency of troubled or fearful dreams. Arsenicum Album Are you haunted by vivid dreams of danger including robbers, thieves, or someone breaking into your home? Homeopathy believes that Arsenicum album can help quell these worrisome thoughts and ease daytime drowsiness. It may also reduce the frequency of teeth-grinding, tossing and turning, muscle twitches, and overall agitation. The goal of this homeopathic technique is to deepen sleep and regulate your body temperature to prevent overheating during the night. It may also make it easier to fall asleep after waking. This remedy is prepared by diluting aqueous arsenic trioxide, which is an inorganic compound and medication often used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia. Valeriana Officinalis For those familiar with holistic medicine and healing, the inclusion of valerian on this list should come as no surprise. This herb, which is native to Europe and some parts of Asia, is commonly used to make sleep aids and medications for treating insomnia and other sleep disorders. Valeriana officinalis is widely recognized for its sedative and antispasmodic properties. All parts of the plant boast healing properties including the root, leaves, and stem. In homeopathy, doctors use this herb to reduce psychological stress and anxiety that may cause sleep troubles. Popular in tea and often produced in powder form, Valeriana officinalis has a bitter taste. Some patients report finding relief from muscle spasms and nightly itching. This homeopathic remedy may reduce tossing and turning and the frequency of confusing or disturbing dreams. Papaver Somniferum If without even realizing it! This flowering plant is more commonly referred to as opium poppy or bread seed poppy and comes from the Papaveraceae plant family. Both opium and poppy seeds are derived from this plant, making it a popular option in homeopathy and other holistic medical practices. Prescription opioids are used to treat chronic pain by blocking pain signals from the brain to the body. Unfortunately, these drugs come with [a high risk of addiction](https://medlineplus.gov/opioidmisuseandaddiction.html#:~:text=Some%20doctors%20prescribe%20them%20for,can%20lead%20to%20overdose%20deaths.) and dependency. Papaver somniferum offers a much safer alternative with some of the same healing benefits. Homeopathic doctors use this remedy to help treat light sleepers and those who experience extreme fluctuations in body temperature including hot flashes during menopause. If you find yourself nodding off at night while reading or performing other tasks but then unable to fall asleep once you get into bed, papaver somniferum might help. Once you finally do fall asleep, some people report struggling to wake up. The sleep you experience may be zombie-like, making it difficult to get out of bed in the morning. This homeopathic remedy can help improve sleep quality so you can wake to feel rested, energetic, and alert. Lachesis Another common homeopathic remedy for treating hot flashes associated with menopause, Lachesis is also used to relieve [menstrual and premenstrual symptoms (PMS)](https://somnustherapy.com/understanding-the-connection-between-pms-and-insomnia/), including cramps and bloating. Some patients also find relief from certain throat and mouth pain. In terms of sleep, by reducing the occurrence of hot flashes and easing pain and discomfort, you can fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. It's also a common remedy for those who never really achieve deep sleep but, instead, are light sleepers that wake easily, change sleeping positions frequently, and jerk awake in a frightened state. Homeopathic doctors believe Lachesis is especially beneficial for left-side sleepers and those who experience vivid dreams associated with feelings of suffocation or drowning. This may be a viable remedy for those who alternate between fits of insomnia and bouts of daytime drowsiness. Other symptoms include extreme alertness and talkativeness at night and extreme fatigue during the day, especially following a large meal. Some people are hesitant to use this remedy since it comes from the venom of the highly poisonous bushmaster snake. But keep in mind that the entire premise behind homeopathic medicine is to use a very small dose of a very strong and sometimes dangerous ingredient to kick-start the body's healing process. Risk Factors of Homeopathic Medicine As with any form of alternative medicine, homeopathy isn't without certain risks. These healing methods are not scientifically proven or approved, which means some people don't fully support their effectiveness and validity. Using homeopathy to treat insomnia and other ailments is a personal choice but one that should be made using all available information. One of the main reasons homeopathic medicine comes with risk is that some of the ingredients and items used to make these medicines, though heavily diluted, are still toxic in large doses. As previously mentioned, Lachesis comes from the venom of a poisonous snake. Arsenicum album is derived, partially, from the lethal chemical arsenic. Ingesting large quantities of these compounds could result in serious harm or even death. Milder symptoms include headaches, abdominal pain, nausea, damage to the liver or pancreas, and skin irritation. Serious potential side effects include kidney failure and seizures. To avoid these life-threatening side effects, always consult with a homeopathic expert before trying these treatment methods or ingesting any homeopathic medication. Never try to dilute and ingest lethal ingredients on your own. It's also important to speak to a medical professional or doctor before replacing your current treatment or medication plan with strictly homeopathic medicine. Homeopathy techniques are often used to support other forms of treatment. Abruptly stopping certain medications or going against your doctor's orders when treating serious illnesses could result in dangerous side effects. Support These Homeopathic Remedies with Good Sleep Hygiene On their own, these homeopathic remedies may bring much-needed relief to your sleep troubles and help ease triggers including pain, discomfort, negative thoughts, vivid dreams, and daytime drowsiness. A multi-faceted approach is best when treating any form of insomnia. Here are a few additional resources and tips for easing insomnia symptoms while also exploring homeopathic solutions. Follow a Consistent Sleep Schedule Many of the abovementioned remedies help ease daytime drowsiness followed by the inability to fall asleep at night. One way to regulate your inner sleep-wake cycle is to set a consistent sleep schedule. That means going to bed and waking at the same time every day including weekends, holidays, and while on vacation. This may sound daunting but before long, your body will adjust to this new schedule and you'll find yourself getting tired around the same time each night and waking naturally in the morning. Other positive side effects include deeper sleep, increased focus during the day, and waking to feel rested. Adopt a Healthy Lifestyle Living a healthy lifestyle is important for a myriad of reasons but when it comes to treating insomnia, eating a balanced diet and incorporating physical activity into your day are crucial. Exercise not only improves your mood, warding off depression, anxiety, and stress, but it helps you feel more tired at night. Physical activity paired with a healthy diet promotes a healthy weight, reducing your risk of obesity and other related ailments including heart disease, diabetes, and obstructive [sleep apnea](https://somnustherapy.com/sleep-apnea-vs-insomnia-the-differences-similarities-and-connections/). Because homeopathy surrounds natural, holistic medicine and works on the premise that your body is self-healing, the healthier you are the better your chances of finding relief from these remedies. Adopting a healthy lifestyle isn't just about the things you do but also about the unhealthy behaviors you avoid. Ditch unhealthy habits including smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol in excess, and eating large meals high in fat and sugar. All of these things can trigger nightmares and fitful sleep. Many homeopathic remedies are designed to reduce the frequency of troubling thoughts and dreams. By eliminating these unhealthy habits from your life, you're promoting the homeopathic healing process. Follow a Nightly Sleep Routine Everything you do leading up to bedtime impacts how well you sleep. In addition to adopting healthy habits, the tasks you perform before bed can either sabotage your sleep or help you fall and stay asleep. Support your homeopathy efforts by enjoying a hot cup of [valerian root tea](https://somnustherapy.com/how-to-use-valerian-root-for-sleep/) before bed. Not only is hot tea soothing, but this herb is known for its sedative properties. Chamomile tea is another option. Ease stress and promote relaxation by taking a bath or meditating at night. This can help ward off negative and plaguing thoughts that so many homeopathic techniques work to overcome. These ritualistic behaviors trigger your brain and body to prepare for sleep. In time, your body will naturally respond to these same actions by releasing [the sleep hormone melatonin](https://somnustherapy.com/falling-asleep-with-melatonin/). Be sure to keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and designed for sleep and sex only. Avoid bringing stimulating activities into bed or using digital devices up to 90 minutes before trying to go to sleep. The [blue light](https://somnustherapy.com/understanding-and-preventing-blue-light-insomnia/) from these screens can delay your brain's production of melatonin and make it increasingly difficult to drift to sleep.
