You represent governments, multinational institutions, nonprofit organizations and businesses. Indeed, you represent the public-private partnerships that will ensure that the work of this conference will become a powerful, ongoing global initiative. I want to salute Jim Wolfensohn for his visionary leadership and for recognizing the centrality of cultural heritage for the social and economic progress of people around the globe. Jim and I share a common commitment to this proposition, and I congratulate him on the World Bank's important contribution. I also want to welcome back to Washington my good friend, Elie Wiesel, who has given our world so much and who will provide this conference with his wise perspective. Under the theme \"honor the past and imagine the future,\" my husband and I have embarked on a millennial program for our nation that embodies the core principles of this conference. The importance of America's cultural heritage and its living, expression in our diversity, we believe, should help chart our nation's future well into the next century. In this era of globalization, it is more critical than ever to work to create a global community where diversity is a source of strength, not division, and where values relating to family, religion and the identities of peoples are respected. Connecting culture to the social and economic well being of people is an essential element in creating the kind of world we all seek. Much good work has been undertaken, and I applaud you for what you are doing. In the months ahead, I hope you will forge a concerted global commitment with partners from all sectors of society. For my part, I offer my wholehearted commitment to this objective and, although I regret that I cannot be with you today, I look forward to joining you at a future gathering that will build on the promise of this conference.

A WOMEN'S CREED We are female human beings poised on the edge of the new millennium. We are the majority of our species, yet we have dwelt in the shadows. We are invisible, the illiterate, the laborers, the refugees, the poor. And we vow: No more. We are the women who hunger-for rice, home, freedom, for each other and for ourselves. We are the women who thirst-for clean water and laughter, for literacy and for love. We have existed at all times, in every society. We have survived femicide. We have rebelled-and left clues. We are continuity, weaving future from past, logic with lyric. We are the women who stand in our sense, and shout YES. We are the women who wear broken bones, voices, minds, broken hearts- but we are the women who dare whisper NO. We are the women whose souls no fundamentalist cage can contain. We are the women who refuse to permit the sowing of death in our gar- dens, our air, our rivers and our seas. We are each precious, unique, necessary. We are strengthened and blessed and relieved at not having to all be the same. We are the daughters of longing. We are the mothers in labour to birth the politics of the 21st century. We are the women men warned us about. We are the women who know that all issues are ours, who will reclaim our wisdom, reinvent our tomorrow, question and redefine everything, especially power. We have worked now for decades to name the details of our need, rage, hope, vision. We have broken our silence and exhausted our patience. We are weary of listing refrains on our suffering-to entertain or sim- ply be ignored. We are done with vague words and waiting; famish- ing for action, dignity, joy. We intend to do more than merely endure and survive. They have tried to deny us, define us, defuse us, denounce us; to jail, en- slave, exile, gas, rape, beat, burn-and bore us. Yet nothing, not even the offer to save their failed system, can grasp us. For thousands of years, women have had responsibility without power- while too many men have had power without responsibility. We offer those men who risk being our brothers a balance, a future, a hand. But with or without them, we will go on. For we are the Old Ones, the New Breed, the Natives who came first but lasted, indigenous too an utterly different dimension. We are the girlchild in Zambia, the grandmother in Burma, the woman in El Sal- vador and Afghanistan, Finland and Fiji. We are the whale-song and rain forest; the depth-wave rising huge to shatter glass power on the shore; the lost and despised who, weeping, stagger into the light. The Contributions of Women in Culture and Sustainable Development 65 AU this we are. The people speaking-who no longer will wait and who cannot be stopped. We are poised on the edge of the millennium- ruin behind us, no map before us, the taste of fear sharp on our tongues. Yet we will leap. The exercise of imagining is an act of creation. The act of creation is an exercise of will. All this is political. All this is possible. Bread. A clean sky. Active peace. A women's voice singing somewhere, melody drifting like smoke from the cookfires. The army disbanded, the harvest abundant. The wound healed, the child wanted, the pris- oner freed, the body's integrity honored, the lover returned. The labor equal, fair and valued. No hand raised in any gesture but greeting. Secure interiors-of the heart, home, land-so firm as to make secure borders irrelevant at last. And everywhere laughter, care, celebration, dancing, contentment. A humble, earthly paradise in the now. We will make it real, make it our own, make policy, make history, make peace, make it available, make mischief, make a difference, make love, make the connections, make a miracle, make ready. Believe it, believe it. Oh, my friends, believe it. For we are the women who will transform the world. Written by Robin Morgan, in collaboration with Perdita egies Meeting, December 1994.
