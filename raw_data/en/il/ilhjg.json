Particularly, we find DIVI 's work interesting in the Contrast Media segment. While there is complexity associated with Iodine -based products, DIVI's strong chemistry skill set and experience in the Contrast Media space have enabled it to bring the Iohexol API to the validation phas e. We believe DIVI is well -placed to capitalize on the carotenoid opportunity, with a 21% sales CAGR to INR8b expected over FY20 -23. This would be driven by healthy demand, product offerings, integrated manufacturing, and the doubling of capacity. We conti nue to value DIVI at 36x 12M forward earnings to arrive at TP of INR4,530. We reiterate Buy, encouraged by promising demand prospects and multiple growth levers - a) new product additions, b) a strong chemistry skill set, c) efficient manufacturing capabil ities, d) scale -led advantage in legacy molecules, e) minimal financial leverage, and f) sufficient cash available for new projects. Iohexol - niche opportunity in Contrast Media space Contrast media agents have a market size of ~USD5b and are growing at a CAGR of 5-6%. Lower genericization and limited competition, coupled with DIVI's specialized chemistry capabilities, provide a reasonable business opportunity. With estimated final pro duct sales of USD500m for Iohexol (g -Omnipaque), we expect the Iohexal API US market size to be USD100 -120m. The genericization of Omnipaque may provide a potential upside of USD40 -50m for DIVI - post the successful validation and subsequent approval for i ts formulator customer. This is given the limited competition and DIVI's considerable experience in this space. Carotenoids - another limited -competition prospect for DIVI DIVI has fully integrated the Nutraceutical facility (Unit II) for the API / finished form of carotenoids. In fact, it has doubled its capacity over the past year and is well -positioned to benefit from the growing demand for carotenoids. Various factors augur well for our expectation of a 21% sales CAGR to INR8b over FY20 -23: a) the global market size for carotenoid products is USD1.5b and would increase at a CAGR of 4% over CY19 -26; b) DIVI has an exhaustive list of product offerings ; c) the company has a presence across the manufacturing value chain ; and d) capacity enhancement is seen in this space . Reiterate BUY DIVI has reported ~INR25b capex since FY18. This has been toward capacity additions as well as to increase backward integration. DIVI has also put up an additional investment of INR4b to fast -track the building of capacity in the CS segment. Considering enhanced product offerings and increased asset utilization, w e expect a 27% sales CAGR over FY20 -23. This, coupled with better operating leverage, would drive a 38% earnings CA GR over FY20 -23E. We continue to value DIVI at 36x 12M forward earnings and arrive Hegde, CFA (Bharat.Hegde@motilaloswal.com ) Investors are advised to refer through important disclosures made at the last page of the Research Report. Motilal Oswal research is available on www.motilaloswal.com/Institutional -Equities, Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, Factset and S&P Capital. Divi's Lab 24 March 2021 2 Iohexol - good opportunity in Contrast Media space DIVI is in the process of developing 16 new APIs to lead the next phase of growth. Particularly, Iohexol , which is under validation, is an interesting product. Given that it finds application in the Contrast Media space and has only three DMF filers to date, it offers reasonable business opportunity for DIVI. However, this is subject to a) the completion of the validation, b) the DMF filing, and c) the subsequent ANDA approval for the formulator to use the API provided by DIVI. With estimated final product sales of USD500m for Iohexol (g -Omnipaque), we expect the Iohexal API US market size to be USD100 -120m. The genericization of Omnipaque may provide a potential upside of USD40 -50m for DIVI given the limited competition and DIVI's considerable experience in this space. DIVI is in the process of enhancing its generic API offerings: DIVI is in the process of developing 16 new APIs to lead the next phase of growth. Currently, it has around 30 products in its Generic API portfolio. It is among the Top 2 producers in 18 of the 30 APIs in its generic API offerings. Exhibit 1: 16 Generic API products under various stages of development Product Therapeutic category Development stage Ranolazine Anti-Anginal Validations completed and planning to file DMF Validations completed and Nicotine Aid Sample Anti-HIV Sample Available , Company Validations have been completed on three APIs and the company is preparing for the DMF filings. Three are under validation, seven have samples available, and three are in the early stage of development. DIVI - well -placed to (Iopamidol), and Visipaque (Iodixanol) are the major products in the Iodine -based Imaging Agents category. Despite these being old products, there are no generics for these products in the US. Particularly, GE Healthcare's Omnip aque is the biggest product in the Contrast Media Agents category, with an estimated USD500m in annual sales in the US. Divi's Lab 24 March 2021 3 Impurities - a major hurdle in scaling up Iodine -based products such as Iohexol Iodine -based drug substances are difficult to manufactu re due to impurities that get introduced during the large -scale manufacturing process. In particular, o - alkylated derivatives are difficult impurities that get introduced during the Iohexol manufacturing process. Continuous purification is required at each step to avoid impurities. Intermediates in the manufacturing process have the tendency to absorb moisture from the atmosphere. Compounds used in contrast media products are aqueous in nature and difficult to crystallize.

Accordingly, we expect DIVI's API sales to be USD40 -50m from this opportunity, post approval for its formulation customer . Enhanced diagnosis favors higher use of contrast media agents Contrast media agents are used in imaging tests such as CT scans, MRI scans , and x -rays. They are administered predominantly either orally or through injection. Contrast agents are used in diagnosing cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nephrologica l disorders. They are also used in diagnosing cancers. The market for contrast media agents is categorized by use in a) agents used in x-rays (and CT scans) and b) those used in MRI scans. Iodine -based products dominate the X -ray Imaging market, while the MRI market is dominated by Gadolinium -based agents. Contrast media agents have a USD5 -6b market size and are growing at 3 -4% annually. Contrast agents used in x -rays form 80% of the total Contrast Media market, while MRI agents form the remaining 20%. The US is estimated to be the biggest market for contrast media agents, followed by Japan and Europe. Divi's Lab 24 March 2021 4 Exhibit 3: 3-4% CAGR expected over 2019 -29 for Contrast Media industry Source: MOFSL , Industry Advancement in diagnostic procedures using imaging and rising instances of cancer and cardiac diseases are the key factors driving these products. As advancement in imaging technique demands more complex imaging technique, MRI-based procedures are also increasing at a faster rate than x -ray / CT scan based procedures . Based on this, and a lower base, Gadolinium -based imaging agents are growing at a faster rate of 5 -6% per year. X -ray / CT scan based imaging agents are more mature and growing at a rate of 2 -3% per year. Iodine -based imaging agents are used in more than 60% of the total 30m imaging procedures conducted in the US per year - with a market size of USD1.5b in the US. There are no generic products in the US for these products. However, generics have a presence in other geographies. For example, Nitigraf, a g eneric Iohexol, is approved in Europe. Assuming blended API cost of 10 -20%, the Iodine -based Contrast Media API market size is estimated to be USD800m 24 March 5 Carotenoids - another niche opportunity for DIVI DIVI has doubled its capacity and is geared up t o benefit from the growing demand for carotenoids. The global Carotenoid market is estimated to be ~USD1.5b and post a CAGR of ~4% over Canthaxahnthin, and Lutein) and complete integration of manufacturing bode well for market share gains in this limited -competition opportunity. DIVI's added capacity to improve sales momentum in Carotenoids segment DIVI doubled its revenue to INR4.4b (8% of sales) in the Carotenoid s business over FY18 -20 and delivered 22% YoY growth in 9MFY21. Over the past year, DIVI has enhanced its capacity by 100% on successful qualification from its customers. Exhibit 4: We expect carotenoid sales CAGR MOFSL , Company Favorable demand drivers, limited competition provide better prospects for carotenoid manufacturers The global Carotenoid market size is ~USD1.5b and would post a 4.2% CAGR over the next 7 years to reach USD2b in CY26. Synthetic carotenoids form ~70% of the global Carotenoid market. Exhibit 5: market to reach USD2b in 2026 Source: MOFSL , Europe 40% Others 10% Carotenoid estimate sales split (2019) Divi's Lab 24 March 2021 6 Carotenoids are mainly used as food coloring in the Food and Beverage segment and dietary supplement s in human and animal food s. Animals cannot produce carotenoids and hence these are added to their feed to provide immunity from diseases. They also provide color to food derived from animals , such as poultry/eggs, fish , and shrimp. The Animal Feed industry accounts for ~40% of all carotenoid sales , the F ood and Beverage industry accounts for 20% , and Dietary Supplements account s for ~5% of all sales. The use of carotenoids in human dietary supplements is one of the main drivers of in creased uptake. Developed countries, especially the US, are focusing on preventive healthcare owing to their high cost and faster growth of healthcare spending. Astaxanthin is an antioxidant and can help in preventing aging and diseases such as Alzheimer's , eye diseases , etc. Lutein is also sometimes referred to as an 'eye vitamin' owing to its use in preventing eye diseases, especially in seniors. Canthaxanthin is known to be used by people with a genetic disease called erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) to reduce sensitivity to the eyes. Beta carot ene is converted by the body into Vitamin A, which is need ed for healthy skin, immune system , and good vision. Beta carotene is also used to prevent certain cancers, heart diseases, and cataract , among others. Lycopene has been linked to improved health, including better heart health, protection from sunburn , and prevention of certain cancers. Astaxanthin is currently the biggest carotenoid in terms of sales by value, with USD600m+ estimated in 2019 sales global ly. Lutein is the fastest growing carotenoid - it posted a ~6.5% CAGR on a base of ~USD300m (2019). Exhibit 7: Astaxanthin the biggest product category, while Lutein the fastest growing Carotenoid Est.

D IVI is backward integrated for the production of API and finished form s of carotenoid, with a full-fledged R&D, application testing , and support facility under one roof at the Unit II facility. Its competitors produce APIs and finished forms at different locations ; hence, they have a higher cost profile. Expect 21% sales CAG R for DIVI in Carotenoids business over -23 DIVI has garnered INR5.2b over the past 12M in this segment, with 95% coming from the US and Europe. Given that customer validation is in place, capacity enhancements are already done, and it has a presence across the manufacturing value chain, we expect DIVI to deliver a 21% sales CAGR in this segment over FY20 -23. Divi's Lab 24 March 2021 7 Valuation and view New offering and market share gains to drive API segment DIVI is well -positioned to add new products and scale up existing products. It is making significant investments not only in terms of capex but also in chemistry - led process improvements. These technology -driven improvements enable DIVI to lower costs in e xisting products to achieve better margin s and lower waste. As DIVI is a large -volume player, process improvements are driving substantial margin expansion. Its next leg of growth is expected to come from the 16 new molecules it is currently working on and market share gains from already commercialized APIs. Strong chemistry skill sets, trust among innovators to drive CS business DIVI has built its CRAMS business based on its long -standing relationships with big pharma companies. It has a long -standing relationship with 6 of the top 10 pharma innovators. The global C ontract Research and Manufacturing Services (CRAMS) business is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9% over 2019 -23 on new investments in R&D (as patent drugs lose their exclusivity) and increased demand for prescription drugs. Global spending on medicine reached USD1.3t in CY19 and is expected to post a 4-5% CAGR to USD1.5t over CY19-23E. With its low cost, strong chemistry skill sets, continuous process improvement, and compliance record, DIVI expects to maintain a strong position in the CRAMS segment . Big pharma companies have reduced their own API ma nufacturing and are increasingly looking to outsource their requirements for APIs. DIVI's strong technical capabilities, large team of 350 R&D scientists, scale of commercial manufacturing, and level of regulatory compliance bode well for business growth. Its ability to manufacture products ranging from a few kilograms to thousands of tons makes it a preferred partner for all types of global pharma companies. Capex benefits kicking in; to see meaningful benefit over medium term DIVI has posted ~INR25b cape x since FY18. The increase in sales seen currently has been driven by increased volumes from these facilities. The recently commercialized DC-SEZ and DCV -SEZ units have started contributing to revenues. It has also included backward integration projects, w hich would aid margin expansion . It has INR5b in CWIP currently and would complete this capex phase by FY21. DIVI has also made an additional investment of INR4b to fast -track the building of capacity in the CS segment. Meaningful commercial benefit from the same is expected from FY22. Well -positioned to deliver strong earnings CAGR over next two years We expect a 38% earnings CAGR over FY20 -23E, led by increased business prospects from CS and Generics, new product additions over the near term, and ~930bp margin expansion on better operating leverage. Divi's Lab 24 March 2021 8 We continue to value DIVI at 36x 12M forward earnings to arrive at TP of INR4,530. We reiterate BUY, supported by promising demand prospects and multiple growth levers - new product additions, strong chemist ry skill sets, efficient manufacturing capabilities, scale -led advantage in legacy molecules, minimal financial leverage , and sufficient cash available for new projects .
