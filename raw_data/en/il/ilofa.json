When I learned that Dr. Wang knew how to open the gates in the body, I was willing to give a try. After the car accident happened in February 2017, I had a severe headache and could not sleep in the night. I went to Stanford Emergency Care, seeing the doctors in Stanford Emergency Department, my primary doctor, and the doctors in Stanford Concussion Clinic. They could not find the reasons causing the headache. The only medicine I received was Tylenol. From February to April, I took 42 pills of Tylenol and 11 pills of Motrin. But it only temporarily relieved the pain. The doctor in the Concussion Clinic gave me a referral form so I could find a therapist near me. But the Therapist canceled the appointment the day before the appointment because the approval from my medical insurance was not received. My work requires a lot of brain thinking which caused a constant severe headache. I became nervous in the day and was not able to concentrate while I was working. I was afraid of the symptoms I had: severe headache, insomnia, depression, and lower back pain caused by the car accident. I heard a friend recently had a car accident and his headache was cured in the University of East-West Medicine. That was why I came to University of East-West Medicine. I was glad that I met Dr. Wang on April 19, 2017. Dr. Wang checked my neck and said that I need to have an X-ray on the neck and spine because the blood circulation in the head was not smooth. He said that I looked very depressed. With Dr. Wang's referral, I took X-Ray in Image Center. The report of the X-Ray says \"Hyper-mobility on extension at the C3/4 level...\" The X-ray report indicated that my spine cord at C3/4 had shifted 2mm which caused headache. On April 21 I brought the X-Ray report and CD of the X-Ray to Dr. Wang. Since then I visited Dr. Wang three times a week for a few weeks. After that I received treatment twice a week. He gave me acupuncture, hot Chinese medicine bag, massage, and opening the body gates. I started to join Chi Gong class. From Chi Gong class, I learned Herguan quantum glorious universe and the beauty of the harmony between universe and human body. How the energy of the universe can come into human body and drives away the pains and diseases after the body gates are opened. Every night before I go to bed I practiced 30 minutes Chi Gong that Dr. Wang taught in the class. I was able to sleep deeply in the night since I practiced Chi Gong. I stopped taking Tylenol and Motrin. I noticed that after three weeks treatment my walking steps were faster than before. The energy came back to my body. I was able to smile naturally. The most important was my headache reduced from level 7-8 to level 2-3. I was able to concentrate when I was working. After a five months treatments, the pain in the head was under the control. Depression and lower back pain disappeared. Dr. Wang noticed that my blood pressure was high since the first day I came to the clinic. (My blood pressure was normal before the car accident.) After one month treatment from Dr. Wang, the blood pressure became normal. To my surprise was my headache had a big improvement since then. I felt no more sharp pain in the head. The intern students in the University of East West Medicine are kind and care the patients. I am impressed for their professional attitude, knowledge, diligent, and eager to learn. "}
