Report on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Northwell Health, Inc. and its member corporations and other affiliated entities (collectively, Northwell), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 201 9 and 201 8, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. Management 's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor 's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consol idated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor 's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity 's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstance s, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Northwell Health, Inc. and its member corporations and other affiliated entities as of December 31, 201 9 and 20 18, and the consolidated results of its operations, changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. Supplementary Information Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. We have not performed any procedures with respect to the audited consolidated financial statements subsequent to April 29, 2020. The accompanying Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards for the year ended December 31, 201 9, as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the consolidated financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the consolidated financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements or to the consolidated financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we also have issued our report dated April 29, 2020 on our consideration of Northwell 's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of Northwell 's internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Audit ing Standards in considering Northwell 's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 91. Organization and Principles of Consolidation (continued) Certain members of Northwell (the Obligated Group) are jointly and severally liable for obligations under bond indentures (see Note 8). The Obligated Group consists of HCI, NSUH, LIJMC, Staten Island, and Stern. Northwell maintains a controlling ownership in vari ous entities, whose results of operations are included in the accompanying consolidated financ ial statements. Northwell's non-controlling interest in these entities at December 31, 2019 an d 2018 is immaterial, both individually and in the aggregate, to Northwell's net assets and excess of revenue and gains and losses over expenses, as reported in the accompanying conso lidated financial statements. Northwell has an 8% ownership interest in Optum360, LLC (Optum360) which is accounted for using the equity method of acc ounting. Under the ag reement, Optum360 pr ovides revenue cycle services for most of Northwell's hosp itals. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, $144,661 and $137,104, respectively, is reported within long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position fo r this investment. Northwell incurred fees of $175,752 and $195,305 to Optum360 for revenue cycle services for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Acquisitions On January 1, 2018 (the Acquisition Date), No rthwell acquired Mather, a 248-bed not-for-profit community teaching hospital located in Port Jeff erson, New York, and its affiliated professional corporation. Northwell acquired Mather by m eans of an inherent contribution where no consideration was transferred by Northwell. Nort hwell accounted for the business combination by applying the acquisition method and, accordingly, the inherent contri bution is valued as the excess of the fair value of assets acquired over the fair value of liabilities assumed. In determining the inherent contribution received, all assets and liabili ties were measured at th e fair value as of the Acquisition Date. The results of Mather's operati ons have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the Ac quisition Date. Mather is not a member of the Obligated Group. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 101.

Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 111. Organization and Principles of Consolidation (continued) The following table summarizes am ounts attributable to Mather from the Acquisiti on Date through December 31, 2018 that are included in the accompanying 2018 consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets: Year Ended December 31, 2018 Total operating revenue $ 376,577 Total operating expenses 372,052 Excess of operating revenue over operating expenses 4,525 Total non-operating gains and losses 1,935 Excess of revenue and gains and losses over expenses $ 6,460 Change in net assets: Net assets without donor restrictions $ 3,637 Net assets with donor restrictions (824) Total change in net assets $ 2,813 In addition to the Mather acquisition, during 2019 and 2018, Northwell acq uired various physician practices. These acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations. Assets acquired during 2018 were approximately $100,000. Incremental revenue recorded in 2018 attributable to these entities acquired during 2018 was approximately $80,000. Ac quisitions during 2019 were not significant. Health Insurance Companies In July 2017, North Shore-LIJ Health Plan Inc. (Health Plan) filed a term ination plan which was approved by the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) in September 2017. Health Plan ceased new enrollment in its Medicaid Mana ged Long-Term Care Plan and, by January 2018, had transitioned its existing members to other pl ans. Northwell expects the wind down of Health Plan's operations to be completed during 2020. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 121. Organization and Principles of Consolidation (continued) In August 2017, Northwell announced that it would wind down CareConnect Insurance Company Inc. (CareConnect) and withdraw from New York State's insurance markets. The New York State Department of Financial Servic es approved CareConnect's plan which allowed CareConnect to stop writing and renewing annual large and sm all group policies effective December 1, 2017 and individual policies effective Ja nuary 1, 2018. Northwell expects the wind down of CareConnect's operations to be substan tially completed during 2020. As a result of Northwell's decision to exit the health insurance business, the net operating results of CareConnect and Health Plan (collectively, the Health Insurance Companies) are separately reported within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Consolidated Statements of Operations The accompanying consolidated statements of operations include the excess of revenue and gains and losses over expenses as the performance indi cator. For purposes of display, transactions deemed by management to be ongoing, major or cen tral to the provision of health care services are reported as operating revenue a nd operating expenses; peripheral or incidental transactions and unusual, nonrecurring items are reported as non-operating gains and losses. Net assets released from restrictions for capital asset acquisitions, the cha nge in fair value of interest rate swap agreements de signated as cash flow hedges, pension and other postretirement liability adjustments and other changes in net assets are excluded from Northwell's performance indicator. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 132. Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies (continued) Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . Under ASU 2016-01, certain investments in limited partnerships and similar entities that are accounted for at cost, less impairment, are now recorded at fair value. The standard also allows entities that are not public business enti ties, among other things, to no longer disclose the fair value and significan t assumptions used to estimate th e fair value of certain financial instruments carried at amortized cost. The adoptio n of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize the rights and oblig ations arising from both finance lease contracts (formerly referred to as capital leases) and operating lease contracts as a ssets and liabilities on the statement of financial position. The accounting for finance leases remains substantially unc hanged as a result of adoption. Lessors in operating leases continue to recogni ze the underlying asset a nd recognize lease income on either a straight-line basis or another systematic and rationa l basis. Northwell adopted ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019, fo llowing the modified retrospectiv e method of application. As such, the 2018 consolidated financial statement am ounts and disclosures ha ve not been adjusted to reflect the provisions of the new standard. The standard did not materially impact Northwell's consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. Northwell has made the transitio n-specific election to apply the package of practical expedients which allows for the carryfo rward of historical asse ssments of (i) whether contracts are or contain leases, (ii) the lease classification and (iii) in itial direct cost s. Certain other accounting policy elections and quan titative and qualitative informa tion pertaining to Northwell's adoption of ASU 2016-02 are described in Note 7. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 142. Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies (continued) In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash , which requires that the statement of cash flows ex plain the change during th e period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restri cted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Northwell adopted ASU 2016-18 eff ective December 31, 20 19. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents included in assets limited as to use (see Note 4) should be included with cash and cash equivalents (including the amounts in the investment portfolio) when reconciling th e beginning-of-period an d end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. Northwell ha s adopted ASU 2016-18 using a retrospective transition method, and as such, certa in reclassifications we re made to 2018 amounts previously reported on the consolid ated statement of cash flows. In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-08, Clarifying the Scope and Accounting Guidance for Contributions Received and Contributions Made , which clarifies existing guidance in order to address diversity in practice in classifying grants (including gove rnmental grants) and contracts received by not-for-profit entiti es. The standard also clarifies the guidance on how entities determine when a contributi on is conditional. Northwell adopted ASU 2018-08 effective January 1, 2019. The impact of the adoption of ASU 2018-08 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The new credit losses standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets a nd certain other instrument s. For trade and other receivables, contract assets recogni zed as a result of applying ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , loans and certain other instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward look ing \"expected loss\" model that ge nerally will result in earlier recognition of credit loss es than under today's incurred loss m odel. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after D ecember 15, 2022. Northwell has not completed the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on its co nsolidated financial statements. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 152. Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies (continued) Use of Estimates The preparation of financial st atements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, includi ng accounts receivable fo r services to patients, and liabilities, including accounts payable and accrued expenses, estimated payables to third-party payers, accrued retirement benefits and malpract ice and other insurance liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financ ial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual re sults could differ from those estimates. During 2019 and 2018, Northwell revised certain esti mates made in prior years to reflect the passage of time and the availability of more rece nt information. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the net change in estimates re lated to prior years was not significant. Cash and Cash Equivalents Northwell classifies all highly li quid financial instruments purchas ed with a maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. Northwell maintains cash on deposit with major banks and invests in money market securi ties with financial institutions which exceed federally-insured limits. Management believes the credit risk relate d to these deposits is minimal. Northwell does not hold any money market funds with significant liquidity rest rictions that woul d be required to be excluded from cash equivalents. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 162. Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies (continued) Cash and cash equivalents (unrestricted and re stricted), as reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, are reported within the following categories in the accompanying consolidated statements of fina ncial position as of December 31, 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 535,619 $ 538,964 Short and lon g-term investments 443,634 422,682 $ 979,253 $ 961,646 Pledges Receivable Pledges (promises to give), less an allowan ce for uncollectible amounts, are recorded as receivables in the year made at net present value and ar e recorded as additions to net assets with donor restrictions. Pledges receivable that are due more than one year from the st atement of financial position date are disc ounted to reflect the present value of future cash flows. Investments Short-term and long-term invest ments include marketable securi ties and other investments. Marketable securities are classifi ed as trading securities. Investme nts in debt secu rities, equity securities and mutual funds with readily determinable fair values are reported at fair value, based on quoted market prices. Northwell has also invested in alternative investments, incl uding funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and private real esta te funds. These other inve stments are not readily marketable and are reported under the equity me thod of accounting. The equity method reflects Northwell's share of the net asse t value of the respective funds. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 172. Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies (continued) Individual investment holdings of the funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and private real estate funds may include invest ments in both nonmarketable and market-traded securities. Valuations of these investments, and therefore Northwe ll's holdings, may be determined by the investment managers or gene ral partners. Values may be based on estimates that require varying degrees of judgment. Recorded estimates may change by a material amount in the near term. The investments may indirectly e xpose Northwell to securiti es lending, short sales of securities and trading in fu tures and forwards cont racts, options and other derivative products. However, Northwell's risk is limited to its amounts invested . At December 31, 2019, Northwell has future commitmen ts of $137,435 and $17,666 to i nvest in private equity and private real estate funds for pension and restri cted assets, respectively. Other investments also include non-controlling inte rests in non-clinical joint ventures held by Northwell for investment purposes. Such invest ments are accounted for under the equity method or at cost less any impairment, adjusted for observable price cha nges for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (Adjusted Cost). Northwell is also invested in commingled fi xed income, equity and risk-parity funds. The underlying investment holdings of the commingled funds are predominantly marketable securities. These investments are reported eith er at fair value based on quoted market prices, if their fair values are readily determinable, or under the eq uity method of accounting, which approximates fair value. The equity method reflects Northwell's share of the net asset value of these investments. The financial statements of the alternative inve stments and commingled fi xed income, equity and risk-parity funds noted above are audited annually by independent auditors, although the timing for reporting the results of such audits for cert ain investments does not co incide with Northwell's annual financial statement reporting. Included in investments are assets limited as to use, which incl ude funds held pursuant to debt financing arrangements, management designat ed funds (including management designated malpractice and other self-insur ance assets), deferred employee compensation plan assets and donor restricted assets. Amounts re quired to meet current liabilit ies are reported as short-term investments. Northwell has future commitment s of approximately $162,000 at December 31, 2019 to purchase additional investments incl uded in assets limited as to use. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 182. Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies (continued) Investment income (including realized gains an d losses on investments, interest and dividends) and the change in net unrealized gains and losses and change in va lue of equity method investments are included in the performance indicator, unless th e income or loss is restricted by donor or law. Interest and dividend income earned on Northwel l's internally designated malpractice and other self-insurance assets is record ed in other operating revenue. Inventory of Supplies Inventory, included in other current assets, is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Insurance Claims Receivable and Liability For medical malpractice and similar contingent liabilities, Northwell determines such claims liabilities without considerati on of insurance recove ries. Accordingly, Northwell recognizes insurance receivables at th e same time that it recognizes the lia bilities, measured on the same basis as the liabilities, subject to the need for a va luation allowance for uncollectible amounts in the accompanying consolidated statements of fina ncial position. Such amounts represent the actuarially determined present va lue of medical malpractice and ot her claims that are anticipated to be covered by insurance, di scounted at a rate of 2.0%. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or, in the case of gifts, at fair value at the date of the gift, less accumulated depreciation and amor tization. Property, plant and equipment from acquired entities that existed at their respective acquisition dates was recorded at fair value based upon an independent valuation. Depreciation and amortization of land im provements, buildings, fixed equipment and major movable equipment is computed by the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the asse ts, ranging from thr ee to forty years. Equipment under finance lease obl igations and leasehold improve ments are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. Such amortization is included in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 192. Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies (continued) During the period of construction of capital assets, interest costs are capita lized as a component of the cost of assets. When assets are disposed of, the carrying amount s of the assets and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss on disposal is included in the perf ormance indicator. When assets become fully depreciated, the carrying amounts of such assets and the relate d accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts (see Note 6). Long-Lived Assets Gifts of long-lived assets are reported at fair valu e established at the date of contribution as changes in net assets without do nor restrictions, excluded from the perfo rmance indicator, unless explicit donor stipulations specify how th e donated asset must be used. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovera ble. If long-lived assets are deemed to be impaired, the impa irment to be recognized is meas ured as the amoun t by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying am ount or the fair value, less costs to sell. Other Assets Other assets included in the accompanying consolid ated statements of financial position primarily consist of goodwill, other intangible assets and investments in clinical joint ventures. In connection with various acquisitions, Northw ell has recognized certa in indefinite-lived intangible assets totaling approximately $243,000 and $241,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The intangible assets are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Northwell determined th at there has been no impairment of these intangible assets. Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs, included in long-term debt and finance l ease obligations, represent costs incurred to obtain financing for various Northwe ll projects and initiatives. Amortization of these costs is provided over the term of the applicable indebtedness. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 202. Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies (continued) Interest Rate Swap Agreements Interest rate swap agreements are reported at fair value. Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on current and projected in terest rates with consideration of the risk of non-performance. Changes in fair value of interest rate sw ap agreements designated as derivative instruments are recognized in Northwel l's performance indicator. Changes in fair value of interest rate swap agreements designate d as cash flow hedges are excluded from the performance indicator. Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities includ ed in the ac companying consolidated statements of financial position primarily consist of the long-term portion of estimated payables to third-party payers, the long-term portion of expected payment obligati ons, deferred revenue and the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements. Classification of Net Assets Northwell separately accounts for and reports net assets without donor restrictions and net assets with donor restrictions. Net assets without donor restrictions incl ude resources th at the governing board may use for any designated purpose and res ources whose use is limited by an agreement between Northwell and an outside party other th an the donor or grantor. Net assets with donor restrictions are those whose use by Northwell has been limited by donors to a specific time period or purpose. When donor restricti ons expire, that is, when a tim e restriction ends or a purpose restriction is accomplished, these ne t assets are reclassified to net assets without donor restrictions and reported as net assets re leased from restrictions. Certain net assets with donor rest rictions have been restricted by donors to be maintained in perpetuity. Income from these net assets is avai lable to support certain teaching, research and training programs. Northwell also recognizes governmental grants where commensurate value is not exchanged as contributions when conditions and restrictions ar e satisfied and reports such amounts within other operating revenue or net assets released from re strictions for capital a sset acquisitions in the consolidated statements of operations. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 212. Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies (continued) Donor Gifts Gifts of cash and other assets, including unconditional promises to give cash and other assets (pledges), are reported at fair value when the gift is received (or promise is made). Donor-restricted contributions whose restrictions are met within the same year as received are classified as contributions without donor restrictions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Northwell receives conditional pledges, which ar e not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The conditi onal pledges primarily relate to the establishment of certain programs. As the conditions of the pledges are me t, the pledges are recognized. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, $70,120 and $48,083, respectively, of conditional pledges have not been recognized in the consolidated st atements of financial position. Contributions and pledges raised through fundrai sing efforts for the ye ars ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows: 2019 2018 Without donor re strictions $ 5,130 $ 2,478 With donor restrictions 87,680 99,942 $ 92,810 $ 102,420 Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 222. Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies (continued) Functional Expenses Northwell provides health care services to re sidents primarily within its geographic areas. Expenses related to providing these services pertain to the followi ng functional and natural categories for the years ende d December 31, 2019 and 2018: 2019 Health Care Services Research General and Administrative Total Salaries $ 5,629,582 $ 75,551 $ 705,670 $ 6,410,803 $ 1,506,952 $ 12,308,960 2018 Health Care Services Research General and Administrative Total Salaries $ 5,161,998 $ 72,214 $ 617,738 $ 5,851,950 $ 1,294,303 $ 11,350,897 The accompanying consolidated financial statements report expense categories that are attributable to more than one health care se rvice or support functi on. Costs not directly attributable to a function are allocated on a functional basis based on internal records and estimates. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 232. Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies (continued) Gain on Sale of Property As a result of a prior year donation, Northwell held ti tle to a remainder interest in a property located in Brea, California. In June 2018, the property was sold and Northwell recognized a $65,723 gain on sale of property for its share of the sale proceeds received. Tax Status Certain entities included in Nort hwell's consolidated financial st atements are taxable entities under Federal or state laws. U.S. generally accepted acc ounting principles require that the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes be utilized by these organizations and for unrelated business activities of the tax-exempt entities included in Northwell's consolidated financial statements. Under the asset and li ability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differenc es by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statem ent carrying amounts and th e tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Northwell has a deferred tax asset of approximately $112,000 and $118,000, respectively, both of which have been fully offset by a relate d valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be real ized. Significant components of th e deferred tax as set relate to net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards. Certain en tities have NOL carry forwards aggregating approximately $540,000 at Decemb er 31, 2019. NOL carryforwards generated prior to 2018 will expire in varying amounts through 2037 and are available to offset future taxable income of the respective entity. NOLs generated after 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but with limitations. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have b een made to the amounts previously reported in the 2018 functional expense and fair value disclosure s reported above in Note 2 and in Note 9 to conform with the 2019 presentation. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 243. Accounts Receivable and Patient Revenue Net patient service revenue and physician practice revenue (colle ctively, Patient Revenue) are reported at the amount that reflects the consideration to which Nort hwell expects to be entitled in exchange for providing patient care. These amount s are due from patients a nd third-party payers (including health insurers and government program s) and include various elements of variable consideration in determin ing a transaction price. Northwell uses a portfolio approach to account fo r categories of patient c ontracts as a collective group, rather than recognizing revenue on an indi vidual contract basis. Th e portfolios consist of major payer classes for Patient Revenue. Based on historical collection trends and other analyses, Northwell believes that revenue recognized by u tilizing the portfolio approach approximates the revenue that would have been recognized if an individual contract approach was used. Northwell's initial estimate of the transaction pri ce for services provided to patients subject to revenue recognition is determined by reducing the total standard charges related to the patient services provided by various elements of vari able consideration, including contractual adjustments, discounts, implicit price concession s and other reductions to Northwell's standard charges. Northwell determines th e transaction price associated with services provided to patients who have third-party payer cove rage on the basis of contractua l rates, governme ntal rates or established charges for the services rendered. The estimates for contractual allowances and discounts are based on contract ual agreements, Northwell's di scount policies and historical experience. For uninsured patien ts who are ineligib le for any government assistance program, Northwell provides services without charge or at amounts less than its established rates for patients who meet the criteria of its charity care polic y. Because Northwell does not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as ch arity care, such services are not reported as Patient Revenue. For uninsured and under-insured patients who do not qualify for charity care, Northwell determines the transaction price associated with services on the basis of charges reduced by implicit price concessions. Implicit price concessi ons included in the estimate of the transaction price are based on Northwell's historical collecti on experience for applicab le patient portfolios. Generally, Northwell bills patients and third-part y payers several days after the services are performed and/or the patient is discharged. Patient Revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. Performance obligations are determined based on the nature of the services provided by Northwell. Patient Reve nue for performance obligat ions satisfied over time is recognized based on actual charges incurred in relation to total charges. Northwell believes that this method provides a reasonable depiction of th e transfer of services over the term of the performance obligation based on the services needed to satisfy the obligation. Generally, Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 253. Accounts Receivable and Patient Revenue (continued) performance obligations satisfied over time relate to patients receiving inpatient acute care services or patients receiving services in Northwell's outpatient and ambulatory care centers. Northwell measures the performance obligation from admission into the hospital or the commencement of an outpatient or physician service to the point when it is no longer required to pr ovide services to that patient, which is generally at the time of discha rge or the completion of the outpatient or physician visit. Substantially all of Northwell's performance obligati ons relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year; the unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations referred to below are primarily related to inpatient acute care servi ces at the end of the repo rting period for patients who remain admitted at that time (in-house patien ts). As such, accounts receivable related to in- house patients are considered contract assets as the performance obligation is not completed until the patients are discharged, which for the majority of the in-house patients occur within days or weeks after the end of the reporting period and at which point Northwell has the right to bill. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, account s receivable for services to patients, net is comprised of the following components: 2019 2018 Receivables for serv ices to patients $ 1,203,722 $ 1,057,798 Contract in-house patients) 81,820 72,527 $ 1,285,542 $ 1,130,325 Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transa ction price (determined on a portfolio basis when applicable) are generally recorded as adjustments to Patient Revenue in the period of the change. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, changes in Northwell's estimates of implicit price concessions, discounts, cont ractual adjustments or other reductions to expected payments for performance obligations satisfied in prior years we re not significant. Portfolio collection estimates are updated periodically based on collection trends. Subsequent chan ges that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the patient's ab ility to pay (determined on a portfolio basis when applicable) are recorded as bad debt expens e in supplies and expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Bad debt expense and the related allowance for uncollectible accounts as of and for the years ended and as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not significant. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 263. Accounts Receivable and Patient Revenue (continued) Northwell has determined that the nature, amo unt, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are primarily affected by it s mix of payers and services. Patient Revenue for the years ended December 31 , 2019 and 2018, by payer, is approximately as follows: 2019 2018 Medicare and Medicare mana ged care $ 3,785,000 $ 3,598,000 Medicaid and Medicaid mana ged copayments and coinsurance under third-party payment programs which are the patient's responsibility are included with in the appropriate payer category above. Patient Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, disaggregated by lines of service, is as follows: 2019 2018 Net patient service revenue: Hospitals $ 9,241,342 $ 8,512,094 Joint venture ambulator y surgery centers 69,430 Stern 8,762,122 Physician practice revenue 2,093,076 1,854,861 Total Patient Revenue $ 11,593,335 $ 10,616,983 Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 273. Accounts Receivable and Patient Revenue (continued) Third-Party Payment Programs Northwell has agreements with third-party payers that provide for payment for services rendered at amounts different from its esta blished charges. A summary of the payment arrangements with major third-party payers follows: Non-Medicare In New York State, hospitals and all non-Medica re payers (including Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans), except Medicaid, work ers' compensation and no-fault insurance programs, negotiate payment rates. If negotiated rates are not esta blished, payers are billed at hospitals' established charges. Medicaid, wo rkers' compensation and no-fault payers pay hospital rates promulgated by the NYSDOH. Payments to hospitals for Medicaid, workers' compensation and no-fault inpatient services are based on a statewid e prospective payment system, with retroactive and/or prospective ad justments for certain rate components paid concurrently with the settlement of the final ra te. Outpatient services also are paid based on a statewide prospective system. Medicaid rate methodologies ar e subject to approval at the Federal level by the Centers fo r Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which may routinely request information about such methodologies prior to approval. Revenue related to specific rate components that have not been approved by CMS is not recognized until Northwell is reasonably assured that such amounts are rea lizable. Adjustments to the current and prior years' payment rates for those payers will continue to be made in future years. Medicare Hospitals are paid for most Medicare inpa tient and outpatient services under national prospective payment systems and other methodol ogies of the Medicare program for certain other services. Federal regulations provide for certain adjustments to current and prior years' payment rates, based on industry-wi de and Northwell-specific data. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 283. Accounts Receivable and Patient Revenue (continued) Northwell has established estimate s, based on information presently available, of amounts due to or from Medicare and non-Medicare payers for adjustments to cu rrent and prior years' payment rates, based on industry-wide and Northwell-spec ific data. The current Medicaid, Medicare and other third-party payer programs are based upon extr emely complex laws and regulations that are subject to interpretation. Noncompliance with su ch laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and exclusion from such programs. Northwell is not aware of any allegations of noncompliance that could have a material adverse effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Medicare cost reports, which are filed individua lly by the applicable Northwell entities and serve as the basis for final settlement with the Medica re program, have been audited by the Medicare fiscal intermediary and settled through years ranging from 2000 to 2017. Other years remain open for audit and settlement, as do certain issues re lated to the New York State Medicaid program for prior years. As a result, there is at least a reason able possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount when open years are settle d and additional info rmation is obtained. Settlements with third-party payers for cost re port filings and retroactive adjustments due to ongoing and future audits, reviews or investigations are considered variable consideration and are included in the determination of Patient Revenue . These settlements are estimated based on the terms of the payment agreement with the paye r, correspondence from the payer and Northwell's historical settlement activity (for example, cost report final settlements or repayments related to recovery audits), including an assess ment to ensure that it is probab le that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the retroactive adjustment is subsequently resolv ed. Such estimates are de termined through either a probability-weighted estimate or an estim ate of the most likely amount, depending on the circumstances related to a given estimated settleme nt item. Estimated settlem ents are adjusted in future periods as adjustments become known (that is, new information becomes available), or as years are settled or are no longer subject to such audits, reviews and investigations. Changes in estimates relating to prior year settlements were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 293. Accounts Receivable and Patient Revenue (continued) There are various proposals at the Federal and State levels th at could, among other things, significantly reduce payment rates or modify pa yment methods. The ultima te outcome of these proposals and other market changes, including the potential effects of revisions to health care regulations that may be enacted by the Fede ral and State governments, cannot presently be determined. Future changes in the Medicare a nd Medicaid programs and any reduction of funding could have an adverse impact on Northwell. Additi onally, certain payers' pa yment rates for various years have been appealed by certain members of Northwell. If the appeals are successful, additional income applicable to those years might be realized. Northwell grants credit without co llateral to its patient s, most of whom ar e insured under various third-party agreements. The significant concentr ations of accounts receiva ble for services to patients at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: December 31 2019 2018 Medicare and Medicare mana ged care 32% 33% Medicaid and Medicaid mana ged care 20 20 Self-pa y 5 5 Other thir d-part y payers 43 42 100% 100% Charity Care Together, charity care, implicit price concessions and bad debt expense represent uncompensated care. The estimated cost of total uncompe nsated care was approximately $357,000 and $340,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, resp ectively. The estimated cost of charity care provided was approximately $260,000 and $250, 000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The estimated cost of uncompens ated care and charity care is based on the ratio of cost to charges, as determin ed using Northwell-specific data. The NYSDOH Hospital Indigent Care Pool (the Pool) was established to provide funds to hospitals for the provision of uncompensated care and is funded, in part, by a 1% assessment on hospital net inpatient service revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Northwell received $66,476 and $69,040, respectively. Northwell made payments into the Pool of $60,132 and $54,752 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for the 1% assessment. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 304. Cash, Investments and Liquidity Northwell's cash, cash equivalent s and investments are reported in the consolidated statements of financial position as presented be low at December 31, 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 535,619 $ 538,964 Short-term investments 2,931,431 2,581,695 Long-term investments Total cash, cash equivalents and investments 5,999,110 5,186,986 Less assets limited as to use: Management designated malpractice and other compensation plan assets 243,250 184,400 Assets under bond indentures and other 121,515 75,195 Total assets limited as to use 2,677,288 2,135,913 Total unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 3,321,822 $ 3,051,073 * Other management designated assets in clude sinking funds established to repay Northwell's debt and proceeds from taxable bond issues and other amounts designated to fund future capital expend itures and investments. The total unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and i nvestments is used in No rthwell's days cash on hand calculation, a required financ ial ratio for certain debt compliance covenants (see Note 8). Short-term investments include $225,030 and $166,290 of assets limited as to use at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Long-term investme nts include $2,452,258 and $1,969,623 of assets limited as to use at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In September 2019, $364,000 of management desi gnated malpractice and other self-insurance assets were transferred to the Northwell Health Cash Balance Plan (the Cash Balance Plan) (see Note 10), which resulted in certain fina ncial benefits and cash flow savings.

Leases As described in Note 2, Northwell adopted ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019. Northwell leases certain medical offices, administrative offices and equipment under finance and operating leases. At the inception of a contract, a determinati on is made if the arrange ment is or contains a lease. Leases are classified as either finance or operating leases, based on the underlying terms of the agreement and certain criteria, such as the term of the lease relative to the useful life of the asset and the total lease payments to be made as compared to the fair value of the asset, among other criteria. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, assets acquired under finance leases of $187,587 and $158,549, respectively, and accumulated amortizati on associated with finance leases of $20,635 and $13,773, respectively, are recorded in property, plant and equipment, ne t in the consolidated statements of financial position. As a result of implementing ASU 2016-02, certain transactions previously classified as long-term debt were reclassified as of January 1, 2019 and are now reported as finance leases. Northwell's right-of-use assets pertaining to operating leases represent the right to use the agreement's underlying assets for the lease term, and the corresponding lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising fro m the lease. Such right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease's commencement date at the present value of lease payments over the lease term for leases with initial terms greater than one year. The present value of lease payments is calculated by utiliz ing the discount rate implicit in the lease, when readily determinable. For leases for which this rate is not readily determinable, Northwell uses its incremental borrowing rate for fi nancing over a comparable period as the discount rate. A right- of-use asset and leas e liability are not recognized for leases with an initia l term of 12 months or less. Northwell recognizes lease expense for operat ing leases over the lease term within supplies and expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The deferred rent liability resulting from recording operating lease expense using the stra ight-line method is recorded within the other long-term liabilities line of the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at December 31, 2018. As a result of implementing ASU 2016-02, this amount is now reported as a reduction to the right-o f-use assets - operating leases line of the accompanying consolidated statement of financ ial position at December 31, 2019. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 377. Leases (continued) Northwell's operating and finance leases have re maining lease terms, ranging from less than one year to sixty-five years, some of which may include options to ex tend. Lease payments related to periods subject to renewal options are excluded fr om the amounts used to determine the right-of- use leased assets and liabilities, unless Northwell is reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend the lease. Northwell's leases may also in clude variable lease payments. Variable lease payments are excluded from the amounts used to de termine the right-of-use leased assets and liabilities, unless the variable lease payments depe nd on an index or rate or are in substance fixed payments. Northwell has made an election for all leases to not separate lease components from non-lease components in contracts in the accounting for it s lease payments, as permitted by ASU 2016-02. As such, Northwell accounts for the applicable non-lease components (e.g., fixed common area maintenance costs), together with the related le ase components when dete rmining the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Operating leases with a present value of appr oximately $900,000 were recorded as right-of-use liabilities and asse ts as of January 1, 2019 upon the adoption of ASU 2016-02. The components of lease cost included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 are as follows: Finance lease cost: Amortization of assets acquire d under finance leases $ 6,508 Interest on finance lease obli gations 16,924 Operatin g lease cost: Lease cost - leases with terms greater than one year 190,136 Short-term lease cost 3,309 Variable lease cost 26,654 Total lease cost $ 243,531 For the year ended December 31, 2018, rent ex pense under operating leas es was approximately $150,000.

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the major ity of Northwell's assets were pledged as collateral under the terms of various debt agreements. In addition, certain debt agreements contain covenants related to the maintenance of financial ratios, including debt service coverage ratios and days cash on hand, and the maintenance of certai n debt service and other reserve funds included in assets limited as to use.

Tota l credit available under such arrangements is $292,000. Balances outstanding from these borrowi ngs are $95,000 and $103,500 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 449. Fair Values of Financial Instruments For assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value, Northwell measures fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asse t or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are applied based on the unit of account from Northwel l's perspective. The unit of account determines what is being measured by referenc e to the level at which the asset or liability is aggregated (or disaggregated) for purposes of appl ying other accounting pronouncements. Northwell follows a valuation hierarchy that pr ioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broa d levels, which are described below: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active ma rkets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable inputs that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when littl e or no market data is available. A financial instrument's categoriz ation within the valuation hier archy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. In determini ng fair value, Northwell uses valuation techniques that maximize the us e of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and considers nonperforman ce risk in its assessment of fair value. A financial instrument's categorization within the three levels of the valuation hierarchy is not indicative of the investment risk a ssociated with the underlying assets. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 459. Fair Values of Financial Instruments (continued) Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair va lue as of December 31, 2019 are classified in the following table in one of the three categories described previously: 2019 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Cash and cash equivalents (including amounts in the investment portfolio) $ 979,253 $ - $ - $ 979,253 Fixed income obligations: U.S. Government obligations 152,491 257,835 - 410,326 Corporate and other bonds - 518,725 - 518,725 Fixed income mutual funds 450,547 - - 450,547 Commingled fixed income funds* - 267,342 Value 444,598 - 444,598 Small cap 162,855 - - 162,855 Global 273,653 - - 273,653 Growth 134,434 - - 134,434 Equity mutual funds 785,480 73,727 - - 73,727 Interest and other receivables 27,027 - - 27,027 Liabilities Interest rate swap agreements - (6,130) - (6,130) $ 3,484,065 $ 1,254,080 $ - $ 4,738,145 Northwell Health, Inc.

Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 479. Fair Values of Financial Instruments (continued) Fair value for Level 1 is based upon quoted market prices. Fair va lue for Level 2 is based on quoted prices for similar in struments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-base d valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the investment. The amounts reported in the previous tables exclude certain amounts re ported as investments, including investments under the equity method or at Adjusted Cost in the amounts of $1,254,835 and $1,623,227 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectiv ely (see Note 2), and assets invested in Northwell's pension plans (see Note 10). 10. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension Plans Northwell maintains several pension plans for it s employees. The followi ng are descriptions of such plans and the respective pension expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Certain members of Northwell pr ovide pension and similar benef its to their employees through defined contribution plans. Contributions to the defined contribut ion plans are based on percentages of annual salaries. It is the policy of these members to fund accrued costs under these plans on a current basis. Pension expense for 20 19 and 2018 related to the defined contribution plans amounted to $200,016 and $178,924, respectively. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 4810. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits (continued) Certain members of Northwell contribute to vari ous multiemployer define d benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreemen ts that cover union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plan s are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects: a. Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of ot her participating employers. b. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunde d obligations of the plan may be borne by the rema ining participating employers. c. If Northwell stops participating in any of its multiem ployer plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. Northwell's significant participa tion in certain multiem ployer plans for the annual period ended December 31, 2019 is outlined in the following tabl e. The following information for the 1199SEIU Health Care Employees Pension Fund (the 1199 Plan ) and the New York Stat e Nurses Association Pension Plan (the NYSNA Plan) is included within the table: a. The \"EIN/Pension Plan Number\" column provides the plans' Employee Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number. b. The most recent \"Pension Protection Act Zone Status\" available in 2019 and 2018 is for a plan's year-end at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and is based on information that Northwell received from the plans and is certified by the plans' actuaries. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80% funded and plans in th e green zone are at least 80% funded. c. The \"FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented\" colu mn indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation pl an (RP) is either pending or has been implemented. d.

C ontributions for these other plans totaled $1,083 and $1,089 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Certain of Northwell's employees participate in deferred compensation plans. The liability for these plans totaled $3,916 and $5,616 at Decemb er 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In connection with these plans, Northwell deposits amounts w ith trustees on behalf of the participating employees. Under the terms of the plans, Northwe ll is not responsible for investment gains or losses incurred. The assets are restricted for paym ents under the plans, but may revert to Northwell under certain specified circumstances.

Debt and equity securities and certain commingled funds with read ily determinable values are carried at fair value, as determined based on independent published sources. Other commingled funds and alternative i nvestments are stated at fair value, determined by using net asset value as a practical expedient, as permitted by generally accepted accounting principles, rather than usin g another valuation method to independently estimate fair value (see Note 2).

Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 5710. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits (continued) Basis Used to Determine the Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets The overall expected long- term rate of return on assets assumption is based upon a long-term building-block approach adjusted for current market conditions. First, return expectations for each asset class are developed with economic and fundame ntal drivers such as inflation, dividends and real earnings growth for stoc ks and real yields, defaults and recoveries for bonds. These expectations assume that market levels at the beginning of the forecast period are in a state of equilibrium. With the understand ing that markets are more ofte n than not in some state of disequilibrium, the \"next ten year\" return forecast s are adjusted to reflect the starting point for inflation expectations, interest rate levels and mark et risk premiums relative to historically normal market levels. The fundamental building blocks us ed to develop the long-term equilibrium return expectations are based on a combination of consen sus forecasts and long-ter m historical averages. The historical data is adjusted to reflect any f undamental changes that have occurred in the relative markets. Once long-term equilibrium forecasts are developed, returns are adjusted for the next ten years to reflect the current environment as it relates to the key economic va riables that influence returns across the capital mark ets. In doing so, the expected path for breakeven inflation, real interest rates and investment grade corporate bond spreads are modeled fo r the next ten years. In this framework, the investment grade corporate spreads are used as a proxy for the risk premium priced broadly into all asset classes within the capital markets. While the precise expected return derived using the above appr oach will fluctuate somewhat from year to year, the Plans' policy is to hold this long-t erm assumption constant as long as it remains within a reasonable tolerance from the derived rate. Description of Investment Policies and Strategies The Plans' overall investment strategy is to achie ve wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. Equity securities in clude investments in do mestic, international, global and emerging markets equ ities. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage -backed securities, emer ging markets debt and U.S. Treasuries. Other types of investments include investme nts in commingled funds and alternative investments that follo w several different strategies. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 5810. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits (continued) There are specific guidelines and diversification st andards for each investment manager. Eligible investments are specifically outlin ed. Each manager must disclose its strategies and report that it abides by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (E RISA) rules, where applicable. The Cash Balance Plan's asset allocation at Dece mber 31, 2019 and 2018, by asset category, is as follows: 2019 2018 Target Allocation Cash and short-term investments 3.7% 2.6% 1.0% Fixed income 32.0 32.7 24.5 Commin gled risk-parit y funds 0.0 Alternative investments 27.5 28.8 41.5 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% The target allocation percentages are set as long -term diversification obj ectives to be met over time, as the portfolio increases the al location to alternative investments. The Cash Balance Plan comprises 85.0% and 83.2% of the Plans' total fair value of plan assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other Postretirement Benefits Certain employees are covered by the Northwell Health Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plan and other postretirement benefi t plans other than pensions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the total funded status of the plans was a liab ility of $36,413 and $31,418, respectively. The current portion of accrued retirement benefits related to th e plans, included in accrued salaries and related benefits in the accompanying consolidated statem ents of financial position, is $1,592 and $1,537 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 5910.

Malpractice and Other Insurance Liabilities Malpractice Northwell provides for potential medical malpractice losses th rough a combinatio n of a self- insurance program and purchased primary and excess insurance, on both a claims-made and occurrence basis, as follows: Primary Insurance Program From January 2003 through December 2016, Northwe ll purchased primary ma lpractice insurance on an occurrence basis, covering most hospitals. The policies prov ided coverage with limits of $1,000 per claim and a $50,000 annual policy aggr egate through 2009. Effe ctive January 2010, the program retained $750 of the primary coverage per indemnity claim, while aggregate limits increased to $60,000. Effective January 2013, the retention level increase d to $900 per claim. Effective January 2017, Northwell decided to fully self-insure the primar y layer covering most hospitals up to $1,000 per claim. In December 2002, Northwell purchased a tail in surance policy to cover unreported occurrences from its prior claims-made primary insurance program. The estimated undiscounted liability for the retained primary covera ge and losses in excess of the insured primary aggregate at Decembe r 31, 2019 and 2018 was $801,568 and $721,206, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the liability was recorded at the actuarially determined present value of $749,229 and $671,804, respectively, based on a discount rate of 2.0%. Malpractice and other insurance liabilities are discounted based on the expected timing of the actuarially estim ated future claim payments under the pr ograms, using a risk -free rate. Such estimates are reviewed and updated on an annual basis. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 6011. Malpractice and Other Insurance Liabilities (continued) Excess Insurance Coverage Regional Insurance covers certain excess malpractic e losses above the primary per claim limit, on a claims-made basis. Additional commercial excess malpractice insurance is purchased on a claims-made basis for excess coverage layers ab ove the Regional Insurance per claim limit. Regional Insurance's estimated undiscounted reserves for losses and loss e xpenses outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $116,547 and $150,317, respectively, and were recorded at the actuarially determined present value of $103, 502 and $144,880, respectively, based on a discount rate of 2.0%. Effective January 1, 2015, the annual aggregate excess coverage provided by Regional Insurance was significantly reduced to $6,500, and was subse quently increased to $7, 750 effective January 1, 2018 and $8,375 effective January 1, 2019. This re sulted in an undiscounted liability for the Northwell hospitals for estimated losses in exces s of the aggregate at December 31, 2019 and 2018 of $323,056 and $263,671, respectively, recorded at the actuarially determin ed present value of $299,580 and $243,240, respectively, based on a 2.0% discount rate. The estimated undiscounted incurred but not reported liab ility for claims in excess of primary insurance layers at Decemb er 31, 2019 and 2018 was $116,806 and $105,453, respectively, and was recorded at the actuarially determined present value of $101,584 and $91,635, respectively, based on a discount rate of 2.0%. Other Self-Insurance Coverage For certain years, certain Northw ell hospitals and physicians were covered for malp ractice claims under various other insured and self-insured arrangements. For se lf-insured claims and incidents, Northwell has reserved $39,771 and $39,308 at D ecember 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, based on actuarial determinations and a di scount rate of 2.0%, as its best estimates of the ultimate cost of such losses. Malpractice claims have been asserted against Northwell by various claimants. These claims are in various stages of processing, and some may ultimately be brought to trial. There are known incidents that have occurred through December 31, 2019 that may result in the assertion of additional claims, and other claims may be asserted arising from services provided to patients in the past. It is the opinion of Northwell's mana gement that adequate insurance, including self-insurance, and malpractice rese rves are being maintained to cover potential malpractice losses. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 6111. Malpractice and Other Insurance Liabilities (continued) Workers' Compensation In June 2013, Northwell change d its workers' compensation insu rance program from a guaranteed cost program to a high deduc tible program with a $1,000 pe r claim retention level. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the liability for retain ed losses under this program was recorded at the actuarially determined present value of $188,810 and $163,209, respectively, based on a discount rate of 2.0%. The estimated undisc ounted liability was $212,176 and $182,982 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Prior to joining Northwell's high deductible progra m, certain hospitals had various self-insured programs for workers' compensation claims. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the liability for these self-insured losses was recorded at the act uarially determined present value of $19,278 and $23,881, respectively, based on a discount rate of 2.0%. Other Insurance Some of Northwell's other insura nce programs, including general liability, have a component of self-insurance or high deductibles. Liabilities for these other insurance programs were not significant at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 6212.

As a result of the acquisition, MLMIC went through a demutualization whereby it s legal structure convert ed from a customer- owned mutual organization to a jo int stock company. Included in other operating revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operat ions for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is $10,858 and $104,075, respectively, from proceeds received by Northwell following the demutualization of MLMIC. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 6313. Net Assets Donor restricted net assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are availa ble for the following: 2019 2018 Teachin g, research, trainin g and othe r $ 321,875 $ 291,967 Capital pro jects endowments consist of donor restricted funds, the income from which is available for a variety of purposes. Northwell follows the requirements of the New Yo rk Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (NYPMIFA) as they relate to its perm anent endowments. Northwell has interpreted NYPMIFA as requiring the preservation of the fair valu e of the original gift, as of the gift date, of the donor-restricted endo wment funds absent explicit donor stipul ations to the cont rary. As a result of this interpretation, Northwell classifies as net as sets with donor restrictions to be maintained in perpetuity (a) the origin al value of gifts donated to the perm anent endowment, (b) the original value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endo wment, and (c) accumulations to the permanent endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. The remaining income from the permanent endowments is classified as net assets with donor re strictions to be used for described purposes or over specified periods of time until those amounts ar e appropriated for e xpenditure. Northwell considers the following factors in making a dete rmination to appropriate or accumulate donor restricted endowment funds: (1) th e duration and preservation of the fund, (2) the purpose of the donor restricted endowment fund, (3) general ec onomic conditions, (4) the possible effect of inflation and deflation, (5) the expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments, and (6) the invest ment policies of Northwell. Northwell's investment and spendi ng policies for endowment assets seek to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowments, while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endow ment assets include those assets of donor- restricted funds that Northwell must hold in perpetuity or for a donor-specified term. Under this policy, as approved by the Board of Trustees, the endowment assets are inve sted in a manner that expects to generate an average annual return over time in excess of 5.0%. Actual returns in any given year may vary from this amount. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 6413. Net Assets (continued) To satisfy its long-term rate-of -return objectives, Northwell relies on a total retu rn strategy in which investment returns are achieved through bo th capital appreciation (r ealized and unrealized) and current yield (interest and dividends). Northw ell targets a diversified asset allocation that consists of equities, fixed inco me and alternativ e investments. Northwell has a policy of appropriating for distribu tion each year, no more th an a 7% return on its endowment funds' corpus. In establishing this policy, Northwell considered the long-term expected return on its endowments. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Northwell had the following activity related to its endowment assets, including amounts to be held in perpetuity and earnings which may be expended: 2019 2018 Endowment balance, be ginnin g of year $ 262,512 $ 261,045 Investment return: Investment income 10,257 13,379 (depreciation) Contributions and 23,540 Amounts appropriate d for expenditure (11,727) (13,721) Net chan ge in endowment funds 47,113 1,467 Endowment balance, end of year $ 309,625 $ 262,512 *Contributions include pled ges receivable for permanently restricted purposes. From time to time, the fa ir value of assets associated with individual donor-restricted endowment funds may fall below the level that the donor requires Northwell to re tain as a fund of perpetual duration. There was no such deficiency as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 6514. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation and Claims Northwell is involved in litigatio n and claims which are not cons idered unusual to its business. While the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits cannot be determined at this time, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of thes e claims will not have a material adverse effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Collective Bargaining Agreements At December 31, 2019, approximately 29% of No rthwell's employees are union employees who are covered under the terms of various collec tive bargaining agreements. Certain collective bargaining agreements which represent approxima tely 1% of union empl oyees (0.4% of total employees) have expired, or will expire, within the next year and are currently being renegotiated. Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds At December 31, 2019, $14,999 in direct-pay letters of credit were maintain ed with a commercial bank to secure certain Northe rn Westchester bond issues. At December 31, 2019, four comm ercial banks are providing a to tal of $410,000 in commitments, solely to support letters of credit required fo r Northwell's high deductib le workers' compensation and vehicle insurance programs. At December 31, 2019, $135,473 in s ecured direct-pay letters of credit were maintained with the banks, and $274,527 of the commitments remain available for future letters of credit. At December 31, 2019, there was also a $45,000 surety bond supporting these programs. In addition, at December 31, 2019, $16,798 in dire ct-pay letters of cred it or surety bonds were maintained to support other workers' compensa tion insurance programs at certain Northwell hospitals. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 6614. Commitments and Cont ingencies (continued) Other Commitments and Contingencies In 2008, Hofstra University (the University) and Northwell entered into a joint academic agreement to establish what is now known as the Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell (the Medical School), at the University, while remaining as separate corporations with separate governance. Under the agreement, Northwell will reimburse the University a minimum of $5,000 each academic year for a portion of the Medical School's annual costs, with amounts indexed to the Medical School tuition. Such reimbursement is contingent upon annual approval by the boards of No rthwell and the University. Nort hwell shall not advance funds to the University that have not yet been spent in connection with the Medical School. Northwell also provides a minimum of $4,000 annually fo r funding of Medical School scholarships and student loans, with amounts inde xed to the Medical School tuition. In April 2015, Northwell entered into a strategi c affiliation with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). Under the terms of this affiliation, No rthwell and CSHL will continue as independent organizations governed by their respective boards of trustees. The goals of the affiliation include advancing cancer diagnostic and therapeutic res earch, developing a new clinical cancer research unit at Northwell to support early-phase clinical studies of new cancer therapies, and recruiting and training more clinician-scientists in oncol ogy. Pursuant to the agreement, Northwell is committed to pay CSHL $15,000 annually throughout the remaining term of the affiliation. In August 2015, Northwell entered into a clinical affi liation and collaborat ion agreement with Maimonides Medical Center (M aimonides), a not-for-profit acut e care hospital located in Brooklyn, New York. The purpose of the affiliation is to pursue collaborative activities, such as clinical integration initiatives and ambulatory servi ces joint ventures, as well as service agreements that may generate operational effi ciencies. Under the terms of the affiliation agreement, Northwell and Maimonides will remain i ndependent organizations governed by their respective boards of trustees. Pursuant to the affiliation agreement, th e parties have also entered into an unsecured loan agreement, whereby through August 2017, Northwe ll loaned a total of $125,000 to Maimonides. Payments on the loan and accrued interest thereon would not commence until the termination of the affiliation agreement. However, if Northwel l becomes the sole member and corporate parent of Maimonides, outstanding amounts borrowed under the loan agreement, including accrued interest, will be forgiven. Northwell Health, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 6714. Commitments and Cont ingencies (continued) In August 2018, Northwell entered into an opti on agreement with a third party that recently acquired property on the Upper East Side of Ma nhattan. Under the agreement, Northwell is required to make minimum monthly payments of approximately $806 to the property owner and is given the option to pu rchase the property at a defined price at certain future dates. The option agreement is for a three-year pe riod, with the ability to extend for up to two additional years. In the normal course of business, Northwell enters into multi-year contract s with vendors, suppliers and service providers for goods or services to be provided to Nort hwell. Under the terms of such agreements, Northwell may be cont ingently liable for termination or other fees in the event of contract termination or default. Northwell does not believe that such contingent liabilities, should they become due, would have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 15. Subsequent Events Management has evaluated the impact of subseq uent events through April 29, 2020, representing the date at which the consolidated financial statements were issued. Due to the global outbreak of Coronavirus Di sease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2020, there have been resulting effects which could negatively impact Northwell's consolidated financial condition. These include significant volatility in the inve stment markets, widespread temporary business closures and event cancellations, and other econom ic and societal eff ects resulting from the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the deferral of elective surgeries and non- emergent procedures and the disr uption of other medical treatments and services at Northwell and throughout the U.S. health care system. Manageme nt continues to closel y monitor th e operational and financial impact of COVID-19 in many respect s, and is pursuing oppor tunities for Federal and any other funding that is or will become available, including from the Federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act , the Federal Em ergency Management Agency or other sources. While planning for and managing through the COVID- 19 pandemic, in partnership with New York State, operations across the continuum have be en disrupted, however, Northwell is currently preparing for the recovery of operations post the COVID-19 crisis. The ultimate impact of these various matters to Northwell and its consolidat ed financial condition is presently unknown. The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 do not reflect the effects of these subsequent events. Except for those mentioned above, no events have occu rred that require disclosure in or adjustment to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The information on the Schedule is presented in accordance with the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (the Uniform Guidance). Therefore, some amounts presented in this Schedule may differ from amounts presented in, or used in the preparation of, the consolidated financial statements. For purpose s of the Schedule, federal awards include assistance p rovided by a federal agency directly or indirectly in the form of grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, loans and loan guarantees, or other non -cash assistance.

Under these cost principles, certain types of expenditures are not allowable or are lim ited as to reimbursement. The U niform Guida nce provides for a 10% de minimi s indirect cost rate election; however, Northwell did not make this election and uses a negotiated indirect cost rate.

We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of Northwell Health, Inc. and its member corporations and other affiliated entities (collectively, Northwell), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated April 29, 2020. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Northwell 's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Northwell 's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Northw ell's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity 's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consid eration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limita tions, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the result s of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity 's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entit y's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose. April 29, 2020 A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 81 Report of Independent Auditors on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program and Report on Internal Control Over Compliance Required by the Uniform Guidance Management and the Board of Trustees Northwell Health, Inc. Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program We have audited Northwell Health, Inc. and its member corporations and other affiliated entities ' (collectively, Northwell) compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Compl iance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of Northwell' s major federal programs for the year ended December 31, 2019. Northwell 's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor 's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. Management' s Responsibility Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of federal statutes, regulations and the terms and conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. Auditor' s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Northwell 's major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtai n reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about Northwell' s compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Northwell 's compliance. Ernst & Young LLP One Jericho Plaza Suite 105 Jericho, NY 11753 Tel: +1 516 336 0100 ey.com A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 82 Opinion on Each Major Federal Program In our opinion, Northwell complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other Matters The results of our auditing procedures disclosed instances of noncompliance which are required to be reported in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, and which are described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as item 2019- 001 r elated to the Research and Development Cluster for the procurement compliance requirement. Our opinion on each major federal program is not modified with respect to this matter. Northwell's response to the noncompliance finding identified in our audit is described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. Northwell 's response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response. Report on Internal Control Over Compliance Management of Northwell is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered Northwell 's internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Northwell 's internal control over compliance. A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be preve nted, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 83 Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that have not been identified . We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, we did identify certain deficiencies in internal control over compliance, as described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as item 2019- 001 related to the Research and Development Cluster for the procurement compliance requ irement , that we consider to be a significant deficiency . Northwell's response to the internal control over compliance findings identified in our audit is described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. Northwell 's response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response. Northwell is responsible for preparing a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in our auditor's report. Northwell's corrective action plan was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it. The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose. September 30 , 2020 A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 84 Northwell Health, Inc.

Procurement, Suspension and Debarment In December 2013, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Un iform Guidance or 2 CFR 200 ) effective for awards issued on or after December 26, 2014. The Uniform Guidance changes included revised procurement requirements for direct cost expenditures under federal awards. Due to the complexity and significance of the changes to the procurement standards , the OMB established a three -year grace period for the Northwell Health, Inc. Schedule of Findings and Q uestioned Costs (continued) Finding 201 9-001 (continued) 87 implementation. As such, for Northwell Health, Inc. (Northwell), the effective date of the new procurement standards was January 1, 2018 for procurements of direct costs made under federal awards that are subject to Uniform Guidance. 2 CFR section 200.303 requires that a non -federal entity establish and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award s that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Under the new procurement standards, there are five methods of procurement based on dollar thresholds and the nature of the expenditures with prescribed documentation requirements for each. One of the procurement methods is \"small purchases\" which are purchases greater than $10,000 (the Micro Purchase Threshold) but less than $250,000 (the Simplified Acquisition Threshold). In accordance with 2 CFR section 200.320(b) \"Small purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. If small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.\" Generally, receiving price or rate quotations from more than one source would satisfy the small purchase requirements. In accordance with 2 CFR section 200.320(f), another procurement method is procurement by noncompetitive proposals, which is procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source and may be used in certain circumstances (e.g., if the item is available on ly from a single source). Condition In order to test internal controls established by Northwell and to test Northwell's compliance with the procurement requirements under the research and development cluster for activity during the year ended December 31, 2019, Northwell Health, Inc. Schedule of Findings and Q uestioned Costs (continued) Finding 201 9-001 (continued) 88 we selected a sample of 30 procurement -related expenditures totaling $ 140,117 from a population of 6,486 procurement -related expenditures totaling $2.7 million. In our sample we noted f our procurement transactions which were subject eith er to the small purchase requirements or procurement by noncompetitive proposals (totaling $ 108,872). For the se selections, at the time of purchase, Northwell did not have evidence of obtaining price or rate quotations in accordance with the small purchase requirements or evidence that the item was only available from a single source at the time of purchase. Management informed us that a cost or price analysis was performed. Cause Northwell's formal procurement policy which incorporated the new Unifor m Guidance procurement requirements was not approved until July 18, 2019 and not implemented until September 6, 2019. Effect or potential effect Northwell was not in compliance with the Uniform Guidance procurement requirements. The best price or rate may not be obtained if Northwell does not obtain the supporting price quotes or evidence of a single source at the time of purchase. However, in these instances, during our testing procedures, subsequent to purchase, management obtained and provided s upporting documentation to support the price or rate quotations or evidence of a single source for these procurement transactions. Questioned costs None. Context Procurement -related expenditures for the research and development cluster totaled $ 2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 representing 9% of the major program's federal expenditures of $28 .6 million. Northwell Health, Inc. Schedule of Findings and Q uestioned Costs (continued) Finding 201 9-001 (continued) 89 Identification as a repeat finding, if applicable This is a repeat finding. The prior year finding reference is 2018- 001. Recommendation Northwell should adhere to and evaluate its compliance with its revised procurement policy adopted in September 2019 and evaluate whether it appropriately follows the necessary provisions of the new procurement standard as outlined in 2 CFR sections 317 - 326, including the requirements to retain price and rate quotations for small purchases and appropriate documentation of a single source . Views of responsible officials Northwell's updated procurement policy for federally sponsored programs was formally approved by Northwell's Policy and Procedure Committee and implemented in September 2019. The Grants Management Office (GMO) has advised faculty and grant administrators of the revised policy and has incorporated a process whereby the GMO will rej ect any purchase requisitions forwarded to its attention prior to the generation of purchase orders, that do not meet the requirements of the revised procurement policy which conforms to the requirements of 2 CFR 200 317 - 326.
