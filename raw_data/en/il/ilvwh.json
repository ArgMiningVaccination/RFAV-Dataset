This prompted the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to envisage the creation of national guidelines for education and career pathways of allied health professionals, with a structured curriculum based on skills and competencies. Thus, this handbook has been designed to familiarize universities, colleges, healthcare providers as well a s educators offering allied health courses with these national standards. Individually, created for different pr ofessional groups of allied health , this handbook aims to reduce the variation in education by comprising of a standardized curriculum, career pathways, nomenclature and other details for each profession. The change fro m a purely didactic approach will create better skilled professionals and improve the quality of overall patient care. In the absence of a national standard -setting authority, this handbook can also guide the thousands of young adults who choose healthcare as a profession - not as doctors or nurses but to play several other critical roles - on the appropriate course of action to enabl e them to be skilled allied health professionals of the future. Who is an Allied Health Professional? The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, accepted in its entirety the definition of an allied health professional based on the afore -mentioned report, though the same has evolved after multiple consultations and the recommended definition is now as follows - Allied health pr ofessionals (AHPs) includes individuals involved with the delivery of health or healthcare related services, with qualification and competence in therapeutic, diagnostic, curative, preventive and/or rehabilitati ve interventions. They work in multidisciplin ary health teams in varied health care settings including doctors (physicians and specialist), nurses and public health officials to promote, protect, treat and/or manage a person(s) physical, mental, social, emotional, environ mental health and holistic we ll-being.1 Since the past few years, many professional groups have been interacting and seeking guidance on all those who would qualify u nder the purview of allied health professionals. In the healthcare system, statutory bodies exist for clinicians, nurses, pharmacists and dental practitioners; but a regulatory structure for around 50 professions is absent in India. Currently, the Government is considering these professions (as listed Annex -1) un der the ambit of the allied healthsystem. However, this is subject to changes and modifications over time, particularly considering how quickly new technologies and new clinical avenues are expanding globally, creating newer cadres of such professionals. Scope and need for allied health professionals in the Ind ian healthcare system The quality of medical care has improved tremendously in the last few decades due to the advances in technology, thus creating fresh challenges in the field of healthcare. It is now widely recognized that health service delivery is a team effort involving both clinicians and non -clinicians, and is not the sol e duty of physicians and nurses.1 Professionals that can competently ha ndle sophisticated machinery and advanced protocols are now in high demand. In fact, diagnosis is MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 10 of 189 now so dependent on technology, that allied health professionals (AHPs) are vital to successful treatment delivery. Effective delivery of healthcare services depends largely on the nature of education, training and appropriate orientation towards community health of all categories of health personnel, and their capacity to function as an integrated team. For instance in the UK, more than 84,000 AHPs, with a ran ge of skills and expertise, play key roles within the National Health Service, working autonomously, in multi -professional teams in various settings. All of them are first -contact practitioners and work across a wide range of locations and sectors within a cute, primary and community care. Australia's health system is managed not just by their doctors and nurses, but also by the 90,000 university -trained, autonomous AHPs vital to the system.2,3 As the Indian government aims for Universal Health Coverage, the lack of skilled human resource may prove to be the biggest impediment in its path to achieve targeted goals. The benefits of having AHPs in the healthcare system are still unexplored in India. Although an enormous amount of evidence suggests that the bene fits of AHPs range from improving access to healthcare services to significant reduction in the cost of care, though the Indian healthcare system still revolves around the doctor -centric approach. The privatization of healthcare has also led to an ever-increasing out -of-pocket expenditure by the population. However, many examples assert the need of skilled allied health professionals in the system, such as in the case of stroke survivors, it is the support of AHPs that significantly enhance their rehabilita tion and long term treatment ensures return to normal life. AHPs also play a significant role to care for patients who struggle mentally and emotionally in the current challenging environment and require mental health support; and help them return to well -being.2 Children with communication difficulties, the elderly, cancer patients, patients with long term conditions such as diabetes people with vis ion problems and amputees; the list of people and potential patients who benefit from AHPs is indefinite. Thus, the brea dth and scope of the allied health practice varies from one end to another, including areas of work listed below: Across the age span o f human development from neonate to old age; With patients having complex and challenging problems resulting from systemic illnesses such as in the case of diabetes, cardiac abnormalities/conditions and elderly care to name a few; Towards health promotion and disease prevention, as well as assessment, management and evaluation of interventions and protocols for treatment; In a broad range of settings from a patient's home to community, primary care centers, to tertiary care settings; and With an understand ing of the healthcare issues associated with diverse socio -economies and cultural norms within the society. Learning goal s and objectives for allied health professionals The handbook has been designed with a focus on performance -based outcomes pertaining to different levels. The learning goals and objectives of the undergraduate and graduate education program will be based on the performance expectations. They will be arti culated as learning goals (why we teach this) and learning objectives (what the students will learn). Using the framework, MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 11 of 189 students will learn to integrate their knowledge, skills and abilities in a hands -on manner in a professional healthcare setting. The se learning goals are divided into nine key areas, though the degree of required involvement may differ across various levels of qualification and professional cadres: 1. Clinical care 2. Communication 3. Membership of a multidisciplinary health team 4. Ethics and accountability at all levels (clinical, professional, personal and social) 5. Commitment to professional excellence 6. Leadership and mentorship 7. Social accountability and responsibility 8. Scientific attitude and scholarship (only at higher level - PhD) 9. Lifelong learning 1. Clinical Care4 Using a patient/family -centered approach and best evidence, each student will organize and implement the prescribed preventive, investigative and management plans; and will offer appropriate follow -up services. Program objectives should enable the students to: Apply the principles of basic science and evidence -based practice Use relevant investigations as needed Identify the indications for basic procedures and perform them in an appropriate manner Provide care to patients - efficiently and in a cost -effective way - in a range of settings, and maintain foremost the interests of individual patients Identify the influence of biological, psychosocial, economic, and spiritual factors on patients' well -being and act in an appropriate manner Incorporate strategies for health promotion and disease prevention with their patients 2. Communication4,5 The student will learn how to communicate with patients/clients, care -givers, other health professionals and other members of the community effectively and appropriately. Communication is a fundamental requirement in the provision of health care services. Program objectives should enable the students to: Provide sufficient information to ensure that the patient/client can participate as actively as possible and respond appropriately to the i nformation Clearly discuss the diagnosis and options with the patient, and negotiate appropriate treatment plans in a sensitive manner that is in the patient's and society's best interests Explain the proposed healthcare service - its nature, purpose, poss ible positive and adverse consequences, its limitations, and reasonable alternatives wherever they exist Use effective communication skills to gather data and share information including attentive listening, open -ended inquiry, empathy and clarification to ensure understanding Appropriately communicate with, and provide relevant information to, other stakeholders including members of the healthcare team MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 12 of 189 Use communication effectively and flexibly in a manner that is appropriate for the reader or listener Explore and consider the influence that the patient's ideas, beliefs and expectations have during interactions with them, along with varying factors such as age, ethnicity, culture and socioeconomic background Develop efficient techniques for all forms of wri tten and verbal communication including accurate and timely record keeping Assess their own communication skills, develop self -awareness and be able to improve their relationships with others Possess skills to counsel for lifestyle changes and advocate hea lth promotion 3. Membership of a multidisciplinary health team6 The student will put a high value on effective communication within the team, including transparency about aims, decisions, uncertainty and mistakes. Team -based health care is the provision of h ealth services to individuals, families, and/or their communities by at least two health providers who work collaboratively to accomplish shared goals within and across settings to achieve coordinated, high quality care. Program objectives will aim at maki ng the students being able to: Recognize, clearly articulate, understand and support shared goals in the team that reflect patient and family priorities Possess distinct roles within the team; to have clear expectations for each member's functions, responsibilities, and accountabilities, which in turn optimizes the team's efficiency and makes it possible for them to use division of labor advantageously, and accomplish more than the sum of its parts Develop mutual trust within the team to create stron g norms of reciprocity and greater opportunities for shared achievement Communicate effectively so that the team prioritizes and continuously refines its communication channels creating an environment of general and specific understanding Recognize measura ble processes and outcomes, so that the individual and team can agree on and implement reliable and timely feedback on successes and failures in both the team's functioning and the achievement of their goals. These can then be used to track and improve per formance immediately and over time. 4. Ethics and accountability Students will understand core concepts of clinical ethics and law so that they may apply these to their practice as healthcare service providers. Program objectives should enable the students t o: Describe and apply the basic concepts of clinical ethics to actual cases and situations Recognize the need to make health care resources available to patients fairly, equitably and without bias, discrimination or undue influence Demonstrate an understan ding and application of basic legal concepts to the practice Employ professional accountability for the initiation, maintenance and termination of patient -provider relationships MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 13 of 189 Demonstrate respect for each patient's individual rights of autonomy, privacy, and confidentiality 5. Commitment to professional excellence7 The student will execute professionalism to reflect in his/her thought and action a range of attributes and characteristics that include technical competence, appearance, image, confidence level, empathy, compassion, understanding, patience, manners, verba l and non -verbal communication, an anti -discriminatory and non -judgmental attitude, and appropriate physical contact to ensure safe, effective and expected delivery of healthcare. Program objectives will aim at making the students being able to: Demonstrate distinctive, meritorious and high quality practice that leads to excellence and that depicts commitment to competence, standards, ethical principles and values, within the legal boundaries of practice Demonstrate the quality of being answerable for all actions and omissions to all, including service users, peers, employers, standard -setting/regulatory bodies or oneself Demonstrate humanity in the course of everyday practice by virtue of having respect (and dignity), compassion, empathy, honour and integrity Ensure that self -interest does not influence actions or omissions, and demonstrate regards for service -users and colleagues 6. Leadership and mentorship8 The student must take on a leadership role where needed in order to ensure clinical product ivity and patient satisfaction. They must be able to respond in an autonomous and confident manner to planned and uncertain situations, and should be able to manage themselves and others effectively. They must create and maximize opportunities for the impr ovement of the health seeking experience and delivery of healthcare services. Program objectives should enable the students to: Act as agents of change and be leaders in quality improvement and service development, so that they contribute and enhance peopl e's wellbeing and their healthcare experience Systematically evaluate care; ensure the use of these findings to help improve people's experience and care outcomes, and to shape clinical treatment protocols and services Identify priorities and effectively m anage time and resources to ensure the maintenance or enhancement of the quality of care Recognize and be self -aware of the effect their own values, principles and assumptions may have on their practice. They must take charge of their own personal and professional development and should learn from experience (through supervision, feedback, reflection and evaluation) Facilitate themselves and others in the development of their competence, by using a range of professional and personal development skills Work independently and in teams. They must be able to take a leadership role to coordinate, delegate and supervise care safely, manage risk and remain accountable for the care given; actively involve and respect others' contributions to integrated person - center ed care; yet work in an effective manner across professional and agency boundaries. They must know when and how to communicate with patients and refer them to other professionals and agencies, to respect the choices of service users and MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 14 of 189 others, to promote shared decision -making, to deliver positive outcomes, and to coordinate smooth and effective transition within and between services and agencies. 7. Social Accountability and Responsibility9 The students will recognize that allied health professionals need to be advocates within the health care system, to judiciously manage resources and to acknowledge their social accountability.10They have a mandate to serve the community, region and the nation and will hence direct all research and service activities towar ds addressing their priority health concerns. Program objectives should enable the students to: Demonstrate knowledge of the determinants of health at local, regional and national levels and respond to the population needs Establish and promote innovative practice patterns by providing evidence -based care and testing new models of practice that will translate the results of research into practice, and thus meet individual and community needs in a more effective manner Develop a shared vision of an evolving and sustainable health care system for the future by working in collaboration with and reinforcing partnerships with other stakeholders, including academic health centres , governments, communities and other relevant professional and non -professional organi zations Advocate for the services and resources needed for optimal patient care 8. Scientific attitude and Scholarship10 The student will utilize so und scientific and/or scholarly principles during interactions with patients and peers, educational endeavors, research activities and in all other aspects of their professional lives. Program objectives should enable the students to: Engage in ongoing sel f-assessment and structure their continuing professional education to address the specific needs of the population Conduct e vidence -based practice s by applying principles of scientific methods Take responsibility for their educational experiences Acquire b asic skills such as presentation skills, giving feedback, patient education and the design and dissemination of research knowledge; for their application to teaching encounters 9. Lifelong learning11 The student should be committed to continuous improvement in skills and knowledge while harnessing modern tools and technology. Program objectives will aim at making the students being able to: Perform objective self -assessments of their knowledge and skills; learn and refine existing skills; and acquire new skills Apply newly gained knowledge or skills to patient care Enhance their personal and professional growth and learning by constant introspection and utilizing experiences Search (including through electronic means), and critically evaluate medical liter ature to enable its application to patient care Develop a research question and be familiar with basic, clinical and translational research in its application to patient care MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 15 of 189 Identify and select an appropriate, professionally rewarding and personally fulfi lling career pathway MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 16 of 189 Introduction of new elements in allied health education Competency -based curriculum A significant skill gap has been observed in the professionals offering healthcare services irrespective of the hierarchy and level of responsibilit y in the healthcare settings. The large variation in the quality of services is due to the diverse methodologies opted for healthcare education and the difference in expectations from a graduate after completion of a course and at work. What one is expecte d to perform' at work is assumed to be learned during the course, however, the course design focuses on what one is expected to know'. The competency -based curriculum thus connects the dots between the know what' and do how'. The efficiency and effectiveness of any educational programme largely depends on the curriculum design that is being followed. With emerging medical and scientific knowledge , educators have realize d that learning is no more limited to memorizing specific l ists of facts and data ; in fact, by the time the professional aims to practice in the healthcare setting, the acquired knowledge may stand outdated. Thus, c ompetency -based education is the answer ; a curricular concept designed to provide the skills that pr ofessionals need. A competency -based program is a mix of skills and competencies based on individual or population needs (such as clinical knowledge, patient care, or communication approaches ), which is then developed to teach relevant content across a ran ge of courses and settings. While the traditional system of education focuses on objectives, content, teacher -centric approach and summative evaluation; competency -based education has a focus on competencies, outcomes, performance and accomplishments. In s uch a case, teaching activities are learner -centered, and evaluation is continuous and formative in structure. The competency - based credentials depend on the demonstration of a defined set of competencies which enables a professional to achieve targeted go als. Competency frameworks comprise of a clearly articulated statement of a person's abilities on the completion of the credential, which allows students, employers, and other stakeholders to set their expectations appropriately.1213 Considering the need of the present and future healthcare delivery system, the curriculum design depicted in this handbook thus will be based on skills and competencies. Promoting s elf-direct ed learning of the professionals The shift in the focus from traditional to competency -based education has made it pertinent that the learning processes may also be revisited for suitable changes. It is a known fact that learning is no more restrict ed to the boundaries of a class room or the lessons taught by a teacher. The new tools and techno logies have widened the platform and introduced innovative modes of how students can learn and gain skills and knowledge. One of the innovative approach es is learner - centric and followsthe concept of self-directed learning. Self-directed learning, in its broadest meaning, describes a process in which individuals take the initiative with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying resources for learning, choosing and implementing learning strate gies and evaluating learning outcomes (Knowles, 1975).14 In self -directed learning, learners themselves take the initiative to use resources rather than simply reacting to transmissions from resources, which helps them learn more in a better way.15 Lifelong, MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 17 of 189 self-directed learning (SDL) has been identified as an important ability for medical graduates (Harvey, 2003)16 and so is applicable to other health professionals including AHPs. It has been proven through many studies worldwide that the self -directed method is better than the teacher - centric method of learning. Teacher -directed learning makes learners more dependent and the orientation to learning becomes subject -centred. If a teacher provides the learning material, the student is usually satisfi ed with the available material, whereas if a student is asked to work on the same assignment, he or she invariably has to explore ext ensive resources on the subject.15 Thus the handbook promotes self -directed learning, apart from the usual classroom teaching and opens the platform for students who wish to engage in lifelong learning. Credit hours vs traditional system Recently the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and the University Grants Commission (UGC) have highlighted the need for the development of a Choice -Based Credit System (CBCS), at par with global standards and the adoption of an effective grading system to measure a lea rner's performance.17 All the major higher education providers across the globe are operating a system of credits. The European Credit Transfer System (ECTS), the National Qualifications Framework' in Australia, the Pan -Canadian Protocol on the Transferabi lity of University Credits, the Credit Accumulation and Transfer System (CATS) in the UK as well as the systems operating in the US, Japan, etc . are examples of these. Globally, a need now exists for the use of a fully convertible credit -based system that c an be accepted at other universities. It has now become imperative to offer flexible curricular choices and provide learners mobility due to the popularity of initiatives such as twinning programmes', joint degrees' and study abroad' programmes.18 In ord er to ensure global acceptability of the graduates, the current curriculum structure is divided into smaller s ections with focus on hours of studying which can be converted into credit hours as per the international norms followed by various other countrie s. Integrated structure of the curriculum Vertical integration, in its truest sense, is the interweaving of teaching clinical skills and knowledge into the basic science years and, reinforcing and continuing to teach the applications of basic science conc epts during the clinical years. (Many efforts called vertical integration' include only the first half of the process). Horizontal integration is the identification of concepts or skills, especially those that are clinically relevant, that cut across (for example, the basic sciences), and then putting these to use as an integrated focus for presentations, clinical examples, and course materials. e.g. Integration of some of the basic science courses around organ systems, e.g., human anatomy, physiology, pat hology; or incorporating ethics, legal issues, finance, political issues, humanities, culture and computer skills into different aspects of a course like the Clinical Continuum. The aim of an integrated curriculum is to lead students to a level of scientif ic fluency that is beyond mere fact and concept acquisition, by the use of a common language of medical science, with which they can begin to think creatively about medical problems.19 MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 18 of 189 This innovative new curriculum has been structured in a way such that it facilitates horizontal and vertical integration between disciplines ; and bridges the gaps between both theory & practice, and between hospital -based practice and community practice. The amount of time devoted to basic and laboratory sciences (integrated with their clinical relevance) would be the maximum in the first year, progressively decreasing in the second and third year of the training, making clinical exposure and learni ng more dominant.11However it may differ from course to course depending on the professional group. Introduction of foundation course in the curriculum The foundation course for allied health professions is an immersive prog ramme designed to impart the required knowledge, skills and confidence for seamless transition to the second semester of a professional allied health course. Post admission, the f oundation course is designed for a period of 6 months to prepare a student to study the respective allied healthcourse effectively and to understand the basics o f healthcare system. This aims to orient the student to the national health system and the basics of public health, medical ethics, medical terminologies, communication ski lls, basic life support, computer learning, infection prevention and control, environmental issues and disaster management, as well as orientation to the community with focus on issues such as gender sensitivity, disability, human rights, civil rights , etc. However, the course is flexible in terms of the required numbers of hours for each subject of the foundation course and its appropriate placement across various semesters. Learning methodologies With a focus on self -directed learning, the curriculum will include a foundation course that focus es on communication, basic clinical skills and professionalism; and will incorporate clinical training from the first year itself. It is recommended that the primary care level should have sufficient clinical expo sure integrated with the learning of basic and laboratory sciences. There should also be an emphasis on the introduction of case scenarios for classroom discussion/case - based learning. Healthcare education and training is the backbone of an efficient healt hcare system and India's education infrastructure is yet to gain from the ongoing international technological revolution. The report From Paramedics to Allied Health: Landscaping the Journey and way ahead , indicate s that teaching and learning of clinical skills occur at the patient's bedside or other clinical areas such as laboratories, augmented by didactic teaching in classrooms and lecture theatres. In addition to keeping up with the pace of technological advancement, there has been a paradigm shift to outcome -based education with the adoption of effective assessment patterns .However, the demand for demonstration of competence in institutions where it is currently limited needs to be promoted . The report also mentions some of the allied health schools in Indiathat have instituted clinical skill centres , laboratories and high -fidelity simulation laboratories to enhance the practice and training allied health students and professionals. The report reiterates the fact that s imulation is the replication of p art or all of a clinical encounter through the use of mannequins, computer - assisted resources and simulated patients. The use of simulators addresses many issues such as suboptimal use of resources and equipment , by adequately training the manpower on newer technologies, limitations for imparting practical training in real -life scenarios, and ineffective skills MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 19 of 189 assessment methods among others .1 The table mentioned below lists various modes of teaching and learning opportunities that harness advanced tools and technologies. Table 1 Clinical learning opportunities imparted through the use of advanced techniques1,20 Teaching modality Learning opportunity examples Patients Teach and assess in selected clinical scenarios Practice soft skills Practice physical examination Receive feedback on performance Mannequins Perform acquired techniques Practice basic procedural skills Apply basic science understanding to clinical problem solving Simulators Practice teamwork and leadership Perform cardiac and pulmonary care skills Apply basic science understanding to clinical problem solving Task under trainers Preparation of the patient, slides , etc. Assessment methods Traditional assessment of students consists of the yearly system of assessments. In most institutions, assessments consist of internal and external assessments, and a theory examination at the end of the year or semester. This basically assesses knowledge instead of assessing skill s or competenc ies. In competency -based training, the evaluation of the students is based on the performance of the skills as per their competencies. Hence, all the three attributes - knowledge, skills, and attitudes - are assessed as required for the parti cular competency. Several new methods and tools are now readily accessible, the use of which requires special training.Some of these are given below: Objective Structured Clinical Examination(OSCE), Objective Structured Practical Examination (OSPE), Object ive Structured Long Examination Record(OSLER) Mini Case Evaluation Exercise(CEX) Case-based discussion( CBD) Direct observation of procedures(DOPs) Portfolio Multi -source feedback Patient satisfaction questionnaire An objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) is used these days in a number of allied healthcourses, e.g. Optometry, P hysiothera py and Radiography. It tests the performance and competence in communication, clinical examination, and medical procedures/prescriptions. In physiotherapy, orthotics, and occupational therapy, it tests exercise prescription, joint mobilization/manipulation techniques; and in radiography it tests radiographic positioning, radiographic image evaluation, and interpretation of results. The basic essen tial elements consist MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 20 of 189 of functional analysis of the occupational roles, translation of these roles (competencies) into outcomes, and assessment of trainees' progress in these outcomes on the basis of demonstrated performance. Progress is defined solely b y the competencies achieved and not the underlying processes or time served in formal educational settings . Most methods use predetermined, agreed assessment criteria (such as observation check -lists or rating scales for scoring) to emphasize on frequent a ssessment of learning outcomes. Hence, it is imperative for teachers to be aware of these developments and they should suitably adopt them in the allied health education system.21 MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 21 of 189 MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 22 of 189 Chapter 2 Methodology of Curriculum Development MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 23 of 189 MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 24 of 189 Chapter 2: Methodology of curriculum development With the release of the report From Paramedics to Allied Health: Landscaping the journey and the way ahead', the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare prioritized the key recommendations and concerns raised by various allied health professionals groups and experts as indicated in the report. One of the major recommendation s in the report was the need for standardization of curriculum and pedagogic requirements for the major allied health professional courses. The MoHF W has identified 12 priority professional streams in the phase -I for the purpose of standardization. The expertise of over 50 leading public and private allied health educational institutions for 12 different disciplines has been sought as part of this exe rcise. Addition ally, international experts from Canada, Sweden, USA and UK are also being roped in, to arrive at a comprehensive and globally acceptable set of educational standards based on a skills and competencies approach. The opinions were sought from experts for all the courses, though curricula for the following two professions were not redesigned as they fall under the ambit of an existing regulatory body -the Rehabilitation Council of India governed by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment - Audiology and Speech Pathology Orthotics and Prost hetics The National Skills Development Agency has also developed the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF). Under the aegis of the NSDA , the Healthcare Sector Skill Council (HSSC) has undertaken a similar process for a few entry level allied health courses (Certificate and Diploma level) . The focus of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is thus to preempt duplication of efforts and arrive at a comprehensive set of minimum standards for the allied health profession sbut for higher level professional qualifications . This would ensure that the key considerations and obligations of both the public and the private sector are adequately add ressed . In view of the above, the Ministry of H ealth and Family Welfare institute d 12 National Curricula Redesign Taskforce groups comprising of academicians and professionals from the best institutes and colleges across the country .These people serve d as subject experts and redesign ed the curricula based on a standardized framework developed by the NIAHS TSU (National Initiative for Allied Health Sciences -Technical Support Unit), which is the technical arm supporting this project . The final curriculum has been reviewed and approved by the National Curricula Review Committee (NCRC), (constituted by the MoHFW), that consists of e xperts with versatile and immense experience in their respective streams, to assess the applicab ility of the curricula drafted in view of the healthcare system as a whole. Steps undertaken in the curricula review process - 1. Curricula were sought from various States and institutions across the country in response to which the NIAHS TSU reviewed : a. 118 curricula of allied health cours es (different levels and different professions ) from 10 states acros s the country; b. 133 curricula of various allied health courses collected during phase -I of the NIAHS project .

Literature review -a comprehensive literature review was undertaken resulting i n a detail edcurriculum of the allied health courses , which included competency and skills - based models followed nationally as well as internationally , methodologies of curriculum development, assessment protocols, and many such aspects of curriculum development . The literature review helped the TSU to develop a reference document that comprised of a standard framework for a competency -based curriculum to be followed for the curricula review and redesign. A detailed mapping of all the resources was und ertaken and shared with the taskgroup experts via email . 3. Constitution of the National Curricula Redesign Taskforces for various profession al groups - Specific taskforce swere then instituted comprising of technical as well as subject experts who were engage d in the process of redesigning the curriculum. 4. Constitution of the National Curricula Review Committee (NCRC) - The NCRC (comprising of experts with versatile and immense experience in their respective domain s) was then constituted for final review and ap proval on the curriculum drafted by the taskforce and NIAHS TSU. 5. National Curricula Redesign Taskforce Consultations - a series of consultations were conducted with subject experts including both regional and national taskgroup experts to develop a skill and competency ' framework for education and career pathways. The consultations were facilitated by the NIAHS TSU members and were led by the chairperson s of the respective group s. Post this, the draft version and recommendation s were compiled by the TSU me mbers and sent to the experts for final review and consent. 6. Localconsultations - These were also conducted in different hospitals and other healthcare settings to get suggestions, feedback and ideas from the subject experts for their respective curricul a. 7. Response draft - Comments and suggestions were received on the draft and a response draft curriculum was prepared, which was then re -circulated for final consent and validation by the taskgroup experts. 8. Submission and approval of draft curriculum - The final draft of the curriculum handbook was then submitted by the taskforce chairman to the National Curricula Review Committee for approval and final sign -off. 9. Public opinion - The handbook was uploaded to seek public opinion from national and international experts, students, faculty, and practitioners of the respective professional groups. 10. Final approval by the NCRC - The comments and suggestions of the public were then reviewed and considered for possible modification s by the taskforce group s. The final approval and sign off for the overall structure was then sought from NCRC. 11.

Medical Laboratory Professionals work in all areas of a clinical laboratory including blood banking, clinical bio -chemistry, haematology, immunology, histopathology and medical microbiology . They perform a full range of laboratory tests - from simple prenatal blood tests, to more complex tests to uncover diseases such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and cancer. They are also responsible for confirming the accuracy of test results, and reporting labor atory findings. The information obtained from a Medical Laboratory Scientist helps the physician influence the medical treatment a patient will receive. Medical Laboratory Scientists operate complex electronic equipment, computers and precision instruments costing millions of dollars. Medical Laboratory Professional s analyze human fluid samples using techniques available to the clinical laboratory, such as manual white blood cell differentials, bone marrow counts, analysis via microscopy, and advanced analy tical equipment. They help physician s in choosing the correct laboratory tests and ensure proper collection methods. They receive patient specimens, analyze and interpret them, and report results. Medical Laboratory Professional s must recognize anomalies in their test results and know how to correct problems with the instrumentation. They monitor, screen, and troubleshoot analyzers featuring the latest technology available in the market. They perform equipment validations, calibrations, quality controls, STAT or run -by-run assessment, statistical control of observed data, and recording of normal operations. To maintain the integrity of the laboratory process, medical laboratory scientist s recognize factors that could introduce error and reject contaminated or substandard specimens, as well as investigate discrepant results. Common tests performed by Medical Laboratory Professional s are complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic p anel (CMP), electrolyte panel, liver function tests (LFT), renal function tests (RFT), thyroid function test (TFT), urinalysis, coagulation profile, lipid profile, blood type, semen analysis (for fertility and post -vasectomy studies), serological studies a nd routine cultures. In some facilities that have few phlebotomists, or none at all, (such as in rural areas) Medical Laboratory Professional s may perform phlebotomy on patients, as this skill is part of the ir clinical training. The practical experience r equired to obtain aBachelor's degree in Medical Laboratory Science gives these professionals a unique understanding of the inter -relationship between microbiological and chemical testing and the resulting clinical manifestations in clinical, scientific and industrial settings. About Medical Laboratory Science Medical laboratory science is the branch of science which deals with all the clinical laboratory investigations on clinical samples for laboratory diagnosis of various diseases. Blood, tissue and body fluids are analyzed and examined for various types of foreign organisms and abnormalities. This information is then used by the medical team to make decisions regarding a patient's medical care. 85% of all medical decisions are based on the results of cli nical laboratory investigation reports. MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 29 of 189 Medical Laboratory Science is an important subject in the field of Medicine. In each system of Medicine, diagnosis of disease is a primary step because no treatment is possible without a proper diagnosis. It is the Medical Laboratory Technocrat, who performs this important task by various scientific tools and techniques. In today's modern world of technology , the diagnosis, treatment & prognosis of various diseases depends upon the results of investigations carried out in a clinical laboratory . Thus ,these professional s play a key role in the field of health care. Medical Laboratory Science has played a significant role in the advancement in the field of Medicine, especially in past few decades. As modern medicine becom es more of a team effort, the Medical Laboratory Scientist/Technologist is an important member and integral part of the Medical team.

Existing in-service Medical Laboratory staff should be c onsidered at par in the present scheme at their respective levels. 3. *Diploma should be phased out in the future and the minimum required qualification should be BMLS 4 yea r course (3.5 years + 6 months internship). Definition of Medical Laboratory Science \"A medical laboratory professional (also referred to as a Medical Laboratory Technologist, a Clinical Laboratory Scientist or Clinical Laboratory Technologist) is a healthcare professional who performs chemical, hematological, immunologic, microscopic and m icrobiological diagnostic analyses on body fluids such as blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, and synovial fluid, as well as other specimens. Medical laboratory scientists work in clinical laboratori es at hospitals, reference laboratories, biotechnology laboratories and non-clinical industrial labs.\" Education of the medical laboratory professional When developing any education programme , it is necessary that programme planning should be outcome -based and should meet local and national manpower requirements . It should also provide personal satisfaction and career potential for the professionals with supporting pathway in the development of the profession. One of the major changes is the shift from a fo cus based on traditional theoretical knowledge , to askills -and competenc ies-based education and training. Optimal education/training requires that the student is able to integrate knowledge, skills and attitude in order to be able to perform a professional act adequately in a given situation. Thus, the following curriculum is prescriptive, aims to focus on a skills - and competencies -based approach for learning and isdesigned accordingly to standardize the content across the nation. Entry requirements Candidate s should have passed 10 + 2 with biology or vocational course in MLS/ML T at 10+2 level Minimum percentage of marks: 50% aggregate Separate entrance exam should be incorporated for these students who want to purse allied health course Course duration It is recommended that any programme developed from this curriculum should have the following minimum duration for students to qualify as entry level professional s in laboratory Science - 2.5 year programme (including 6 months of internship) - Diploma level 4 year programme (including 6 months of internship) - Bachelors ' degree level 2 year programme (including dissertation) - Masters ' degree level Ph.D . programme (including thesis) MODEL C URRICUL UM HANDBOOK OF MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE (Intellectual property of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) Page 34 of 189 The emphasis initially should be on the academic content estab lishing a strong scientific basis and in the la st six months on the application of theory to clinical/reflective practice. In the Bachelor s'degree programme , six months shall be devoted to clinical practice , on a continuum of rotation from theory to practice over the programme. The aim of the 4 year degree programme is to enable the development of the laboratory professional as a key member of the healthcare system With the change in disease dynamics and multi fold increase in cases needing medical laboratory science for the purpose of diagnosis, it is imperative that a well -structured programme of postgraduate education is also encouraged so as to enhance research capacity within the country to widen the scope of clinical practice for the profession and to produce well trained teaching faculty from within the profession. Thus, a Master's degree programme is recommended with minimum of two years of education including dissertation/thesis , tospecialize in the field of Medical Laboratory Science. Postgraduate students can contribute significantly in research and academics. Ph.D . also plays a significant role in the academic system of Medical Laboratory Science; however the curriculum has not indicated any prescript ive guidelines for that level apart from mapping it on the career and qualification map. The same needs to be promoted , for strengthening the Faculty development and significant contribution of Med. Lab. Professionals in the field of Research and development. Teaching faculty and infrastructure The importance of providing an adequate learning environment for students needs be emphasized. Both the physical infrastructure and the teaching staff must be adequate. Teaching areas should facilitate different teaching methods. Where students share didactic lectures with other disciplines (e.g. diagnostic radiographers, nurses) large lecture theatres may be appropriate, but smaller teaching areas should also be provided for tutorial and problem/case - based learning approaches. In all venues where students are placed the health and safety standards must be adhered to. It is recommended that a faculty and student ratio of 1:10 is to be followed for the Post graduate progra mmes and 1:25 for the under graduate programmes. Job availability As per ILO documentation, employers worldwide are looking for job applicants who not only have technical skills that can be applied in the workplace, but who also can communicate effectivel y, including with customers; can work in teams, with good interpersonal skills; can solve problems; have good ICT skills; are willing and able to learn; and are flexible in their approach to work.23 Graduates can expect to be employed in hospitals and priv ate laboratories. A career in research, following the completion of a higher degree such as a Ph . D., is an option chosen by some graduates. Graduates are eligible for employment overseas where their qualifications, training and experience are highly regar ded. Graduates have good employment prospects, and will enter a field in which the demand for professionals has increased in recent years and will keep on increasing due to chronic emerging conditions.

They should understand the theoretical basis for evidence -based practice and be effective members of the multidisciplinary team. They should always be prepared to participa te in or initiate research into practice. They should able to work according to registration requirements of the respective country/ state. All aspects of Medical laboratory Science have been considered in the development of this curriculum together with the identification of the roles expected for different levels of medical laboratory professionals based on their qualification and experience. The need for connecting the dots between the education and employment practices has been the road map for devisi ng this curriculum. The National Curriculum Taskforce on Medical Laboratory Science has successfully designed the career and qualification map indicating the growth opportunities for a professional in the career pathway based on the level as indicated in the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF). The career pathway indicates level 4 as the entry level after the completion of a minimum 2.5 years of Diploma level programme including 6 months internship in medical laboratory science (Diploma in Medi cal Laboratory Science) and level 5 as the entry level after completion of a minimum 4 years of Baccalaureate level programme including 6 months internship in medical laboratory science (Bachelor in Medical Laboratory Science - BMLS). The component s of the programmes starting from diploma and above ha ve been detailed out in the coming chapters. A foundation course has also been designed to bring all the students at the same level of understanding with respect to basic healthcare related norms before the start of a career in a healthcare professional course. The foundation course is mandatory for all the allied health professional courses and for both entry level courses - diploma as well as degree. If a diploma holder has completed the foundation course a nd is willing to pursue the degree course, the candidate will directly get entry for next semester, however a pre - qualifier skill test will have to be satisfactorily completed, if not, then the candidate will have to undergo the first semester of foundati on course again.
