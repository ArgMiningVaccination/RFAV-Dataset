It is one of the fastest growing fields in healthcare and it is widely used today in the United States. Most people utilizing CAM approaches are seeking ways to improve overall health and well-being to relieve symptoms associated with body aches such as neck and back pain, stiffness, chronic illnesses, anxiety and depression, and side effects of conventional medicine. Symptoms of depression can lead to major depression, which is consequentially a major public health problem in the United States. In 2014, more than 1 out of 20 Americans have been reported to have moderate to high depressive symptoms. While depression is treatable with western medication, many have found that the use of mind and body approaches such as mediation, chiropractic/osteopathic manipulation, and yoga show great benefit in improving the cognitive symptoms of depression without medication side effects.

CONCLUSION A negative association was found between the use of mind-body therapy and mental health among U.S. adults in all unadjusted models. Mind-body therapies users were found to be more depressed individuals. These results support the literature reviews that mind-body therapies users are more likely to be depressed.
