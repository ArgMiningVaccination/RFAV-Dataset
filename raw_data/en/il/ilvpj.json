In our endeavour to develop a genetic HIV-vaccine that elicits broad and robust immune responses to several virus variants, we have demonstrated major cross-clade Gag responses in patients infected with different subtypes of HIV-1.

We also found that HIV-1 infection results in release of intracellular perforin into the serum of HIV infected individuals and in SIV/SHIV infected monkeys.
