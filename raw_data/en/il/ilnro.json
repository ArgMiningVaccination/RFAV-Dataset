Why Do Seasonal Allergies Occur? A person can suffer with seasonal allergies from a young age, however they can suddenly start occurring at any point throughout one's life. They are not contagious and are, for the most part, very easily diagnosed given the period during which they occur and the associated symptoms. Seasonal allergies, also referred to as Hay Fever or Allergic Rhinitis, occur when an individual is exposed to a substance called an allergen. As a response, the body starts to produce antibodies and histamine to fight against this foreign substance, thereby causing the typical symptoms of seasonal allergies. These symptoms are very similar to those of a cold: runny nose, sinus congestion, sneezing, red eyes, fatigue, and headaches. The substances which are most frequently recognized by our bodies as allergens and are thus responsible for seasonal allergies are tree pollen, various grasses, and ragweed. How to prevent allergies from occurring? Seasonal allergies are difficult to prevent, especially given that pollen is all around us during the peak season. However, certain good habits can keep this seasonal discomfort at bay. For example: Don't go outdoors when pollen is highly present in the air or when it is a windy day Don't dry your clothes outdoors where pollen can attach to them Don't go to parks and green spaces when pollen is in high concentrations Do wash your hair frequently In addition to these good habits, it is important to boost your immune system in preparation for spring.
