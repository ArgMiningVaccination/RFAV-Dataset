Furthermore, it is often used for skin health, wound healing, and iron deficiency prevention. Zinc (5 mg/mL) - an essential mineral with maximum benefits for immunity, it contributes to cell growth, wound healing, and burning the fat in the body. Moreover, it has been proven to help combat infections and increase immune protection. Glutathione (200 mg/mL) - an important amino acid that acts as an antioxidant, accelerates the body's healing processes, detoxifies the liver, and contributes to immune protection. It protects host immune cells and contributes to the optimal functioning of other cells vital for an adequate immune response to an infection or severe disease.
