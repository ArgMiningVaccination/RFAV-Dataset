PLoS One ; affected disproportionately by COVID-19. Reasons are multifactorial and include social and [structural determinants of health]. During the onset and height of the [pandemic], evidence suggested decreased access to SARS CoV-2 testing. In 2020, the [National Institutes of Health]launched the Rapid [Acceleration]of Diagnostics (RADx)- [Underserved Populations]initiative to improve SARS CoV-2 testing in underserved [communities]. In this study, we explored [attitudes], experiences, and barriers to SARS CoV-2 testing and [vaccination]among [New York City] [public housing]residents. METHODS:Between we conducted 9 virtual [focus groups]among 36 low- housing]. RESULTS:Among residents [reporting]a prior SARS CoV-2 test, main reasons for testing were to prepare for a medical [procedure]or because of a high- [risk]exposure. Barriers to testing included [fear]of discomfort from the nasal swab, [fear]of exposure to COVID-19 while traveling to get tested, concerns about the consequences of testing positive and the [belief]that testing was not necessary. Residents reported a mistrust of [information sources]and the [health care system]in general; they depended more \"word of [mouth]\" for The major [barrier]to [vaccination]was lack of [trust]in [vaccine] [safety].

Residents also emphasized the need for [language]-concordant [information sharing]and for information to come from \"people [who]look like [them] and come from the same background as [them]\". CONCLUSIONS:Barriers to SARS CoV-2 testing and [vaccination]centered on themes of a lack of accurate information, [fear], mistrust, [safety], and convenience. Resident-endorsed [strategies]to increase testing include making testing easier to access either through home or onsite testing locations.
