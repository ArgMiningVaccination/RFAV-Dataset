Award Information](#_Section_II._Award_1) Eligibility Information](#_Section_III._Eligibility) [Section and Submission Information](#_Section_IV._Application_1) [Section V. Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VII. Agency Contacts](#_Section_VII._Agency) [Section VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support research that will contribute to the overall understanding of Lyme disease and co-infections transmitted by Ixodes ticks. This research opportunity encourages studies that address diverse scientific areas such as 1) pathogenesis, 2) host response, 3) disease transmission, 4) vector biology and natural history, 5) vaccines, 6) diagnostics, and 7) therapeutics. Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in the United States, with state health departments reporting more than 36,000 annual cases in a recent report and CDC estimates of 300,000 cases per annum. Globally, Lyme disease is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, which comprises multiple species, three of which commonly infect humans: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii and B. garinii. In the United States, where B. burgdorferi ss is the causative agent of Lyme disease, additional Borrelia species have recently been reported that may complicate accurate diagnosis of the disease. In addition, other pathogens transmitted by Ixodes ticks can cause coinfections, and the effects of those infections on Lyme disease remain largely unknown. Recent scientific advances using genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches have uncovered an abundance of genes, effectors and metabolites previously unappreciated for their role in Lyme disease transmission and/or pathogenesis. By tapping this new and growing data resource, the field is poised to advance our understanding of Lyme disease and co-infections transmitted by Ixodes ticks and develop new products for the translational pipeline. This FOA is designed to encourage the research community to submit applications focusing on gaps in our understanding of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato infections, new Lyme-related borrelioses, and Lyme coinfections, with the ultimate goal of advancing the field towards solutions for the improved detection, prevention and treatment of Lyme disease. Examples of research topics include, but are not limited to: NOTE: Clinical trials will not be supported under this FOA. Please see the revised NIH definition of \"clinical trials\" in [NOT-OD-15-015](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-015.html). NOTE: This FOA will use the Research Project (R01) grant mechanism: projects that are exploratory and have only limited or no preliminary data are not suited for this FOA.

Important Update: See [NOT-OD-18-228](/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-228.html) for updated review language for due dates on or after January 25, 2019. Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the [NIH mission](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149), all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is there a strong scientific premise for the project? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175). When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174). The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if NOT consistent with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. Reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. For Resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project. Not Applicable Not Applicable As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score. Reviewers will assess whether the project presents special opportunities for furthering research programs through the use of unusual talent, resources, populations, or environmental conditions that exist in other countries and either are not readily available in the United States or augment existing U.S. resources. Reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of Select Agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s). Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: (1) [Data Sharing Plan](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); (2) [Sharing Model Organisms](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and (3) [ Genomic Data Sharing Plan (GDS)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11153). For projects involving key biological and/or chemical resources, reviewers will comment on the brief plans proposed for identifying and ensuring the validity of those resources. Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s) convened by the Center for Scientific Review, in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11154), using the stated [review criteria](#_1._Criteria). Assignment to a Scientific Review Group will be shown in the eRA Commons. As part of the scientific peer review, all applications: Applications will be assigned on the basis of established PHS referral guidelines to the appropriate NIH Institute or Center. Applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications. Following initial peer review, recommended applications will receive a second level of review by the appropriate national Advisory Council or Board. The following will be considered in making funding decisions: After the peer review of the application is completed, the PD/PI will be able to access his or her Summary Statement (written critique) via the [eRA Commons](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11123). Refer to Part 1 for dates for peer review, advisory council review, and earliest start date. Information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11156). If the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request \"just-in-time\" information from the applicant as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157). A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the grantee's business official. Awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in [Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions](#_5._Funding_Restrictions). Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs. Any application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158) website.
