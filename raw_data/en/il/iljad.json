Acute Phase Reactants Acute phase reactants are plasma proteins whose levels dramatically increase (called positive acute phase reactants) or, in some cases, decrease (called negative acute phase reactants) in response to the elevated circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 that occur when infection or tissue damage occurs. Most dramatically increased are: C-reactive protein (CRP) Serum lectin, and serum component activate complement and act as opsonins. Serum amyloid A and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein are transport proteins, and fibrinogen is a coagulation factor. Elevated C-reactive protein levels are a nonspecific indicator of infection or inflammation. Increased fibrinogen levels are the main reason the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated in acute inflammation. Many acute phase reactants are made in the liver. Collectively, they may help limit tissue injury, enhance host resistance to infection, and promote tissue repair and resolution of inflammation. Antibodies Antibodies act as the antigen receptor on the surface of [B cells](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/biology-of-the-immune-system/cellular-components-of-the-immune-system#v992166) [ B cells The immune system consists of cellular components and molecular components that work together to destroy antigens.

Antibodies recognize specific configurations (epitopes, or antigenic determinants) on the surfaces of antigens (eg, proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids). Antibodies and antigens fit tightly together because their shape and other surface properties (eg, charge) are complementary. The same antibody molecule can cross-react with related antigens if their epitopes are similar enough to those of the original antigen. Antibody structure Antibodies consist of 4 polypeptide chains (2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light chains) joined by disulfide bonds to produce a Y configuration (see figure [B-cell receptor](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/biology-of-the-immune-system/molecular-components-of-the-immune-system#v28603688) [ B-cell receptor ](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/biology-of-the-immune-system/molecular-components-of-the-immune-system#v28603688) ). The heavy and light chains are divided into a variable (V) region and a constant (C) region. B-cell receptor The B-cell receptor consists of an Ig molecule anchored to the cell's surface. CH = heavy chain constant region; CL = light chain region; Fab lambda () = 2 types of light chains; VH = heavy chain variable region; VL = light chain variable region. V regions are located at the amino-terminal ends of the Y arms; they are called variable because the amino acids they contain are different in different antibodies. Within the V regions, hypervariable regions determine the specificity of the immunoglobulin (Ig). They also function as antigens (idiotypic determinants) to which certain natural (anti-idiotype) antibodies can bind; this binding may help regulate B-cell responses. The C region of the heavy chains contains a relatively constant sequence of amino acids (isotype) that is distinctive for each Ig class. A B cell can change the isotype it produces and thus switch the class of Ig it produces. Because the Ig retains the variable part of the heavy chain V region and the entire light chain, it retains its antigenic specificity. The amino-terminal (variable) end of the antibody binds to antigen to form an antibody-antigen complex. The antigen-binding (Fab) portion of Ig consists of a light chain and part of a heavy chain and contains the V region of the Ig molecule (ie, the combining sites). The crystallizable fragment (Fc) contains most of the C region of the heavy chains; Fc is responsible for complement activation and binds to Fc receptors on cells. Antibody classes Antibodies are divided into 5 classes: IgM IgG IgA IgD IgE The classes are defined by their type of heavy chain: mu () for IgM, gamma () for IgG, alpha () for IgA, epsilon () for IgE, and delta () for IgD. There are also 2 types of light chains: kappa () and lambda (). Each of the 5 Ig classes can bear either kappa or lambda light chains. IgM is the first antibody formed after exposure to new antigen. It has 5 Y-shaped molecules (10 heavy chains and 10 light chains), linked by a single joining (J) chain. IgM circulates primarily in the intravascular space; it complexes with and agglutinates antigens and can activate complement, thereby facilitating phagocytosis. Isohemagglutinins are predominantly IgM. Monomeric IgM acts as a surface antigen receptor on B cells. Patients with [hyper-IgM syndrome](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/immunodeficiency-disorders/hyper-igm-syndrome) [ Hyper-IgM Syndrome Hyper-IgM syndrome is an immunoglobulin (Ig) deficiency characterized by normal or elevated serum IgM levels and decreased levels or absence of other serum immunoglobulins, resulting in susceptibility... read more ](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/immunodeficiency-disorders/hyper-igm-syndrome) have a defect in the genes involved in antibody class switching (eg, genes that encode CD40, CD154 therefore, IgA, IgG, and IgE levels are low or absent, and levels of circulating IgM are often high. IgG is the most prevalent Ig isotype in serum and is present in intravascular and extravascular spaces. It coats antigen to activate complement and facilitate phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages. IgG is the primary circulating Ig produced after reexposure to antigen (secondary immune response) and is the predominant isotype contained in commercial gamma-globulin products. IgG protects against bacteria, viruses, and toxins; it is the only Ig isotype that crosses the placenta. Therefore, this class of antibody is important for protecting neonates, but pathogenic IgG antibodies (eg, anti-Rh0[D] antibodies, stimulatory anti-thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor autoantibodies), if present in the mother, can potentially cause significant disease in the fetus. There are 4 subclasses of IgG: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. They in descending order of serum concentration. IgG subclasses differ functionally mainly in their ability to activate complement; IgG1 and IgG3 are most efficient, IgG2 is less efficient, and IgG4 is inefficient. IgG1 and IgG3 are efficient mediators of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; IgG4 and IgG2 are less so. IgA occurs at mucosal surfaces, in serum, and in and secretions; colostrum), where it provides an early antibacterial and antiviral defense. J chain links IgA into a dimer to form secretory IgA. Secretory IgA is synthesized by plasma cells in the subepithelial regions of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. [Selective IgA deficiency](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/immunodeficiency-disorders/selective-iga-deficiency) [ Selective IgA Deficiency Selective IgA deficiency is an IgA level < 7 mg/dL (< 70 mg/L, < 0.4375 micromol/liter) with normal IgG and IgM levels.

Many patients... read more ](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/immunodeficiency-disorders/selective-iga-deficiency) is relatively common but often has little clinical impact because there is cross-functionality with other classes of antibody. IgD is coexpressed with IgM on the surface of naive B cells. Whether these 2 classes function differently on the surface of the B cell and, if so, how differently is unclear. They may simply be an example of molecular degeneracy. Serum IgD levels are very low, and any unique function of circulating IgD is unknown. IgE is present in low levels in serum and in respiratory and gastrointestinal mucous secretions. IgE binds with high affinity to receptors present in high levels on mast cells and basophils and to a lesser extent on several other hematopoietic cells, including dendritic cells. If antigen bridges 2 IgE molecules bound to the mast cell or basophil surface, the cells degranulate, releasing chemical mediators that cause an inflammatory response. IgE levels are elevated in atopic disorders (eg, allergic or extrinsic [asthma](/professional/pulmonary-disorders/asthma-and-related-disorders/asthma) [ Asthma Asthma is a disease of diffuse airway inflammation caused by a variety of triggering stimuli resulting in partially or completely reversible bronchoconstriction.

There are 3 types of parasites: Single-cell by immune and other cells when the cell interacts with a specific antigen, with pathogen-associated molecules such as endotoxin, or with other cytokines. Main (TNF-alpha, lymphotoxin-alpha, lymphotoxin-beta) Although lymphocyte interaction with a specific antigen triggers cytokine secretion, cytokines themselves are not antigen-specific; thus, they bridge innate and acquired immunity and generally influence the magnitude of inflammatory or immune responses. They act sequentially, synergistically, or antagonistically. They may act in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Cytokines deliver their signals via cell surface receptors. For example, the IL-2 receptor consists of 3 chains: alpha (), beta (), and gamma (). The receptor's affinity for IL-2 is High if all 3 chains are expressed Intermediate if only the beta and gamma chains are expressed Low if only the alpha chain is expressed Mutations or deletion of the gamma chain is the basis for X-linked [severe combined immunodeficiency](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/immunodeficiency-disorders/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid) [ Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) Severe combined immunodeficiency is characterized by low to absent T cells and a low, high, or normal number of B cells and natural killer cells.
