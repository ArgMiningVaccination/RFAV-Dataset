Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 1 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L500 \u00a7418.52 Condition of Participation : Patient's rights L501 The patient has the right to be informed of his or her rights, and the hospice must protect and promote the exercise of these rights. L502 \u00a7418.52(a) Standard: Notice of rights and responsibilities. (1) During the initial assessment visit in advance of furnishing care the hospice must provide the patient or representative with verbal (meaning spoken) and written notice of the patient's rights and responsibilities in a language and manner that the patient understands. When reference is made to \"patient\" in the Guidelines, it also refers to any person who may, unde r State law , act on the patient's behalf when the patient is unable to act for him or herself. That person is referred to as the patient's surrogate or representative. If a court has formally declared the patient incompetent, the surrogate or representative is whomev er the court guardian, conservator, or committee appointed. The hospice should verify that the representative has the necessary authority. For example, a court -appointed conservator might have the power to make financial decisions, but not health care deci sions. All hospice patients should be aware of their rights and responsibilities before the hospice begins to provide care. The hospice must verbally explain the patient rights and responsibilities to all patients accepted for care (or explain the rights to the patient's representative if the patient is physically or mentally incapacitated). There must be evidence that the hospice conscientiously tried, within the constraints of the individual situation, to inform the patient/family both verbally (spoken) and in writing of patient rights and responsibilities. If a patient is able to read and understand written materials without assistance, an oral summary, along with the complete written documentation is acceptable. For the patient who does not speak or understand English, hospices should make all reasonable efforts to secure a professional, objective translator for hospice -patient communications, including those involving the notice of patient rights and responsibilities. The hospice may only use family a nd friends as translators for the patient when an objective translator cannot be secured by the hospice or if the patient specifically requests this approach. Hospices should make all reasonable efforts to have written copies of the notice of rights and re sponsibilities available in the language(s) that are commonly spoken in the hospice's service area. For those patients who speak languages in areas where professional translators for those languages are not readily available, using family and friends of the patient is an acceptable option if the patient agrees. Further information on this topic is available from the Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights Policy Guidance: Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination As It Affects Persons With Limited English Proficiency. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 2 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Procedures and Probes: \u00a7418.52(a)(1) Ask the hospice for a copy of the material they provide to patients or their representative on admission. During home visits, ask the patient/family if the hospice informed them of their rights and responsibilities, and, if so, how and when. They should be able to give, in their own words, examples of how the rights apply to the care being received and any concerns they have about financial implications of the items or services they receive. They should also be able to explain how to access the hospice staff. If the patient or representative is vague in answering questions, ask for the written patient rights and responsibilities information that the hospice provided him or her as resource material, prior to furnishing care. L503 \u00a7418.52(a)(2) - The hospice must comply with the requirements of subpart I of part 489 of this chapter regarding advance directives. The hospice must inform and distribute written information to the patient concerning its policies on advance directives, including a description of applicable State law. Advance directives generally refer to written statements or instructions, completed in advance of a serious illness, about how an individual wants medical decisions made. The two most common forms of advance directives are a living will and a durable medical power of attorney for health care. It is the patient's right to formulate an advanc e directive should he/she wish to do so. The patient's admission to hospice should not be affected by his/her desire not to formulate an advance directive or by the contents of an advance directive. There may be State specific requirements for advance dire ctives that must be followed. The hospices obligations under 42 CFR 489.102 include the following requirements: Hospices must maintain written policies and procedures concerning advance directives with respect to all adult individuals receiving medical care by or through the provider and are required to: (1) Provide written information to such individuals concerning: (i) An individual's rights under State law (whether statutory or recognized by the courts of the State) to make decisions concerning such medical care, including the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment and the right to formulate, at the individual's option, advance directives. Providers are permitted to contract with other entities to furnish this information but are sti ll legally responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this section are met. Providers are to update and disseminate amended information as soon as possible, but no later than 90 days from the effective date of the changes to State law; and (ii) The written policies of the provider or organization respecting the implementation of such rights, including a clear and precise statement of limitation if the provider cannot implement an advance directive on the basis of conscience. At a minimum, a provider's statement of limitation should: Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 3 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors (A) Clarify any differences between institution -wide conscience objections and those that may be raised by individual physicians; (B) Identify the state legal authority permitting such objection, and (C) Describe the range of medical conditions or procedures affected by the conscience objection. (2) Document in a prominent part of the individual's current medical record, or patient care record in the case of an individual in a religious nonmedical health care institution, whether or not the individual has executed an advance directive; (3) Not condition the provision of care or otherwise discriminate against an individual based on whether or not the individual has executed an advance directive; (4) Ensure compliance with requirements of State law (whether statutory or recognized by the courts of the State) regarding advance directives. The provider must inform individuals that comp laints concerning the advance directive requirements may be filed with the State survey and certification agency; (5) Provide for education of staff concerning its policies and procedures on advance directives, and (6) Provide for community education reg arding issues concerning advance directives that may include material required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, either directly or in concert with other providers and organizations. Separate community education materials may be developed and used, at t he discretion of providers. The same written materials do not have to be provided in all settings, but the material should define what constitutes an advance directive, emphasizing that an advance directive is designed to enhance an incapacitated individua l's control over medical treatment, and describe applicable State law concerning advance directives. A provider must be able to document its community education efforts. Hospices must furnish this information to the patient at the time of initial receipt of hospice care by the individual from the hospice. Hospices: 1. Are not required to provide care that conflicts with an advance directive; and 2. Are not required to implement an advance directive if, as a matter of conscience, it cannot implement an advance directive and State law allows the hospice to conscientiously object Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 4 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors If an adult individual is incapacitated at the time of admission or at the start of care and is unable to receive information (due to the incapacitating conditions or a mental disorder) or articulate whether or not he or she has executed an advance directive, then the hospice may give advance directive information to the individual's family or surrogate in the same manner that it issues othe r materials about policies and procedures to the family of the incapacitated individual or to a surrogate or other concerned persons in accordance with State law. The hospice is not relieved of its obligation to provide this information to the individual o nce he or she is no longer incapacitated or unable to receive such information. Follow -up procedures must be in place to provide the information to the individual directly at the appropriate time. Compliance with the advance directives requirements is nece ssary for continued participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. L504 \u00a7418.52(a)(3) - The hospice must obtain the patient's or representative's signature confirming that he or she has received a copy of the notice of rights and responsibilities. Procedure \u00a7418.52(a)(3) Review the clinical record for evidence of the patient's or representative's signature confirming receipt of the notice of rights and responsibilities. L505 \u00a7418.52(b) Standard: Exercise of rights and respect for property and person (1) The patient has the right: (i) To exercise his or her rights as a patient of the hospice; (ii) To have his or her property and person treated with respect; (iii) To voice grievances regarding treatment or care that is (or fails to be) furnished and the lack of respect for property by anyone who is furnishing services on behalf of the hospice; and (iv) To not be subjected to discrimination or reprisal for exercising his or her rights. Patients must be fr ee to exercise their rights without fear of reprisal from the hospice. The hospice must not hamper, compel, treat differentially, or retaliate against a patient or family for exercising the patient's rights. The hospice must assure that its staff will prot ect patients' rights and will involve patients in decisions about their care, treatment and services. A grievance is a formal or informal written or verbal complaint that is made to any hospice employee, including volunteers and individuals furnishing hos pice services under arrangement, by a patient or the patient's representative regarding the patient's care, abuse, neglect, or misappropriation of property. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.52(b)(1)(i)-(iv) Review patient admission information for instructions on making a complaint. Note any patient -described problems recorded either in the hospice's documentation of complaints received or in the clinical record reviews, and note if they were addressed and resolved. If resolution of the problem was not possible, the hospice should document both the actions attempted and the outcomes achieved. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 5 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Ask to see documentation of complaints made by patients or patients families for the previous 12 months and review how the hospice received, recorded, investigated, and resolved these complaints. Is there evidence that the hospice staff is aware of and follows the hospice 's policy for complaint investigation when a patien t/family makes a complaint to a staff member? Pay close attention to staff remarks and staff behavior that may represent deliberate actions to promote or to limit a patient 's autonomy or choice. Who in the hospice is ultimately accountable for receiving, i nvestigating and resolving any patient concerns or problems that cannot be resolved at the staff level? During home visits, ask the patient/family if they know how and whom to contact if they have a complaint. Ask the patient, the patient 's family, guardian or other legal representative, if they have any comments or concerns, or have registered any grievances or complaints about the hospice or its services. If this has already occurred, ask how it was handled and what the results or outcomes were. L506 \u00a7418.52(b)(2) - If a patient has been adjudged incompetent under state law by a court of proper jurisdiction, the rights of the patient are exercised by the person appointed pursuant to state law to act on the patient's behalf. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.52(b)(2) Determine if the rights of a patient adjudged incompetent or who has a representative acting on his/her behalf are exercised by the legally appointed individual. If the hospice is currently caring for a patient who has been adjudged incompet ent, and you have questions concerning the exercise of the patient's rights, you may contact the patient's legal representative about their involvement in planning care, treatment and services decisions. If the patient is selected for a home visit, obtain the legal representative's approval for the visit. L507 \u00a7418.52(b)(3) - If a state court has not adjudged a patient incompetent, any legal representative designated by the patient in accordance with state law may exercise the patient's rights to the exten t allowed by state law. L508 \u00a7418.52(b)(4) - The hospice must: (i) Ensure that all alleged violations involving mistreatment, neglect, or verbal, mental, sexual, and physical abuse, including injuries of unknown source, and misappropriation of patient property by anyone furnishing services on behalf of the hospice, are reported immediately by hospice employees and All patient complaints and alleged or real violations included in this standard must be reported immediately to the hospice administrator and should be investigated, resolved and documented. Abuse means the willful infliction of injury, unreasonable confinement, intimidation, or punishment with resulting physical harm, pain or mental anguish. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 6 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors contracted staff to the hospice administrator; Verbal abuse \" includes the use of oral, written or gestured language that willfully includes disparaging and derogatory terms to patients or their families, or within their hearing distance, regardless of their age, ability to comprehend, or disability. Mental abuse includes, but is not limited to, humiliation, harassment, and threats of punishment or deprivation. Sexual abuse includes, but is not limited to, sexual harassment, sexual coercion, or sexual assault. Physical abuse includes, but is not limited to, hitting, slapping, pinching and kicking. It also includes controlling behavior through corporal punishment. Neglect means failure to provide goods and services necessary to avoid physical harm or mental anguish. \"Misappropriation of patient property means the deliberate misplacement, exploitation, or wrongful, temporary or permanent use of a patient's belongings or money without the patient's consent. Injuries of unknown source - An injury should be classified as an \"injury of unknown source\" when both of the following conditions are met: 1. The source of the injury was not observed by any person or the source of the injury could not be explained by the patient; and 2. The injury is suspicious because of the extent of the injury or the location of the injury (e.g., the injury is located in an area not generally vulnerable to trauma) or the number of injuries observed at one particular point in time or the incidence of injuries over time. Immediately means as soon as possible, but not to exceed 24 hours after discovery of the incident, in the absence of a shorter State time frame requirement. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.52(b)(4)(i) Ask the hospice administrator if he/she has received any reports of the violations listed in the standard and how it was resolved. Is there evidence that all allegations are thoroughly investigated? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 7 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Are staff members able to identify various forms of abuse or neglect? Do staff members know what to do if they witness any violations of mistreatment, abuse, neglect, and injuries of unknown source or misappropriation of patient property? During home vis its, ask patients and families if they have any concerns about how they or their property have been treated by the hospice staff. L509 \u00a7418.52(b)(4)(ii) - Immediately investigate all alleged violations involving anyone furnishing services on behalf of the hospice and immediately take action to prevent further potential violations while the alleged violation is being verified. Investigations and/or documentation of all alleged violations must be conducted in accordance with established procedures; Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.52(b)(4)(ii) Determine what procedures are in place to address how the hospice will protect patients from real or perceived abuse, neglect or exploitation from staff, volunteers, or family members. How does the hospice utilize t hese procedures when necessary? L510 \u00a7418.52(b(4))(iii) - Take appropriate corrective action in accordance with state law if the alleged violation is verified by the hospice administration or an outside body having jurisdiction, such as the State survey agency or local law enforcement agency; and L511 \u00a7418.52(b)(4)(iv) - Ensure that verified violations are reported to State and local bodies having jurisdiction (including to the State Survey and Certification Agency) within 5 working days of becoming awar e of the violation. The hospice has 5 working days from becoming aware of the violation to investigate any alleged violations and, if the alleged violation is verified, it must report the verified violation to the State and local bodies having jurisdiction within those 5 days. If State requirements for reporting verified violations are more stringent than Federal requirements, the more stringent State requirements take precedence. The stringent State requirements may be those that require violations to be reported regardless of whether they are verified or not, or requirements that verified violations be reported in less than 5 days. However, if State requirements are less stringent than Federal requirements, the Federal requirements take precedence. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 8 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L512 \u00a7418.52(c) Standard: Rights of the patient The patient has a right to the following: (1) Receive effective pain management and symptom control from the hospice for conditions related to the terminal illness; Hospices are responsible for managing the patient's pain and symptoms related to the terminal illness and related conditions in a timely fashion. Patients should not have to experience long waits for pain and symptom management, medications, or interventi ons to address the patient's condition. Hospices should have methods in place to assure that the patient's pain, and all other distressing symptoms, are controlled effectively 24 hours a day/7days per week, in all settings and wherever the patient resides. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.52 (c)(1) Ask the hospice to describe its policy for assessing, managing and reassessing pain and other symptoms and how it defines effective pain management and symptom control. Determine how the hospice assures that the patient receives the needed medications in a timely fashion. During the home visit, ask patient/family how quickly the hospice satisfies the patient's request for pain medication or symptom control, during the daytime hours, nights and weekends. Observe the patient for any signs of discomfort. Ask the patient or family, as appropriate, if the patient has been experiencing pain or other symptoms. If so, was this reported to the hospice? If reported, what was t he hospice's response? Have there been any instances where the hospice failed to respond promptly to the patient's request for pain medication or symptom management? L513 \u00a7418.52 (c)(2) - Be involved in developing his or her hospice plan of care; Probes \u00a7418.52(c)(2) Ask staff how they facilitate patient/family participation in planning care. Ask the patient/family how they are involved in planning care. L514 \u00a7418.52 (c)(3) - Refuse care or treatment; While patients have the right to refuse services, probe further if you find a particular trend where a majority or all patients are refusing a particular service (e.g., social work, spiritual counseling, volunteers, etc.,) to assure that patients are fully informed of the service they are refusing and that the hospice is fully prepared to provide the service with qualified personnel. L515 \u00a7418.52(c)(4) - Choose his or her attending physician; Patients have the right to choose their attending physician and to have this person involved in their medical care in all hospice settings as long as the attending physician, in turn, undertakes to provide care for the patient. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 9 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Probe \u00a7418.52(c)(4) Is there any evidence that the hospice does not allow patients to choose their attending physician, or pressures the patient to choose the hospice physician as their attending physician? L516 \u00a7418.52(c)(5) - Have a confidential clinical record. Access to or release of patient information and clinical records is permitted in accordance with 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164. The right to confidential clinical records means safeguarding the content, including paper records and/or electronically stored information from unauthorized disclosure without the specific informed consent of the patient or legal representative. There should be evidence that the hospice ensures the confidentiality of the patient's clinical record. During the survey, observe whether clinical staff shows evidence of protecting the confidentia lity of clinical records. Is patient information posted where visitors or other non- hospice staff can view it? Are clinical records accessible to unauthorized persons who could read or remove the clinical record, thereby violating the patient's privacy? L517 \u00a7418.52(c)(6) - Be free from mistreatment, neglect, or verbal, mental, sexual, and physical abuse, including injuries of unknown source, and misappropriation of patient property; If, during the course of the survey, you identify the possibility of mistreatment, neglect, abuse(s), or injuries of unknown source and misappropriation of patient property, investigate through interviews, observations, and record reviews. Follow all applicable Federal and State survey guidelines and policies when reporting and documenting any instances where you observe violations listed in this standard. Documentation should include who committed the act, the nature of the act, and where and when it occurred. Ensure that the hospice addresses the incident(s) immediately. L518 \u00a7418.52(c)(7) - Receive information about the services covered under the hospice benefit; Medicare covered hospice services are set forth at 42 CFR 418.200 -204. The hospice should fully inform Medicare patients about all Medicare covered hospice servi ces and fully inform non-Medicare patients about any other hospice services that apply to the patient (e.g., Medicaid, private insurance). Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.52(c)(7) Is the patient/family aware of all covered hospice services including the provision of medications related to the terminal condition, continuous care and short -term inpatient care? Discuss whether the hospice has described any services for which the patient might have to pay. Consider the patient's ability to understand and retain coverage information. If the patient cannot locate the information provided by the hospice, documentation in the clinical record that the hospice has provided this information to the patient/family will suffice. Do NOT try to advise the patient about financial, coverage, or payment issues. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 10 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L519 \u00a7418.52(c)(8) - Receive information about the scope of services that the hospice will provide and specific limitations on those services. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.52(c)(8) Ask the patient/family what services they are receiving from the hospice and if they are aware of any limitations to those services. Hospices are required to pr ovide all hospice services necessary for the palliation and management of the terminal illness and related conditions and should not accept patients if they cannot provide these hospice services. See \u00a7418.56(c). For example, a hospice may not accept a pati ent if, due to staffing problems, it is not able to provide hospice aide services in the amount needed to meet the patient's needs. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 11 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L520 \u00a7418.54 Condition of participation : Initial and Comprehensive assessment of the patient L521 \u00a7418.54 - The hospice must conduct and document in writing a patient -specific comprehensive assessment that identifies the patient's need for hospice care and services, and the patient's need for physical, psychosocial, emotional, and spiritual care. This assessment includes all areas of hospice care related to the palliation and management of the terminal illness and related conditions. The comprehensive patient assessment must accurately reflect the patient's current healt h status and include information to establish and monitor a plan of care. Hospices are not required to use specific forms or formats to document their initial or comprehensive assessments. They may choose to document patient specific comprehensive assessments in either written or electronic format provided the assessments are complete, readily identifiable, and available in the patient's clinical record. L522 \u00a7418.54(a) Standard: Initial assessment The hospice registered nurse must complete an initial assessment within 48 hours after the election of hospice care in accordance with \u00a7418.24 is complete (unless the physician, patient, or representative requests that the initial assessment be completed in less than 48 hours.) The purpose of the initial asse ssment is to gather the critical information necessary to treat the patient/ family's immediate care needs. The assessment needs to take place in the location where hospice services are being delivered. The initial assessment is not a \"meet and greet\" visit whereby the hospice introduces itself to the patient/family and begins to evaluate the patient's interest in and appropriateness for hospice care. It must assess the patient's immediate physical, psychosocial, emotional and spiritual status related to the terminal illness and related conditions. The initial assessment is necessary to gather the essential information necessary to begin the plan of care and provide the immediate necessary care and services. The registered nurse (RN) must conduct this initia l assessment. Hospices may choose to send a social worker or other discipline along with the RN to complete the initial assessment. Hospices are free to choose their own method for documenting the initial assessment. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.54(a) Determine through interview, observation and record review if the hospice identified the patient/ family's immediate needs. Did the RN complete the initial assessment within the required time frames? Clinical record documentation should confirm/support t hat time frames are met. Pay particular attention to the effective date/time of the election and the date/time of the completion of the initial assessment. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 12 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L523 \u00a7418.54(b) Standard: Timeframe for completion of the comprehensive assessment The hospice interdisciplinary group, in consultation with the individual's attending physician (if any), must complete the comprehensive assessment no later than 5 calendar days after the election of hospice care in accordance with \u00a7418.24. All members of the IDG must be involved with completing the comprehensive assessment in order to identify the patient/ family's physical, psychosocial, emotional and spiritual needs and contribute to the development of the plan of care to address those needs. The individuals/disciplines that complete the assessment should be consistent with the hospice's own policies and procedures and the discipline's scope of practice. The RN, in consultation with the other members of the IDG, considers the information gathered from the initial assessment as they develop the plan of care and the group determines who should visit the patient/family during the first 5 days of hospice care in accordance with patient/family needs and desires and the hospice's own policies and procedures. The patient may or may not have an attending physician. If the attending physician is unavailable or unresponsive, the hospice physician must assume this role. If the patient does have an attending physician, one or more members of the IDG should consult with this physician in completing the comprehensive assessment. This consultation can occur through phone calls or other means of communication (Fax, e -mails, text messages, etc.,) and will help to acquire a better understanding of the patient and family. Attending physicians can often provide a history of the patient's disease process and family dynamics that can help the hospice make better care planning decisions that address all areas of need related to the terminal illness and related conditions, resulting in improved patient outcomes. The \"election of hospice care\" is the effective date of the election statement. The patient may sign the hospice election statement with a later (not earlier) effective date. Hospices may choose to complete the comprehensive assessment earlier than 5 days after the effective date of the election (e.g., it may complete the comprehensive assessment at the same time the initial assessment is complete d). L524 \u00a7418.54(c) Standard: Content of the comprehensive assessment The comprehensive assessment must identify the physical, psychosocial, emotional, and spiritual needs related to the terminal illness that must be addressed in order to promote the hospice patient's well -being, comfort, and dignity throughout the dying process. The assessment would include, but not be limited to, screening for the following: pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, restlessness, anxiety, sleep disorders, skin integrity, confusion, emotional distress, spiritual needs, support systems, and family need for counseling and education. The hospice would then gather additional information, as necessary, to be able to meet the patient/family needs. For example, in addition to screening the patient for the presence of pain, a comprehensive assessment of the patient's pain based on accepted clinical standards of practice may necessitate gathering the following information, as applicable to the patient: History of pain and its treatment (including non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment); Characteristics of pain, such as: Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 13 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors - Intensity of pain (e.g., as measured on a standardized pain scale); - Descriptors of pain (e.g., burning, stabbing, tingling, aching); - Pattern of pain (e.g., constant or intermittent); - Location and radiation of pain; - Frequency, timing and duration of pain; - Impact of pain on quality of life (e.g., sleeping, functioning, appetite, and mood); - Factors such as activities, care, or treatment that precipitate or exacerbate pain; - Strategies and factors that reduce pain; and - Additional symptoms associated with pain (e.g., nausea, anxiety). Physical examination (ma y include the pain site, the nervous system, mobility and function, and physical, psychological and cognitive status); Current medical conditions and medications; and The patient/ family's goals for pain management and their satisfaction with the current level of pain control. L525 \u00a7418.54(c) - The comprehensive assessment must take into consideration the following factors: (1) The nature and condition causing admission (including the presence or lack of objective data and subjective complaints). L526 \u00a7418.54(c)(2) - Complications and risk factors that affect care planning. L527 \u00a7418.54(c)(3) - Functional status, including the patient's ability to understand and participate in his or her own care. L528 \u00a7418.54(c)(4) - Imminence of death. L529 \u00a7418.54(c)(5) - Severity of symptoms. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.54(c)(1) - (5) Ask clinical staff to describe how they obtain all relevant information necessary to complete the comprehensive assessment. Is there evidence in the clinical record and during home visits that the reasons for admission, complications and risk factors that could affect care planning, functional status, imminence of death, and symptom severity have been identified and are being addressed? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 14 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surve yors L530 \u00a7418.54(c)(6) - Drug profile. A review of all of the patient's prescription and over -the- counter drugs, herbal remedies and other alternative treatments that could affect drug therapy. This includes, but is not limited to, identification of the following: (i) Effectiveness of drug therapy (ii) Drug side effects (iii) Actual or potential drug interactions (iv) Duplicate drug therapy (v) Drug therapy currently associated with laboratory monitoring. In reviewing the patient 's prescribed and over-the -counter medications and any additional substance that could affect drug therapy, the hospice must consider drug effectiveness, side effects, interactions of drugs, duplicate drugs and drugs associated with laboratory testing which could affect the patient. In addition, the hospice should consider both the use of pharmacological and non- pharmacological interventions to promote the patient 's comfort level and sense of wellbeing based on the assessment of patient needs and desires. M edication Interaction is the impact of another substance (such as another medication, nutritional supplement (including herbal products), food, or substances used in diagnostic studies) upon a medication 's action. The interactions may alter absorption, di stribution, metabolism, or elimination. These interactions may decrease the effectiveness of the medication or increase the potential for adverse consequences. Duplicate therapy\" refers to multiple medications of the same pharmacological class/category o r any medication therapy that substantially duplicates a particular effect of another medication that the individual is taking. Non -pharmacological interventions refers to approaches to care that do not involve medications, generally directed towards st abilizing or improving a person's mental, physical or psychosocial wellbeing . There should be evidence in the clinical record that common side effects of medications are anticipated and preventive measures are implemented. The hospice should review each p atient 's medications and monitor for medication effectiveness, actual or potential medication -related effects, duplicate drug therapy and untoward interactions during each update to the comprehensive assessment, and as needed as new medications are added or change d, or the patient 's condition changes. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.54(c)(6) Ask clinical staff to describe their process/policy of drug regimen/medication review including: How potential adverse effects and drug reactions are identified? What process is followed when a patient/family is found to be noncompliant? What non-pharmacological methods are considered to relieve pain and other symptoms? How patients and families are educated about effective pain and symptom management. What process th e hospice utilizes to assess and measure pain and other uncomfortable symptoms. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 15 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors What procedures or protocols the hospice uses to reassess pain and symptom management. How the hospice monitors a patient when they begin a new medication, increase/ decrease a dosage or discontinue a medication. During the home visit, ask the patient/caregiver what medications (prescription and over- the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, etc.) the patient is currently taking and compare this information with the medications documented within the plan of care. Are the patient's preferences/goals for pain management and symptom control followed and achieved? L531 \u00a7418.54(c) (7) - Bereavement. A n initial bereavement assessment of the needs of the patient's family and other individuals focusing on the social, spiritual, and cultural factors that may impact their ability to cope with the patient's death. Information gathered from the initial bereav ement assessment must be incorporated into the plan of care and considered in the bereavement plan of care. Although a bereavement plan is initiated after the death of the patient, prior to the death, the hospice must assess any grief/loss issues of the pa tient's family through an initial bereavement risk assessment that is incorporated in the plan of care. Bereavement issues continue to be part of the ongoing assessments, and the bereavement plan of care after death is based on all these assessments. Bereavement services may be offered prior to the death when the initial assessment, comprehensive assessment, or updates to the assessment identifies the need for the patient/family. Social, spiritual and cultural factors that may impact a family member or other individual's ability to cope with the patient's death would include, but not be limited to: History of previous losses; Family problems; Financial concerns; Communication issues; Drug and alcohol abuse; Health concerns; Legal and financial concern; Mental health issues; Presence or absence of a support system; and Feelings of despair, anger, guilt or abandonment. These issues may not be readily apparent during the initial bereavement risk assessment, but should be incorporated into the hospice plan of care if they become evident, and must be considered in the bereavement plan of care. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 16 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.54(c)(7) What evidence is present which shows that the hospice conducted an initial bereavement risk assessment? Does the plan of care reflect/address the bereavement issues identified in the assessment? L532 \u00a7418.54(c)(8) - The need for referrals and further evaluation by appropriate health professional s. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.54(c)(8) Ask the hospice how they determine the need to refer a patient or family member(s) to appropriate health professionals for further evaluation. L533 \u00a7418.54(d) Standard: Update of the comprehensive assessment The update of the comprehensive assessment must be accomplished by the hospice interdisciplinary group (in collaboration with the individual's attending physician, if any) and must consider changes that have taken place since the initial assessment. It must include information on the patient's progress toward desired outcomes, as well as a reassessment of the patient's response to care. The assessment update must be accomplished as frequently as the condition of the patient requires, but no less frequently than every 15 days. Hospices are free to choose their own method for documenting updates to the assessment. The hospice should evaluate and document the patient 's response to the care, treatment and services provided, and progress toward desired outcomes. The purpose of updating the assessment is to ensure that the hospice IDG has the most recent accurate information about the patient/family in order to make accurate care planning decisions. Assessment updates should be easily identified in the clinical record. Hospices are required to update the comprehensive assessment as frequently as the condition of the patient requires, which may be more frequently than every 15 days. The hospice must ensure that each update is completed no later than 15 days from the pre vious one. Hospices are not required to complete, in full, those documents that they identified as comprising their comprehensive assessment every 15 days, although hospices are free to do so if they so choose. They are required to identify and document if there were no changes in the patient/family condition or needs. There should be evidence that the IDG identifies through its ongoing assessments when a change is needed to the plan of care and evidence that the patient/family receives the care and servic es necessitated by the change. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.54(d) Determine through interview, observation and record review if there is evidence that all members of the IDG are actively involved in evaluating the patient's care, so that the patient receives the benefit of the full IDG s assessment. L534 \u00a7418.54(e) Standard: Patient outcome measures (1) The comprehensive assessment must include data elements that allow for Examples of data elements that would allow for the measurement of outcomes include, but are not limited to, patient reported data on outcomes of treatment for pain, dyspnea, Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 17 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors measurement of outcomes. The hospice must measure and document data in the same way for all patients. The data elements must take into consideration aspects of care related to hospice and palliation. nausea, vomiting, constipation, emotional distress, and spiritual needs. For example, a hospice may choose to measure patients whose pain is controlled within 48 hours of admission. Incorporating a data element into the initial assessment and comprehensive assessment will identify the patients that had pain upon admission and identify the patients that had their pain controlled within 48 hours. L535 \u00a7418.54(e)(2) The data elements must be an integral part of the comprehensive assessment and must be documented in a systematic and retrievable way for each patient. The data elements for each patient must be used in individual patient care planning and in the coordination of services, and must be used in the aggregate for the hospice's quality assessment and performance improvement program. Procedures \u00a7418.54(e)(2) Interview key staff and have them explain the hospice's system of documentation and retrieval of patient specific data elements. Ask to see a copy of the data elements that comprise the hospice's comprehensive assessment. Have the hospice explain how they use these data elements in care planning, coordination of services and in their quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) program. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 18 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L536 \u00a7418.56 Condition of participation: Interdisciplinary group, care planning, and coordination of services L537 \u00a7418.56 - The hospice must designate an interdisciplinary group or groups as specified in paragraph (a) of this section which, in consultation with the patient's attending physician, must prepare a written plan of care for each patient. The physician member of the IDG may be the hospice medical director or another hospice physician who is employed by or under contract with the hospice. The nurse, social worker and counselor members of the IDG must be hospice employees or emp loyees of the agency or organization of which the hospice is a sub-division (e.g., a hospital) who are appropriately trained and assigned to the hospice. Probes \u00a7418.56 Ask the hospice how it assures that a written plan of care is developed for each pati ent with full participation of the IDG members in consultation with the patient's attending physician, if any. Request documentation that verifies that all IDG members participated in each patient- specific written plan of care. L538 \u00a7418.56 - The plan of care must specify the hospice care and services necessary to meet the patient and family -specific needs identified in the comprehensive assessment as such needs relate to the terminal illness and related conditions. There should be a direct link between t he needs identified in the patient/family assessment and the plan of care developed by the hospice. Hospices may identify needs in the comprehensive assessment that are not related to the terminal illness and related conditions, and should document that they are aware of these needs and note who is addressing them. Hospices are not required to provide direct services to meet needs unrelated to the terminal illness. Hospices are responsible for including services and treatments in the plan of care that addre ss how they will meet the patient and family -specific needs related to the terminal illness and related conditions. The medical director and/or other hospice physician is responsible for meeting the medical needs of the patient according to \u00a7418.64(a)(3) per the patient's attending physician's request or when the hospice is unable to contact the attending physician to a ddress the patient's medical needs. L539 \u00a7418.56(a) Standard: Approach to service delivery (1) The hospice must designate an interdisciplinary group or groups composed of individuals who work together to meet the physical, medical, psychosocial, emotional, and spiritual needs of the hospice patients and families facing terminal illness and Memb ers of the IDG must be appropriately trained in the hospice philosophy and competent to perform in their assigned area(s). The hospice may involve other members of the care team in the IDG s activities. Supervision of care by the IDG members may be acco mplished by face -to- face or telephonic conferences, evaluations, discussions and general oversight, as well as by direct observations. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 19 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors bereavement. Interdisciplinary group members must provide the care and services offered by the hospice, and the group, in its entirety, must supervise the care and services.

Facilitating exchange of information among staff and patient/caregiver. Developing a mechanism whereby a continual flow of information regarding patient/family needs are made available to the IDG staff. L540 \u00a7418.56(a)(1) - The hospice must designat e a registered nurse that is a member of the interdisciplinary group to provide coordination of care and to ensure continuous assessment of each patient's and family's needs and implementation of the interdisciplinary plan of care. Procedures and Probes \u00a74 18.56(a)(1) Ask the administrator to identify the individual(s) designated as the RN coordinator(s). How does this person assure that coordination of care and continuous assessment of needs occur among staff providing services to the patient/family so that all members of the IDG are kept informed of the patient/ family's status? L541 \u00a7418.56(a)(1) - The interdisciplinary group must include, but is not limited to, individuals who are qualified and competent to practice in the following professional roles: (i) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy (who is an employee or under contract with the hospice). (ii) A registered nurse. (iii) A social worker. (iv) A pastoral or other counselor. The number of individuals on the IDG is not as important as their qualifications and abilities. For example, if a group member meets the hospice criteria and is licensed as a registered nurse and also meets the Medicare criteria to be considered a social w orker under the hospice benefit, he/she would be qualified to serve on the IDG as both a nurse and a social worker. Procedures \u00a7418.56(a)(1)(i)-(iv) Determine through interview, observation and record review that all disciplines comprising the IDG contri bute to the patient's comprehensive and ongoing assessments and care planning process. L542 \u00a7418.56(a)(2) - If the hospice has more than one interdisciplinary group, it must identify a specifically designated interdisciplinary group to establish policies governing the day-to-day provision of hospice care and services. If the hospice has more than one IDG, it may select members from different IDGs to serve on the IDG that establishes the hospice's policies, as long as all required disciplines are represente d (e.g., physician, RN, social worker, counselor). Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 20 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L543 \u00a7418.56(b) Standard : Plan of care All hospice care and services furnished to patients and their families must follow an individualized written plan of care established by the hospice interdisciplinary group in collaboration with the attending physician (if any), the patient or representative, and the primary caregiver in accordance with the patient's needs if any of them so desire. L544 \u00a7418.56(b) - The hospice must ensure that each patient and the primary care giver(s) receive education and training provided by the hospice as appropriate to their responsibilities for the care and services identified in the plan of care. L545 \u00a7418.56(c) Standard: Content of the plan of care The hospice must develop an individualized written plan of care for each patient. The plan of care must reflect patient and family goals and interventions based on the problems identified in the initial, comprehensive, and upda ted comprehensive assessments. The plan of care must include all services necessary for the palliation and management of the terminal illness and related conditions, including the following: Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.56(c) Determine through interview /observation and record review if the plan of care identifies all the services needed to address problems identified in the initial, comprehensive and updated assessments. Is there evidence of patients receiving the medication/treatments ordered? Are plans of care individualized and patient -specific? Does the plan of care integrate changes based on assessment findings? Is there documentation to support that the development of the plan of care was a collaborative effort involving all members of the IDG and the attending physician, if any? The attending physician and the IDG members do not have to sign the plan of care but there must be documentation of their involvement. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 21 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L546 \u00a7418.56(c)(1) - Interventions to manage pain and symptoms. The goal of effective pain and symptom management is quality of life. When the pain and symptoms that cause distress to the patient are effectively managed, the patient and family are better able to focus on their vision of a \"good death.\" Effective pain and symptom management include the ongoing assessment of the patient's physical, psychosocial, emotional and spiritual needs and re -evaluating the effectiveness of the current plan of care in order to address those needs. There should be evidence in the clinical record and on home visits that the hospice treats patient's symptoms such as pain, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, constipation, dyspnea, emotional distress, insomnia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and spiritual needs using accepted professional standards of practice. The hospice may also include the use of alternative therapies in the plan of care, to benefit hospice patients/families (e.g., art, yoga, massage, music and light therapy). Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.56(c)(1) Ask clinical managers and hospice staff about specific patients, including information about the patient's condition and what interventions are being used to manage pain and ease symptoms. Is there evidence the hospice proactively anticipates potential medication side - effects and implements preventive measures to address them? During home visits, observe the patient's comfort level. Is the patient satisfied with his/her level of comfort? Ask the patient or family if they have ever had to call the hospice because the patient's pain or symptoms were out of control. If so, what was the hospice's response? If the interventions or care provided do not appear to be consistent with current standards of practice and/or the patient's pain appears to persist or recur, interview one or more health care professionals as necessary (e.g., hospice nurse, physician member of the IDG) who, by virtue of training and knowledge of the patie nt, should be able to provide information about the evaluation and management of the patient's pain/symptoms. Depending on the issue, ask about: How chosen interventions were determined to be appropriate; How they guide and oversee the selection of pain management interventions; The rationale for not intervening, if pain was identified for which no intervention was implemented; Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 22 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Changes in pain characteristics that may warrant review or revision of interventions; and When and with whom the professional discussed the effectiveness, ineffectiveness and possible adverse consequences of pain management interventions. L547 \u00a7418.56(c)(2) - A detailed statement of the scope and frequency of services necessary to meet the specific patient and family needs. The use of visit ranges in the patient plan of care should follow these parameters: The plan of care may include a range of visits and PRN (Latin abbreviation for pro re nata - as needed; as circu mstances require) orders for visit frequencies to ensure the most appropriate level of service is provided to the patient. A range of visits is acceptable as long as it continues to meet the identified needs of the patient/family. Visit ranges with s mall intervals are acceptable (i.e., 1 -3 visits/week; 2 -4 visits/week) but ranges that include \"0\" as a frequency are not allowed. The IDG may exceed the number of visits in the range to address patient/ family's needs. There should be documentation in t he record to support the need for the extra visit(s). If the patient requires frequent use of PRN visits, the plan of care should be updated to include the need for additional visits. Standing orders or routine orders must be individualized to address the specific patient's needs and signed by the patient's physician. The IDG should be proactive in developing each patient's plan of care by planning ahead for anticipated patient changes and needs. Decisions should reflect the patient/family preferences rather than be solely a response to a crisis. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.56(c)(2) Ask the clinical manager and other IDG members to describe: What criteria are used to assess the needs of the patient and family? Who is involved in this process? How the IDG decides what services the patient will receive? How the hospice evaluates if the services provided are continuing to meet the patients and families needs? How the hospice monitors the delivery of services, including those provided under arrangement or contract, to ensure compliance with the hospice philosophy? During the home visit, ask the patient/family if they are aware of all the services included in the hospice benefit. If they are not able to describe them, ask to see any information/documentation the hospice may have left with them describing these services. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 23 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Ask the patient/family who comes to see them from the hospice, how often they come, what services they provide and if they are provided in a timely manner. Are they satisfied with the level of services they are receiving?

Probes \u00a7418.56(e)(5) What systems are in place to facilitate the exchange of information and coordination of services among staff and with other non-hospice healthcare providers? How does the hospice ensure that coordination of care occurs between services provided directly and those under arrangement? Is there documentation in the clinical record of the sharing of information between all disciplines providing care and with other healthcare providers furnishing services to t he patient? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 25 Tag Number Regulations Guidance to Surveyors L559 \u00a7418.58 Condition of participation : Quality assessment and performance improvement L560 \u00a7418.58 - The hospice must develop, implement, and maintain an effective, ongoing, hospice -wide data-driven quality assessment and performance improvement program. The hospice's governing body must ensure that the program: reflects the complexity of its organization and services; involves all hospice services (including those services furnished under contract or arrangement); focuses on indicators related to improved palliative outcomes; and takes actions to demonstrate improvement in hospice performance. The hospice must maintain documentary evidence of its quality assessment and performance improvem ent program and be able to demonstrate its operation to CMS. The condition requires each hospice to develop its own QAPI program to meet its needs. Hospice outcome measures, data elements, tools, and instructions for using them have been developed by the hospice industry and quality improvement organizations. Quality improvement in hospice is a developing field. The methods used by the hospice for self - assessment are flexible and may include a review of current documentation (e.g., review of clinical record s, incident reports, complaints, patient satisfaction surveys, etc.); patient care, direct observation of clinical performance, operating systems and interviews with patients and/or staff. The information gathered by the hospice should be based on criteria and/or measures generated by the medical and professional/technical staffs and reflect hospice best practice patterns, staff performance, and patient outcomes. Ongoing means that there is a continuous and periodic collection and assessment of data. Assessment of such data enables areas of potential problems to be identified and indicates additional data that should be collected and assessed in order to identify whether a problem exists. The following elements should be considered within the QAPI plan how ever it is structured: Program objectives; All patient care disciplines; Description of how the program will be administered and coordinated; Methodology for monitoring and evaluating the quality of care; Priorities for resolution of problems; Monitoring to determine effectiveness of action; Oversight responsibility reports to governing body; and Documentation of the review of its own QAPI program. The fundamental purpose of the QAPI CoP is to set a clear expectation that hospices must take a proactive approach to improve their performance, and focus on improved patient/family care and activities that impact patient health and safety. CMS stresses th e improvement in systems in order to improve processes and patient outcomes. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 26 Tag Number Regulations Guidance to Surveyors Hospices must have all of the components of a QAPI program in place hospice -wide. CMS expects hospices to demonstrate, with objective data, that improvements have taken place in actual care outcomes, processes of care, patient/family satisfaction levels, h ospice operations, or other performance indicators. The QAPI program will be evaluated for its hospice -wide effectiveness on the quality of care provided and activities that impact upon patient health and safety. The impact of the program can be assessed by looking at data gathered and compared at different points in time, and actions taken based on that comparison. The hospice should be analyzing data and evaluating the effectiveness of their own program continually. The organized hospice -wide QAPI program must be ongoing and have a written plan of impleme ntation. Opportunities to improve care should be applied on a hospice -wide basis, when appropriate. The hospice takes and documents remedial action when problems are identified and evaluates the outcome of these actions. The results must be transmitted to the governing body to fulfill its responsibility to ensure an effective QAPI program. Quality assessment and performance improvement is a process of continual assessment of a hospice's performance with implementation of solutions, assessment of the effect iveness of the solutions, and evaluations to determine how it can do even better. The QAPI program fosters the continual striving of improvement of the delivery of care and services provided by a hospice. Performance improvement fosters a \"blame -free\" envi ronment and encourages hospices to evaluate the operating systems and processes in the agency instead of fixing one problem at a time. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.58 Hospices are required to collect and analyze patient care and administrative quality data and to use that data to identify, prioritize, implement, and evaluate performance improvement projects to improve the quality of services furnished to hospice patients. In order to assess compliance with the QAPI requirements and to assess the adequacy and appropriateness of a hospice's QAPI program, request the following: Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 27 Tag Number Regulations Guidance to Surveyors The hospice' s aggregated data and its analysis of that data; The hospice's QAPI plan; The individuals responsible for the QAPI program; Evidence that the QAPI system has been implemented and is functioning effectively, including evidence of: - Regular meetings; - Investigation and analysis of sentinel and adverse events; - Recommendat ions or options for systemic change to prevent recurrence of sentinel or adverse events; - Identified performance measures that are tracked and analyzed; and - Regular review and use of the QAPI analyses by hospice management and the governing body to ma ke systemic improvements. Any other necessary resources needed to assess a hospice's compliance. This information will allow you to match the data provided by the hospice with the actual experiences of hospice employees and patients to ensure that the QAPI program is prevalent throughout the hospice's operations and services, and that it is positively influencing patient care. Focus on areas such as how and why the hospice chose its quality measures, how it ensures consistent data collection, how it uses data in patient care planning, and how it aggregates and analyzes data. Ask the hospice how it use s the data analysis to select performance improvement projects, how it implements such projects, and how it uses the data to evaluate the effectiveness of those projects. While a copy of QAPI meeting minutes may be an acceptable method of demonstrating tha t regular meetings were held, alternate evidence may be acceptable. Surveyors may not require copies of meeting minutes unless the meeting minutes are judged to be essential to an assessment of whether the QAPI actually analyzed an adverse or sentinel even t that is the subject of a complaint investigation or standard survey. Essential in this context means that there is not alternate evidence that suffices to address the central question of whether an assessment that meets CMS requirements was conducted. Al ternate evidence, for example, may be a recommendation for systemic change that was sufficiently detailed that a reasonable person would conclude the recommendation was based on competent analysis. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 28 Tag Number Regulations Guidance to Surveyors L561 \u00a7418.58(a) Standard: Program scope (1) The program must at least be capable of showing measurable improvement in indicators related to improved palliative outcomes and hospice services. L562 \u00a7418.58(a)(2) - The hospice must measure, analyze, and track quality indicators, including adverse patient events, and other aspects of performance that enable the hospice to assess processes of care, hospice services, and operations. Hospices are required to assess quality in all areas of operations that might be a dversely affecting patient care or core hospice services. There is a specific requirement to track adverse events (as they are defined in hospice policy) and reduce their occurrence where possible. They must be able to show (using quantitative data or othe r means) that they can improve quality, as measured by their own indicators or measures. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.58(a)(2) Does the hospice adhere to its definition of adverse event when tracking and monitoring and implementing preventive actions f or these events? Does the hospice's QAPI program measure, analyze and track quality indicators related to processes of care, hospice services and operations? L563 \u00a7418.58(b) Standard: Program data (1) The program must use quality indicator data, including patient care, and other relevant data, in the design of its program. Hospices must not limit their QAPI data collection efforts to the data collected during patient assessments. Data collection must look beyond patient assessment data to examine all facets of a hospice's operation. All patient services and all activities that may impact patient/family care should be evaluated as part of the QAPI program. This would include but not be limited to: physician services, nursing services, medical social services, counseling services, clinical records, infection control, pharmaceutical services, durable medical equipment (DME), patient rights, administrative services, contract services, volunteers, hospice aide and adverse events. Whatever measures the h ospice chooses to assess quality should be monitored regularly so that opportunities for improvement can be identified and prioritized. Data should be collected in a timely manner so that measures can be reported on the schedule set up by the hospice. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.58(b)(1) Is the hospice 's QAPI program data -driven? Is there evidence that the hospice uses the data collected to identify opportunities for improvement? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 29 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L564 \u00a7418.58(b(2) - The hospice must use the data collected to do the following: (i) Monitor the effectiveness and safety of services and quality of care. (ii) Identify opportunities and priorities for improvement. L565 \u00a7418.58(b(3) - The frequency and detail of the data collection must be approved by the hospice's governing body. The governing body may assume hands -on control of the QAPI program to ensure that the program is in compliance with this rule, or it may choose to appoint one or more individua ls to handle the structure and administration of the QAPI program. The governing body retains ultimate responsibility for the actions of the designated individual(s). L566 \u00a7418.58(c) Standard : Program activities (1) The hospice's performance improvement activities must: (i) Focus on high risk, high volume, or problem -prone areas. L567 \u00a7418.58(c)(1)(ii) - Consider incidence, prevalence, and severity of problems in those areas. L568 \u00a7418.58(c)(1)(iii) - Affect palliative outcomes, patient safety, and quality of care. Outcomes are the results of care provided; palliative outcomes are the results of palliative care provided. L569 \u00a7418.58(c)(2) - Performance improvement activities must track adverse patient events , analyze their causes, and implement preventive actions and mechanisms that include feedback and learning throughout the hospice. Hospices may choose to develop their own definition for the term \"adverse event\" or use a definition developed by a national accrediting organization or industry organization. Once a hospice has identified the definition of an adverse event, it is responsible for adhering to the definition when tracking and analyzing these events and when implementing preventive actions. In gene ral, an adverse event would be any action or inaction by a hospice that caused harm to a hospice patient. However, hospices are not bound to use this generic description. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 30 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L570 \u00a7418.58(c)(3) - The hospice must take actions aimed at performance improvement and, after implementing those actions, the hospice must measure its success and track performance to ensure that improvements are sustained. Hospices must consider how often certain quality issues arise and th e severity of potential harm when prioritizing opportunities for improvement. When adverse event monitoring reveals a problem area, the hospice must implement changes designed to decrease occurrence of the adverse event. The hospice must assure that the ne w process is implemented hospice -wide and that it is effective in reducing the adverse event. For performance improvement in all areas of operations, the hospice must monitor the level of improvement over time to be sure that it is sustained. Procedures a nd Probes \u00a7418.58(c)(3) Determine if the hospice has taken appropriate action to correct problems identified by the QAPI program. Examine reports and minutes of QAPI meetings to determine if the hospice has documented the remedial action and its outcome. Examples of appropriate remedial action may include, but are not limited to changes in policies and procedures. Is there evidence that the hospice continues to monitor performance to ensure that improvements are sustained? L571 \u00a7418.58(d) Standard: Performance improvement projects Beginning February 2, 2009, hospices must develop, implement and evaluate performance improvement projects. L572 \u00a7418.58(d)(1) - The number and scope of distinct performance improvement projects conducted annually, based on the needs of the hospice's population and internal organizational needs, must reflect the scope, complexity, and past performance of the hospice's services and operations. L573 \u00a7418.58(d)(2) - The hospice must document what p erformance improvement projects are being conducted, the reasons for conducting these projects, and the measurable progress achieved on these projects. There is no requirement for hospices to conduct a specific number of performance improvement projects. They must select the number and topics of projects based on the results of their quality monitoring and other quality information such as the results of State or accreditation surveys. Performance improvement projects must be documented in written form and include the elements outlined in the standard. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 31 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.58(d)(2) Do the number and scope of performance improvement projects conducted by the hospice accurately reflect the scope, complexity and past performance of the hospice? Are all performance improvement projects appropriately documented? L574 \u00a7418.58(e) Standard: Executive responsibilities The hospice's governing body is responsible for ensuring the following: (1) That an ongoing program for quality improvement and patient safety is defined, implemented, and maintained, and is evaluated annua lly. L575 \u00a7418.58(e)(2) - That the hospice -wide quality assessment and performance improvement efforts address priorities for improved quality of care and patient safety, and that all improvement actions are evaluated for effectiveness. L576 \u00a7418.58(e) (3) - That one or more individual(s) who are responsible for operating the quality assessment and performance improvement program are designated. The governing body is responsible for assuring that the QAPI program is working to address any problem areas i n patient care and hospice operations, and to improve performance in these areas. The governing body must also appoint individuals who will operate the QAPI program for the hospice. Probes \u00a7418.58(e)(3) Do hospice records indicate that the hospice's governing body is involved in oversight of the QAPI program? Is there an individual appointed by the governing body who is responsible for operating the QAPI program? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 32 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L577 \u00a7418.60 Condition of participation : Infection control L578 \u00a7418.60 - The hospice must maintain and document an effective infection control program that protects patients, families, visitors, and hospice personnel by preventing and controlling infections and communicable diseases. The hospice infection control program must identify risks for the acquisition and transmission of infectious agents in all settings where patients reside. There needs to be a system to communicate with all hospice personnel, patients, families and visitors about infection prevention and control issues including their role in preventing the spread of infections and communicable dis eases through daily activities. The hospice's infection control program may include, but not be limited to the following: Educating staff on the science of infectious disease transmission; Protocols for addressing patient care issues and prevention of infection related to infusion therapy, urinary tract care, respiratory tract care, and wound care; Guidelines on caring for patients with multi -drug resistant organism; Policies on protecting patients, staff and families from blood borne or airborne pathogens; Monitoring staff for compliance with hospice policies and procedures related to infection control; and Protocols for educating staff and families in standard precautions and the prevention and control of infection. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.60 Ask the hospice what steps it takes to assure that staff take appropriate infection and communicable disease prevention and control precautions, including educating the patient and families about their role in communicating the information to others who may have contact with the patient. How does the hospice ensure that patients/families receive timely instruction regarding standard precautions to follow in preventing and controlling infections and communicable diseases? If the hospice provides inpatient care directly, observe for appropriate infection prevention and control precautions including signage or other posted information or materials in patient rooms or staff areas. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 33 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L579 \u00a7418.60(a) Standard: Prevention The hospice must follow accepted standards of practice to prevent the transmission of infections and communicable diseases, including the use of standard precautions. Accepted standards of practice for health care providers are typically developed by government agencies, professional organizations and associations. Examples would include, but not be limited to, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, State Practice Acts, and commonly accepted health standards established by national organizations, boards, and councils (e.g., Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), American Nurses Association etc.) Standard Precautions are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions (except sweat), non-intact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard Precautions include a group of infection prevention practices that apply to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status, in any setting in which healthcare is delivered. These include: hand hygiene; use of gloves, gown, mask, eye protection, or face shield, depending on the anticipated exposure; and safe injection practices. Also, equipment or items in the patient environment likely to have been contaminated with infectious body fluids must be handled in a manner to prevent transmission of infectious agents (e.g., wearing gloves for direct contact, contain heavily soiled equipment, properly clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable equipment before use on another patient). (Excerpt from CDC \"Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings 2007.\") Any deficiency cited as a violation of accepted standards of practice must have a copy of the applicable standard of practice provided to the hospice along with the statement of deficiencies. A hospice may also be surveyed for compliance with State pract ice acts for each relevant discipline. Any deficiency cited as a violation of a State practice act must reference the applicable section of the State practice act allegedly violated, and a copy of that section of the act must be provided to the hospice along with the statement of deficiencies. Procedures \u00a7418.60(a) During home visits, observe the hospice's practices related to prevention and transmission of infections and communicable diseases and use of standard precautions. L580 \u00a7418.60(b) Standard: Control The hospice must maintain a coordinated agency- wide program for the surveillance, identification, prevention, control, and investigation of infectious and communicable diseases that \u2014 Examples of infection control practices tha t the hospice may use include monitoring work related employee illness and infections, analyzing them in relation to patient infections, and taking appropriate actions when an infection or communicable disease is present to prevent its spread among staff, patients, family and visitors. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 34 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors (1) Is an integral part of the hospice's quality assessment and performance improvement program; and Surveillance data should be routinely reviewed and monitored. Appropriate corrective actions need to be taken based on the data analysis. The hospice must use this information as a part of its QAPI program. L581 \u00a7418.60(b)(2) - Includes the following: (i) A method of identifying infectious and communicable disease problems; and (ii) A plan for implementing the appropriate actions that are expected to result in improvement and disease prevention. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.60(b)(2) Ask the hospice to explain the method(s) it uses to identify infectious and communicable disea se problems. Does the hospice redesign its strategies to improve its infection prevention and control policies when it identifies problems? If you have concerns, ask to review the hospice's policies related to infection control and communicable diseases. L582 \u00a7418.60(c) Standard: Education The hospice must provide infection control education to employees, contracted providers, patients, and family members and other caregivers. Probes \u00a741 8.60(c) Is hospice staff (direct employees and contacted staff) aware of infection control principles and procedures? Do they demonstrate this knowledge during home visits? During home visits ask the patient/family or other caregivers to describe infection control education they have received. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 35 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L583 \u00a7418.62 Condition of participation : Licensed professional services. L584 \u00a7418.62 (a) - Licensed professional services provided directly or under arrangement must be authorized, delivered, and supervised only by health care professionals who meet the appropriate qualifications specified under \u00a7418.114 and who practice under the hospice's policies and procedures. Licensed professional services, for purposes of this section, would include, but not be limited to, skilled nursing care, physical therapy, speech language pathology, occupational therapy, and medical social services. L585 \u00a7418.62(b) - Licensed professionals must actively participate in the coordination of all aspects of the patient's hospice care, in accordance with current professional standards and practice, including participating in ongoing interdisciplinary comprehensive assessments, developing and evaluating the plan of care, and contributing to patient and family counseling and education; and L586 \u00a7418.62(c) - Licensed professionals must participate in the hospice's quality assessment and performance improvement program and hospice sponsored in-service training. Procedures and Probe s \u00a7418.62(c) Interview key staff to determine how the hospice ensures that licensed professionals participate in their QAPI and in-service training programs. What evidence is there that all employees (direct and contracted) have been properly oriente d to the tasks they are expected to perform, participate in the appropriate hospice in- service training programs, and demonstrate the appropriate skills, when needed, in practice? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 36 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L587 \u00a7418.64 Condition of participation : Core services L588 \u00a7418.64 - A hospice must routinely provide substantially all core services directly by hospice employees. These services must be provided in a manner consistent with acceptable standards of practice. These services include nursing services, medical social services, and counseling. The hospice may contract for physician services as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. L589 \u00a7418.64 - A hospice may use contracted staff, if necessary, to supplement hospice employees in order to meet the needs of patients under extraordinary or other non -routine circumstances. A hospice may also enter into a written arrangement with another Medicare certified hospice program for the provision of core services to supplement hospice employee/staff to meet the needs of patients. Circumstances under which a hospice may enter into a written arrangement for the provision of core services include: unanticipated periods of high patient loads, staffing shortages due to illness or other short- term temporary situations that interrupt patient care; and temporary travel of a patient outside of the hospice's service area. Employee means a person who: (1) works for the hospice and for whom the hospice is required to issue a W -2 form on his or her behalf; or (2) if the hospice is a subdivision of an agency or organization, an employee of the agency or organization who is assigned to t he hospice; or (3) is a volunteer under the jurisdiction of the hospice. If a contracting service or agency pays the individual, and is required to issue a form W -2 on the individual's behalf, or if the individual is self -employed, the individual is not considered a hospice employee. Extraordinary circumstances generally would be a short -term temporary event that was unanticipated. Examples of such circumstances might include, but are not limited to, unanticipated periods of high patient loads (such as an unexpectedly large number of patients requiring continuous care simultaneously), staffing shortages due to illness, receiving patients evacuated from a disaster such as a hurricane or a wildfire, or temporary travel of a patient outside the hospice's serv ice area. If a hospice chooses to contract with another Medicare-certified hospice or a non- hospice entity, the contracting hospice must maintain professional management responsibility for the services provided, in accordance with \u00a7418.100(e). Probes \u00a7418.64 How does the hospice assure that all contract providers receive training in the hospice's philosophy and care before providing services to patients? L590 \u00a7418.64(a) Standard: Physician services The hospice medical director, physician employees, and contracted physician(s) of the hospice, in conjunction with the patient's attending physician, are responsible for the The medical director may also serve as the physician member of the IDG. Probe \u00a7418.64(a) Is there evidence that the medical needs of t he patients are being met by the hospice physician for patients who do not have an attending physician or when the attending physician is unresponsive or unavailable? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 37 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors palliation and management of the terminal illness and conditions related to the terminal illness. (1) All physician employees and those under contract, must function under the supervision of the hospice medical director. (2) All physician employees and those under contract shall meet this requir ement by either providing the services directly or through coordinating patient care with the attending physician. (3) If the attending physician is unavailable, the medical director, contracted physician, and/or hospice physician employee is responsible for meeting the medical needs of the patient. L591 \u00a7418.64(b) Standard: Nursing services (1) The hospice must provide nursing care and services by or under the supervision of a registered nurse. Nursing services must ensure that the nursing needs of the patient are met as identified in the patient's initial assessment, comprehensive assessment, and updated assessments. L592 \u00a7418.64(b)(2) - If State law permits registered nurses to see, treat, and write orders for patients, then registered nurses may provide services to beneficiaries receiving hospice care. If an RN, including a nurse practitioner, advanced practice nurse, etc., is permitted by State law and regulation to see, treat, and write orders, then the R.N. may perform this function while providing nursing services for hospice patients. Hospices are free to us e the services of all types of advanced practice nurses within their respective scopes of practice to enhance the nursing care furnished to its patients. Services provided by a nurse practitioner (NP) who is not the patient's attending physician, are included under nursing care. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 38 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L593 \u00a7418.64(b)(3) - Highly specialized nursing services that are provided so infrequently that the provision of such services by direct hospice employees would be impracticable and prohibitively expensive, may be provided under contract. Highly specialized services, such as complex wound care and infusion specialties, are determined by the nature of the service and the nursing skill level required to be proficient in the service. For example, a hospice may need to contract with a pediatric nurse because of the very infrequent pediatric patients the hospice cares for and that to employee a pediatric nurse would be impracticable and expensive. Continuous care is not a highly specialized service, because while time intensive, it does not require highly specialized nursing skills. L594 \u00a7418.64(c) Standard: Medical social services Medical social services must be provided by a qualified social worker, under the direction of a physician. So cial work services must be based on the patient's psychosocial assessment and the patient's and family's needs and acceptance of these services. The social worker's services are provided in accordance with the plan of care. Because social work services must be provided under the direction of a physician, physician approval of the plan of care will satisfy the intent of this requirement. The psychosocial assessment i s an evolving document that is revised as new information is acquired and as progress toward goals is made. The psychosocial assessment may also include the bereavement risk assessment. The purpose of the psychosocial assessment is to help the IDG identify issues that either impede or facilitate the patient's treatment and to assist the patient/family in reaching the maximum benefit from hospice care and services. The assessment should include a wide variety of factors, including but not limited to, the patient and family's adjustment to the terminal illness, the social and emotional factors related to the terminal illness, the presence or absence of adequate coping mechanisms, the family dynamics and communication patterns, financial resources or constraint s, the caregiver's ability to function effectively, identifying obstacles and risk factors which may effect compliance with the plan of care, and identifying family support systems to help facilitate coping with end of life issues. Procedures and Probes \u00a7 418.64(c) How does the hospice introduce and offer medical social work services to the patient/family? Ask the social worker or clinical manager to describe the factors that are included in the psychosocial assessment and how this information is used in the care planning process to benefit the patient/family. Is there evidence that each patient receives social work services (unless specifically refused by the patient) that reflect the needs identified in the psychosocial assessment? L595 \u00a7418.64 (d) Standard: Counseling services Counseling services must be available to the patient and family to assist the patient and family in minimizing the stress and problems that arise from the terminal illness, related conditions, and the dying process. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 39 Tag Number Regulations Guidance to Surveyors L596 \u00a7418.64(d) - Counseling services must include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) - Bereavement counseling. The hospice must: (i) Have an organized program for the provision of bereavement services furnished under the supervision of a qualified professional with experience or education in grief or loss counseling. (ii) Make bereavement services available to the family and other indi viduals in the bereavement plan of care up to 1 year following the death of the patient. Bereavement counseling also extends to residents of a SNF/NF or ICF/MR when appropriate and identified in the bereavement plan of care. (iii) Ensure that bereavement services reflect the needs of the bereaved. (iv) Develop a bereavement plan of care that notes the kind of bereavement services to be offered and the frequency of service delivery. A special coverage provision for bereavement counseling is specified in \u00a7418.204(c). The supervisor of bereavement services may be the IDG social worker or other professional with documented evidence of experience or education in grief or loss counseling. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.64(d)(1) Ask the hospice to explain how and when they incorporate the bereavement assessment into the comprehensive assessment. What services does the hospice provide to reflect the needs of the family and other individuals in the bereavement plan of care? How does the hospice evaluate the outcomes and effectiveness of the bereavement services they provide? Select and review a sample of 2 -3 bereavement plans of care from a list of the patients who have died within the past 12 months. Determine if the bereavement fol low up was appropriate and provided within identified time frames? Did the bereavement services provided reflect the needs of the bereaved? L597 \u00a7418.64(d)(2) - Dietary counseling. Dietary counseling, when identified in the plan of care, must be performed by a qualified individual, which include dietitians as well as nurses and other individuals who are able to address and assure that the dietary needs of the patient are met. Hospices are required to assure the dietary needs of the patient are met by a qualified individual. If an RN is capable of meeting the patient's needs, then the dietary counseling can be provided by the RN. If the needs of the patient exceed the expertise of the nurse, then the hospice must have available an appropriately trai ned and qualified individual such as a registered dietitian or nutritionist to meet the patient's dietary needs. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.64(d)(2) Ask the clinical manager how the hospice meets the needs of patients and families who experience challen ges and conflict with end of life care dietary issues. This may include providing education about how the dying process naturally results in lack of appetite and intake and how this may relate to the patient's decreasing appetite and food intolerances during the end of life. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 40 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Ask the clinical manager how the hospice meets the needs of patients who experience dysphasia, problematic enteral feedings, or unresolved nutritional issues secondary to nausea, vomiting, or the dying process . L598 \u00a7418.64(d)(3) - Spiritual counseling T he hospice must: (i) Provide an assessment of the patient's and family's spiritual needs. (ii) Provide spiritual counseling to meet these needs in accordance with the patient's and family's acceptance of this service, and in a manner consistent with patient and family beliefs and desires. (iii) Make all reasonable efforts to facilitate visits by local clergy, pastoral counselors, or other individuals who can support the patient's spiritual needs to the best of its ability. (iv) Advise the patient and family of this service. There should be evi dence in the clinical record that the hospice has offered and/or provided spiritual counseling in accordance with the patient/ family's desires. If a patient and family desires spiritual counseling, then a hospice should facilitate visits by local clergy, pastoral counselors, or others to the best of its ability. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.64(d)(3) Determine through clinical record review, interview and home visits how the hospice addresses the spiritual needs/concerns of the patients and families. How does the hospice introduce the availability of spiritual counseling? What mechanisms are in place to meet the patient/family spiritual needs? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 41 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L599 \u00a7418.66 Condition of participation: Nursing services -- Waiver of requirement that substantially all nursing services be routinely provided directly by a hospice.

The location of a hospice that operates in several areas is considered to be the location of its central office. The hospice must provide evidence to CMS that it has made a good faith effort to hire a sufficient number of nurses to provide services. CMS may waive the requirement that nursing services be furnished by employees based on the following cr iteria: 1) The location of the hospice's central office is in a non-urbanized area as determined by the Bureau of the Census. 2) There is evidence that a hospice was operational on or before January 1, 1983 including the following: (i) Proof that the or ganization was established to provide hospice services on or before January 1, 1983. (ii) Evidence that hospice -type services were furnished to patients on or before January 1, 1983. (iii) Evidence that hospice care was a discrete activity rather than an aspect of another type of provider's patient care program on or before January 1, 1983. 3) By virtue of the following evidence that a hospice made a good faith effort to hire nurses: Section 8161(dd)(5)(a)(i) of the Social Security Act specifically refe rences urbanized areas as defined by the Bureau of the Census. Further information on this topic is available at http://www.census/gov. Hospices may also contact their assigned Medicare administrative contractor or check the hospice wage index, which is updated and published yearly. If there is any question concerning a waiver, contact the CMS RO.

(ii) Medical social services. (iii) Physician services. (iv) Counseling services, including spiritual counseling, dietary counseling, and bereavement counseling. (v) Hospice aide, volunteer, and homemaker services. (vi) Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. (vii) Short -term inpatient care. (viii) Medical supplies (including drugs and biologicals) and medical appliances. L653 \u00a7418.100(c)(2) - Nursing services, physician services, and drugs and biologicals (as specified in \u00a7418.106) must be made routinely available on a 24-hour basis 7 days a week. Other covered services must be available on a 24-hour basis when reasonable and necessary to meet the needs of the patient and family. L654 \u00a7418.100(d) Standard : Continuation of care A hospice may not discontinue or reduce care provided to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary because of the beneficiary's inability to pay for that care. This condition applies to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries only. L655 \u00a7418.100(e) Standard : Professional management r esponsibility A hospice that has a written agreement with The hospice must retain administrative and financial management responsibility, and oversight of staff and services provided under arrangement. For Medicare purposes, the hospice is reimbursed for all covered services it provides, whether directly or under arrangement. It is the responsibility of the hospice to pay for those services provided to Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 63 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors another agency, individual, or organization to furnish any services under arrangement must retain administrative and financial management, and oversight of staff and services for all arranged services, to ensure the provision of quality care. Arranged services must be supported by written agreements that require that all services be -- (1) Authorized by the hospice; (2) Furnished in a safe and effective manner by qualified personnel; and (3) Delivered in accordance with the patient's plan of care. Medicare beneficiaries under arrangement. When a hospice provides services under arrangements to non-Medicare beneficiaries, the hospice is responsible for establishing how payment for those services will occur, but the standard does not require the hospic e to pay for those services directly or to pay for services for which there is no reimbursement or for services that another insurer is obligated to pay. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.100(e) Ask how the hospice assures that all contracted personnel (agenc y, individual or organization) provide care that is in accordance with the patient's plan of care? How does the hospice assure that all services provided under arrangement are authorized by the hospice? How does the hospice monitor and exercise control over services provided by personnel under arrangements or contracts? How does the hospice assure professional management of patients that are receiving inpatient care under arrangement? How and when does communication occur between the hospice and contracted individuals, agencies or organizations? How does the hospice assure that services are furnished by qualified staff? L656 \u00a7418.100(f) Standard : Hospice multiple locations If a hospice operates multiple locations, it must meet the following requirements: (1) Medicare approval. (i) All hospice multiple locations must be approved by Medicare before providing hospice care and services to Medicare patients. It is inherent in the provider certification process for a hospice to notify CMS of its proposal to add a location from which it provides services. Absent such notification, CMS has no way of carrying out the statutorily mandated obligation of determining whether the hospi ce is complying with all applicable participation requirements at the new location. It is a longstanding CMS policy that there is no basis for a provider to bill Medicare for services provided from a location that has not been determined to meet applicable requirements of participation. This guidance is contained in \u00a7\u00a7 2086 and 3224 of this manual. When an existing hospice intends to add a multiple location, it must notify CMS, the State Survey Agency (SA), and, if deemed, it should notify its approved nat ional accreditation organization (AO), in writing of the proposed location if it expects this location to participate in Medicare or Medicaid. The hospice must also submit a Form CMS-855A change of information request (including all supporting documentation) to its Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) before CMS approval can be granted. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 64 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors The provider must obtain CMS approval of the new location before it is permitted to bill Medicare for services provided from the new location. Upon receipt of a hospice's notice and request for approval of a multiple location, the CMS RO will carefully evaluate the information, together with any supporting documentation from the hospice and any other relevant information known to the RO in making its decision. If a decision can be made based on the written application and supporting documentation, CMS will grant or deny an approval wi thout requiring a survey. If, however, the RO concludes that circumstances warrant a survey to establish whether the new location complies with all applicable requirements, CMS will advise the provider and will make no further findings until a Medicare certification survey has been completed and submitted to CMS for its review. In either event, CMS will notify the provider of its decision in writing, as appropriate. NOTE: CMS will not approve a hospice's inpatient facility or a change of location for a hospice's own inpatient facility without a survey to assure that the facility meets all requirements specified at 42 CFR 418.110. A hospice may not bill Medicare for services provided from a multiple location until the new site or location has been approve d by CMS. The fact that a national accreditation organization with deeming authority has approved a new site or location will not affect CMS' decision. CMS ' determination will be based on its independent application of its regulations to the facts in the case. Services provided before the effective date of approval should not be billed to Medicare. If the hospice does operate at multiple locations, a deficiency found at any location will result in a compliance issue for the entire hospice. L657 \u00a7418.100(f)(1)(ii) The multiple location must be part of the hospice and must share administration, supervision, and services with the hospice issued the certification number. Procedures \u00a7418.100(f)(1)(ii) Ask the hospice how it a ssures that any multiple locations operating as a part of the hospice share administration, supervision and services, and participate in the hospice's QAPI activities. How does the hospice communicate with the multiple location(s) to assure that it is responsible to the same governing body and central administration that governs the hospice issued the provider agreement, and that the governing body and central administra tion are able to adequately manage the location, resolve any problems that occur and assure quality of care for all patients. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 65 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L658 \u00a7418.100(f)(1)(iii) The lines of authority and professional and administrative control must be clearly delineated in the hospice's organizational structure and in practice, and must be traced to the location which was issued the certification number. L659 \u00a7418.100(f)(1)(i) (iv) The determination that a multiple locat ion does or does not meet the definition of a multiple location, as set forth in this part, is an initial determination, as set forth in \u00a7498.3. Initial determinations under 42 CFR 498.3 are subject to administrative review. L660 \u00a7418.100(f)(2) The hospice must continually monitor and manage all services provided at all of its locations to ensure that services are delivered in a safe and effective manner and to ensure that each patient and family receives the necessary care and services outlined in t he plan of care, in accordance with the requirements of this subpart and subparts A and C of this section. Surveyors may conduct the entire survey or part of the survey at the multiple location(s). When conducting a survey at a multiple location, the surve yor may request that all necessary documentation for review be transported to that location at the hospice's expense. This may include, but not be limited to, a sample of clinical records from all other locations, QAPI reports, administrative records, pers onnel files, and policies and procedures. There should be evidence that: The hospice exerts the supervision and control necessary at each location to assure that all hospice care and services continue to be responsive to the needs of the patient/family at all times and in all settings; Each location provides the same full range of services that is required of the hospice that was issued the certification number; Each patient is assigned to a specific IDG responsible for ongoing assessment, planning, monitoring, coordination and provision of care; Each location is responsible to the same governing body and central administration that governs the hospice that was issued the certification number, and the governing body and central administration mu st be able to adequately manage the location and assure quality of care. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 66 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L661 \u00a7418.100(g) Standard : Training (1) A hospice must provide orientation about the hospice philosophy to all employees and contracted staff who have patient and family contact. L662 \u00a7418.100(g)(2) - A hospice must provide an initial orientation for each employee that addresses the employee's specific job duties. L663 \u00a7418.100(g)(3) A hospice must assess the skills and competence of all individuals furnishing care, including volunteers furnishing services, and, as necessary, provide in-service training and education programs where required. The hospice must have written policies and procedures describing its method(s) of assessment of competency and maintain a written description of the in-service training provided during the previous 12 months. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.100(g) Review a sample of personnel records to verify that initial orientation, assessment of skil ls and competency, and in-service training was provided to all employees, contracted staff and volunteers furnishing care/services to hospice patients and families. Review hospice written agreements and training programs provided for contracted personne l. If concerns are identified, interview the administrator or his/her designee, and staff regarding the specific issue.

L665 \u00a7418.102 - The hospice must designate a physician to serve as medical director. The medical director must be a doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is an employee, or is under contract with, the hospice. When the medical director is not available, a physician designated by the hospice assumes the same responsibilities and obligations as the medical director. There is only one medical director for the hospice, including all multiple locations, if it has them. That individual may work full time or part time. If the medical director is not a paid employee or a contracted medical director, he/she is considered a volunteer under the control of the hospice. All other hospice physicians function under the supervision of the medical director. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.102 Ident ify through interview and documentation who the medical director is and who is designated to serve in this capacity in his/her absence. L666 \u00a7418.102(a) Standard: Medical director contract. (1) A hospice may contract with either of the following \u2014 (i) A self -employed physician; or (ii) A physician employed by a professional entity or physicians group. When contracting for medical director services, the contract must specify the physician who assumes the medical director responsibilities and obligations. The medical director may also be a volunteer physician under the control of the hospice, as long as this person meets all Federal and State requirements for a hospice physician. L667 \u00a7418.102(b) Standard: Initial certification of terminal illness. The medical director or physician designee reviews the clinical information for each hospice patient and provides written certification that it is anticipated that the patient's life expectancy is 6 months or less if the illness runs its normal course. The physician must consider the following when making this determination: (1) The primary terminal condition; (2) Related diagnosis(es), if any; (3) Current subjective and objective medical The medical director or physician designee (who is a hospice employee or under contract with the hospice) has the responsibility for the medical component of the hospice's patient care program, including initial certifications and recertification of termin al illness. During the clinical record review, verify that the clinical information necessary for certification is present in the record. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 68 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors findings; (4) Current medication and treatment orders; and (5) Information about the medical management of any of the patient's conditions unrelated to the terminal illness. L668 \u00a7418.102(c) Standard: Recertification of the terminal illness. Before the recertification period for each patient, as described in \u00a7418.21(a), the medical director or physician designee must review the patient's clinical information. L669 \u00a7418.102(d) Standard: Medical director responsibility . The medical director or physician designee has responsibility for the medical component of the hospice's patient care program. The single individual who fills the role of the medical director assumes overall responsibility for the medical component of the hospice's patient care program. This responsibility, which extends to all hospice multiple locations, includes overseeing the implementation of the entire physician, nursing, social work, therapy, and counseling areas within the hospice to ensure that these areas consistently meet patient and family needs. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 69 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L670 \u00a7418.104 Condition of participation: Clinical records. L671 \u00a7418.104 - A clinical record containing past and current findings is maintained for each hospice patient.

Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 70 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L679 \u00a7418.104(b) Standard: Authentication. All entries must be legible, clear, complete, and appropriately authenticated and dated in accordance with hospice policy and currently accepted standards of practice. A hospice may create its own policy on authentication of clinical records based on accepted standards of practice. Hospices must follow State laws regarding authentication of clinical records, and, within this context, alter their policies as often as nece ssary to adapt to changing technologies and practices. Medicare requires a legible identifier for services provided/ordered. This method must be handwritten (not stamped) or an electronic signature to sign an order or other clinical record documentation. The noted exception is that facsimiles of original written or electronic signatures are acceptable for the certifications of terminal illness for hospice. Stamped signatures are not acceptable. Providers and physicians using electronic signatures should recognize that there is a potential for misuse or abuse with alternate signature methods. For example, providers need a system and software products that are protected against modification, etc., and should apply administrative procedures that are adequate and correspond to recognized standards and laws. The individual whose name is on the alternate signature method as well as the provider bear the responsibility for the authenticity of the information to which they have attested. Physicians should check wit h their attorneys and malpractice insurers in regard to the use of alternative signature methods. Hospices may not accept stamped physician signatures on orders, treatments, or other documents that are a part of the patient's clinical record. Surveyors m ust have access to clinical records. If the record is maintained electronically, the hospice must provide all equipment necessary to read the record in its entirety. The hospice must also produce a paper copy of the record, if requested by the surveyor. All State licensure and State practice regulations continue to apply to Medicare -approved hospices. Where State law is more restrictive than Medicare, the hospice needs to apply the State law standard. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.104(b) Ask the hospice to e xplain their system of authentication. Verify that at a minimum it includes the following safeguards: The hospice has a method to identify the author of each entry. This would include verification of the author of faxed orders/entries or computer entrie s. If the hospice is using electronic medical records, electronic authentication must have a user ID and password protections in place. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 71 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Every entry, both written and electronic, must be signed and dated by the person performing the service. L680 \u00a7418.104(c) Standard: Protection of information The clinical record, its contents and the information contained therein must be safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use. The hospice must be in compliance with the Department's rules regarding personal health information as set out at 45 CFR parts 160 and 164. The hospice must ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain access to patient records, and that individuals cannot alter patient records. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.104(c) How does the hospice protect the confidentiality of clinical records. What is the hospice's policy on leaving and protecting clinical record information in the patient's home? If the hospice uses electronic patient records, what security safeguards are in place to protect the electronic system against loss, theft, damage, disruption of operations or unauthorized use? Is access to clinical records controlled? Are there meas ures in place to protect the patient from identity theft? Observe the hospice's security practices for patient records. Are patient records (hard copy or electronic) left unsecured or unattended? Verify that adequate precautions are taken to prevent physical or electronic altering. L681 \u00a7418.104(d) Standard: Retention of records Patient clinical records must be retained for 6 years after the death or discharge of the patient, unless State law stipulates a longer period of time. If the hospice discontinues operation, hospice policies must provide for retention and storage of clinical records. The hospice must inform its State agency and its CMS Regional office where such clinical records will be stored and how they may be accessed.

The hospice must ass ure that the inpatient facility has enough nursing personnel present on all shifts to guarantee that adequate safety measures are in place for the patients, and that the routine, special, and emergency needs of all patients are met at all times. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 80 Tag Num ber Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Each patient must receive all nursing services as prescribed and must be kept comfortable, clean, well -groomed, and protected from accident, injury, and infection. L711 \u00a7418.108(c) Standard: Inpatient care provided under arrangements If the hospice has an arrangement with a facility to provide for short-term inpatient care, the arrangement is described in a written agreement, coordinated by the hospice and at a minimum s pecifies \u2014 (1) That the hospice supplies the inpatient provider a copy of the patient's plan of care and specifies the inpatient services to be furnished; L712 \u00a7418.108(c)(2) - That the inpatient provider has established patient care policies consistent with those of the hospice and agrees to abide by the palliative care protocols and plan of care established by the hospice for its patients; L713 \u00a7418.108(c)(3) - That the hospice patient's inpatient clinical record includes a record of all inpatient se rvices furnished and events regarding care that occurred at the facility; that a copy of the discharge summary be provided to the hospice at the time of discharge; and that a copy of the inpatient clinical record is available to the hospice at the time of discharge; L714 \u00a7418.108(c)(4) - That the inpatient facility has identified an individual within the facility who is responsible for the implementation of the provisions of the agreement; Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 81 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L715 \u00a7418.108(c)(5) - That the hospice retains responsibility for ensuring that the training of personnel who will be providing the patient's care in the inpatient facility has been provided and that a description of the training and the names of those giving the training are documented; and L716 \u00a7418.108(c)(6) - A method for verifying that the requirements in paragraphs(c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section are met. Hospices may have arrangements with more than one facility for the provision of inpatient care. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.108(c)(6) Ask the hospice clinical manager what facilities they use and how they monitor the care their patients receive at each facility. If you have questions concerning the provision of care or the hospice's explanation of how they monitor care at the facility(ies), ask to review a copy of their written agreement. Ask how the hospice assures that all staff caring for hospice p atients at the inpatient facility(ies) have been trained in the hospice philosophy of care and are able to provide patient care according to the hospice plan of care. If necessary, contact or visit the facility(ies) as needed to verify compliance. L717 \u00a7418.108(d) Standard: Inpatient care limitation The total number of inpatient days used by Medicare beneficiaries who elected hospice coverage in a 12-month period in a particular hospice may not exceed 20 percent of the total number of hospice days consum ed in total by this group of beneficiaries. This standard applies to Medicare beneficiaries only. Compliance with this regulation is based on the total number of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the hospice program, and does not include patients from other payor sources. L718 \u00a7418.108(e) Standard: Exemption from limitation Before October 1, 1986, any hospice that began operation before January 1, 1975, is not subject to the limitation specified in paragraph (d) of this section. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 82 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L719 \u00a7418.110 Condition of participation: Hospices that provide inpatient directly L720 \u00a7418.110 - A hospice that provides inpatient care directly in its own facility must demonstrate compliance with all of the following standards: L721 \u00a7418.110(a) Standard: Staffing The hospice is responsible for ensuring that staffing for all services reflects its volume of patients, their acuity, and the level of intensity of services needed to ensure that plan of care outcomes are achieved and negative outcomes are avoided. The intent of this regulation is to ensure that the hospice provides staffing that is adequate to meet patient needs. Adequate staff means that the numbers and types of qualified, trained, and experi enced staff on the inpatient unit meet the care needs of every patient. Procedures and Probes 418.110(a) How does the hospice assure that there is adequate staff on duty, especially during the evening, nighttime, weekends and holiday shifts, to take ca re of the individual needs of all patients? Interview patients/family to determine if they were satisfied with the care and services they received. If an on-site visit is conducted, observe if the staff is responsive to patient needs and if call bells are answered promptly. Do patients frequently call for assistance? Are patients checked frequently for safety, comfort and positioning? Ask hospice management for the inpatient staffing schedules and patient census for the past month to determine if staffing was adequate to meet patient needs. How does the hospice determine the staff -to-patient ratios on each shift? Review at least one clinical record to evaluate if staff provided the treatments, medications, personal care, and diet in compliance with the patient's plan of care. If questions arise regarding staffing patterns (staff illness, staff not reporting to work, etc.,) review the facility's staffing schedule and/or timecards as necessary. L722 \u00a7418.110(b) Standard: Twenty -four hour nursing services (1) The hospice facili ty must provide 24-hour nursing services that meet the nursing needs of Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 83 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors all patients and are furnished in accordance with each patient's plan of care. Each patient must receive all nursing services as prescribed and must be kept comfortable, clean, well - groomed, and protected from accident, injury, and infection. L723 \u00a7418.110(b)(2) - If at least one patient in the hospice facility is receiving general inpatient care, then each shift must include a registered nurse who provides direct patient care. The general inpatient care provided in a facility for pain control or acute or chronic symptom management, which cannot be managed in other settings, is a different level of care than respite care. It is n ot automatically necessary to have an RN assigned to every shift to provide direct patient care if the only hospice patients in a facility are receiving the respite or routine levels of care. Staffing for a facility solely providing the respite or routine home care levels of care to hospice patients should be based on each patient's care needs. The requirements for nursing services for respite care are located at \u00a7418.108(b)(2). Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.110(b)(2) Ask the hospice for a schedule of RN personnel for the past month and inquire about the mechanism to ensure an RN provides direct patient care on each shift. L724 \u00a7418.110(c) Standard: Physical environment. The hospice must maintain a safe physical environment free of hazards for patients, staff, and visitors. L725 \u00a7418.110(c)(1) - Safety management. (i) - The hospice must address real or potential threats to the health and safety of the patients, others, and property. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.110(c)(1)(i) Ask the hospice what security mechanisms are in place and being followed to protect patients, staff and visitors. Review and analyze documentation related to patient and staff incidents and accidents to identify any incidents/accidents or patterns of incidents/accidents concerning a safe environment. Expand your review if you suspect a problem with a safe environment in the hospice. If the hospice has identified problems, did it evaluate those problems and take steps to ensure a safe patient environme nt? How does the hospice assure that staff follows current standards of practice for patient environmental safety, infection control, and security? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 84 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L726 \u00a7418.110(c)(1)(ii) - The hospice must have a written disaster preparedness plan in effect for managing the consequences of power failures, natural disasters, and other emergencies that would affect the hospice's ability to provide care. The plan must be periodically reviewed and rehearsed with staff (including non-employee staff) with special emphasis placed on carrying out the procedures necessary to protect patients and others. There should be documentation of LSC fire drills at varied times on all shif ts. For example, fire drills on the day shift should not always occur at 10:00 A.M. Further information on disaster preparedness guidance is available at http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files/PDF/NFPA1600.pdf Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.110(c)(1)(ii) Reques t a copy of the hospice disaster preparedness plan and determine if the content addresses the management of power failures, natural disasters, and other potential emergencies, specific to the hospice's location. Request a copy of staff (both employed and volunteer staff) orientation/periodic education of the components of the disaster plan. What is the hospice's procedure for notification of staff, patients, physicians, and others in an emergency? Where does the hospice document and maintain its da ted, written report, and evaluation of each drill? Request and review this information. Interview random staff to assess their knowledge of specific responsibilities during a disaster or drill and what to do in a specific emergency i.e. fire in a patien t's room. Are evacuation diagrams posted and visible to all staff, patient, and family members? Review evidence of specific planning for internal and external disasters, patient/record transfers, and arrangements with community resources. L727 \u00a7418.110(c)(2) - Physical plant and equipment. The hospice must develop procedures for controlling the reliability and quality of -- (i) The routine storage and prompt disposal of trash and medical waste; (ii) Light, temperature, and ventilation/air excha nges throughout the hospice; (iii) Emergency gas and water supply; and (iv) The scheduled and emergency maintenance and repair of all equipment. The term trash refers to common garbage as well as biohazardous waste. The storage and disposal of trash and medical waste should be in accordance with Federal, State and local laws and regulations (i.e., the Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), CDC, State environmental, health and safety regulations). The hospice must have a system to provide emergency gas and water as needed to provide care to inpatients. This includes making arrangements with local utility companies and others for the provision of emergency sources of water and gas. The hospice should consider nationally accepted references or calculations made by qualified staff when determining the need for at least water and gas. For example, one source for information on water is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.110(c)(2) Ask the hospice to explain its system for providing emergency gas and water and routine and preventive maintenance schedules for equipment. Determine that ongoing maintenance Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 85 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors inspections are performed, and that necessary repairs are completed. How does the hospice assure the reliability and quality of light, temperature, and ventilation/air exchanges throughout the hospice? L728 \u00a7418.110 (d) Standard: Fire protection (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section - - (i) The hospice must meet the provisions applicable to nursing homes of the 2000 edition of the Life Safety Code (LSC) of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).

(ii) Chapter 19.3.6.3.2, exception number 2 of the adopted edition of the LSC does not apply to hospices. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.110(d) Is there documentation of compliance with any State and/or Federal building regulations codes, such as the 2000 edition of the Life Safety Code (LSC). NOTE: The LSC is not applicable where CMS finds that a State has in effect a fire and safety code imposed by State law that adequately protects patients in health care facilities. Request to see evidence that fire/safety drills have been held on all shifts at varied times as required by the Life Safety Code. Where does the hospice document and store its dated, written report, and evaluation of each drill? Reque st evidence of the latest checks of fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems, and smoke alarms. Does a preventive maintenance program exist for electrical, HVAC (heat, ventilation and air conditioner), sprinkler, and security systems? Observe the locati on of fire extinguishers. Are there functional smoke alarms in each patient room? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 86 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors (2) In consideration of a recommendation by the State survey agency, CMS may waive, for periods deemed appropriate, specific provisions of the Life Safety Code which, if rigidly applied would result in unreasonable hardship for the hospice, but only if the waiver would not adversely affect the health and safety of patients. (3) The provisions of the adopted edition of the Life Safety Code do not apply in a State if CMS finds that a fire and safety code imposed by State law adequately protects patients in h ospices. (4) Notwithstanding any provisions of the 2000 edition of the Life Safety Code to the contrary, a hospice may place alcohol -based hand rub dispensers in its facility if -- (i) Use of alcohol -based hand rub dispensers does not conflict with any St ate or local codes that prohibit or otherwise restrict the placement of alcohol -based hand rub dispensers in health care facilities; (ii) The dispensers are installed in a manner that minimizes leaks and spills that could lead to falls; (iii) The dispens ers are installed in a manner that adequately protects against access by vulnerable populations; and (iv) The dispensers are installed in accordance with chapter 18.3.2.7 or chapter 19.3.2.7 of the 2000 edition of the Life Safety Code, as amended by NFPA Temporary Interim Amendment 00 - 1(101), issued by the Standards Council of the National Fire Protection Association on April 15, 2004. The Director of the Office of the Federal Register has approved FPA Temporary Interim Amendment 00 - Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 87 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors 1(101) for incorporation by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 C.F.R. part 51.

The hospice must provide a home -like atmosphere and ensure that patient areas are designed to preserve the dignity, comfort, and privacy of patients. (1) The hospice must provide \u2014 (i) Physical space for private patie nt and family visiting; (ii) Accommodations for family members to remain with the patient throughout the night; and (iii) Physical space for family privacy after a patient's death. (2) The hospice must provide the opportunity for patients to receive vis itors at any hour, including infants and small children. A homelike atmosphere de -emphasizes the institutional character of the setting to the extent possible. Procedures \u00a7418.110(e) Interview patients/family members to validate that visiting hours are not restricted and accommodations are provided for family members to stay with the patient during the night. Observe the patient areas for the above requirements. Are window treatm ents and floor coverings residential/homelike in appearance and design? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 88 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L730 \u00a7418.110(f) Standard: Patient rooms. (1) The hospice must ensure that patient rooms are designed and equipped for nursing care, as well as the dignity, comfort, and privacy of patients. (2) The hospice must accommodate a patient and family request for a single room whenever possible. (3) Each p atient's room must\u2014 (i) Be at or above grade level; (ii) Contain a suitable bed and other appropriate furniture for each patient; (iii) Have closet space that provides security and privacy for clothing and personal belongings; (iv) Accommodate no more than two patients and their family members; (v) Provide at least 80 square feet for each residing patient in a double room and at least 100 square feet for each patient residing in a single room; and (vi) Be equipped with an easily -activated, functioning device accessible to the patient, that is used for calling for assistance. (4) For a facility occupied by a Medicare - participating hospice on December 2, 2008, CMS may waive the space and occupancy requirements of paragraphs (f)(2)(iv) and (f)(2)(v) of this section if it determines that \u2014 (i) Imposition of the requirements would result in unreasonable hardship on the hospice if strictly enforced; or jeopardize its ability to continue to participate in the Medicare program; and In addition to a clean, com fortable bed, each patient should have at least a place to put personal effects, such as pictures and a clock, furniture suitable for the comfort of the patient and visitors (i.e., a chair) and adequate lighting suitable to the tasks the patient chooses to perform, or the inpatient staff needs to perform. Waiver requests mentioned in this requirement must be submitted in writing to the CMS RO. Probes \u00a7418.110(f) Does each bed have a flame retardant cubicle curtains, movable screens, or other acceptable means of providing full visual privacy? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 89 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors (ii) The waiver serves the needs of the patient and does not adversely affect their health and safety. L731 \u00a7418.110(g) Standard: Toilet and bathing facilities. Each patient room must be equipped with, or conveniently located near, toilet and bathing facilities. Toilet facilities means a space that contains a lavatory and a toilet. Assure that each floor has at least one toilet facility and shower stall large en ough to accommodate a wheelchair and patient transfer. L732 \u00a7418.110(h) Standard: Plumbing facilities. The hospice must \u2014 (1) Have an adequate supply of hot water at all times; and (3) Have plumbing fixtures with control valves that automatically regulate the temperature of the hot water used by patients. The intent of this regulation is that the temperature of water at fixtures and in showers and tubs used by patients shall be automati cally regulated by control valves and delivered for use at the appropriate temperature. There is a risk that patients or staff may be scalded by excessively hot water discharged by plumbing fixtures. Water that is too hot may scald individuals who are exposed to it. This danger is particularly significant for patients who may have circulatory or other neurological deficits that prevent the instantaneous recoil from water that is too hot. The chart below shows the estimated time for persons to receive second and third degree burns at various temperatures. Water Temperature Time to Receive Second Degree Burn Time to Receive Third Degree Burn 120 degrees 8 minutes 10 minutes 124 degrees 2 minutes 4 minutes 131 degrees 17 seconds 30 seconds 140 degrees 3 seconds 5 seconds 150 degrees <1 second 1 second Cont. L732 The recommended water temperatures at the plumbing fixtures should be maintained at or below 110 degrees. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.110(h) Interview staff and patients to assure there is always an adequate supply of hot water on the unit. Request incident reports for the past 12 months. Has there been any documentation of an incident(s) related to patie nt scalding with water? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 90 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Cont. L732 Ask the hospice to provide the maintenance logs for the automatic control valves used to regulate the temperature of the hot water. Review the water temperatures recorded. Check the hot water temperatures at patient's sinks, showers and tubs to verify t hat the water temperature does not exceed safe bathing temperature. How to test water temperatures: 1. Follow the thermometer manufacturers recommended instructions for use. 2. Measure the hot water temperature prior to heavy use, or at least one hour a fter, so the hot water heater has time to recover and heat to its set temperature. 3. To ensure accuracy, do not hold the thermometer under the running water to measure the temperature. 4. Allow the hot water to run for a sufficient amount of time to ens ure the water is at its hottest temperature. 5. Fill a bowl or cup with hot water. 6. Immediately immerse the silver end of the thermometer completely into the contained water. 7. Keep the thermometer in the water until the measurement has stabilized (30 to 60 seconds), then read the temperature. L733 \u00a7418.110(i) Standard: Infection control. The hospice must maintain an infection control program that protects patients, staff and others by preventing and controlling infections and communicable disease as stipulated in \u00a7418.60. The hospice inpatient facility must have an active surveillance program that includes specific measures for prevention, early detection, control, education, and investigation of infections and communicable diseases in the hospice . There must be a mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of the program(s) and take corrective action when necessary. The program must include implementation of nationally recognized systems of infection control guidelines to avoid sources and transmission of infections and communicable diseases (e.g., the CDC Guidelines for Prevention and Control of Nosocomial Infections, the CDC Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Tuberculosis in Health Care Facilities, OSHA regulations, and APIC guidelines on infection control, etc.). Review disease reporting procedures and evidence of systematic tracking of communicable and reportable diseases. Is this program part of the hospice's overall quality assessment and performance improvement and education program? Interview management and staff to determine if they are aware of the procedure to be followed if a patient or staff contracts an infectious or communicable disease. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 91 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Determine if there have been a high number of infections unrelated to the patients' diagnosis. If identified, what were the hospice's response and actions to prevent these and future occurrences? The active infection control program should have policies t hat address the following: Definition of nosocomial infections and communicable diseases; Measures for identifying, investigating, and reporting nosocomial infections and communicable diseases; Measures for assessing and identifying patients and he alth care workers, including hospice personnel, contract staff (e.g., agency nurses, housekeeping staff) and volunteers, at risk for infections and communicable diseases; Measures for the prevention of infections; Measures for prevention of communica ble disease outbreaks, such as airborne diseases (TB, SARS, etc.), food borne diseases (Hepatitis A, Salmonella, etc.), blood borne diseases (HIV, Hepatitis B, etc.), and others (VRE, MRSA, pseudomonas, etc.); Provision of a safe environment consistent with nationally recognized infection control precautions, such as the current CDC recommendations for the identified infection and/or communicable disease; Isolation procedures and requirements for infected or immunosuppressed patients Use and techniques for standard precautions; Education of patients, family members and caregivers about infections and communicable diseases; Techniques for hand washing, respiratory protections, asepsis as well as other means for limiting the spread of contagion; Orientation of all new hospice personnel to infections, communicable diseases, and to the infection control program; Measures for the screening and evaluation of health care workers, including all hospice staff, contract workers (e.g., agency nurses, housekeeping staff, etc), and volunteers, for communicable diseases, and for the evaluation of staff and volunteers exposed to patients with non-treated communicable diseases; and Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 92 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Employee health policies regarding infectious diseases and when infected or ill employees, including contract workers and volunteers, must not render patient care and/or must not report to work. L734 \u00a7418.110(j) Standard: Sanitary environment The hospic e must provide a sanitary environment by following current standards of practice, including nationally recognized infection control precautions, and avoid sources and transmission of infections and communicable diseases. \"Sanitary\" includes, but is not lim ited to, preventing the spread of disease -causing organisms by keeping patient care equipment clean and properly stored. Patient care equipment includes, but is not limited to, toothbrushes, dentures, denture cups, glasses, water pitchers, emesis basins, hair brushes, combs, bed pans, urinals, and positioning or assistive devices. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.110(j) Ask the hospice to describe how they keep the facility clean and sanitary. Observe staff providing care. Do they follow acceptable infection control guidelines? Observe the inpatient units - do they appear clean? L735 \u00a7418.110(k) Standard: Linen. The hospice must have available at all times a quantity of clean linen in suf ficient amounts for all patient uses. Linens must be handled, stored, processed, and transported in such a manner as to prevent the spread of contaminants. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.110(k) Interview patients/families to determine if linens are promptly changed when soiled throughout all 24- hour periods, including weekends and holidays. Ask management what the hospice's policy is on the frequency of linen change and replacement? During a tour of the inpatient hospice unit, observe patient bedding to assure cleanliness. Request to see the linen storage area to determine if there is an adequate supply to meet ongoing patient needs. How does the hospice store the clean linen to keep it clean, dry, and dust free? Is soiled linen and clothing collected and enclosed in suitable bags or containers in well - ventilated areas, separate from clean linen and not permitted to accumulate in the facility? L736 \u00a7418.110(l) Standard: Meal service and menu planning. The hospice must furnish meals to each patient that are \u2014 (1) Consistent with the patient's plan of care, nutritional needs, and therapeutic diet; (2) Palatable, attractive, and served at the proper temperature; and The intent of this regulation is to assure that the nutritive value of food is not compromised and destroyed because of prolonged food storage, light, and air exposure. Food should be palatable, attractive, and served at the proper temperature as determin ed by the type of food Food-palatability refers to the taste and/or flavor of the food. Food attractiveness refers to the appearance of the food when served. Food temperature is food served at preferable temperature (hot foods are served hot and cold foods are served cold) as discerned by the patient and customary practice. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 93 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors (3) Obtained, stored, prepared, distributed, and served under sanitary conditions. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.110(l) Evidence for palatability and attractiveness of food, from day to day and meal to meal, may be strengthened through sources such as: observation, patient, family and staff interviews. Attempt to visit the inpatient unit while meals are delivered and obs erve if volunteers or staff are available to assist patients who need help. How does the hospice meet the individual patient' s nutritional needs as identified in the plan of care? What arrangements does the hospice have to serve meals at the proper t emperature and in a form that meets the patients needs and desires? Is food served at preferable temperature (hot foods are served hot and cold foods are served cold) as discerned by the patient and customary practice? How is the IDG kept informed of the patient's response to the prescribed diet? Are meals individually scheduled, if needed, to allow for frequent, small meals if so desired by the patient? Is food available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to respond to the patient's requests and needs? L737 \u00a7418.110(m) Standard: Restraint or seclusion. All patients have the right to be free from physical or mental abuse, and corporal punishment. All patients have the right to be free from restraint or seclusion, of any form, imposed as a means of coercion, discipline, convenience, or retaliation by staff. Restraint or seclusion may only be imposed to ensure the immediate physical safety of the patient, a staff member, or others and must be discontinued at the earliest possible time. The hospice is responsible for creating a culture that supports a patient's right to be free from restraint or seclusion. The hospice must also ensure that systems and processes are developed, implemented, and evaluated that support the patients rights addressed in this standard, and that eliminate the inappropriate use of restraint or seclusion. If restraints or seclusion is necessary within the parameters of this regulation, it must be discontinued as soon as possible based on an individualized patient assessment and re- evaluation. A violation of any of these patients rights constitutes an inappropriate use of restraint or seclusion and would be subject to a condition level deficiency. The use of restraints for the prevention of falls must not be considered a routine part of a falls prevention program. Although restraints have been traditionally used as a falls prevention approach, they have major, serious drawbacks and can contribute to serious injuries. There is no evidence that the use of phys ical restraint, (including, but not limited to, raised side rails) will prevent or reduce falls. Additionally, falls that occur while a person is physically restrained often result in more severe injuries and/or death. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 94 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L738 \u00a7418.110(m)(1) - Restraint or seclusion may only be used when less restrictive interventions have been determined to be ineffective to protect the patient, a staff member, or others from harm. L739 \u00a7418.110(m)(2) - The type or technique of restraint or seclusion used must be the least restrictive intervention that will be effective to protect the patient, a staff member, or others from harm. L740 \u00a7418.110(m)(3) - The use of restraint or seclusion must be -- (i) In accordance with a writ ten modification to the patient's plan of care; and (ii) Implemented in accordance with safe and appropriate restraint and seclusion techniques as determined by hospice policy in accordance with State law. L741 \u00a7418.110(m)(4) - The use of restraint or seclusion must be in accordance with the order of a physician authorized to order restraint or seclusion by hospice policy in accordance with State law. L742 \u00a7418.110(m)(5) - Orders for the use of restraint or seclusion must never be written as a standing order or on an as needed basis (PRN). This regulation prohibits the use of standing or PRN (Latin abbreviation for pro re nata - as needed; as circumstances require) orders for the use of restraint or seclusion. The ongoing authorization of restraint or seclusion is not permitted. Each episode of restraint or seclusion must be initiated in accordance with the order of a physician. If a patient was recently released from restraint or seclusion, and exhibits behavior that can only be handled through the rea pplication of restraint or seclusion, a new order would be required.

These competencies must be demonstrated initially as part of hospice orientation and subsequently on a periodic basis consistent with hospice policy. Hospices have the flexibility to identify a time frame fo r ongoing training based on the level of staff competency, and the needs of the patient population(s) served. All staff working in a hospice that precludes the use of restraints or seclusion would not have to be trained or demonstrate competencies specified in this standard since no staff in a restraint free facility would be applying restraints or placing patients in seclusion. In this situation, the hospice should ensure that all staff are aware of its restraint and seclusion free philosophy and provide ongoing training in this philosophy.

For the purposes of this guidance under this condition, \"facility\" will be used in place of SNF/NF or ICF/ IID. All references to a \"patient\" in the guidance under this condition mean a person who is a resident of a facility and is receiving hospice services from the Medicare certified hospice. L761 \u00a7418.112(a) Standard: Resident eligibility, election, and duration of benefits. Medicare patients receiving hospice services and residing in a SNF, NF, or ICF/ IID are subject to the Medicare hospice eligibility criteria set out at \u00a7418.20 through \u00a7418.30. L762 \u00a7418.112(b) Standard: Professional management.

The term \"professional management\" for a hospice patient who resides in a SNF/NF or ICF/ IID has the same meaning that it has if the hospice patient were living in his/her own home. Professional management involves assessing, planning, monitoring, directing a nd evaluating the patient's /resident's hospice care across all settings. The professional services provided by the hospice to the patient in his/her home should continue to be provided by the hospice to the patient in a facility, or other place of residen ce. Hospice core services must be routinely provided by the hospice, and cannot be delegated to the facility. Hospices should specify that facility staff should immediately notify the hospice of these unplanned interventions. In the contract between the ho spice and the facility, potential crisis situations and temporary emergency measures should be addressed and determined how they will be handled by facility staff. Hospice is responsible for providing all hospice services including: Ongoing assessment, care planning, monitoring, coordination, and provision of care by the Hospice IDG.

The agreement must be signed by authorized representatives of the hospice and the SNF/NF or ICF/ IID before the provision of hospice services. The written agree ment is for the provision of hospice services between the two entities. As the written agreement is not patient specific, it does not need to be rewritten for each patient. If there are concerns regarding the provision of services, the hospice and the facility may review and revise this agreement as appropriate for needed changes and/or improvement in the working relationship between the two entities. L764 \u00a7418.112(c) - The written agreement must include at least the following: (1) The manner in which the SNF/NF or ICF/ IID and the hospice are to communicate with each other and document such communications to ensure that the needs of patients are addressed and met 24 hours a day.

The hospice must document that this communication has occurred. Procedures and Probes \u00a7 418.112(c)(1) What system is in place to assure that the facility knows how to notify the hospice when necessary on a 24/7 basis? Is there any evidence that the communication is not occurring as needed during various times of the day or week or speci fic shifts? How does the hospice ensure that facility staff are able to recognize the individuals who are receiving hospice services and know that the services provided to this patient should be in accordance with the coordinated plan of care? What evidence is there that the hospice and the facility communicate with each other during and between patient visits, as appropriate, to share information about the patient's needs and response to the plan of care? Does the hospice staff have access t o and the ability to communicate with facility staff about the patient's care as often as needed? Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 103 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L765 \u00a7418.112(c)(2) - A provision the SNF/NF or ICF/ IID immediately notifies the hospice if \u2014 (i) A significant change in a patient's physical, mental, social, or emotional status occurs; (ii) Clinical complications appear that suggest a need to alter the plan of care; (iii) A need to transfer a patient from the SNF/NF or ICF/ IID arises, and the hospice makes arrangements for, and remains responsible for, any necessary continuous care or inpatient care necessary related to the terminal illness and related conditions; or (iv) A patient dies.

In entering i nto an agreement with each other, each provider retains responsibility for the quality and appropriateness of the care it provides in accordance with their respective laws and regulations. Both providers must comply with their applicable conditions/require ments for participation in Medicare/Medicaid. The facility's services must be consistent with the plan of care developed in coordination with the hospice, (the hospice patient residing in a facility should not experience any lack of services or personal ca re because of his/her status as a hospice patient); and the facility must offer the same services to its residents who have elected the hospice benefit as it furnishes to its residents who have not elected the hospice benefit. If a patient is receiving ser vices from a Medicare/Medicaid certified nursing facility or ICF/ IID, and the facility was advised of concerns by the hospice and failed to address and/or resolve issues related to coordination of care or implementation of appropriate services, the hospice surveyor will refer the concerns as a complaint to the State Agency responsible for oversight of the facility identifying the specific patient(s) involved and the concerns identified.

A hospice may offer bereavement services to facility staff or residents that ful fill the role of a hospice patient's family as identified in the patient's plan of care. L773 \u00a7418.112(d) Standard: Hospice plan of care. In accordance with \u00a7418.56, a written hospice plan of care must be established and maintained in consultation with SNF/NF or ICF/ IID representatives. All hospice care provided must be in accordance with this hospice plan of care. L774 \u00a7418.112(d)(1) - The hospice plan of care must identify the care and services that are needed and specifically identify which provider is responsible for performing the respective functions that have been agreed upon and included in the hospice plan of care. L775 \u00a7418.112(d)(2) - The hospice plan of care reflects the participation of the hospice, the SNF/NF or ICF/ IID, and the patient and family to the extent possible. The hospice and the facility must develop a coordinated plan of care for each patient that guides both providers. When a hospice patient is a resident of a facility, that patient 's hospice plan of care must be established and maintained in consultation with representatives of the facility and the patient/family (to the extent possible). The hospice portion of the plan of care governs the actions of the hospice and describes the services that are needed to care for the patie nt. In addition, the coordinated plan of care must identify which provider (hospice or facility) is responsible for performing a specific service. The coordinated plan of care may be divided into two portions, one of which is maintained by the facility and the other, which is maintained by the hospice. The facility is required to update its plan of care in accordance with any Federal, State or local laws and regulations governing the particular facility, just as hospices need to update their plans of care according to \u00a7418.56(d) of these CoPs. The hospice plan of care must specifically identify/delineate the provider responsible for each function/service/intervention included in the plan of care. NOTE : The providers must have a procedure that clearly outlines the chain of communication between the hospice and facility in the event a crisis or emergency develops, a change of condition occurs, and/or changes to the hospice portion of the plan of care are indicated. Based on the shared communication between pr oviders, both providers portion of the plan of care should reflect the identification of: Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 106 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Palliative outcomes; Responsible goals. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.112 (d)(2) Interview the patient, family or representative if possible to determine their involvement in the development of the plan of care, defining the approaches and goals, and to determine if interventions reflect choices and preferences. Also, determine how they are involved in developing and revising pain management strategies (if any) and any necessary revisions if the interventions do not work. Determine whether medicatio ns or other interventions for symptom control, medical supplies or DME related to the terminal illness have been arranged and provided by the hospice, and are available for patient use. Determine whether there have been delays in the provision of medications and/or supplies/equipment, and how this has been addressed by the hospice and the facility. L776 \u00a7418.112(d)(3) - Any changes in the hospice plan of care must be discussed with the patient or representative, and SNF/NF or ICF/ IID representatives, and must be approved by the hospice before implementation. The hospice and the facility must have a process in which they can exchange information from the hospice IDG plan of care reviews and assessment updates, and the facility team, patient and family (to t he extent possible) conferences, when updating the plan of care and evaluating outcomes of care to assure that the patient receives the necessary care and services. The hospice must authorize all changes to the hospice portion of the plan of care prior to the change being made. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.112(d)(3) Based on observations, if concerns are identified that the plan of care does not identify the interventions observed, or if the patient and/or representative have indicated that the interventions are not meeting his/her needs, interview hospice and facility staff. Determine how the hospice and facility monitor for the outcome of the interventions and what process they have in place to revise the plan of care to meet the needs of the patient. Determine how the hospice is providing coordination of the plan of care interventions, assuring that the interventions are being implemented by the facility, and assuring that interventions are not changed without hospice approval.

The hospice must: (1) Designate a member of each interdisciplinary group that is responsible for a patient who is a resident of a SNF/NF or ICF/ IID. The designated interdisciplinary group member is responsible for: L778 \u00a7418.112(e)(1)(i) - Providing overall coordination of the hospice care of the SNF/NF or ICF/ IID resident with SNF/NF or ICF/ IID representatives; and The intent of this regulation is for the hospice IDG to designate a member responsible for overseeing and coordinating the provision of care between the hospice and the facility. This person may or may not be the hospice RN responsible for the coordination of patient's hospice care in the facility. It ma y also be the physician, social worker or counselor member of the IDG. In order to facilitate the coordination and provision of hospice care to the patient, the hospice and the facility should address how the hospice staff access and communicate with facil ity staff. This includes, but is not limited to: Development of each provider's portion of the plan of care to assure that the plans are complimentary and reflect common goals and the patient's expressed desire for hospice care; Documentation in both respective entities clinical records or other means to ensure continuity of communication and easy access to ongoing information; Role of any hospice vendor in delivering supplies or medications; Ordering, renewal, delivery and administration of medications; and Role of the attending physician, and process for obtaining and implementing physician orders. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.112(e)(1)(i) Does the hospice's system for ordering, renewal, delivery and administration of medications work effectively in the facility? What procedures are in place to ensure that the patient receives timely medication and treatments for optimal palliation, pain and symptom relief? Is there evidence that th e hospice provides education to the facility on the hospice resident 's pain and symptom management plan? Does the hospice work with the facility to monitor the effectiveness of treatments related to pain and symptom control?

Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.112(e)(1)(ii) If there are problems identified regarding failure to communicate with facility staff, interview the hospice designated IDG member, and the facility care plan coordinator for the patient, in order to determine: The system the hospice has in place to ensure continuity of communication and easy access to ongoing information (e.g., documentation in both respective entities clinical records); and How the information from each provider's team conferences get communicated to the individuals participating in caring for the patient. Determine if there have been any concerns related to the need to change or alter the plan of care; or if a significant change in condition occurred requiring a transfer to an acute care setting, and how and when the facility notified the hospice of the concerns. In the event that there are concerns related to the coordination and implementation of the patient's plan of care for pain control and symptom management, interview the facility's nurse aides who provide direct care to the patient to determine: If they are aware of any complaints of pain from the patient or signs and symptoms that could indicate the presence of pain or discomfort; To whom they report the patient's complaints, signs, or symptoms; and If they are aware of, and implement, interventions for pain/discomfort management for the patient consistent with the patient's plan of care, (for example, allowing a period of time for a pain medication to take effect before bathing and/or dressing). Review the plan of care to determine if the plan was coordinated between the hospice and the facility. Determine if symptom management, including pain management interventions, are included, if needed, and addressed as appropriate: Measurable pain manag ement goals, reflecting patient needs and preferences; Pertinent non-pharmacological and/or pharmacological interventions; Time frames and approaches for monitoring the status of the patient's pain, including the effectiveness of the interventions; Identification of clinically significant medication -related adverse consequences such as falling, constipation, anorexia, or drowsiness, and a plan to minimize those adverse consequences; and Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 109 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors Whether the pain has been reassessed and the plan of care revised as necessary if the current interventions are not effective or the patient has experienced a change of condition or status. If the plan of care refers to a specific protocol, determine whe ther interventions are consistent with that protocol. If a patient's plan of care deviates from the protocol, determine through staff interview or record review the reason for the deviation. Interview a facility staff person who is knowledgeable about the needs and care of the patient to determine: How and when staff communicate with the hospice when/if the patient is experiencing pain; If the patient receives pain medication (including PRN and adjuvant medications), how, when, and by whom the result s of medications are evaluated (including the dose, frequency of PRN use, schedule of routine medications, and effectiveness); How staff monitor for the emergence or presence of adverse consequences of interventions; What is done if pain or other sym ptoms persist or recur despite treatment, and the basis for decisions to maintain or modify approaches; and How the hospice and the facility coordinate their approaches, communicate about the patient's needs, and monitor the outcomes (both effectiveness and adverse consequences). L780 (2) Ensure that the hospice IDG communicates with the SNF/NF or ICF/ IID medical director, the patient's attending physician, and other physicians participating in the provision of care to the patient as needed to coordinate the hospice care of the hospice patient with the medical care provided by other physicians. Both provid ers may document physician orders. Orders are to be dated and signed in accordance with State laws. Implementation of the plan of care changes resulting from physician orders received by the facility must have prior hospice approval. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.112(e)(2) If concerns were identified that changes to the plan of care, without prior hospice approval, occurred as a result of physician orders received by the facility, determine: How the IDG communicates with physicians involved with the patie nt; and If there is evidence that the IDG communicates effectively with all physicians involved in the patient's care to ensure that duplicative and/or conflicting physician orders related to the terminal illness and related conditions are not issued. L781 \u00a7418.112(e) (3) - Provide the SNF/NF or ICF/ IID with the following information: (i) The most recent hospice plan of care specific to each patient; The hospice and facility must have a process by which information from the hospice IDG plan of care reviews, updated assessments, and the facility team and the patient and family (to the extent possible) will be exchanged when developing and updating the plan of care and evaluating outcomes of care to assure that the patient receives the necessary care and Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 110 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors (ii) Hospice election form and any advance directives specific to each patient; (iii) Physician certification and recertification of the terminal illness specific to each patient; (iv) Names and contact information for hospice personnel involved in hospice care of each patient; (v) Instructions on how to access the hospice's 24-hour on-call system; (vi) Hospice medication information specific to each patient; and (vii) Hospice physician and attending physician (if any) orders specific to each patient. services.

L782 \u00a7418.112(f) Standard: Orientation and training of staff Hospice staff in coordination with SNF/NF or ICF/ IID facility staff, must assure orientation of such staff furnishing care to hospice patients in the hospice philosophy, including hospice policies and procedures regarding methods of comfort, pain control, symptom management, as well as principles about death and dying, individual responses to death, patient rights, appropriate forms, and record keeping requirements. It is the hospice's responsibility to assess the need for staff training and coordinate the staff training with representatives of the facility. It is also the hospice's responsibility to determine how frequently training needs to be offered in order to ensure that the facility staff furnishing care to hospice patients are oriented to the philosophy of hospice care. Facility staff turnover rates should be a consideration in determining training frequency. Procedures and Probes \u00a7418.112(f) If during observations and interviews with the patient/representative and staff, concerns are identified that staff are not following the hospice philosophy, policies and procedures regarding methods of comfort, pain control, symptom management, as well as principles about death and dying, individual responses to death, patient rights, appropriate forms, and record keeping requirements, interview hospice staff on how they have provided education to the facility staff. How does the hospice assure that the f acility staff furnishing care to hospice patients are trained in the hospice philosophy of care?

L798 \u00a7418.116 - The hospice and its staff must operate and furnish services in compliance with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations related to the health and safety of patients. If State or local law provides for licensing of hospices, the hospice must be licensed. L799 \u00a7418.116(a) Standard: Multiple locations. Every hospice must comply with the requirements of \u00a7420.206 of this chapter regarding disclosure of ownership and control information. All hospice multiple locations must be approved by Medicare and licensed in accordance with State licensure laws, if applicable, before providing Medicare reimbursed services. L800 \u00a7418.116(b) Standard: Laboratory services. (1) If the hospice engages in laboratory testing other than assisting a patient in self - administering a test with an appliance that has been approved for that purpose by the FDA, the hospice must be in complia nce with all applicable requirements of part 493 of this chapter. Determine if the hospice is providing laboratory testing as set forth at 42 CFR Part 493. If the hospice is performing testing, request to see the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificate for the level of testing being performed, i.e., a certificate of waiver, certificate for provider-performed microscopy procedures, certificate of accreditation, certificate of registration, or certificate of compliance (issued upon the determination of compliance after an on -site survey). Hospices holding a certificate of waiver are limited to performing only those tests determined to be in the waived category. Some tests that a hospice may perform that fall into the waived category inc lude: Dipstick/tablet reagent urinalysis; Blood glucose by glucose monitoring devices cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for home use; Some prothrombin time tests; and Some glycosolated hemoglobin tests. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 123 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors For a complete listing of waived tests, refer to CMS website at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/CLIA/10_Categorization_of_Tests.asp#TopOfPage Hospices holding a certificate for provider-performed microscopy procedures are limited to performing only those tests determined to be in the provider-performed microscopy procedure category or in combination with waived tests. The tests in the provider -performed microscopy procedures category (e.g., wet mounts, urine sediment examinations, and nasal smears for granulocytes) are not typical of those performed in a hospice. However, if they are conducted by hospice staff under a certificate for provider- performed microscopy procedures, they must be performed by a practitioner as specified at \u00a7493.19 (i.e., a physician, nurse midwife, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or dentist). If not performed by these personnel, the hospice would require a regist ration certificate (which allows the performance of such testing until a determination of compliance is made), certificate of accreditation, or certificate of compliance. For a complete listing of provider-performed microscopy procedures, refer to CMS website at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/CLIA/10_Categorization_of_Tests.asp#TopOfPage A registration certificate, a certificate of accreditation, or a certificate of compliance is required if the hospice performs any other testing procedures, (i.e., moderate or high complexity testing). While some prothrombin testing is in the waived category, as mentioned above, other prothrombin testing is considered moderate complexity testing depending on the skill level required to operate the instrument. For a complete listing of moderate and high complexity tests, refer to CMS website at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/CLIA/10_Categorization_of_Tests.asp#TopOfPage Assisting individuals in administering their own tests, such as fingerstick blood glucose or prothrombin testing, is n ot considered testing subject to the CLIA regulations. However, if the hospice staff is actually responsible for measuring the blood glucose level or prothrombin times of patients with an FDA -approved blood glucose or prothrombin time monitor, and no other tests are being performed, request to see the facility's certificate of waiver, since glucose testing with a blood glucose meter (approved by the FDA specifically for home use) and some prothrombin time tests are waived tests under the provisions at 42 CF R 493.15. If the hospice does not possess the appropriate CLIA certificate, inform the hospice that it is in violation of CLIA law and that it must apply immediately to the State Agency for the appropriate certificate. The hospice is out of compliance wit h 42 CFR 418.116(b). Also, refer this hospice's noncompliance to the department within the State Agency responsible for CLIA surveys. Hospice Conditions of Participation (Effective 11/29/19) 124 Tag Number Regulation Guidance to Surveyors L801 \u00a7418.116(b)(2) - If the hospice chooses to refer specimens for laboratory testing to a reference laboratory, the reference laboratory must be certified in the appropriate specialties and subspecialties of services in accordance with the applicable requirements of Part 493 of this chapter. The hospice is required to co mply with applicable State law and secure a CLIA certificate of waiver for any waived testing performed by staff. Lab specimens obtained in the patient's home must be taken to laboratories that meet CLIA and state law requirements. The hospice should have a copy of the reference laboratory's CLIA certificate in its administrative records. Transmittals Issued for this Appendix Rev # Issue Date Subject Impl.
