For more information go to [www.P65Warnings.ca.gov/food](https://www.P65Warnings.ca.gov/food). Ingredients (2.47 grams per serving) Caffeine Anhydrous (100 milligrams per serving) Many of us can't shake the cobwebs without our morning cup of coffee, but this compound is a lot more than a mere pick-me-up. Caffeine also boosts metabolism, improves strength, promotes muscle endurance, and enhances anaerobic performance. [[9]](#ref-9) [[10]](#ref-10) [[11]](#ref-11) The clinically effective dose of caffeine for enhancing performance is between 3 and 6 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. [[12]](#ref-12) We included 100 milligrams of caffeine in Energy Surge because it's enough to provide benefits while also allowing you to safely use a caffeinated pre-workout supplement like [Pulse](https://legionathletics.com/products/supplements/pulse-pre-workout) or drink caffeinated beverages like coffee, tea, and energy drinks. L-Theanine (100 milligrams per serving) L-theanine is an amino acid found primarily in tea that's responsible for some of its health benefits. It helps balance the levels of two chemicals in the brain known as glutamate and GABA, which transmit nerve impulses. That's why research shows that supplementation with L-theanine . . . - Reduces the effects of mental stress [[13]](#ref-13) - Increases the production of nitric oxide, which improves blood flow [[14]](#ref-14) - When paired with caffeine, improves mood, memory performance, and attention [[15]](#ref-15) [[16]](#ref-16) [[17]](#ref-17) [[18]](#ref-18) The clinically effective dosage of L-theanine when combined with caffeine is between a ratio of 1:1 and 2:1 theanine to caffeine, but as 2:1 may produce a calming effect, the 1:1 ratio we've used in Energy Surge is optimal for boosting energy, focus, and athletic performance. Taurine (2 grams per serving) Taurine is an amino acid found primarily in seafood and meat that plays an important role in cardiovascular and muscle function by protecting cells from oxidative stress and regulating the release of neurotransmitters and glucose. [[19]](#ref-19) [[20]](#ref-20) Research shows that supplementation with taurine . . . - Improves focus, attention, and verbal reasoning when combined with caffeine [[21]](#ref-21) [[22]](#ref-22) - Helps minimize unwanted side effects of caffeine (like jitters) [[23]](#ref-23) - Helps prevent a \"sugar crash\" by slowing the release of glucose into the blood [[24]](#ref-24) [[25]](#ref-25) The clinically effective dose of taurine is 1-to-3 Rhodiola Rosea Extract (250 milligrams per serving) Rhodiola rosea (also known as Golden Root) is a plant that grows in cold parts of the world, including the Arctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It's known as an adaptogen, which is a substance that causes an imperceptible level of stress in the body and trains it to better handle future stresses. Research shows that supplementation with rhodiola rosea . . . - Improves mood reduces symptoms of stress and depression [[26]](#ref-26) [[27]](#ref-27) [[28]](#ref-28) - Reduces stress-related fatigue [[29]](#ref-29) - Preserves and possibly enhances cognition and mood during strenuous periods [[30]](#ref-30) - May enhance physical performance [[31]](#ref-31) - May reduce exercise-induced muscle damage [[32]](#ref-32) - May help the body defend against viral infections [[33]](#ref-33) The clinically effective dose of rhodiola rosea is unknown, but most long-term benefits have been observed with 90 to 120 milligrams. Energy Surge contains 250 milligrams of rhodiola rosea per serving because it may produce quicker results. B Vitamin Complex (27.4 milligrams per serving) B vitamins are a category of naturally-occurring substances that cells need to turn food into energy. They also affect mood, feelings of wellness, and brain, nerve, and cardiovascular function. Research shows that supplementation with B vitamins (particularly vitamins B2, B3, B6, and B12) . . . - Reduces stress [[34]](#ref-34) - Improves mental clarity, energy, and focus [[35]](#ref-35) - Boosts cognitive function and memory [[36]](#ref-36) [[37]](#ref-37) - Can prevent and reduce symptoms of depression [[38]](#ref-38) [[39]](#ref-39) There is no established clinically effective dose of a B vitamin complex, but the B vitamins thought to most improve energy, mood, and cognitive function are B2, B3, B6, and B12. Energy Surge contains 3.4 mg of vitamin B2 (as riboflavin), 20 mg of vitamin B3 (as niacin), 4 mg of vitamin B6 (as pyridoxal-5-phosphate), 12 mcg of vitamin B12 (as methylcobalamin). No Artificial Food Dyes or Other Chemical Junk As with artificial sweeteners, studies show that artificial food dyes may cause negative effects in some people, including gastrointestinal toxicity and behavioral disorders. [[40]](#ref-40) [[41]](#ref-41) [[42]](#ref-42) [[43]](#ref-43) [[44]](#ref-44) That's why we use natural coloring derived from fruits and other foods, as well as natural flavoring.
