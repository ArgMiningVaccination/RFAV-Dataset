It is necessary to ensure product quality. - Follow the recommended dosage and avoid overuse to mitigate any adverse effects. - Dilute essential oils in carrier oils as per the prescribed dilution ratio. For babies and children, the dilution ratio ranges from 0.1 to 5 percent. Consult an expert to know the precise dilution ratio for an oil. - Choose a carrier oil that is mild on the baby's sensitive mucous membrane. For instance, fractionated coconut oili [X]A lighter, less greasy form of coconut oil obtained by removing certain fats. or virgin coconut oil is a general recommendation. Speak to an essential oil expert to know more about suitable carrier oils. - Do a patch test for the carrier oil alone to rule out any allergies due to the base oil. - Do a patch test of the essential oil and carrier oil mix to rule out the possibility of allergic reactions or cross-reactivity. If your baby has allergies or a family history of allergies and sensitivities, consult a pediatrician before use. - If your baby has any medical conditions or is on medications, use essential oils after consulting the doctor to prevent possible drug interactions. - Discontinue using the essential oil if the baby exhibits signs of sensitivity, such as visible skin irritation or uncontrolled crying. You can apply a small amount of vegetable oil or full-fat milk to soothe the affected area. - Keep essential oils in tinted glass bottles and store them in a cool, dark place, away from sunlight, to preserve their quality. - Diffuse essential oils in a ventilated area for no more than 20 minutes.
