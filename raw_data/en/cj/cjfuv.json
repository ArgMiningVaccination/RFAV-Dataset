We appreciate any comments that you have regarding the Federal Student Aid Handbook. We revise and clarify the text in response to questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please contact us at fsaschoolspubs@ed.gov to let us know how to improve the Handbook so that it is always clear and informative. Here, we provide a summary of the changes and clarifications presented in greater detail in the chapters that follow. Alone the text herein does not provide schools with the guidance needed to satisfactorily administer the Title IV HEA programs . For more complete guidance, you should refer to the text in the chapters cited, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and the Higher Education Assistance Act (HEA) as amended. Throughout this volume, new information is indicated with the following symbol: When the text represents a clarification rather than a change, it is indicated with: When we believe that historically there might be some misunderstanding of a requirement, we indicate that with: If we want to point out a bit of helpful information, we indicate it with: Finally, if we want to draw your attention to something, we indicate it with: Notes on Active Links At the top of each page you will find links to the Federal Student Aid Glossary and Appendices, the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR), and Dear Colleague Letters (DCL).This volume of the Federal Student Aid Handbook comprises topics pertaining to colleges' general obligations in administering the Title IV student aid programs: institutional and program eligibility, administrative requirements, audits, record keeping, program reviews, and providing information to the public are all explained.Introduction to Volume 2 NEW Reminder TIPClarification CFR June 2017Major Changes Chapter 2\u2014 Program Eligibility, Written Arrangements, & Distance Education We have clarified the Certification requirements for GE programs.

Some schools apply only for designation as an eligible institution\u2014they do not seek to participate\u2014so that their students may receive deferments on FSA program loans or be eligible for the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits or other non-FSA programs that require schools to be FSA-eligible. The same application is used to apply for both eligibility and certification for participation (see Chapter 2 ). TYPE AND CONTROL The three types of eligible institutions The law defines three kinds of eligible institutions : institutions of higher education , proprietary institutions of higher education , and postsecondary vocational institutions . Each type of school is eligible to participate in all the FSA programs, provided it offers the appropriate type of program (see the chart on the next page). This section covers the key elements of the three definitions, giving special attention to those requirements that affect the definition of an eligible program. Although the criteria for the three types of institutions differ, it is possible that an institution of higher education can also qualify as a postsecondary vocational institution by offering a programs that are less than an academic year in length and lead to a certificate or other non- degree recognized credential. Institutional control The control of an institution distinguishes whether it is public or private, nonprofit or for-profit. By definition, an institution of higher education or a postsecondary vocational institution can be either public or private but is always nonprofit. A proprietary institution of higher education is always a private, for-profit institution.Institutional Eligibility This chapter discusses the three types of institutions that are eligible to participate in the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs. If circumstances change and a participating school no longer qualifies as an eligible institution, it must notify the Department of Education (the Department; see Chapter 5 ) and carry out the closeout procedures described in Chapter 8 . Assessing your school's compliance To assess your school's compliance with the provisions of this chapter, see the FSA Assessment module for \"Institutional Eligibility,\" at: Eligible program\u2014 Chapter 2 Closeout procedures\u2014 Chapter 8 Applying to participate, New School Guide Eligibility of homeschooled and correspondence students\u2014 Volume 1 , Chapter 1 Definitions of eligible institutions 34 CFR 600.4, 600.5, and FSA HB June 20172-4Type and Control of Eligible Institutions The institution offers (1) associate, bachelor's, gradu - ate, or professional degree programs; (2) a program of at least two years that is acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree; or (3) a training program of at least one academic year that leads to a certificate or other nondegree recognized credential and prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.The institution must (1) provide training for gainful employment in a recognized occupation or (2) have provided a program leading to a baccalaureate degree in liberal arts continuously since 1/1/09 (with continuous regional accreditation since 10/1/07 or earlier). Programs offered must meet the criteria of at least one category below: (1) They are at least a 15-week (instructional time) undergraduate program of 600 clock hours, 16 semester or trimester hours, or 24 quarter hours. They may admit students without an associate degree or equivalent. (2) They are at least a 10-week (instructional time) program of 300 clock hours, 8 semester or trimester hours, or 12 quarter hours. They must be a graduate/professional program or must admit only students with an associate degree or equivalent. (3) They are at least a 10-week (instructional time) undergraduate program of 300-599 clock hours. They must admit at least some students who do not have an associate degree or equivalent and must meet specific qualitative standards. Note: These programs are eligible only for Direct Loan participation. Any school may act as a postsecondary vocational institution to offer GE programs less than one academic year in length. Also, all three institutional types may provide a comprehensive transition and postsecondary program for individuals with intellectual disabilities. \"Two-Year Rule\" (applicable to proprietary and postsecondary vocational institutions): Legally authorized to give (and continuously have been giving) the same postsecondary instruction for at least two consecutive years. The institution must provide training for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Programs offered must meet the criteria of at least one category below: (1) They are at least a 15-week (instructional time) undergraduate program of 600 clock hours, 16 semester or trimester hours, or 24 quarter hours. They may admit students without an associate degree or equivalent. (2) They are at least a 10-week (instructional time) program of 300 clock hours, 8 semester or trimester hours, or 12 quarter hours. Must be a graduate/professional program or must admit only students with an associate degree or equivalent. (3) They are at least a 10-week (instructional time) undergraduate program of 300-599 clock hours. Must admit at least some students who do not have an associate degree or equivalent and must meet specific qualitative standards. Note: These programs are eligible only for Direct Loan participation.Institution of Higher Education A public or private nonprofit educational institution located in a stateProprietary Institution of Higher Education A private, for-profit educational institution located in a statePostsecondary Vocational Institution A public or private nonprofit educational institution located in a stateChapter 1\u2014Institutional Eligibility CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-5BASIC CRITERIA FOR ELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS To be eligible an institution must be legally authorized by a state to provide a postsecondary edu - cation program in that state, be accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or have met the alternative requirements, if applicable, and admit as regular students only individuals with a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent or individuals beyond the age of compulsory school attendance in the state where the in - stitution is located. These requirements are discussed in the following sections. LEGAL AUTHORIZATION BY A STATE Generally, an eligible institution must be located in a state. A school is physically located in a state if it has a campus or instructional site in that state. There are exceptions: Institutions of higher education in the Federated States of Mi - cronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands are eligible for purposes of the Federal Pell Grant Program. Institutions of higher education in Palau are eligible for pur - poses of the Federal Pell Grant, FSEOG, and FWS programs. Foreign schools may participate in the Direct Loan Program, subject to the rules of Subpart E of 34 CFR Part 600. There are two basic requirements for an institution to be considered legally authorized by a state for the purpose of Title IV program eligibility: (1) the state must authorize the institution by name to operate postsecondary educational programs; and (2) the state must have a process to review and act on complaints concerning the schools, including enforcing applicable state laws. The following are exempt from both of these requirements: schools authorized by name by the federal government to offer educational programs beyond secondary education, and schools authorized by name by an Indian tribe [as defined in 25 USC 1801(a)(2)] to offer educational programs beyond secondary education, provided they are located on tribal lands and the tribal government has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the schools and enforces applicable tribal requirements or laws.Nonprofit institution A school that is owned and operated by one or more nonprofit corporations or associations whose net earnings do not benefit any private shareholder or individual, legally authorized to operate as a non - profit organization by each state in which it is physically located, and determined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to be eligible for tax- deductible contributions in accordance with the IRS Code [26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)]. State defined \"State\" includes not only the 50 states, but also American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. See 34 CFR 600.2.Definition of Indian tribe The institutional eligibility regulations (see 34 CFR 600.9) incorrectly cite 25 USC 1802(2); this will be corrected in the Federal Register to 25 USC 1801(a)(2). Role of state entities The regulations mention, as one option, that an institution may be established by name through some \"other action\" by an appropriate state entity. Other institutions, established as businesses or nonprofit charitable institutions, must show that the state took an active role in approving or licensing them to operate postsecondary educational programs. For details on these and other issues, see DCL GEN-13-20.Volume 2\u2014School June 20172-6Religious institutions must comply with (2) but are exempt from (1) above\u2014i.e., they are already considered to be legally authorized to operate postsecondary educational programs\u2014if they are exempt from state authorization as religious institutions under the state constitution or by state law. See the definition in the margin on the following page. Authorization to operate postsecondary educational programs A school can be established by name as an educational institution through a state charter, statute, constitutional provision, or other action by an appropriate state entity. The school must be authorized to operate educational programs beyond the secondary level, including programs leading to a degree or certificate. In addition, the institution must comply with any applicable state approval or licensure requirement, although the state may exempt the school from that approval or requirement based on the school being in operation for at least 20 years or on its accreditation by one or more accrediting agencies recognized by the Department. If a school was not established by name as an educational institution but was established by a state on the basis of an authorization to conduct business or to operate as a nonprofit charitable organization, it must be approved or licensed by name by the state to offer programs beyond secondary education, including programs leading to a degree or certificate. Such a school can't be exempted from state approval or licensure requirements based on accreditation, years in operation, or a comparable exemption. A school must have documentation that it has the authority to operate in a state at the time of its certification to participate in the FSA programs. For more information on applying for participation in the FSA programs, see the New School Guide . Existing Title IV schools should ensure that they are currently in compliance with the regulations, but they are not required to immediately update their Eligibility and Certification Approval Report (ECAR). Instead, they can include the information showing their state authorization when they next submit their application for approval to participate in the FSA programs. For questions about documenting state legal authorization, schools should contact their participation team, information for which can be found at https://eligcert.ed.gov.Definition of religious institution An institution that is owned, controlled, operated, and maintained by a religious organization lawfully operating as a nonprofit reli - gious corporation; and awards only religious degrees or cer - tificates including but not limited to a certificate of Talmudic studies, an as - sociate of Biblical studies, a bachelor of religious studies, a master of divinity, or a doctor of divinity. 34 CFR different types of schools meet state authorization requirements Legal Entity Entity Description Approval or Licensure Process Educational InstitutionA public, private nonprofit, or for-profit institution established by name through a charter, statute, articles of incorporation, or other action issued by an appropriate state entity as an educational institution authorized to operate educational programs beyond secondary education, including programs leading to a degree or certificate.The institution must comply with any applicable state approval or licensure process and be approved or licensed by name. It may be exempted from such requirement based on its accreditation or being in operation at least 20 years. Business A for-profit entity established by the state on the basis of an authorization or license to conduct commerce or provide services.The state must have a state approval or licensure process, and the institution must comply with that process and be approved or licensed by name to offer postsecondary education. An institution in this category may not be exempted from state approval or licensure based on accreditation, years in operation, or a comparable exemption.Charitable OrganizationsA nonprofit entity established by the state on the basis of an authorization or license for the public interest or common good. Notes: The chart does not apply to federal, tribal, and religious institutions, which are exempt from these requirements, or to distance education programs offered out of state. A state must have a process to review and address complaints directly or through referrals; this applies to all institutions except tribal and federal institutions. For tribal institutions, the tribal government must have a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning them and to enforce applicable tribal requirements or laws. State complaint process The state must have a process to review and act on complaints (for example, about fraud or false advertising) concerning a school, which must provide the contact information for filing those complaints to enrolled and prospective students. Complaints can be handled by the state attorney general's office or a state agency as long as that entity can review, investigate, and resolve complaints against the school. There may be different complaint processes for different types of schools. Whatever entity handles complaints, the state must have the final authority for the process. See DCL GEN-14-04 for more FSA HB 20172-8ACCREDITATION Generally, a school must be accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association (both referred to here as agencies) to be eligible. Except as provided here, a school must be accredited by an agency that has the authority to cover all of the institution's programs. An agency such as this is referred to as the school's primary accrediting agency . A school can have only one primary accreditor. A school may also be accredited by one or more programmatic accrediting agencies. A programmatic accrediting agency is one that accredits only individual educational programs that prepare students for entry into a profession, occupation, or vocation. If a school is seeking to change primary accreditors, it must first provide the Department and the agencies all materials documenting the reasons for the change. Information on accreditation changes is in Chapter 5 . Alternatives to regular accreditation The law provides two statutory alternatives to accreditation by a recognized accrediting agency. First, a public or private nonprofit institution may be preaccredited by an agency or association that has been approved by the Department to grant such preaccreditation. Second, public postsecondary vocational educational institutions may be eligible for FSA funds if accredited by a state agency that the Department determines to be a reliable authority. Primary accreditor The primary accreditor typically is an accrediting agency whose scope is institution-wide rather than only programmatic. A participating institution must tell the Department which accrediting agency it wants to serve as its primary accrediting agency for FSA eligibility. If a school offers only programs of a singular nature, the school's primary accreditor may be an agency that accredits only those specific educational programs. Dual accreditation If a school is accredited by two agencies at the same time, the school must designate which agency's accreditation will be used in determining institutional eligibility for FSA funds and must inform the Department via the E-App. Further, the school must provide to the Department and to both agencies all materials documenting the reasons for dual accreditation before the school adds the additional accreditation. See Chapter 5 for more on changes in accreditation and loss of eligibility.Nationally recognized accrediting agency An agency or association the Department has recognized to accredit or preaccredit a category of institution, school, or educational program according to 34 CFR Parts 602 and 603. List of accrediting agencies The Department periodically publishes a list of nationally recognized accrediting bodies in the Federal Register based on criteria in 34 CFR Part 602. The list of accrediting agencies recognized for FSA purposes is on the Department's website at ( www.ed.gov/ admins/finaid/accred/index.html ). Agencies recognized for their preaccreditation categories are in Section 7. Information about national recognition of state approval agencies is in Section 10. Alternatives to accreditation Institutions of Higher Education 34 CFR 600.4(a)(5)(ii) Postsecondary Vocational Institutions 34 CFR 600.6(a)(5)(ii) Preaccredited A status granted by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association to a public or private nonprofit institution that is progressing toward accreditation within a reasonable period of time. Institutions of Higher Education 34 CFR 600.4(a)(5)(ii) Postsecondary STANDARDS An eligible institution may admit as regular students only persons who have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent, are beyond the age of compulsory school attendance in the state in which the school is located, or are dually enrolled in the college and a secondary school. An eligible student must have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent or be beyond the age of compulsory attendance and meet the criteria for homeschooled students. Students who are dually enrolled in high school and college are not eligible for FSA funds. See Volume 1 , Chapter 1 . High school diploma A high school diploma is a document recognized by the state in which the high school is located. Unless required by its accrediting or state licensing agency, the college is not required to keep a copy of a student's high school diploma or recognized equivalent of a high school diploma (see below). Rather, the college may rely on the student's certification (including that on the FAFSA) that he or she has received the credential and a copy of the certification must be kept on file. This certification need not be a separate document. It may be collected on the college's admissions application. The college may also require the student to provide supporting documentation. Recognized equivalent of a high school diploma The following are the equivalent of a high school diploma: A GED certificate. A state certificate awarded after passing an authorized test and that the state recognizes as equivalent to a high school diploma. This includes evidence of a passing score on tests recognized by the state and similar to the GED, such as the High School Equivalency Test or HiSET and the Test Assessing Secondary Completion or TASC. An academic transcript showing that the student has success - fully completed at least a two-year program that is acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree (including a previously earned bachelor's degree). For a student seeking enrollment in a program of at least the associate degree level, documentation showing that he excelled academically in high school and has met the formalized written admissions policies of the college.Related requirements A school may not deny readmission to a service member of the uniformed services for reasons relating to that service. See Chapter 3 for more information.Admissions standards 34 CFR 600.4(a)(2), 600.5(a)(3), 600.6(a)(2) Checking validity of high school diplomas A school must evaluate the validity of a student's high school completion if the school or the Department has reason to believe that the high school diploma is not valid or was not obtained from an entity that provides secondary school education. This is discussed in detail in Volume 1 , Chapter 1 . 34 CFR 668.16(p) Dual enrollment in high school and college 20 USC 1001(b)(2)(B), 1002(b)(2)(B) and (c) (2)(B)Regular student definition A person who is enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an eligible program to obtain a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential. If a person is not yet beyond the age of compulsory school attendance in the state where the college is physically located, it may only enroll her as a regular student if she has a high school diploma or its equivalent or is dually enrolled in high school and college. 34 CFR 600.2 Students admitted without a high school diploma or equivalent A school that admits students who do not have a high school diploma or a recognized equivalent has additional considerations. See Limitation on students admitted without a high school diploma or equivalent in Chapter 4 .Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations, 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-10Homeschooled students and compulsory school attendance The Department considers a homeschooled student to be beyond the age of compulsory school attendance if the state in which the college is located does not consider him truant once he has completed homeschooling. For instance, if your state requires children to attend school until age 17, you may admit as a regular student a child who completes her secondary homeschooling curriculum at age 16 if your state would not consider her truant and would not require her to go to high school or continue homeschooling until age 17. You may rely on a homeschooled student's self-certification that he completed secondary school in a homeschool setting, as discussed in Volume 1, Chapter 1 , under \"Academic Qualifications.\" Preparatory programs for students without a high school diploma or equivalent A school that admits students without a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent (except homeschooled students) must make available to them a program that has proven successful in helping students obtain the equivalent of a high school diploma. For example, such a program might assist a student in obtaining a GED certificate or the state certificate mentioned earlier. It could be a preparatory program conducted by state and local secondary school authorities, as well as a program for which the school has documentation that statistically demonstrates success. The school must provide information about the availability of the program to interested students. The school does not have to provide the program or pay for its cost. The program must be offered at a place that is convenient for students, and the school must take reasonable steps to ensure that they have access to it, such as coordinating the timing of school programs and the preparatory program. The law does not require a school to verify that a student is enrolled in a preparatory program or to monitor his progress in it. A student who does not have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent is not required by law to enroll in such a program, but the school may make this an admission requirement. A student may not receive FSA funds for the program, and a school cannot include the cost of the program in a student's cost of attendance.Related topics See Chapter 2 for transition programs for students with intellectual disabilities. See also Volume 1, Chapter 1 , about that and about remedial coursework.Students admitted without a high school diploma or equivalent A school that admits students who do not have a high school diploma or a recognized equivalent has additional considerations. See Limitation on students admitted without a high school diploma or equivalent in Chapter 4 . Career pathway programs Students enrolled in an eligible career pathway program who are not high school graduates and don't have a diploma equivalent may be eligible to receive Title IV aid if they pass an independently administered, ED-approved ability-to-benefit test or complete at least 6 credit hours or 225 clock hours that apply to a degree or certificate offered by the school. See DCL GEN-16-09 for more information, including a list of Q's and A's about career pathway PROPRIETARY OR VO - CATIONAL SCHOOLS To be eligible as a proprietary institution or a postsecondary vocational institution, a school must be legally authorized to give (and have continuously been giving) the same postsecondary instruction for at least two consecutive years prior to its application. The educational program(s) offered must remain substantially the same in length and subject matter except for changes made because of new technology or requirements of other federal agencies. A school subject to the two-year rule may not award FSA funds to a student in a program that is not included in the school's approval documents. If a school is subject to the two-year rule, during the school's initial period of participation in the FSA programs, the Department will not approve additional programs that would expand the institution's eligibility. An exception would be considered if the school demonstrates that the program has been legally authorized and continuously provided for at least two years prior to the date of the request. A branch campus of an eligible proprietary institution or postsecondary vocational institution seeking status as a main campus or freestanding institution is subject to the two-year rule. It must be designated as a branch campus for two years after certification as such by the Department before it can seek certification as a main or freestanding school. An additional location must obtain approval from the Department to become a branch campus. A branch campus then must satisfy the two-year rule before it may be considered for status as a freestanding institution. Time at an additional location of an eligible proprietary institution or postsecondary vocational institution does not count toward the two years.Notifying ED of changes to school's E-App information If there is a change to any of a school's answers to the Yes/No questions in Section G of a submitted Electronic Application (E-App), which deal with enrollment thresholds for the limitations below, the school must notify the Department via the E-App (see Chapter 5 ). The Department will advise the school of its options, including whether the school might be eligible for a waiver. Waivers are available for the correspondence student limitation, the incarcerated student limitation, and the limitation on students without a high school diploma or equivalent. 34 CFR 600.7(h)Branch campus A branch campus is geographically apart from and independent of the school's main campus. It is considered to be independent of the main campus if it: is permanent in nature; offers educational programs leading to a degree, certificate, or other recognized credential; has its own faculty and administrative or supervisory organization; and has its own budgetary and hiring authority. Branch campus 34 CFR 600.2 and 600.8 Additional location June 20172-12FACTORS LEADING TO LOSS OF ELIGIBILITY Limitations An otherwise eligible institution becomes ineligible if it violates, among other requirements, the 50% limit on students without a high school diploma or equivalent (for schools that don't offer a 4-year bachelor's de - gree program or a 2-year associate degree program), the incarcerated student limitation (25%), or the correspondence course limitation (50%) or correspondence student limitation (50%). The school must demonstrate compliance with these limitations, and its calculations must be attested to by the independent auditor. Chapter 4, which describes FSA audit requirements, discusses the calculations in more detail and how the school must notify the Department of a failure to meet any of these requirements. Bankruptcy or crimes involving FSA programs A school is not eligible if it files for relief in bankruptcy or has entered against it an order for bankruptcy. The school is also ineligible if either of these circumstances apply to an affiliate of the school that has the power, by contract or ownership interest, to direct or cause the direction of the management of policies of the school. A school also loses eligibility if it, its owner, or its executive officer has pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or is found guilty of, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of FSA program funds; or been judicially determined to have committed fraud involving FSA program funds. If a school becomes ineligible for any of these reasons, it must notify the Department of the change within 10 days. A school that becomes ineligible because of one of these factors must immediately stop awarding FSA funds and must follow the requirements for a school that has lost its FSA participation (see Chapter 8) . The loss of eligibility is effective as of the date of the bankruptcy or the date the school or individual pleads guilty to, or is found responsible for, the crime, as applicable. A loss of eligibility for these two reasons is permanent\u2014the school's eligibility cannot be reinstated.Conditions of institutional ineligibility 34 CFR 600.7 Prohibition on employment of individuals who have misused government funds A school may not have as principals or employ or contract with other organizations that employ individuals who have engaged in the misuse of government funds. See Chapter 3 for details. Chapter 1\u2014Institutional Eligibility CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-13TEACH grant eligibility There are no agencies for the accreditation of professional teacher education programs that are recognized by the Department at the present time. Thus, to comply with the definition of a TEACH Grant-eligible program, institutions should follow the regulations pertaining to State approval of the teacher preparation programs or one of the other options available under the definition of a TEACH Grant-eligible institution in 34 CFR 686.2(d). DC-GEN-08-07 34 CFR Part 686PARTICIPATING IN THE TEACH GRANT PROGRAM Eligibility for the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant program is not automatically extended to an FSA-eligible postsecondary school. A school qualifies as a \"TEACH Grant-eligible institution\" if it offers a high-quality teacher preparation program at either the baccalaureate or master's level and provides supervision and support services to teachers (or assists in the provision of such services). The teacher preparation program must be accredited by a specialized accrediting agency recognized by the Department for the accreditation of professional teacher education programs or be approved by a state and provide extensive pre-service clinical experience. If a school does not have a teacher preparation program, it can qualify for TEACH Grants if it provides one or more 2-year programs of study that are accept - able for full credit to either a baccalaureate teacher preparation degree program or a baccalaureate degree program in a high- need field at another TEACH-eligible school with which it has an agreement; offers a baccalaureate degree that, in combination with other training or experience, will prepare a student to teach in a high-need field and has an agreement with another institution that offers a teacher preparation program or a post-baccalaure - ate program that prepares students to teach; or offers a postbaccalaureate program that prepares students to teach. APPLYING AS AN ELIGIBLE NONPARTICIPATING SCHOOL Some schools choose to establish their eligibility for FSA programs but elect not to participate in them because designation as an eligible institution qualifies a school or its students to take advantage of non- FSA programs or benefits, such as the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits. In addition, only students attending eligible institutions qualify for in-school deferments of payments on their federal education loans. A school wishing to be designated an eligible nonparticipating institution may submit an E-App to the Department at any time. The application must be materially complete.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations, 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-14The Department will contact the school, generally within 90 days of receiving the application, if it has additional questions. If it approves the school's application, it will send an electronic notice to the president and financial aid officer stating that the school is eligible and that its approval letter and ECAR must be printed and maintained. If the Department does not approve the school's application, it will tell the school why. WITHDRAWAL RATES Students are considered to have withdrawn if they officially withdraw, unofficially drop out, are expelled from the school, or receive a 100% refund of their tuition and fees. Those who withdraw from one or more courses or programs but do not withdraw entirely from the school (e.g., the students reduced their credit hours from 12 to 6) do not meet the definition of withdrawn. Instead, this action is considered a change in enrollment status. New schools (those seeking to participate in an FSA program for the first time) must have an undergraduate withdrawal rate for regular students of no more than 33% during the last completed award year. When calculating the withdrawal rate, the school must include all regular, enrolled students. The definition of enrolled does not require either payment of tuition or class attendance; therefore, the withdrawal rate calculation must include enrolled students who have not yet paid tuition or begun attending classes.\"Enrolled\" for the purpose of withdrawal rates Students enroll when they complete the school's registration requirements (except payment of tuition and fees). Correspondence students are enrolled if they have been admitted to the program and have submitted one lesson (that was completed without the assistance of a school representative). Chapter 1\u2014Institutional Eligibility CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-15THE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT To participate in the FSA programs, a school must have a current Program Participation Agreement (PPA), signed by the school's president, chief executive officer, or chancellor and an authorized representative of the Secretary of Education. Purpose and scope of the PPA With the PPA the school agrees to comply with the laws, regulations, and policies governing the FSA programs. After being certified for FSA program participation, the school must administer FSA program funds in a prudent and responsible manner. A PPA contains critical information: in addition to the effective date of a school's approval, the date by which the school must reapply for participation, and the date on which the approval expires, the PPA lists the FSA programs in which the school is eligible to participate. Beginning to disburse funds when first signing the PPA A school may make Pell and TEACH Grant disbursements to students for the payment period in which the PPA is signed by the Secretary. Schools receiving initial certification can participate in the Campus-Based programs in the next award year that funds become available. Direct Loan program disbursements may begin in the loan period that the PPA is signed. Expiration or termination of the agreement Either the school or the Department may terminate the PPA. The agreement automatically terminates if the school loses eligibility. A school's Program Participation Agreement expires on the date that the school changes ownership that results in a change in con - trol (see Chapter 5 ), the school closes or stops offering educational programs for a reason other than a normal vacation period or natural disaster that directly affects it or its students (see closure procedures in Chapter 8 ), the school ceases to meet the eligibility requirements (see Chapter 4 and \"Factors Leading to Loss of Eligibility\" in this chapter), the school's period of participation expires, or its provisional certification is revoked ( Chapters 4, 5, and 8). A school's PPA no longer covers an additional location as of the date on which that location ceases to be a part of the school.Program Participation Agreement Sec. 487 of the HEA covered by the PPA An eligible school must enter into a PPA with the Department to participate in the following programs: Federal Pell Grant Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant* TEACH Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Federal Work-Study (FWS) Federal Perkins Loan Federal Direct Loan Program (DL) * A school that is certified for Pell Grant purposes is considered to be certified for the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant program. Experimental sites The Experimental Sites Initiative permits statutory and regulatory flexibility for schools participating in the experiments. This gives the Department data for judging the effectiveness of certain laws and regulations and whether they should change. For example, the Dual Enrollment Experiment allows participating colleges to award Pell grants to students for their Title IV-eligible college program while still being enrolled in high school. For more information and other experiments, see the website at ( https://experimentalsites. ed.gov HB June 20172-16Selected Provisions of the PPA Most of the provisions of the Program Participation Agreement (PPA) are discussed in detail in Volume 2 and other volumes of the Federal Student Aid Handbook . In this section, we highlight some of the general school requirements in the PPA that may not be as familiar to financial aid professionals. Note that the PPA may list additional requirements that are school-specific; schools must carefully review all of the requirements listed on their PPA. General Terms & Conditions The school certifies that it will comply with a. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, barring discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin; b. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, barring discrimination on the basis of sex; c. The Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (see Chapter 7 ); d. Sections 501 and 505(b)(2) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, on safeguarding information (see Chapter 7 ); e. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, barring discrimination on the basis of physical handicap (34 CFR Part 104); and f. The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (34 CFR Part 110). The school acknowledges that the Department, states, and accrediting agencies may share information about the school without limitation. The school acknowledges that the school must, prior to any other legal action, submit any dispute involving the final denial, withdrawal, or termination of accreditation to initial arbitration. General Provisions The school will use funds received under any FSA program, as well as any interest and other earnings thereon, solely for the purposes specified for that program . If the school is permitted to request FSA program funds under an advance payment method, the school will time its requests for funds to meet only the school's immediate FSA program needs (see Volume 4, Chapter 2 ). The school will not charge for processing or handling any application, form, or data used to determine a student's FSA eligibility (see Chapter 3 ). The school will establish administrative/fiscal procedures and reports that are necessary for the proper and efficient management of FSA funds, and it will provide timely information on its administrative capability and financial responsibility to the Department and to the appropriate state, guaranty, and accrediting agencies (see Chapter 6 ). The school must acknowledge the authority of the Department and other entities to share information regarding fraud, abuse, or the school's eligibility for participation in the FSA programs (see Chapter 8 ). The school must, in a timely manner, complete reports, surveys, and any other data collection effort of the Department including surveys under the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (see Chapter 6 ). The school cannot penalize in any way a student who is unable to pay school costs due to compliance with the FSA program requirements or due to a delay in an FSA loan disbursement caused by the school. The school must comply with the program integrity requirements established by the Department, state authorizing bodies, and accrediting agencies (see Chapter 8 ). The school is liable for all improperly administered funds received or returned under the FSA programs, including any funds administered by a third-party servicer (see Chapter 3 FSA HB June 20172-17Selected provisions of the PPA, continued If the program offered by the school is preparing students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, the school will a. demonstrate a reasonable relationship [as defined in 34 CFR 668.14(b)(26)(i)] between the length of the program and entry level requirements for the recognized occupation, and b. establish the need for the training for students to obtain employment in the recognized occupation. Certifications Three certifications are included in the PPA: Lobbying; Debarment, Suspension, and other responsibility matters; and Drug-Free Workplace Requirements (see Chapter 6 ). Drug Prevention Certification (see Chapter 6 ). Certification regarding Debarment, Suspension, Eligibility, and Voluntary Exclusion\u2014lower-tier covered transactions. Direct Loans The school will not charge any fees of any kind to student or parent borrowers for loan application, origination activities, or the provision and processing of any information needed to receive a Direct Loan. The note or evidence of obligation of the loan shall be the property of the Secretary. The school accepts responsibility and financial liability stemming from its failure to perform its functions under this Program Participation Agreement. Additional requirements In addition to the requirements listed on the PPA, a school must meet any requirements for participation in the General Provisions (34 CFR Part 668), as well as those specific to an individual FSA program. FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM, 20 USC 1070a et seq; 34 CFR Part 690. FEDERAL DIRECT STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM, 20 USC 1087a et seq; 34 CFR Part 685. FEDERAL PERKINS LOAN PROGRAM, 20 USC 1087aa et seq; 34 CFR Part 674. FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY GRANT PROGRAM, 20 USC 1070b et seq; 34 CFR USC 2751 et seq; 34 CFR Part 675. These requirements are discussed in the Application and Verification Guide and volumes 1-6 of this Federal Student Aid Handbook .Volume 2\u2014School Operations, 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-18CHAPTERC 2 Many of the program eligibility requirements are derived from the institutional definitions that we discussed in Chapter 1 . However, bear in mind that institutional eligibility does not mean that all programs at the school are eligible. A financial aid office should have a process to confirm the eligibility of an educational program before paying any FSA funds to students enrolled in that program and should promptly report changes to the Department following the procedures in Chapter 5 .CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-19 Program Eligibility, Written Arrangements, & Distance EducationDETERMINING PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY A school's eligibility does not necessarily extend to all its programs, so the school is responsible for ensuring that a program is eligible before awarding FSA funds to students in that program. In addition to determining that the program meets the eligible program criteria given in this chapter, the school should make certain that the program is included under the notice of accreditation from a nationally recognized accrediting agency (unless the agency does not require that particular programs be accredited). The school should also make certain that it is authorized by the appropriate state to offer the program (if the state licenses individual programs at postsecondary institutions). In some instances a school or program may need a general authorization as well as licensure for a specific program approval. (See the chart on eligible institutions and the discussion under Legal Authorization By a State in Chapter 1 .) A school's eligibility extends to all eligible programs and locations on its E-App, unless the school participation division (SPD) determines that certain programs or locations did not meet the eligibility requirements or it has not approved the expansion's FSA eligibility. Generally, the school's eligible nondegree programs and locations are specifically named on the Eligibility and Certification Approval Report (ECAR). Additional locations and programs may be added later. Once the SPD has approved the program/location, it will notify the school and an updated ECAR can be printed. See the discussion under Changes to Educational Programs in Chapter 5 for a discussion of when and how a school must notify the Department when adding programs and when the school must wait for approval from the Department. Note that all GE programs must be reported to ED and all direct assessment programs must be reported to and approved by ED.Program eligibility 34 CFR 668.8 34 CFR 691.2(b) School, program, and student eligibility To qualify as an eligible institution, a school must offer at least one eligible program. Not all programs at an eligible institution must be eligible, but at least one of the programs at the school must meet the eligible program requirements. Except for students enrolled in certain preparatory or teacher certification courses, a student must be enrolled in an eligible program to receive FSA funds (see Volume 1, Chapter 1 for more information).Related topics Eligibility requirements for specific educational programs\u2014 Volume 1, Chapter 1 Types of educational programs defined for eligible institutions\u2014 Volume 2, Chapter 1 Updating the E-App to change programs and locations\u2014 Volume 2, Chapter DCL FSA HB June 20172-20If a program offered through distance or continuing education meets the definition of an eligible program, students enrolled in that program must be considered for FSA program assistance on the same basis as students enrolled in eligible programs offered through traditional modes. With some limitations, if a correspondence program meets the definition of an eligible program, students enrolled in that program are considered eligible (see Distance Education & Correspondence Study in this chapter). BASIC TYPES OF ELIGIBLE PROGRAMS There is a wide variety of programs that are eligible for Title IV aid. This section explains some of the most common for each type of institution. Later in the chapter we explain others, such as direct assessment programs and comprehensive transition and postsecondary programs. Eligible programs at an institution of higher education At a public or private nonprofit institution of higher education, the following types of programs are Title IV-eligible: a program that leads to an associate, bachelor's, professional, or graduate degree, a transfer program of at least two academic years in duration that does not award a credential and is acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree, a program of at least one academic year in duration that leads to a certificate or other nondegree recognized credential and prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized oc - cupation, a program consisting of courses required for elementary or sec - ondary teacher certification or recertification in the state where the student plans to teach that is offered in credit or clock hours, or a certificate or diploma training program that is less than one year and prepares students for gainful employment in a recog - nized occupation (if the school also meets the definition of a postsecondary vocational institution). Note that a nondegree program at a public or private nonprofit institution is subject to the rules for a \"gainful employment program.\" (See Gainful Employment Electronic Announcement #53 for a discussion of what constitutes a GE program. )Chapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written Arrangements, & Distance EducationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-21Eligible programs at a proprietary or postsecondary vocational institution There are several types of eligible programs at a proprietary institution or a postsecondary vocational institution. Generally these programs must have a specified number of weeks of instruction and must provide training that prepares a student for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The program provides at least 600 clock hours, 16 semester or trimester hours, or 24 quarter hours of undergraduate instruc - tion offered during a minimum of 15 weeks of instruction. The program may admit as regular students persons who have not completed the equivalent of an associate degree. The program provides at least 300 clock hours, 8 semester hours, or 12 quarter hours of instruction offered during a mini - mum of 10 weeks of instruction. The program must be a gradu - ate or professional program or must admit as regular students only persons who have completed the equivalent of an associate degree. The program is known as a short-term program, which quali - fies for the Direct Loan program only. This type of program must provide at least 300 but less than 600 clock hours of in - struction offered during a minimum of 10 weeks of instruction. The program must admit as regular students some persons who have not completed the equivalent of an associate degree. It must also have been in existence for at least one year, have veri - fied completion and placement rates of at least 70% (see below), and not be more than 50% longer than the minimum training period required by the state or federal agency, if any, for the oc - cupation for which the program of instruction is intended. Lastly, a program that leads to a baccalaureate degree in liberal arts at an accredited proprietary institution is an eligible (non-GE) program. The school must have been continuously accredited by a recognized regional accrediting agency or association since at least October 1, 2007, and have provided the program continuously since January 1, 2009.Definition A program leading to a baccalaureate degree in liberal arts is one that the school's recognized regional accreditation agency determines is a general instructional program in the liberal arts, the humanities, or the general curriculum, falling within one or more of the following categories: 1. A program that is a structured combination of the arts, biological and physical sciences, social sciences, and humanities, emphasizing breadth of study. 2. An undifferentiated program that includes instruction in the general arts or general science. 3. A program that focuses on combined studies and research in the humanities subjects as distinguished from the social and physical sciences, emphasizing languages, literatures, art, music, philosophy, and religion. 4. Any single instructional program in liberal arts and sciences, general studies, and humanities not listed in 1 through 3 above. Instruction must be in a regular program, not an independently designed or individualized program or unstructured studies. 34 CFR 20172-22Number of students who obtained employment* within 180 days of receiving credential and who are employed (or have been employed) for at least 13 weeks following receipt of credential Number of regular students who received credential for successfully completing the program during the award year *in the recognized occupation for which they were trained or in a related comparable occupation The school must document the employment of any student it includes as employed in the placement rate calculation. Examples of such documentation include but are not limited to a written statement from the employer, signed copies of state or federal income tax forms, or written evidence of payment of Social Security taxes. The school must reasonably determine whether a related occupation is comparable. For instance, for a student who was trained as an auto mechanic, it is reasonable to determine that a job as a boat mechanic is comparable. However, for a person trained in retail sales management, a counter-service job at a fast-food restaurant is not comparable.Number of regular students who earned credentials for successfully completing the program within 150% of its length Number of regular students enrolled in the program for the award year, including the number of regular students who withdrew with a 100% refund of tuition and fees and the number of regular students enrolled at the end of the award yearFor the purpose of demonstrating compliance with the standards for short-term (300-600 clock-hour) programs, a school must calculate the completion and placement rates for the award year. The independent auditor who prepares the school's compliance audit report must attest to the accuracy of the school's calculation of completion and placement rates. See 34 CFR 668.8(e), (f), and (g).Completion & placement rates for short-term programs = Completion Rate = Placement Rate PROGRAMS LEADING TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT To be eligible for Title IV funding, an educational program at a postsecondary school must lead to a degree\u2014associate, bachelor's, graduate, or professional degree from a public or non-profit institution\u2014 or prepare students for \"gainful employment in a recognized occupation.\" We refer to the latter as \"gainful employment programs\" or \"GE programs\" for short. They include nondegree programs offered by public and private nonprofit institutions and almost all academic programs offered by proprietary institutions; see below for details. They are subject to the Department's regulations on disclosures (see Chapter 6 ).Chapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written Arrangements, & Distance EducationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-23Programs offered by for-profit institutions All educational programs offered by for-profit (proprietary) institutions are GE programs with the following three exceptions: 1. Preparatory coursework necessary for enrollment in a Title IV- eligible program [34 CFR 668.32(a)(1)(ii)]; 2. Approved Comprehensive Transition and Postsecondary (CTP) programs for students with intellectual disabilities [34 CFR 668.231]; and 3. A limited number of bachelor degree programs in liberal arts if offered by the school since January 2009 and if the school has been regionally accredited since October 2007 [34 CFR 600.5(a) (5)(i)(B)]. Programs offered by public and private nonprofit institutions All non-degree educational programs offered by public or private non-profit institutions are GE programs with the following four exceptions: 1. Preparatory coursework as noted under (1) above; 2. Approved CTP programs as noted under (2) above; 3. Programs that are at least two years long and are designed to be fully transferable to a bachelor's degree program and for which the school does not confer a credential [34 CFR 668.8(b)(1)(ii)]; and 4. Teacher certification programs the institution does not award a credential for [34 CFR 668.32(a)(1)(iii)]. See also the margin note on embedded programs. A student who is concurrently enrolled in a GE and a non-GE program must be included as an enrolled student in the former for purposes of GE reporting and in the calculation of information for disclosures. State requirements and program length The institution must demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the length of the program and entry level requirements for which the program prepares the student. The Secretary considers the relationship to be reasonable if the number of clock hours provided in the program does not exceed by more than 50% the minimum number of clock hours required for training in the recognized occupation for which the program prepares the student, as established by the State in which the program is offered, or as established by any federal agency (if applicable). See 34 CFR 668.14(b)(26).Gainful employment guidance Gainful Employment Electronic Announcement #53 on May 20, 2015, explains GE program identification.Recognized occupation 34 CFR 600.2 All non-degree programs must prepare students in that program for gainful employment in a specific recognized occupation. This requirement also applies to degree programs at proprietary schools. A recognized occupation is one that is: identified by a Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code established by the Office of Management and Budget or an Occupational Information Net - work O*NET-SOC code established by the Department of Labor and available at O*NET OnLine at ( www.onetonline. org) or its successor site, or considered by ED, in consultation with the Department of Labor, to be a recog - nized occupation. If the title of the program does not clearly indicate the specific occupation that the program prepares the student for, that information must appear on the E-App. Embedded programs Some public and private nonprofit institutions offer degree programs in which students may also be awarded a non- degree credential (e.g., certificate, diploma) after completing a portion of the degree program. These are not GE programs as long as a significant number of the students enrolled in the program earn the degree rather than withdraw after obtaining the certificate. If a significant number of students enrolled in the program do not earn the degree, all of the students are considered to be enrolled in a non-degree program, that is, a GE program. State process for complaints Note that under 34 CFR 668.43(b) you must provide state contact information to students or prospective students for filing complaints in each state in which you operate. (See Chapter 6 for the school consumer information requirement.)Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-24Certification requirements for GE programs When providing updated GE Program information to the Department, institutions must provide a new GE Certification to cover the updated list of GE Programs. Updates that require a new certification include establishing or re-establishing the eligibility of a program, or changing the name, CIP code, or credential level of a currently-approved GE Program. The institution certifies that - Each eligible GE program included on the attached ECAR or E-App is approved by a recognized accrediting agency or is otherwise included in the institution's accreditation by its recognized accrediting agency, or, if the institution is a public postsecondary vocational institution, the program is approved by a recognized State agency for the approval of public postsec - ondary vocational education in lieu of accreditation; Each eligible GE program included on the attached ECAR or E-App is programmatically accredited, if such accreditation is required by a Federal governmental entity or by a governmen - tal entity in the State in which the institution is located or in which the institution is otherwise required to obtain State ap - proval under 34 CFR 600.9; For the State in which the institution is located or in which the institution is otherwise required to obtain State approval under 34 CFR 600.9, each eligible GE program included on the attached ECAR or E-App satisfies the applicable educational prerequisites for professional licensure or certification require - ments in that State so that a student who completes the pro - gram and seeks employment in the State qualifies to take any licensure or certification exam that is needed for the student to practice or find employment in an occupation that the program prepares students to enter; and For a gainful employment program for which the institution is establishing initial eligibility for Title IV , HEA program funds, the program is not substantially similar to a program offered by the institution that in the prior three years, became ineligible for Title IV , HEA program funds under the debt-to-earnings rates measure or was failing, or in the zone with respect to, the debt-to-earnings rates measure and was voluntarily discontin - ued by the institution. A school may not include in its list of eligible GE programs a failing or zone GE program that it voluntarily discontinued, a program that became ineligible due to D/E rates, or a program that is substantially similar to a discontinued or ineligible program until three years have passed.GE programs at foreign colleges The only programs at foreign proprietary institutions that are eligible for FSA loan funds are degree programs in medicine, nursing, and veterinary science. All Title IV- eligible programs at these institutions are GE programs. The determination if a program is a GE program at a foreign public or nonprofit institution is the same as for domestic public and nonprofit institutions.Fulfilling GE Certification Requirements when Updating the E-App Gainful Employment Electronic Announcement #77ClarificationChapter 2\u2014Program EducationCFR Glossary DCL HB June 20172-25ADDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS There are additional FSA program eligibility requirements for specific educational programs. For example, only undergraduate educational programs are eligible under the Pell Grant and FSEOG programs. Correspondence programs are not eligible unless they meet the general requirements for an eligible program and are required for the student's regular program of study leading to a degree. Educational programs eligible for TEACH Grants To qualify for TEACH Grants, an educational program must be designed to prepare an individual to teach as a highly quali - fied teacher in a high-need field and lead to a baccalaureate or master's degree (including 2-year programs of study that are ac - ceptable for full credit toward a baccalaureate degree), or a postbaccalaureate program of study for students who have completed a baccalaureate degree but need to take additional state-required courses for teacher certification or licensure. A postbaccalaureate program consists of courses required by a state for a student to receive a professional certification or licensing credential that is needed for employment as a teacher in an elementary or secondary school in that state. It must be a program that is treated as an undergraduate program for FSA purposes and may not lead to a graduate degree. Note that the program cannot be considered a postbaccalaureate program if the school offers a baccalaureate degree in education. For TEACH grant student eligibility requirements, see Volume 1 , Chapter 6 . Volume 2\u2014School DCL FSA HB June 20172-26Programs for students with intellectual disabilities A student with an intellectual disability who enrolls in a comprehensive transition and postsecondary (CTP) program at a school that participates in the FSA programs is eligible for non-loan assistance (Pell Grants, FSEOG, and Federal Work-Study). As discussed in Volume 1, the student is exempt from some student eligibility requirements. A CTP program is a degree, certificate, non-degree, or non-certificate program that is designed to support students with intellectual disabilities who want to continue their instruction (academic, career and technical, and independent living) at a postsecondary school to prepare for gainful employment. Schools must apply to the Department to have such a program judged eligible. The program must be delivered to students physically attending the institution, include an advising and curriculum structure, and provide students with intellectual disabilities opportunities to participate in coursework and other activities with students without disabilities. Such programs must require that at least half of the students' participation in the program, as determined by the school, focuses on academic components through one or more of the following activities: taking credit-bearing courses with students without disabilities, auditing, or otherwise participating in, courses the student does not receive regular academic credit for with students without disabilities, taking non-credit-bearing, nondegree courses with students without disabilities, and participating in internships or work-based training in settings with individuals without disabilities.Applying for eligibility for a CTP program When applying to the Department for eligibility for a CTP program, a school must follow the procedures in 34 CFR 600.20 and provide the information described in 34 CFR 668.232. See the electronic announcement dated 6/21/10 on the IFAP website. Definition of intellectual disability A student with an intellectual disability means a student 1) with mental retardation or a cognitive impairment characterized by significant limitations in\u2014 (i) Intellectual and cognitive functioning; and (ii) Adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual, social, and practical adaptive skills; and (2) Who is currently, or was formerly, eligible for special education and related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (20 U.S.C. 1401), including a student who was determined eligible for special education or related services under the IDEA but was homeschooled or attended private school.Chapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written EducationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-27ESL programs Students enrolled in a program that consists solely of English as a second language (ESL) instruction are only eligible for Pell Grants. An ESL program must meet the general requirements for eligible programs (e.g., it must lead to a degree or other credential), and a school must request an eligibility determination for it from the Department. The program may admit only students who need instruction in English to be able to use the knowledge, training, or skills they already have. The school must document its determination that the ESL instruction is necessary for each student enrolled. Schools should pay attention to the effect that awarding Pell Grants for more than one academic year of attendance in an ESL program has on a student's Pell LEU (See Volume 3 ). See Chapter 3 for a discussion of the requirement that schools define the effect of non-credit remedial courses (including ESL on a student's academic progress. Competency-based education programs Competency-based education (CBE) is an innovative approach in higher education that organizes academic content according to competencies\u2014what a student knows and can do\u2014rather than follow a more traditional scheme, such as by course. As with all Title IV-eligible programs (except correspondence programs), CBE programs must be designed to ensure that there is regular and substantive interaction between students and instructors. Interaction that is wholly optional, initiated primarily by the student, or occurring only upon the request of the student is not sufficient. Some schools use a CBE model where instructors perform different roles and no single faculty member is responsible for all aspects of a course or competency. Such a model may be used, but schools must ensure that regular and substantive interaction between students and instructors occurs, that instructors meet accrediting agency standards for instruction in their subject, and that the faculty resources dedicated to the program are sufficient for the accrediting agency. Interactions between students and personnel who don't meet accrediting agency standards for providing instruction in the subject area would not be considered substantive interaction with an instructor.TIPVolume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-28FSA funds may be awarded only for learning that results from instruction provided or overseen by the school. FSA funds cannot be awarded for any portion of the program based on study or life experience prior to enrollment in the program or based on tests of learning that are not associated with educational activities overseen by the school. A school must ensure that the instructional materials and faculty support necessary for academic engagement are available to students every week that the school counts toward its defined payment period or academic year. Educational activity in a CBE program includes but is not limited to: participating in regularly scheduled learning sessions (where there is an opportunity for direct interaction between the stu - dent and the faculty member); submitting an academic assignment; taking an exam, an interactive tutorial, or computer-assisted instruction; attending a study group that is assigned by the institution; participating in an online discussion about academic matters; consultations with a faculty mentor to discuss academic course content; and participation in faculty-guided independent study (as defined in 34 CFR 668.10(a)(3)(iii)). For direct assessment programs only, educational activity also includes development, in consultation with a qualified faculty member, of an academic action plan that addresses competencies identified by the school. As with other types of eligible programs, CBE programs may be offered as nonterm or as standard or nonstandard term programs. Such programs may also last less than a year if all applicable requirements are met. See DCL GEN-14-23 for more information, including guidance about CBE programs and cost of attendance, satisfactory academic progress, return of Title IV funds, and direct assessment programs.Chapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written Arrangements, & HB June 20172-29Types are two types of CBE programs: those that measure progress using clock or credit hours and direct assessment programs. Credit- or clock-hour CBE programs are organized by competency but measure student progress using clock or credit hours. In such programs, Title IV aid must be administered under normal statutory and regulatory provisions for credit- or clock-hour programs. An institution offering a CBE program using credit hours must ensure that for Title IV purposes each credit hour in the program requires sufficient educational activity to fulfill the federal definition of a credit hour (see page 31) and must reasonably approximate not less than one hour of classroom instruction and two hours of out-of-class work each week. A credit hour in a CBE program might not require structured class sessions but must still require sufficient academic activity\u2014for instance, reading and writing assignments with feedback from an instructor\u2014to reasonably approximate three hours of expected academic engagement per week for each credit hour. The CBE program could allow this work to be completed more flexibly and at the student's pace as long as he is making satisfactory academic progress. Direct assessment programs are a type of CBE program that does not use credit or clock hours. Progress in a direct assessment program is measured solely by assessing whether students can demonstrate that they have a command of a specific subject, content area, or skill or can demonstrate a specific quality associated with the subject matter of the program. Therefore, unlike a CBE program measured in credit hours, a direct assessment program does not specify the level of educational activity in which a student is expected to engage in order to complete the program. Because direct assessment programs do not use credit or clock hours, schools must establish credit- or clock-hour equivalencies for the programs and provide a factual basis for that to the Department as part of the application process for direct assessment programs. The equivalencies must be approved by a school's accrediting agency, and the school must document that approval. See GEN-14-23 for more about equivalencies. The entire program must be provided by direct assessment\u2014one offered partly with credit or clock hours is not Title IV-eligible\u2014and the assessment must be consistent with the accreditation of the institution or program. A direct assessment program may use learning resources (e.g., courses or portions of courses) that are provided by entities other than the school providing the direct assessment program without regard to the limitations on contracting for part of an educational program (see Written Arrangements Between Schools later in this chapter).Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary 20172-30Several types of programs and coursework that might otherwise be eligible for FSA purposes are not eligible if they involve direct assessment: Programs at foreign schools. Preparatory coursework required for entry into an eligible pro - gram ( see Volume 1, Chapter 6 ). Courses necessary for an elementary or secondary school teaching credential or certificate ( see Volume 1, Chapter 6 ). Remedial coursework measured through direct assessment. However, note that remedial instruction offered in credit or clock hours in conjunction with a direct assessment program is eligible for FSA funds. A school that wishes to award FSA funds for a program using direct assessment must submit an updated E-App (at www.eligcert. ed.gov ) to the Department to apply for approval of the program. In addition to updating the E-App, the school will email to the case teams (at CaseTeams@ed.gov) supporting documentation: a detailed program description (recommended length not to exceed 20 pages), a detailed description of financial aid administration (not to exceed 5 pages), and documentation that the school's accrediting agency has evaluated and approved the program and agrees with the school's credit- or clock-hour equivalency. See DCL GEN-13-10 for complete instructions. The detailed program description will be a succinct narrative clearly indicating the name of the program and how it meets the regulatory requirements of 34 CFR 668.10(b). Each requirement must be specifically identified in the narrative; for example, there must be a description of how the assessment of learning is done [668.10(b)(2)]. The detailed description of financial aid administration for the program explains how the program meets the Title IV requirements. For example, the school must provide a basis for its credit- or clock-hour equivalent for the program or portion thereof (the clock or credit hours will be used as the basis for the FSA award calculations described in Volume 3 , Chapter 1 ). If a school plans to change any aspect of the program, it must obtain prior approval from the Department by reapplying.Direct assessment programs 34 CFR 668.10 For more information, including step-by- step instructions on how to apply for Title IV approval of a direct assessment program, see DCL GEN-13-10. Direct assessment definitions An academic year in a direct assessment program consists of a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time, during which a full-time student is expected to complete the equivalent of at least 24 semester or trimester credit hours or 36 quarter credit hours for an undergraduate program. A week of instructional time is any seven- day period in which at least one day of educational activity occurs. Educational activity includes assessments, regularly scheduled learning sessions, faculty-guided independent study, consultations with a faculty mentor, and development of an academic action plan addressed to the competencies identified by the school. Independent study occurs when a student follows a course of study and works with a faculty member to decide how the student will meet defined course objectives. Both agree on what the student will do (e.g., readings, research, and work products), how the student's work will be evaluated, and the time frame for completion. The student must interact with the faculty member on a regular and substantive basis to assure progress within the course or program. A full-time student is one carrying a full- time academic workload, as determined by the school, that is the standard for all students in the program. For undergraduate students, the school's standard must equal or exceed the minimum requirements in the definition of full-time student in 34 CFR 668.2, based on the credit- or clock-hour equivalency for the program.Chapter 2\u2014Program EducationCFR June 20172-31Apprenticeships instruction with on-the- job experience. Postsecondary schools may provide related classroom instruction, technical training, or other certified training. If all or part of an apprenticeship meets an academic requirement of a Title IV-eligible educational program, students enrolled in that program may receive Title IV aid for the entire program, including for the apprenticeship portion. Since student aid is partly determined by the number of credit or clock hours in the program, the structured on-the-job portion must be associated with a defined number of credit or clock hours. For clock-hour educational programs, students' completion of the clock hours associated with the on-the-job training must be under the supervision of school faculty. Except as may be required by the accrediting agency or state, there is no limit on the percentage of the program that consists of on-the-job training as long as the school provides the training. Note that schools must report to the Department any location at which 50% or more of an educational program is provided, including any on-the-job component. If an entity other than the school provides the on-the-job training, that component must be 25% of the program or less or, with specific permission of the institution's accrediting agency, over 25% but less than 50% of the program. In such contracted situations, the school must enter into a written arrangement with the entity providing the on-the-job training. If the program is offered in credit hours, the written arrangement should establish the equivalent credit hours for the non-coursework portion of the program. A school's policies for establishing credit hours must meet all requirements and standards set by its accrediting agency. See the discussion under Written Arrangements Between Schools later in this chapter for additional information.Apprenticeships For more information see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-14-22 and Volume 6 , Chapter 2 , of FSA 20172-32Study-abroad programs A participating institution may establish study-abroad programs for which students are eligible to receive FSA funds. The study-abroad program does not have to be a required part of the eligible program at the home school for the student to be eligible to receive FSA funds, but the credits earned through the study-abroad or exchange program must apply toward graduation in the student's program at the home school. In addition, students in the study-abroad program must remain concurrently enrolled at their home school. Moreover, the school must mention the availability of FSA funds in the information it provides to students about the study-abroad program. Types of study-abroad programs Study-abroad program configurations include the following: A home school sends students to a study-abroad program at an eligible or ineligible foreign host school. The home school must have a contractual agreement with the foreign school. A written arrangement between a domestic institution and one in another country is always considered a contractual agreement in which the domestic institution is the home school. A home school has, instead of a separate agreement with each foreign school, a written arrangement with a study-abroad organization that represents one or more foreign schools. The arrangement must adequately describe the duties and responsi - bilities of each entity and meet the requirements of the regula - tions. A variant of the study-abroad program occurs when a home school sends faculty and students to a foreign site. This is not a consortium or contractual study-abroad program; rather, the foreign site is considered an additional location under 34 CFR 600.32. A study-abroad program must be part of a written contractual agreement between two or more schools. If a study-abroad program has higher costs than the home school, those should be reflected in the student's cost of attendance. This may result in the student being eligible for additional FSA funds. Some eligible students have had problems receiving FSA funds for study-abroad programs because neither their home school nor the school they were temporarily attending documented that they were enrolled in an eligible program of study. The Program Participation Agreement requires participating schools to establish procedures that ensure that students participating in study-abroad programs receive the FSA funds to which they are entitled.Study abroad references Arrangements with a study-abroad organization 34 CFR 668.5 Student eligibility in study-abroad CFR Maximum Awards 34 CFR 676.20 The maximum FSEOG for a full academic year is usually $4,000. However, a school may award as much as $4,400 to a student participating in a study-abroad program that is approved for credit by the home school. Written arrangements between domestic and foreign schools An eligible U.S. school may have a written arrangement with a foreign school or organization that is acting on behalf of a foreign school, but such an arrangement is always considered to be one between an eligible domestic school where the student enrolls and an ineligible foreign school, even if the latter is otherwise Title IV-eligible. Therefore, these arrangements are considered contractual agreements that must follow the rules that apply to such. See DCL GEN-11-18 for more information about Title IV eligibility of programs offered through written arrangements between U.S. and foreign schools.Chapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written Arrangements, & Distance EducationCFR June 20172-33Flight school program 34 CFR 668.8(i)Flight school programs A flight school program must maintain current valid certification by the Federal Aviation Administration to be eligible. WRITTEN ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN SCHOOLS Under a consortium or contractual agreement (including those for study-abroad programs), the home school must give credit for courses taken at the other schools on the same basis as if it provided the training itself. The underlying assumption of such an agreement is that the home school has found the other school's or organization's academic standards equivalent to its own and the instruction an acceptable substitute for its own. A home school may decline to give credit for courses in which a student earns a grade that is not acceptable at the home school even though the host school has a policy of accepting that grade for its resident students. Also, although grades received through consortium or contractual agreements do not have to be included in a student's grade point average, they must be included when calculating the quantitative component (the percentage of credits earned vs. attempted) of her satisfactory academic progress. If not written for an individual student or group of students, agreements between schools can go on indefinitely. These agreements do not have to be renewed unless the terms of the agreement change. A school must provide enrolled and prospective students with a description of the written arrangements it has entered into, including the portion of the educational program that the school that grants the degree or certificate is not providing, the name and location of the other schools or organizations that are providing that portion of the educational program, the method of delivery of that part of the educational program, and estimated additional costs students may incur by enrolling in an educational program provided under the written arrangement.Definitions Consortium agreement \u2014a written agreement between two or more eligible schools. Contractual agreement \u2014a written agreement between an eligible school and an ineligible school. Home school \u2014the school where the student is enrolled in a degree or certificate program. Host school \u2014the school where the student is taking part of his or her program requirements through either a consortium or contractual agreement. Two plus two program \u2014a partnership between a two-year and a four-year school that facilitates a student's completing the last two years of the student's four-year degree.Written arrangements June 20172-34Consortium agreement A consortium agreement can apply to all FSA programs. Under a consortium agreement, students may take courses at a school other than the home school and have those courses count toward the degree or certificate at the home school. A student can only receive FSA assistance for courses that are applicable to the student's certificate or degree program. A consortium agreement can be a blanket agreement between two or more eligible schools, or it can be written for a specific student. Such an agreement is often used when a student takes related courses at neighboring schools or when a student is enrolled in an exchange program with another eligible school for a term or more. A school could have one agreement for each student, a separate agreement with each host school, or a blanket agreement with a group of schools. In a consortium agreement there is no limit on the portion of the eligible program that may be provided by eligible schools other than the home school. Agreement contents can vary widely and will depend upon the interests of the schools involved and the accrediting or state agency standards. (See sidebar for required contents of an agreement.) Usually the home school is responsible for disbursing funds, but if the student is enrolled for a full term or academic year at the host school, it may be easier for the host school to monitor his eligibility and make payments. When there is a written arrangement between eligible schools, any of the schools participating in the written arrangement may make FSA calculations and disbursements without that school being considered a third-party servicer. This is true even if the student is not currently taking courses at the school that is calculating and disbursing the aid. The school that disburses an FSA award is responsible for maintaining information on the student's eligibility, how the award was calculated, what money has been disbursed, and any other documentation associated with the award, even if some of that documentation comes from other schools. Moreover, the school paying the student must return FSA funds if required, for example, in refund/return or overpayment situations. For determining enrollment status under a consortium agreement, see Volume 3 , Chapter 3 .Requirement to inform students of an arrangement 34 CFR 668.43(a)(12) Contents of a consortium agreement The Department does not dictate the format of the agreement (which can be executed by several different offices) or where the agreement is kept. However, the following information should be included in all agreements: the school that will grant the degree or certificate; the student's tuition, fees, and room and board costs at each school; the student's enrollment status at each school; the school that will be responsible for disbursing aid and monitoring student eligibility; and the procedures for calculating awards, disbursing aid, monitoring satisfactory progress and other student eligibility requirements, keeping records, and re - turning funds when the student withdraws.Chapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written Arrangements, & Distance EducationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-35Contractual agreement If the limitations in the following paragraphs are adhered to, an eligible school may enter into a contractual agreement with an ineligible school or organization that provides part of the educational program of students enrolled at the eligible school. Such a contract is prohibited with an ineligible school or organization whose eligibility or certification to participate in the FSA programs has been terminated or revoked by the Department or application for certification or recertification to participate in the FSA programs was denied by the Department. Similarly, an eligible school is prohibited from entering into a contract with an ineligible school or organization that has voluntarily withdrawn from participation in the FSA programs under a termination, show-cause, suspension, or similar type of proceeding initiated by the Department or the school's state licensing agency, accrediting agency, or guarantor. Under a contractual agreement, the eligible school is always the home school. It performs all the aid processing and disbursement for students attending the ineligible school and is responsible for maintaining all records necessary to document student eligibility and receipt of aid (see Chapter 7 ). With a contractual agreement, the ineligible school can in general provide no more than 25% of the educational program. However, it may provide more than 25% but less than 50% of the program as long as (1) the home and ineligible schools are not owned or controlled by the same individual, partnership, or corporation; and (2) the home school's accrediting agency or state agency (in the case of a public postsecondary vocational institution) determines and confirms in writing that the agreement meets its standards for contracting out education services. Schools sometimes contract with providers of software platforms designed to support distance education programs. When such a contractor provides only the software or platform for coursework and instruction in the program is still performed by the school's own faculty under the school's supervision, such an arrangement is not considered a written arrangement under 34 CFR 668.5. However, if the contractor's staff provides instruction as part of its provision of software or other services, the school must have a contractual agreement in place that establishes the proportion of the program provided by the contractor and ensures it does not exceed the legal limitsInternships and externships Internships and externships that are part of a program and are provided by organizations other than the institution are subject to the written arrangement requirements. However, an internship or externship portion of a program does not have to meet the written arrangement requirements if the internship or externship is governed by explicit accrediting agency standards that require the oversight and supervision of the institution, where the institution is responsible for the internship or externship and students are monitored by qualified institutional personnel.Written arrangements between schools under same ownership or control If the written arrangement is between two or more eligible institutions that are owned or controlled by the same individual, partnership, or corporation, the Department considers the educational program to be an eligible program if the educational program offered by the school that grants the degree or cer - tificate otherwise satisfies the require - ments of an eligible program (described in this chapter), and the school that grants the degree or cer - tificate provides more than 50% of the educational program. NEWVolume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-36DISTANCE EDUCATION AND CORRESPONDENCE STUDY Schools use distance education and correspondence courses to respond to students' needs for alternatives to the schedules and locations at which courses traditionally have been offered. A school may not refuse to provide FSA funds to a student because she is enrolled in correspondence or distance education courses unless the courses are not part of an eligible program. Some participating institutions contract with distance education providers that are not eligible to participate in the FSA programs. These participating institutions must ensure that they do not exceed the limitations on contractual arrangements (see previous section). Distance Education A distance education program at a domestic school is considered an eligible FSA program if it has been accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department for accreditation of distance education. It is not subject to the rules that apply to correspondence coursework, which are discussed in the next section. Distance education means education that uses certain technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor and to support regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor . The interaction may be synchronous (student and instructor are in communication at the same time) or asynchronous. The technologies may include the Internet; audio conferencing; or one-way and two-way transmissions through open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, broadband lines, fiber optics, satellite, or wireless communications devices. A course taught through video cassettes or discs is also considered a distance education course but only if one of the three technologies listed is used to support interaction between the students and the instructor.Accreditation for distance education Distance education programs must be evaluated by an accrediting agency that is recognized by ED for the purpose of evaluating distance education, just as an agency must be specifically reviewed and recognized for the evaluation of correspondence education. Dear Colleague Letter GEN-06-17 includes specific instructions on notifying ED if the school intends to seek new accreditation and updating the E-App to reflect changes to the school's accreditation.Chapter 2\u2014Program FSA HB June 20172-37Correspondence courses Unlike distance education courses, which are treated the same as all other eligible programs, some restrictions apply to correspondence courses. A correspondence program at a domestic school is considered an eligible FSA program if it has been accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department for accreditation of correspondence education. A correspondence course is a home-study course for which the school provides instructional materials, including examinations on the materials, to students who are not physically attending classes at the school. Interaction between the instructor and student is limited, not regular and substantive, and primarily initiated by the student. Correspondence courses are typically self-paced. When a student completes a portion of the instructional materials, the student takes the examinations that relate to that portion of the materials and returns the examinations to the school for grading. If a course is part correspondence and part residential training, the course is considered to be a correspondence course. If a school adds distance education technology, such as electronic delivery of course materials or an online discussion board, to a correspondence course, the school must ascertain the predominant method of instruction (correspondence or distance education), keeping in mind that a distance education course must use technology to support regular and substantive interaction between the students and instructor. The school must use the rules for the predominant method in administering the FSA programs. If a school offers more than 50% of its courses by correspondence or if 50% or more of its students are enrolled in its correspondence courses, the school loses its eligibility to participate in the FSA programs (see Chapter 1 ). Note that correspondence students enrolled in certificate programs are not eligible for FSA funds. For a full discussion of when a school may pay a student for correspondence study, see Volume 1, Chapter 1. Also see Volume 3, Chapter 2 for limitations on the cost of attendance for correspondence students and Volume 3, Chapter 1 for the timing of disbursements to correspondence students.Correspondence courses & institutional eligibility 34 CFR education\" HEA Sec. 102(a)(3)(A) and (B) A combined correspondence and residential program example A school offers a truck driving program, the first part of which is offered via correspondence. After completing that part of the program, the student has to attend a residential site where he learns how to drive trucks. This is a correspondence program.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB of clock hour and credit hour 34 CFR 600.2CLOCK-HOUR/CREDIT-HOUR CONVERSIONS The credit hour definition and the credit/clock hour conversion rules serve two purposes: to determine program eligibility and to determine the award amount for certain FSA programs. In this section, we discuss the first of these topics\u2014the use of the credit- and clock-hour rules in determining if a program meets the minimum program length requirements discussed earlier in the chapter. Definition of a clock hour A clock hour is defined as a period of time consisting of 1. a 50- to 60-minute class, lecture, or recitation in a 60-minute period; 2. a 50- to 60-minute faculty-supervised laboratory, shop training, or internship in a 60-minute period; or 3. sixty minutes of preparation in a correspondence course. Definition of a credit hour A credit hour is an amount of work that reasonably approximates not less than 1. one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class work each week for approximately 15 weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or 10 to 12 weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or at least the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or 2. at least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. The regulations make an exception to this definition in the case of programs that are subject to one of the clock-hour/credit-hour conversion formulas, as described in the following text.Clock-credit hour conversions 34 CFR 668.8(k) & (l) See the Program Integrity Q&As at (www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/ hearulemaking/2009/credit.html#credit ). Measuring attendance in clock hours A student's period of attendance is measured according to one of several commonly accepted academic standards. A clock hour is based on an actual hour of attendance (though each hour may include a 10-minute break). Credit hours are typically based on two hours of homework for each hour of class attendance. A school is not permitted to count more than one clock hour per 60-minute period; in other words, a school may not schedule several hours of instruction without breaks and then count clock hours in 50-minute increments. For instance, a school could not consider seven consecutive hours of instruction to be 8.4 hours by dividing 50 minutes into 420 minutes. Seven 60-minute periods of instruction may not count for more than seven clock hours.Chapter 2\u2014Program Eligibility, Written Arrangements, & Distance EducationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-39Clock-credit hour conversions in determining program eligibility If your school offers an undergraduate educational program in credit hours that is considered a GE program, it must use one of the following conversion formulas unless the program is at least two academic years in length and provides an associate degree, a bachelor's degree, a professional degree, or an equivalent degree as determined by the Department; or each course within the program is acceptable for full credit toward a single associate degree, bachelor's degree, or professional degree provided by that institution, or equivalent degree as determined by the Department, provided that 1) the school's degree requires at least two academic years of study; and 2) the school demonstrates that students enroll in, and graduate from, the degree program. The formula will determine if after the conversion the program includes the minimum number of credit hours to qualify as an eligible program for FSA purposes. For determining the number of credit hours in that educational program a semester hour must include at least 37.5 clock hours of instruction, a trimester hour must include at least 37.5 clock hours of instruction, and a quarter hour must include at least 25 clock hours of instruction. To determine if the program meets the FSA standard for the minimum number of credit hours for that type of program, schools must use one of the following formulas. For a semester- or trimester-hour program Number of clock hours in the credit-hour program 37.5 For a quarter-hour program Number of clock hours in the credit-hour program 25Rounding Because the results of these formulas determine the eligibility of a program, the resulting number of credit hours may not be rounded up. The results for each course may include the result with fractions or must be rounded down.Exemption if ED determines that the program offers \"equivalent degree\" The regulations also stipulate that the school is exempted from using the clock- hour/credit-hour formulas if the Department determines that the program provides a degree equivalent to an associate degree, a bachelor's degree, or a professional degree. This does not permit a school to ask for a determination that a nondegree program is equivalent to a degree program. Exception example Although for a program to be eligible for the clock-credit hour conversion exception all of the classes must be acceptable for full credit toward a degree program at the school, only a majority need to actually be accepted into the program. For example, a school has a two-year program in plumbing and a bachelor's degree program in construction technology. Any of the five plumbing courses taken by a student in the two-year plumbing program may be used to satisfy the plumbing requirement in construction technology. However, that requirement is only for three plumbing courses, and no more than that can be accepted toward the construction technology degree. But since all of the plumbing courses that are part of the two-year program are acceptable in the bachelor's program and a majority (three out of five or 60%) will be accepted, the plumbing program qualifies for the exception.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-40If a school applies the appropriate formula and finds that a program is eligible, the converted credit hours are used to determine the amount of FSA funds that a student who is enrolled in the program is eligible to receive as explained in Volume 3, Chapter 1 . For more information on how to perform the clock-hour/credit-hour conversion, see the Conversion Case Study at the end of this chapter. Credits approved by state and accrediting agencies When some states and accrediting agencies approve programs, they also approve the number of credits in the programs. The credits approved by states and accrediting agencies are not necessarily the credits for FSA purposes. For FSA purposes, the number of credits in the program will be those determined by the conversion formula, but they will never be more than those approved by a state or accrediting agency.State/accrediting agency criteria for clock/credit hours The regulations for state and accreditation agencies explain how an agency reviews a school's assignment of credit hours. 34 CFR 602.24 and 603.24Chapter June 20172-41Out-of-class student work The school's minimum number of clock hours of instruction per credit may be less if its designated accrediting agency or recognized state agency for the approval of public postsecondary vocational institutions for participation in the FSA programs has not identified any deficiencies with the school's policies and procedures for determining the credit hours that the school awards for programs and courses. In such cases student work outside of class combined with the clock hours of instruction must meet or exceed the numeric requirements (37.5 or 25), and a semester hour must include at least 30 clock hours of instruc - tion, a trimester hour must include at least 30 clock hours of instruc - tion, and a quarter hour must include at least 20 hours of instruction. Merely having coursework that is outside of class does not mean a school can automatically divide by 30 or 20. The minimum may be higher than 20 or 30 depending on the amount of out-of-class work that is expected in the different educational activities of a program and may vary depending on the particular activity. The case study that follows illustrates a method for accurately accounting for any out-of-class work a student may have in a course. Also, the amount of out-of-class work in a particular course or activity in a program does not carry over to other courses or activities.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-42Conversion Case Study (clock hours to semester hours) A program with 720 clock hours consists of 5 classroom courses with 120 clock hours each, and A 120 clock-hour externship with no out-of-class student work. The school determines that for The first 3 classroom courses, a student generally is required to perform 40 hours of out-of-class work for each course, and The last 2 classroom courses have 8 hours of out-of-class work for each course. The school has two options 1. Default option \u2014convert only based on clock hours and ignore any out-of-class work 2. Full formula option \u2014take into account both clock hours and out-of-class work to determine the maximum allowable credit hours Then, there are four possible outcomes depending on the school's policy for option and rounding (always round down course-by-course): Default options\u201419.2 or 18 semester hours Full formula options\u20142.026 or 21 semester hours Default Option In applying the default option the school wold use the default 37.5 clock hours per semester hour, and ignore the out-of-class work (conversion must be course-by-course). 120 / 37.5 = 3.2 semester hours per course (or 3, if rounding; always round down course-by-course) Converted program = 3.2 * 6 = 19.2 semester hours (or 3 * 6 = 18 semester hours, if rounding) Full formula option Must evaluate on individual coursework components of a program Total clock hours and out-of-class student work is irrelevant Must meet limitation for the minimum number of clock hours per credit hour in addition to out- of-class work Excess out-of-class student work per credit hour does not carry over between courses or educational activities in a program Use exact calculation, including any fractions of credit hours, or round down any fraction, including one equal to or greater than half Rounding on individual course or educational activity, not on the total Full formula option CHAPTERC 3CFR Glossary DCL FSA Administrative & June 20172-45 This chapter describes aid-related requirements a school must meet to participate in the Federal Student Aid programs. Many of these requirements require coordination with other school offices. For instance, the requirements for adequate staffing, the incentive compensation prohibition, and hiring restrictions related to the misuse of government funds might apply to your school's human resources office. Similarly, your school's academic divisions and its business office will need to be aware of the standards for satisfactory progress policies, readmission of service members, and in-state tuition rates for service members and their families.ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE Consistency of information and conflicting information A school must have a system of identifying and resolving discrepan - cies in all FSA-related information received by any school office. A school must resolve discrepancies for all students, not just those selected for veri - fication. Resolution includes determining what information is correct and documenting the school's findings in the student's file. Such a system must include a review of : All student aid applications, need analysis documents, multiple reporting records, potential overawards from COD, statements of educational purpose, statements of registration status, and eligibility notification documents presented by or on behalf of each applicant. The Student Aid Report/ISIR for a student. Even if a school has already verified the information on a student's SAR/ISIR, it must review all information on subsequent SARs/ISIRs. Any documents, including copies of federal tax return and tax account transcripts, that are normally collected by the school to verify information received from the student or other sources. Any other information submitted or normally available to the school regarding a student's citizenship, previous educational experience, or Social Security number or other factors relating to the student's eligibility for FSA funds. For instance, if a student receives an academic scholarship through one school office, that office must notify the aid administrator of these benefits to ensure that the amounts are correctly reported on the student's aid application and are counted as estimated financial assistance for the Campus-based and Direct Loan programs.Related information Financial Standards, Chapter 4 Consumer Information, Campus Safety, Reports, & Other Requirements, Chapter 6 Records, Electronic Processes, Chapter 7 Administrative capability To participate in the FSA programs, a school must demonstrate that it is administratively capable of providing the education it promises and of properly managing the FSA programs. 34 CFR 668.16 FSA Assessments To assess your school's compliance with these requirements, see the FSA Assessment modules on \"Automation\" and \"Satisfactory Academic school's admissions or registrar's office must provide the aid office with any information it has that might affect a student's eligibility, such as the student's enrollment in an ineligible pro - gram or in summer classes immediately preceding a fall term of enrollment. A school's business office must inform the aid office whenever it receives information about a student receiving an outside scholarship. There is a distinction between how long you need to be alert for con - flicting information and how long you have to actually resolve a conflict. Even if the processing year has ended, you must continue to resolve con - flicting information unless all aid for the period of enrollment has been disbursed, at the time of disbursement there was no conflicting informa - tion, and the student is no longer enrolled at the school (and is not in - tending to reenroll). You may not ignore a document in your files unless a student is no longer enrolled. If you have conflicting information in your files, you must resolve it as expeditiously as possible. If you become aware of con - flicting information for a student who is no longer enrolled and there is aid to be disbursed, you must resolve the conflict before making the late or post-withdrawal disbursement. If aid that the school was unaware of is received after the end of a period of enrollment for a student who is intending to re-enroll, that aid must be treated as estimated financial assistance for either the period of enrollment just completed or for the subsequent period of enrollment. See the discussion of estimated financial assistance and packaging in Volume 3. Remember, if any office at your school has information that might affect a student's eligibility for FSA funds, it must provide that informa - tion to the school's designated coordinating official (described later). That person must forward it to the financial aid office, where procedures must be in place to ensure that any conflicting information is resolved and doc - umented before the student receives any (or any additional) FSA funds.Death of a student If a student dies during the award year, the school isn't required to resolve conflicting information. OIG referrals 34 CFR 668.16(g)Students who turn out to be ineligible Sometimes resolving conflicting information will reveal that a previously eligible student who received Title IV aid was actually ineligible, for example, a student who indicated on his FAFSA that he had a high school diploma when he really did not. In such cases the student must return* all the Title IV aid he received (except earned FWS wages) while ineligible, even if it was in a previous award year. Also, you are required to update COD data to reflect the adjustments. If you suspect that the student intended to deceive rather than made a mistake, see \"OIG referrals\" on this page. * While the student is generally responsible for repaying aid in such cases, there might be situations where the school is responsible. See DHC-Q4 at ( www2.ed.gov/ information between 2016-2017 2017-2018 For the transition to the use of prior-prior year information on the FAFSA, income and tax data from 2015 will be used for the above consecutive award years and may create cases of conflicting information. To reduce burden on schools, the following measures will be in place. FAFSA on the Web will have warning edits for 2017-2018 that will pop up when the student fills out the application and enters an income or tax amount that differs from the amount reported on the 2016-2017 FAFSA. These edits will not be triggered if the 2016-2017 FAFSA was based on esti - mated data or if between the two years there was a change in the student's dependency status or in the student's or parents' marital status. If the student does not correct the 2017-2018 data based on the above warnings, edit and comment codes will be included on the SAR and ISIR. Schools may choose to reconcile these edits with the student, but they are not required to do so except as explained below. The CPS will compare the student's last 2016-2017 transaction with the 2017-2018 ISIR. If the comparison reveals conflicting information that would result in a significant change in the EFC, the CPS will flag the 2017-2018 ISIR and SAR with a \"C\" code and a new comment code 399 informing the school that it must resolve the conflicting information. If comment code 399 does not appear, schools are not required to determine if the income and tax data differ between the two years. However, schools must still resolve other instances of conflicting information (for example, in a student's high school completion status). The CPS will not flag an ISIR for resolution of conflicting information, even if there is a significant change to the EFC, when PJ was per - formed in 2016-2017 or 2017-2018 or between the two award years there was a change in the student's dependency status or his or his parents' marital status.

Conflicting information must be resolved before any PJ adjustment. Conflicting information does not need to be resolved if the student is no longer en - rolled and does not intend to re-enroll. However, if she later enrolls or re-enrolls for any period of 2016-2017 or 2017-2018, you must then resolve the conflicting infor - mation. For more information, including details pertaining to the resolution of conflicting infor - mation in these case, see DCL GEN-16-14 and the announcement of October 21, 2016. See also the frequently asked questions beginning with question G-Q12 in the Early FAFSA sec - tion of the IFAP website. Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-49Examples of conflicting information citizenship status, accuracy of SSN, default or overpayment status, changes in student's academic status (including grade level progression), elements considered in determining Cost of Attendance other student financial assistance or resources, and inconsistent information used in calculating the student's EFC. Conflicting information does not include such things as a household size that differs from the number of exemptions on a tax return; dependency under IRS rules vs. ED definition of dependency; a roster of candidates for an outside scholarship, as opposed to a list of recipients; privacy-protected information, such as information from professional counselors, chaplains, doctors, etc.; assumptions made by the Central Processing System; and a student who has an expired immigration document but whose secondary confirmation match is success ful.Examples of Conflicting informationVolume 2\u2014School FSA HB 20172-50OIG referrals A school must refer to the Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) any credible information indicating that an applicant for federal student aid may have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in connection with his or her application. Common misconduct includes false claims of independent student status, false claims of citizenship, use of false identities, forgery of signa - tures of certifications, and false statements of income. Remember that fraud is the intent to deceive as opposed to a mistake. If you suspect such intent on the part of a student, report it to the OIG by phoning 1-800-MISUSED. Schools must also refer to the OIG any third-party servicer who may have engaged in fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, or other illegal conduct involving the FSA Programs. It is always appropriate for a financial aid administrator to consult with a school's legal counsel prior to referring suspected cases of fraud or misconduct to an agency outside of the school. Referrals to the IG are also mentioned in the Application and Verification Guide. Coordinating official A school must designate a capable individual to be the coordinating official. This person performs a key role in demonstrating the school's administrative capability. She administers the FSA programs and coordi - nates the aid from those programs with that from all other sources (fed - eral, state, school, and private). As noted earlier, all the information the school receives and any changes processed by an office of the school that might affect a student's FSA eligibility are communicated to the coordi - nating official and by her to the financial aid office. For example, when aid administrators create a student's financial aid package, they must consider financial assistance (scholarships, grants, awards, etc.) the student is receiving from external and internal sources to ensure that he is not overawarded. Therefore, any information the school's admissions office or an academic department gets about finan - cial assistance a student is receiving must be made available to the co - ordinating official. Another example is that the financial aid office must be informed of any changes in a student's enrollment status. Therefore, whenever he adds or drops a class, changes from credit to audit, or with - draws from school, the change must be communicated to the coordinat - ing official.Separation of function For further guidance on the separation of functions, contact the appropriate school participation division.Coordinating official\u2014definition of capable individual 34 CFR 668.16(b)(1) An individual is \"capable\" if he or she is certified by the state in which the school is located, if state certification is required. Other factors affecting capability include the individual's successful completion of FSA program training provided or approved by the Department and previous experience and documented success in FSA program administration.Chapter 3\u2014FSA HB June 20172-51Counseling Schools must provide adequate financial aid counseling to all enrolled and prospective students and their families. In addition, schools must also provide entrance and exit counseling for student borrowers in the Perkins and Direct Loan programs. For a complete discussion of Direct Loan counseling requirements, see Chapter 6. For a discussion of Perkins counseling and disclosure requirements, see Volume 6. Adequate staffing To manage a school's aid programs effectively, the aid administrator must be supported by an adequate number of professional and clerical personnel. The number of staff that is adequate depends on the num - ber of students aided, the number and types of programs in which the school participates, the number of applicants evaluated and processed, the amount of funds administered, and the type of financial aid delivery sys - tem the school uses. What may be adequate at one school may be insuf - ficient at another. The Department will determine on a case-by-case basis whether a school has an adequate number of qualified persons, based on program reviews, audits, and information provided on the school's appli - cation for approval to participate in the FSA programs. System of checks and balances In addition to having a well-organized financial aid office staffed by qualified personnel, a school must ensure that its administrative proce - dures for the FSA programs include an adequate system of internal checks and balances. This system, at a minimum, must separate the functions of authorizing payment and disbursing or delivering funds so that no single person or office exercises both functions for any student receiving FSA funds. Small schools are not exempt from this requirement even though they may have limited staff. Individuals working in either authorization or disbursement may perform other functions as well but not both au - thorization and disbursement. These two functions must be performed by individuals who are not members of the same family and who do not together exercise substantial control over the school. If a school performs any aspect of these functions via computer, no one person may have the ability to change data that affect both authorization and disbursement. While electronic processes enhance accuracy and efficiency, they also can blur separation of functions so the awarding and disbursement oc - cur virtually simultaneously. Schools must set up controls that prevent an individual or an office from having the authority or the ability to perform both functions. Family definition and example A member of a person's family is a parent, sibling, spouse, child, spouse's parent or sibling, or sibling's or child's spouse. Example: Charlie works in the financial aid office at Krieger University, and he notices that there is an opening in the business office. He thinks of telling his daughter Sarah about the job but then realizes that because the business office disburses student aid, she would not be able to work there while he is responsible for awarding aid in the financial aid office. 34 CFR 668.15(f)(3)Volume 2\u2014School June 20172-52In addition, your system also should have controls that prevent cross- functional tampering. For example, financial aid office employees should not be able to change data elements that are entered by the registrar's office. Finally, your system should only allow individuals with special security classifications to make changes to the programs that determine student need and awards, and it should be able to identify the individuals who make such changes. OWNERSHIP, EMPLOYEES, AND CONTRACTORS Debarment of school owners or staff If one of the principals of a school is debarred or suspended by a fed - eral agency, that person is prohibited from participating in any FSA pro - gram as long as the agency's procedures include due process protections that are equivalent to those provided by ED. The principals of a school include its owners, directors, officers, partners, employees, and anyone else with management or supervisory responsibilities. A principal may also be someone who is not employed by the school but who has critical influence on or substantive influence over a covered transaction (such as the receipt of Pell Grant or Campus-Based funds). For example, a principal may be someone, employed by the school or not, who is in a position to handle federal funds; is in a position to influence or control the use of those funds; or occupies a technical or professional position capable of sub - stantially influencing the development or outcome of an activ - ity required to perform the covered transaction. Schools participating in the FSA programs have a fiduciary respon - sibility to safeguard FSA funds and ensure those funds are used for the benefit of the students for whom they are intended. We expect participat - ing institutions to thoroughly examine the background of individuals they employ (or are considering employing) in management or supervisory positions. If a school discovers that a person employed in a management or supervisory capacity has been suspended or debarred by a federal agency, the school must remove that person from such a position or risk losing its FSA eligibility. Moreover, a school may not enter into a relation - ship (and must terminate an ongoing relationship) with a lender, third- party servicer, or loan servicer the school determines has been debarred or suspended.Debarment and suspension To protect the public interest, it is the policy of the federal government to conduct business only with responsible individuals. To implement this policy, the government takes debarment and suspension actions against individuals whom it determines constitute a current risk to federal agencies. Executive Order 12549 Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR Part 9, Subpart 9.4) 34 CFR Part 85 Similar debarment and suspension limitations apply to lenders, third- party servicers, loan servicers, and any individuals who provide services described in 34 CFR 668.2 or 682.200 to an FSA recipient whether or not they are employed by the school. Covered transactions For purposes of the debarment/ suspension rules, covered transactions include: disbursement of FSA funds to a student or borrower, certification by an educational institu - tion of eligibility for an FSA loan, and acquisition or exercise of any servicing responsibility for a grant, loan, or work study assistance under an FSA program. Checking debarment/suspension status online You can search for entity registration and exclusion records on the The System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/##11Chapter 3\u2014FSA Administrative & Related RequirementsCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-53Certifying current or prospective employees or contractors Before a school may receive FSA funding, it must certify that neither the school nor its employees have been debarred or suspended by a fed - eral agency. You can find this certification in the Program Participation Agreement and in the web-based FISAP package available to schools par - ticipating in the Campus-Based programs. The certification provided by the school is a material representation of fact relied upon by the Department when it enters into a participation agreement with the school. Moreover, a school is expected to have knowl - edge and information normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. Although the Department doesn't dictate how a school must ensure that its principals/employees have not been debarred or suspended by a federal agency, we do hold the school responsible for any information it could reasonably have been expected to know in the course of ordinary operations. In addition, we expect the school to expend a reasonable amount of effort ensuring that it and its employees are in compliance. If the Department learns that a prospective participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available, the Department may terminate the participation of the institution. A school chooses the method and frequency for making a determi - nation about the eligibility of its principals. This might include asking current and prospective employees and contractors, in person or in writ - ing, about their debarment or suspension histories. In addition, a school might also examine the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs to find out if an individual or organiza - tion is debarred or suspended. A school should discuss with its attorney the procedures appropriate to its circumstances. The employees who award FSA funds and those who disburse them should always be included in those whose backgrounds are examined. In addition, employees who participate in other transactions from which the regulations exclude individuals who have been debarred or suspended should be included. A school should consult with its attorney on the indi - viduals it must certify. The debarment or suspension of a person who is not a principal of the school and who does not work in the financial aid office will not affect the school's FSA eligibility so long as that person is not involved in any covered transactions. Disqualified individuals & PPA 34 CFR 668.14(b)(18)(i)Notifying the Department of change of control A school must report any changes of control under which a person acquires the ability to affect substantially the actions of the school. Such changes in control trigger a review to determine if the school is financially responsible (see Chapter 5 ).Control and ownership interest Definition of control 34 CFR 600.31(b) Ownership interest 34 June 20172-54Lower-tier covered transactions A school must not enter into lower-tier covered transactions with a debarred or suspended individual or organization. A lower-tier covered transaction is any transaction between a participant in a covered transac - tion (such as the school) and another individual or organization, if that transaction stems from a covered transaction. A school must obtain a cer - tification from any lower-tier organization if the amount of the lower-tier transaction is $25,000 or more. The lower-tier organization must inform the school in writing if the organization or its principals are debarred or suspended. Therefore, the certification does not need to be renewed from year to year. Crimes involving FSA program funds Schools are prohibited from having as principals those who have engaged in the misuse of government funds or from employing or con - tracting with other organizations that employ such persons. Specifically, a school must not knowingly employ, in a capacity that involves the administration of the FSA programs or the receipt of funds under those programs, an individual who has been convicted of, or has pled nolo con - tendere or guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of federal, state, or local government funds, or has been administratively or judicially determined to have com - mitted fraud or any other material violation of law involving federal, state, or local government funds; contract with a school or third-party servicer that has been terminated from the FSA programs for a reason involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of federal, state, or local gov - ernment funds or that has been administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud or any other material vio - lation of law involving federal, state, or local government funds; or contract with or employ any individual, agency, or organization that has been, or whose officers or employees have been: (1) convicted of, or pled nolo contendere or guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of federal, state, or local government funds; or (2) administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud or any other material vio - lation of law involving federal, state, or local government funds.Referring criminal conduct to OIG The regulations provide the following examples of criminal misconduct: False claims by the school for FSA pro - gram assistance; False claims of independent student status; False claims of citizenship; Use of false identities; Forgery of signatures or certifications; False statements of income; and Payment of any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid to any person or entity en - gaged in any student recruitment or ad - mission activity or in making decisions regarding the award of FSA program funds. See the next section on incentive compensation.Lower-tier transactions Examples of common lower-tier covered transactions are a school's contracts with a financial aid consultant service or with a loan collection or billing agency. Sample certification statement from lower-tier organization The Department disseminated the following language in April 1989 as a model that schools may use to obtain the required certification statement from a lower-tier organization. \"The prospective lower tier participant certifies, by submission of this proposal, that neither it nor its principals is presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participating in this transaction by any Federal department or agency. Where the prospective lower tier participant is unable to certify to any of the statements in this certification, such prospective participant shall attach an explanation to this proposal.\" Federal Register , May 26, 1988, page 19211, disseminated in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-89-21.Chapter 3\u2014FSA RequirementsCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-55Code of conduct If a school participates in an FSA loan program, it must publish and enforce a code of conduct that includes bans on the following: revenue-sharing arrangements with any lender, steering borrowers to particular lenders or delaying loan certi - fications, and offers of funds for private loans to students in exchange for providing concessions or promises to the lender for a specific number of FSA loans, a specified loan volume, or a preferred lender arrangement. The code of conduct applies to the officers, employees, and agents of the school and must also prohibit employees of the financial aid office from receiving gifts from a lender, guaranty agency, or loan servicer. The code must also prohibit financial aid office staff (or other employ - ees or agents with responsibilities with respect to education loans) from accepting compensation for any type of consulting arrangement or contract to provide ser - vices to or on behalf of a lender relating to education loans; and service on an advisory board, commission, or group established by lenders or guarantors, except for reimbursement for reason - able expenses. Compensation for serving on an advisory board A person employed in a financial aid office who serves on an advisory board established by a lender or group of lenders cannot receive anything of value from the lender but can receive reimbursement for reasonable ex - penses associated with participation. A school must report annually to ED any such reasonable expenses paid or provided to any employee who is employed in the financial aid office or who otherwise has responsibilities with respect to education loans or other financial aid of the institution. The report must include the following: the amount of each specific instance of reasonable expenses paid or provided; the name of the financial aid official, other employee, or agent to whom the expenses were paid or provided; the dates of the activity for which the expenses were paid or provided; and a brief description of the activity for which the expenses were paid or provided.Advisory board compensation HEOA Section 1011 Section 140 of the Truth in Lending Act Disclosures of Reimbursements for Service on Advisory Boards HEOA section 1011 HEA section WITH THIRD-PARTY SERVICERS Schools are permitted to contract with consultants for assistance in administering the FSA programs. However, the school ultimately is responsible for the use of FSA funds and will be held accountable if the consultant mismanages the programs or program funds. A third-party servicer administers any aspect of the school's FSA participation. Examples of functions that third-party servicers perform include the following: processing student financial aid applications, performing need analysis, and determining student eligibility or related activi - ties; certifying loans, servicing loans, or collecting loans; processing output documents for payment to students, and receiving, disbursing, or delivering FSA funds; conducting required student consumer information services; preparing and certifying requests for cash monitoring or reim - bursement funding; preparing and submitting notices and applications required of eligible and participating schools, or preparing the Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP); performing default prevention/aversion activities, such as contacting student loan borrowers to discuss repayment options or borrower account history, assisting with completion and/or collection of borrower deferment or forbearance forms, performing entrance/exit loan counseling, implementation and oversight of a written default management plan, and /or accessing borrower information contained in Department systems; accessing Department systems (NSLDS, COD, CPS, etc.) that contain personally identifiable student information, and/or accessing personally identifiable student information down - loaded from a Department system to perform any Title IV function or service on behalf of an eligible institution; determining student eligibility and related activities, such as completing verification, performing satisfactory academic progress evaluations, determining award amounts, performing Return of Title IV aid calculations, and/or reconciling Title IV program accounts; and processing enrollment verification for deferment forms or NSLDS enrollment reporting.

Contact Information If you have questions about this announcement or the attached Third Party Servicer Data Form, contact the Third Party Servicer Oversight Group (816) 268-0543. You may also e-mail fsapc3rdpartyserviceroversight@ed.gov . Questions and Answers about and Examples of Third-Party Servicer Activities are available in the attachment to DCL-GEN-16-15 of a third-party Under a contract with a school, a third-party servicer agrees to comply with all Title IV provisions, which includes those that refer solely to schools as well as to servicers, and to be jointly and severally liable with the school for a violation by the servicer of any of those provisions. A school must ensure that its contracts accurately and specifically detail the functions that the servicer (or its subcontractor(s), (if applicable) performs on behalf of the institution, and those functions that are required to be completed by the institution. The contract must identify the third-party servicer by its legal name and include any other name the servicer does business as (d/b/a). The contract must provide the physical address and primary phone number of the servicer's primary lo - cation, as well as the name, title, phone number, and e-mail address of the president or chief executive officer of the entity. If a third-party servicer subcontracts any of its contractual responsibilities, the contract must identify the subcontractor and clearly describe the functions performed on behalf of the servicer and institution by the subcontractor. The servicer agrees to use any Title IV funds (and interest or earn - ings on them) in accordance with the regulations and, if it disburses those funds, to confirm student eligibility and make the required returns to Title IV funds (see Volume 5 ) when a student withdraws. A third-party servicer must refer to the Department's inspector gener - al any suspicion of crime relating to FSA program administration, includ - ing any information that there is reasonable cause to believe the school might have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct pertaining to the FSA programs (see the examples in the margin). If the contract is terminated or the servicer files for bankruptcy or ceases to perform any functions prescribed under the contract, the ser - vicer must return to the school all unexpended FSA funds and records related to the servicer's administration of the school's participation in the FSA programs. For more information about elements to include in Third-Party Servicer contracts see DCL GEN 15-01, January 9, 2015, and DCL GEN-16-15, August 18, 2016.Third-party servicer definition An individual or a state or a private, profit or nonprofit organization that enters into a contract with an eligible school to administer, through manual or automated processing, any aspect of the school's participation in any Title IV program. 34 CFR 668.2 Notifying ED of third-party servicer contracts Schools must notify the Department of new third-party servicer contracts and changes to existing contracts, as described in Chapter 5 . If a school has submitted information regarding its third-party servicers as part of applying for certification or recertification, no additional submission is required. Institutional liability A school remains liable for any and all FSA- related actions taken by the servicer on its behalf. NEW TIPThird-Party Servicers and Information Security Institutions are subject to the information security requirements established by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for financial institutions. Third-Party Services must provide the same security. Third-Party Servicers and Privacy Third-party servicers must comply with all aspects of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) with regard to the third-party servicer's receipt and use of any education records provided by the institution.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-58Excluded functions Examples of functions that are not considered administering the par - ticipation in a Title IV program: performing lockbox processing of loan payments; performing normal electronic fund transfers (EFTs) after being initiated by the school; acting as a Multiple Data Entry Processor (MDE); financial and compliance auditing; mailing documents prepared by a school or warehousing school records; participating in a written arrangement with other eligible schools to make eligibility determinations and FSA awards for certain students (see Chapter 2 ); and providing computer services or software. A person or organization performing these functions is not consid - ered to be a third-party servicer and is not subject to third-party servicer requirements. Excluded entities An employee of a school is not a third-party servicer. For this pur - pose, an employee is one who: is paid directly by the school; works full or part time or on a temporary basis; performs all duties under school supervision, whether on site or remotely; is not employed by or associ - ated with a third-party servicer; and is not a third-party servicer for any other school. A school may not have as a third-party servicer one that has been limited, suspended, or terminated by the Department within the preceding five years; has had, during the servicer's two most recent audits, a finding that resulted in the servicer being required to repay an amount greater than five percent of the funds that the servicer adminis - tered under the Title IV programs for any year; or has been cited during the preceding five years for failure to submit audit reports required under Title IV in a timely fashion.Chapter 3\u2014FSA Administrative & Related RequirementsCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-59Incentive compensation in the law and regulations The prohibition of incentive compensation appears in Section 487(a)(20) of the HEA and in the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations at 34 CFR 668.14(b)(22). On March 22, 2013, the Department published a revision to the preamble of the October 29, 2010, final regulations in accordance with the remand in \"Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities v. Duncan\" 683F.3d 427 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Incentive compensation On March 17, 2011, the Department issued additional guidance on incentive compensation. In addition to the tables included in this text, that Dear Colleague Letter provided examples of how the incentive compensation rules are applied, as well as guidance on \"tuition sharing\" and \"profit sharing\" and other forms of compensation. Since that time, the Department posted additional related questions and answers to address study abroad situations for Title IV-eligible students and to clarify when bundled services provided by a third party are subject to the incentive compensation ban. See GEN-11-05 and the webpage at (www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/ hearulemaking/2009/compensation. html ). \"Safe harbors\" exceptions Regulations issued on October 29, 2010, eliminated the safe harbors effective July 1, 2011. Definitions See Table 3 for regulatory definitions of Commission, bonus, or other incentive payment Securing enrollments or the award of financial aid Entity or person engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity or in making decisions about the award of financial aid EnrollmentINCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROHIBITION Schools may not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any individual or entity engaged in recruiting or admis - sion activities or in making decisions about awarding FSA program funds. As stated previously, only two types of activities are subject to the in - centive compensation ban: securing enrollment (recruitment) and secur - ing financial aid. No other activities are subject to the ban. The incentive compensation prohibition applies to all individuals with responsibility for recruitment or admission of students or making deci - sions about awarding FSA funds. As shown in Table 1, the Department draws a distinction between recruitment activities that involve working with individual students and policy-level determinations that affect re - cruitment, admission, or the awarding of FSA funds. The Department expects that employees who have titles such as enrollment counselors, recruitment specialists, recruiters, and enrollment managers have suffi - ciently direct involvement in recruitment that the incentive compensation ban applies to them. Senior managers and executive level employees who are only involved in the development of policy and do not engage in indi - vidual student contact or the other covered activities listed in Table 1 will not generally be subject to the incentive compensation ban. When other activities are coupled with recruitment or securing finan - cial aid, a school must consider how they compensate persons or enti - ties to avoid payments that are prohibited. Table 1 illustrates how these principles would be applied to activities that schools carry out in support of recruitment and financial aid. Payments to persons or entities that undertake or have responsibility for recruitment and decisions related to securing financial aid are subject to the incentive compensation ban even if their work also includes other activities. Schools may use factors such as seniority or length of employment as a basis for compensating employees covered by the incentive compensa - tion prohibition. Many other qualitative factors may also be used so long as they are not related to the employee's success in securing student en - rollments or the award of financial aid. These factors may include such things as job knowledge and professionalism; skills such as analytic abil - ity, initiative in work improvement, clarity in communications, and use and understanding of technology; traits such as accuracy, thoroughness, dependability, punctuality, and FSA HB June 20172-60Two-part test to evaluate if a payment is incentive compensation 1. Is the payment a commission, bonus, or other incentive payment, defined as an award of a sum of money or something of value paid to or given to a person or entity for services rendered? 2. Is the commission, bonus, or other incentive payment provided to any person based, in any part directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid? If the answer to each question is \"yes,\" the payment would be prohibited.

For a school to exchange data with the FSA systems, it must have Internet access through its network or through an Internet service provider. Your school will also need to enroll in the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) and establish a data mailbox. (Doing this and other tasks related to electronic processing is the most frequent duty for third-party servicers.) Most schools prepare student data records in a software package such as EDExpress and transmit the records as batch files to the SAIG mailbox. The Department's systems send edited records back to the SAIG mailbox, where the school downloads the records and uses its software to update the records in its own database. Schools must use COD's common record format, complying with the published schema for the corresponding award year, to send and receive origination and disbursement data for Pell Grants, TEACH Grants, and Direct Loans. This format uses Extensible Markup Language (XML). To create and edit student records, your school may use the Department's EDExpress software, develop its own software, or rely on a third-party software vendor. If you are not using EDExpress software to prepare your records, it is your responsibility to ensure that the software you use is capable of generating COD records in XML format. As an alternative, you can now create and edit student records directly on many of our websites, such as COD, CPS, and NSLDS. When creating and editing records on the Web, you do not use PC software and you do not have to transmit the changes through your SAIG mailbox. Systems help For help with questions about specific systems, such as application processing and software (CPS/SAIG), COD, and NSLDS, see the \"Help\" link on the Information for Financial Aid Professionals site: www.ifap.ed.gov . Confirmation of TG Numbers Every organization enrolled for a Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) account was required to review and validate its assigned TG numbers and Electronic Services user accounts by December 9, 2016. If you have questions, contact CPS/ SAIG Technical Support at 800/330-5947 (TDD/TTY 800/511-5806) or by at CPSSAIG@ed.gov. Two-factor authentication (TFA) For greater security FSA systems use TFA, which employs a token to generate single- use passwords. We encourage users to download the new \"soft\" token, which is an application for their mobile device, but the \"hard\" token or key fob is also still available. See the December 29, 2014, electronic announcement. For questions about TFA and tokens, you can contact the CPS/SAIG Technical Support and the TFA Support Center at (800) 330-5947 or by email at TFASupport@ed.gov . From April to June 2016, TFA is being implemented for the G5 payment system. This TFA is separate from the one using the token described above. See the April 19, 2016, announcement.

(The most recent issuance was for 2005-2006 and gave an optimal configu - ration of a 2.8 GHz/333 MHz processor and 80 GB hard drive with a high-speed Internet connection.) When reviewing your office's computer needs, you should be aware that its system requirements (processor speed, RAM, hard-drive storage, etc.) will depend on which FSA functions the school uses, the number of records processed, and school database inter - faces.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations Perkins Go to iLibrary > NSLDS Reference Materials on the IFAP website for NSLDS newsletters, updates, and other information.

Enrollment information is used to determine if the student is still considered in school, must be moved into repayment, or is eligible for an in-school deferment. Program-level enrollment data is also used to determine a student's eligibility for Direct Subsidized Loans. For students moving into repayment, the out-of-school status effective date determines when the grace period begins and how soon a student must begin repaying loan funds. You're required to report changes in the student's enrollment status, the effective date of the status, and an antici - pated completion date. You must report enrollment status at both the school and program level. For this purpose an academic program is defined as the combina - tion of your school's Office of Postsecondary Education Identification (OPEID) number and the program's Classification of Instructional Pro - gram (CIP) code, credential level, and published program length. When a student is enrolled in more than one major (or comparable designation under your school's academic policies), each is considered an academic program and is reported separately whether the student receives separate degrees or certificates for each major or only receives one for completing the requirements for all majors. Enrollment in a minor is not a separate program and therefore would not be reported as such. Report a student's \"active enrollment status\" (full-time, three-quarter time, half-time, and less than half-time) based on the total number of credit or clock hours in which he or she is enrolled at the institution, regardless of whether specific credits apply to the academic program being reported. See DCL GEN-14-17 for examples and more information. NSLDS will send a roster file electronically to your school or its des - ignated servicer every 60 days (or more frequently depending on your schedule) through its SAIG mailbox. The file includes all of the school's students who are identified in NSLDS as Pell recipients, Perkins Loan, Stafford (Direct and FFEL) Loan borrowers or the beneficiaries of a PLUS loan. The file is not necessarily connected to loans made at your school\u2014 it may also report information for students who received some or all of their FSA loans at other schools but are currently attending your school.Chapter 3\u2014FSA Administrative & Related 20172-67Your school or servicer must certify the information and re - turn the roster file within 15 days of receiving it. You may also go to (www.nsldsfap.ed.gov ) and update information for your students online. As already noted, you must report enrollment changes within 30 days; however, if a roster file is expected within 60 days, you may provide the updated data on that roster file. If the roster file that you are returning contains records that don't pass the NSLDS enrollment reporting edits, you will receive a response file with the records that didn't pass. Within 10 days you'll need to make the necessary corrections to these records and resubmit them. If you are using a servicer, you may need to assist the servicer in correcting these errors. Please remember that your school is ultimately responsible for no - tifying NSLDS of student enrollment changes. When your school reports enrollment data to the NSLDS, it does not have to complete enrollment reporting rosters received directly from guaranty agencies. Additionally, your school may request that a lender confirm a borrower's enrollment status using NSLDS rather than com - pleting an in-school deferment form. Updating borrower information at separation Schools that conduct their own exit counseling rather than have students complete it on studentloans.gov must, within 60 days after the exit counseling session, provide the appropriate federal loan servicer or the guaranty agency for FFEL that is listed in the borrower's student aid records any updated information about: her name, address, references, future permanent address, Social Security number, the identity and ad - dress of her expected employer, the address of her next of kin, and her driver's license number and state of issuance. This information may be uploaded with the NSLDS Exit Counseling Submittal template at ( www. fsadownload.ed.gov ). NSLDS will then provide the data to the appropri - ate loan holders. Sharing information about delinquent/defaulted borrow - ers To promote loan repayment, schools are encouraged to notify the ap - propriate Direct Loan servicer with new information about a delinquent borrower's location or employment and to work with defaulted borrowers to bring their loans out of default. The Direct Loan servicers send electronic reports to participating schools listing all delinquent and defaulted Direct Loan borrowers who took out loans while attending the school. The report, which contains the borrowers' names, addresses, and phone numbers, is organized by the number of days past due so that schools can contact and counsel borrow - ers to avoid default. Schools can also request delinquency reports through NSLDS (viewable online or for delivery to their TG mailbox) for all their borrowers with any of the DL servicers.Updating enrollment information on the Web You can create or update student enrollment status by using the \"Enroll\" tab on the NSLDS Professional Access site: (https://www.nsldsfap.ed.gov/ ). Phone support: 1-800-999-8219 Accurate program-level reporting It is critical to completely and accurately report students' program-level enrollment information to NSLDS. This information is used to determine the subsidy status of loans under the 150% Direct Subsidized Loan Limit and for other purposes. Pay particular attention to correctly reporting published program length, the field for which is a six-digit number with an implied decimal after the third digit. See the electronic announcements from December 23, 2014 and May 13, 2016. Enrollment status codes These codes are used for enrollment reporting and are listed in the Enrollment Reporting Guide: F = Full time Q = At least three-quarter time but less than full time H = At least half time but less than three-quarter time L = Less than half time G = Graduated W = Withdrawn (voluntary or involuntary) A = Approved Leave of Absence D = Deceased X = Never attended Z = Record not foundReceiving roster files A school or its servicer must sign up to receive roster files through the SAIG Enrollment site: (https://fsawebenroll.ed.gov/ June 20172-68A former FFEL school may agree to provide the holders of delinquent loans information about delinquent borrowers' location or employment. The school may also try to contact borrowers and counsel them to avoid default. Former FFEL schools may ask a guaranty agency to provide informa - tion about students who were enrolled at the school who have defaulted on their Stafford loans. The guarantor may not charge for this informa - tion. The school may also ask the guarantor to notify the school when - ever a lender requests default aversion assistance on a loan made at your school, and provide the borrower's name, address, and Social Security number. The guaranty agency may charge a reasonable fee for this service. Your school may only use the information to remind the borrower to re - pay her loan(s). If you've requested it, the guaranty agency must also notify your school when loans to its students are sold, transferred, or assigned to another holder. The notification must include the address and telephone number of the new loan holder. This notification requirement only ap - plies to loans that are in the grace period or repayment and only if your school was the last the borrower attended before the loan entered repay - ment. For instance, if a student received Stafford Loans earning a bach - elor's degree at your school but pursued a master's degree at another school before those loans entered repayment, the guarantor is not re - quired to notify you if the loans are sold. Financial aid history and transfer monitoring A school must consider a student's financial aid history in making FSA program awards. The regulations require that schools use NSLDS data to ob - tain information about a student's financial aid history. To receive a student's financial aid history, your school must register for the Transfer Student Monitoring Process . Through this process, NSLDS will monitor a transfer student's financial aid history and alert you to any relevant changes\u2014other than the default and overpayment information reported in the postscreening process\u2014that may affect the student's current award(s). You must send NSLDS identifying information (or enter it online) for students transferring to your school so that NSLDS can use transfer moni - toring to notify you of changes to their financial aid history. You may send information for students who have expressed an interest in attending your school even if they have not yet formally applied for admission. You can find a complete discussion of this requirement and the trans - fer student monitoring process in Volume 1, Chapter 3 .Financial aid history 34 CFR 668.19 DCL GEN-00-12 DCL GEN-01-09, July 2001 (including July 16, 2001, update)Privacy: sharing student records with lenders A student authorizes his school to release information to lenders by signing the promissory note as part of the loan application process. This authorization covers information relevant to the student's or parent's eligibility to borrow as well as locating the borrower. Examples of such information are enrollment status, financial assistance, and employment records. See Chapter 7 for more information about recordkeeping and privacy. Loan information from the guarantor Upon request, the guarantor must inform the school of students in default on FFELs. 34 CFR 682.401(b)(24) If the lender requests preclaims assistance, the guarantor must inform the school of this request if the school has requested such notification. 34 CFR 682.404(a)(4) Sec. 428(c)(2)(H) of the HEA The guarantor must notify the school when a loan made at that school changes hands if the school requests such information. Sec. 428(b)(2)(F) of the HEA 34 CFR 682.401(b)(25) Transfer student monitoring You must verify the eligibility of transfer students for FSA funds. You may either check the student's financial aid history on the NSLDS Professional Access site or wait seven days after you've submitted the student's information for monitoring to receive a response from NSLDS. To begin using the \"inform\" feature, you must designate a contact on the \"School Transfer Profile\" page at (www.nsldsfap.ed.gov DCL FSA June 20172-69SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (SAP) To be considered administratively capable, a school must have a satisfactory academic progress policy that is the same as or more strict for an FSA recipient as the school's standards for a student enrolled in the same educational program who is not receiving FSA funds. Because satisfactory academic progress issues are most often raised in specific student eligibility cases, we discuss the details of SAP standards in Volume 1 , Chapter 1 , of the FSA Handbook. You should carefully review that discussion if your school is developing or amending its SAP policy. Basic elements of an SAP policy As discussed in Volume 1 , a school's policy must include evaluations at least annually for programs longer than one year and every payment period for programs of one year or less. There must be a qualitative component consisting of a minimum grade point average or comparable factor that is measurable against a norm. For programs longer than two academic years, the policy must stipulate that a student must have at the end of the second year a GPA of at least a \"C\" or its equivalent or have an academic standing consistent with the school's requirements for graduation. There must also be a quantitative component that consists of a maximum time frame in which a student must complete her educational program and a pace of completion that ensures she will complete the program within the time frame. In addition, your school's policy must explain: the effect of ESL and remedial courses on progress, how progress is measured if a student changes majors or seeks to earn additional degrees, how course repetitions are handled, whether you have appeals for an adverse SAP determination and the procedures for any such appeals, and the procedures for otherwise re-establishing satisfactory progress. The policy must include provisions for consistent application of the standards to all students within categories (e.g., full-time, part-time, undergraduate, and graduate students) and educational programs established by the school. Generally, the quantitative and qualitative standards used to judge academic progress include all periods of the student's enrollment. Even periods in which the student did not receive FSA funds must be counted.Satisfactory academic progress School policy: 20172-70PROVISIONS FOR U.S. ARMED FORCES MEMBERS AND FAMILY In-state tuition rates for active duty service members and family attending public institutions A public postsecondary school may not charge a member of the armed forces who is on active duty for a period of more than 30 days more than the school's tuition rate for residents of the state. Similarly, the service member's spouse and dependent children are entitled to the in- state tuition rate. In addition, if the service member, spouse, or dependent child pays the in-state tuition rate, the public institution must allow the person to continue to pay such a rate as long as the individual is continuously en - rolled, even if there is a subsequent change in the permanent duty station of the service member to a location outside of the state. Readmission of service members A school must promptly readmit a service member with the same academic status as he had when last attending the school or accepted for admission to the school. This requirement applies to any student who cannot attend school due to military service (see the definition in the mar - gin). The student must notify the school of his military service and inten - tion to return to school as follows: Notification of military service. The student (or an appropri - ate officer of the armed forces or official of the Department of Defense) must give oral or written notice of such service to the school as far in advance as is reasonable under the cir - cumstances. This notice does not have to indicate whether the student intends to return to the school and may not be subject to any rule of timeliness. (Timeliness must be determined by the facts in each case.) Alternatively, at the time of readmission, the student may submit an attestation of military service that necessitated the student's absence from the school. No notice is required if precluded by military necessity, such as service in operations that are classified or would be compromised by such notice. Definitions for readmission For purposes of this discussion\u2014 Military service (or service in the uniformed services) \u2014service, whether voluntary or involuntary, in the armed forces, including service by a member of the National Guard or Reserve on active duty, active duty for training, or full- time National Guard duty under federal authority, for a period of more than 30 consecutive days under a call or order to active duty of more than 30 consecutive days. This does not include National Guard service under state authority. Service member \u2014someone who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform, service in the uniformed services on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation to perform service. Appropriate officer \u2014A warrant, commissioned, or noncommissioned officer authorized to give such notice by the military service concerned. Definitions for tuition rates for military families Armed Forces \u2014the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. Active duty \u2014 full-time duty in the active military service of the United States. Active duty includes full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance, while in the active military service, at a school designated as a service school by law or by the Secretary of the military department concerned. Active duty does not include full-time National Guard duty.Chapter 3\u2014FSA FSA HB June 20172-71 Notification of intent to return to school. The student must also give oral or written notice of her intent to return to the school within three years after the completion of the period of service. A student who is hospitalized or convalescing due to an illness or injury incurred or aggravated during the performance of service must notify the school within two years after the end of the period needed for recovery from the illness or injury. A stu - dent who fails to apply for readmission within these periods does not automatically forfeit eligibility for readmission but is subject to the school's established leave of absence policy and general practices. A school must designate one or more offices that a student may con - tact to provide notification of service and notification of intent to return. The school may not require that these notices follow any particular for - mat. The school must promptly readmit the student into the next class or classes in the program beginning after he provides notice of intent to reenroll, unless he requests a later date or unusual circumstances require the school to admit him at a later date. This requirement supersedes state law\u2014for example, a school must readmit a qualifying service member to the next class even if that class is at the maximum enrollment level set by the state. The school must admit the student with the same academic status, which means: to the same program to which the student was last admitted or, if that exact program is no longer offered, the program that is most similar to that program, unless she chooses a different program; at the same enrollment status, unless the student wants to en - roll at a different enrollment status; with the same number of credit hours or clock hours previously completed, unless the student is readmitted to a different pro - gram to which the completed credit hours or clock hours are not transferable, and with the same academic standing (e.g., with the same satisfactory academic progress status) the student previously had.Termination for bad conduct A student's readmission rights terminate in the case of a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge, general court-martial, federal or state prison sentence, or other reasons as described in 34 CFR 668.18(h). Reasonable efforts to help prepare student If the school determines that the student is not prepared to resume the program with the same academic status at the point where she left off or will not be able to complete the program, the school must make reasonable efforts at no extra cost to help her become prepared or to enable her to complete the program. This includes providing refresher courses and allowing the student to retake a pretest at no extra cost. The school is not required to readmit the student if it determines that there are no reasonable efforts it can take to prepare her to resume the program at the point where she left off or to enable her to complete the pro - gram, or that after it makes reasonable efforts (those that do not place an undue hard - ship on the institution), the student is not prepared to resume or complete the program. \"Undue hardship\" means an action requiring significant difficulty or expense when considered in light of the overall financial resources of the institution and the impact otherwise of such action on the operation of the institution. The school has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the student is not prepared to resume the program with the same academic status at the point where she left off or that she will not be able to complete the program.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-72If the student is readmitted to the same program, for the first aca - demic year in which he returns, the school must assess the tuition and fee charges that he was or would have been assessed for the academic year during which he left the school. However, if his veterans education ben - efits or other service member education benefits will pay the higher tu - ition and fee charges that other students in the program are paying for the year, the school may assess those charges to the student as well. If the student is admitted to a different program, and for subsequent academic years for a student admitted to the same program, the school must assess no more than the tuition and fee charges that other stu - dents in the program are assessed for that academic year. The cumulative length of the absence and of all previous absences from the school for military service may not exceed five years. Only the time the student spends actually performing service is counted. See the next page for additional rules pertaining to cumulative length of absence.Chapter 3\u2014FSA Administrative CFR 668.18 (a) General (3) This section applies to an institution that has continued in operation since the student ceased attending or was last admitted to the institution but did not begin attendance, not - withstanding any changes of ownership of the institution since the student ceased attendance. (4) The requirements of this section supersede any State law (including any local law or ordinance), contract, agreement, policy, plan, practice, or other matter that reduces, limits, or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided by this section for the period of enrollment during which the student resumes attendance, and continuing so long as the institution is unable to comply with such requirements through other means. 668.18 (e) Cumulative length of absence. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a student's cu - mulative length of absence from an institution does not include any service\u2014 (1) That is required, beyond five years, to complete an initial period of obligated service; (2) During which the student was unable to obtain orders re - leasing the student from a period of service in the uniformed services before the expiration of the five-year period and such inability was through no fault of the student; or (3) Performed by a member of the Armed Forces (including the National Guard and Reserves) who is\u2014 (i) Ordered to or retained on active duty under\u2014 (A) 10 U.S.C. 688 (involuntary active duty by a military re - tiree); (B) 10 U.S.C. 12301(a) (involuntary active duty in wartime); (C) 10 U.S.C. 12301(g) (retention on active duty while in cap - tive status); (D) 10 U.S.C. 12302 (involuntary active duty during a na - tional emergency for up to 24 months); (E) 10 U.S.C. 12304 (involuntary active duty for an opera - tional mission for up to 270 days); (F) 10 U.S.C. 12305 (involuntary retention on active duty of a critical person during time of crisis or other specific condi - tions); (G) 14 U.S.C. 331 (involuntary active duty by retired Coast Guard officer); (H) 14 U.S.C. 332 (voluntary active duty by retired Coast Guard officer); (I) 14 U.S.C. 359 (involuntary active duty by retired Coast Guard enlisted member); (J) 14 U.S.C. 360 (voluntary active duty by retired Coast Guard enlisted member); (K) 14 U.S.C. 367 (involuntary retention of Coast Guard en - listed member on active duty); or (L) 14 U.S.C. 712 (involuntary active duty by Coast Guard Re - serve member for natural or man-made disasters);(ii) Ordered to or retained on active duty (other than for train - ing) under any provision of law because of a war or national emergency declared by the President or the Congress, as de - termined by the Secretary concerned; (iii) Ordered to active duty (other than for training) in support, as determined by the Secretary concerned, of an operational mission for which personnel have been ordered to active duty under section 12304 of title 10, United States Code; (iv) Ordered to active duty in support, as determined by the Secretary concerned, of a critical mission or requirement of the Armed Forces (including the National Guard or Reserve); or (v) Called into Federal service as a member of the National Guard under chapter 15 of title 10, United States Code, or section 12406 of title 10, United States Code (i.e., called to respond to an invasion, danger of invasion, rebellion, danger of rebellion, insurrection, or the inability of the President with regular forces to execute the laws of the United States). 668.18 (g) Documentation. (1) A student who submits an application for readmission to an institution under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section shall provide to the institution documentation to establish that\u2014 (i) The student has not exceeded the service limitation in para - graph (c)(1)(ii) of this section; and (ii) The student's eligibility for readmission has not been termi - nated due to an exception in paragraph (h) of this section. (2)(i) Documents that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section include, but are not limited to, the following: (A) DD (Department of Defense) 214 Certificate of Release or Dis - charge from Active Duty. (B) Copy of duty orders prepared by the facility where the orders were fulfilled carrying an endorsement indicating completion of the described service. (C) Letter from the commanding officer of a Personnel Support Activity or someone of comparable authority. (D) Certificate of completion from military training school.

(G) Letter from National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) Team Leader or Administrative Officer verifying dates and times of NDMS training or Federal activation. (ii) The types of documents that are necessary to establish eligi - bility for readmission will vary from case to case. Not all of these documents are available or necessary in every instance to estab - lish readmission eligibility. (3) An institution may not delay or attempt to avoid a readmis - sion of a student under this section by demanding documenta - tion that does not exist, or is not readily available, at the time of readmission.Readmission for service members\u2014additional 20172-74Executive Order 13607 executive order, 13-05 and the electronic announcements issued September 11, 2012, and January 18, 2013.Executive Order 13607: Principles of Excellence On April 27, 2012, the White House issued EO 13607, which created the Principles of Excellence for Educational Institutions Serving Service Members, Veterans, Spouses, and Other Family Members. The principles apply to all postsecondary schools that receive funding from federal military and veterans educational benefits programs. They strengthen consumer protections for students who receive these benefits and provide access to information to help them make informed choices about their college education. Adoption of the principles is voluntary but encouraged. The principles describe requirements in the following key areas: (1) providing a standardized cost form, (2) providing federal aid information, (3) aggressive and fraudulent recruiting, (4) state authorization, (5) mis - representation, (6) incentive compensation, (7) accreditation, (8) readmis - sion, (9) refunds, (10) individual education plans, and (11) academic and financial counseling points of contact. Title IV schools are likely already complying with many of the prin - ciples through their participation in the Title IV programs (for example, the refund requirement). One principle requires institutions to provide affected students with a personalized and standardized form describing the students' educational costs and how those may be covered by financial aid. The Financial Aid Shopping Sheet, released by the Department in July 2012, helps institutions satisfy that principle.CHAPTERC 4FSA HB June 20172-75CFR Glossary DCL Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort Default Rates Schools that participate in the FSA programs are generally required to have annual compliance and financial statement audits. This chapter will discuss the audit requirement and the financial standards and limitations that apply to a school's FSA eligibility. In addition, we will discuss the annual calculation of a school's cohort default rate. FSA AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOLS A school that participates in any FSA program, including a participating foreign school, generally must have an independent auditor conduct an annual audit of the school's compliance with the laws and regulations that are applicable to the FSA programs in which the school participates (a compliance audit) and an audit of the school's financial statements (a financial statement audit). While a compliance audit covers the school's administration of the FSA programs, a financial statement audit provides the Department with information necessary to evaluate a school's status vis-a-vis the financial standards that are discussed later in this chapter. The type of compliance audit a school or servicer must undergo depends on its type of control: public, for-profit, or nonprofit. All for-profit schools must have an FSA compliance audit con - ducted under the Inspector General's Audit Guide (for FSA school audits), which is available on the IFAP website. Public and nonprofit schools must comply with the Single Au - dit Act. The Single Audit Act requires these schools to have an audit conducted in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Nonprofit Organizations. (Circular A-133 allows an FSA compliance audit under the criteria of the Audit Guide under limited circumstances.) The Office of Inspector General (OIG) also conducts audits, usually in cases where there is concern over a school's administration of the FSA programs. An OIG or other federal audit does not satisfy the requirement that a school have annual compliance and financial statement audits performed by an independent public accountant. Note that audit requirements also apply to third-party servicers. However, a school may never use a third-party servicer's audit in place of its own required audit because the school is ultimately liable for its own violations as well as those incurred by its third-party servicers. School participation divisions For information regarding accounting and compliance issues, a school should contact the school participation division for its region. Go to the IFAP website ( ifap.ed.gov ) > Help > Contact Information > Federal Student Aid Offices > School Participation DivisionRelated information Administrative requirements, Chapter 3 Program reviews, Chapter 8 Audit requirements & waiver HEA: Sec. 487(c) 20 USC Waiver: 34 CFR 668.27Single Audit Act Not Applicable The Higher Education Act requires each Title IV participating institution to submit to the Department a financial audit and a compliance audit on at least an annual basis. Both the HEA and the implementing regulations require annual submissions of not only the institution's audited financial statements but also of the compliance audit of the institution's administration of the Title IV student aid programs. Therefore, a submission prepared under the Single Audit Act requirements that does not include a compliance audit does not meet the HEA audit requirement. EA 2016-08-05NEWVolume 2\u2014School FSA audit submissions A school that has an audit performed under the Audit Guide for FSA schools must submit both the compliance audit and the audited financial statements within six months of the end of the school's fiscal year. Both audits must be prepared by an independent public accountant in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and audited in accordance with the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS). The compliance audit and financial statement audit may be performed by different auditors. However, the audits must be submitted as one package. Both the compliance audit and the financial statement audit must be performed on a fiscal-year basis. In cases where the school's fiscal year does not coincide with an award year, the school's compliance audit will cover parts of two award years (see example).Independent CPA/auditor An independent certified public accountant or government auditor, except that a government auditor must meet the Government Auditing Standards qualification and independence standard, including standards related to organizational independence. Opportunity to send comments to Small Business Ombudsman The Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and 10 Regional Fairness Boards were established to receive comments from small businesses about federal agency enforcement actions. The Ombudsman annually will evaluate the enforcement activities and rate each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on the enforcement actions of the Department of Education, call 1-888-REG-Fair (1-888-734-3247). Submission dates for FSA audits A school's or servicer's annual compliance and financial statements audits performed under the Audit Guide must be based upon the fiscal year and submitted to the Department within six months after the end of the school's or servicer's fiscal year. (These requirements do not apply to audits performed under the Single Audit Act that are due as specified in OMB Circular A-133.) The chart on the next page lists audit due dates and the period the audit must cover. (The chart provides information for the most common institutional fiscal-year-end dates.)Fiscal year for 2016-2017 For schools using a calendar year as their fiscal year, their most recently completed fiscal year is the one that ends on December 31, 2016. For those schools using the award year as their fiscal year, their most recently completed fiscal year will be the one that ends on June 30, 2017.

Each subsequent audit must cover the period since the end of the period covered by the preceding audit that is accepted by the Department. Waivers of requirement for an annual FSA audit A school may request a waiver of the requirement for an annual audit for up to three years. A proprietary school must have disbursed less than $200,000 in each of the two most recently completed award years to be eligible for the waiver, and the school must also meet the other regulatory conditions in 34 CFR 668.27. A public or private nonprofit institution that expends less than $750,000 in federal funds in a fiscal year is exempt from filing compliance audits after the school gains initial eligibility. If a waiver is approved, at the end of the waiver period, the school must submit a compliance audit covering each individual fiscal year in the waiver period and a financial statement audit for the last year of the waiver period. This exception to the annual audit requirement may not be granted for the award year preceding a school's required recertification.Audits required at end of waiver period The regulations do not waive the requirement that a school audit its administration of the FSA programs; they waive the requirement that these audits be submitted on an annual basis. Therefore, if a school is granted a waiver for three years, when the waiver period expires and the school must submit its next compliance audit, that audit must cover the school's administration of the FSA programs since the end of the period covered by its last submitted compliance audit. The auditor for a proprietary school must audit, and attest to, the school's annual 90/10 determination for each individual year in the waiver period (in accordance with 34 CFR 668.23(d)(4)).Audit submission due dates School's Both audits Period audited fiscal year due (financial and end date compliance) September 30, March 31, October 1, 2015, through 2016 2017 September 30, 2016 December 31, June 30, January 1, 2016, through 2016 2017 December 31, 2016 March 31, September 30, April 1, 2016, through 2017 2017 March 31, 2017 June 30, December 31, July 1, 2016, through 2017 2017 June 30, FSA HB June 20172-78If the Department grants the waiver, the school does not have to submit its compliance or audited financial statement until six months after the end of the third fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the school last submitted a compliance audit and audited financial statement, or the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the school last submitted compliance and financial state - ment audits if the award year in which the school will apply for recertification is part of the third fiscal year. A school's waiver request may include the fiscal year in which that request is made, plus the next two fiscal years. A school remains liable for repaying any FSA funds it improperly expends during the waiver period. A compliance audit is the vehicle for discovering improper expenditures. Therefore, a school will be required to pay any liabilities when the school eventually submits a compliance audit for the fiscal years in which it made improper expenditures.Rescinding the waiver The Department rescinds a waiver if the school: disburses $200,000 or more of FSA program funds for an award year; undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control; or becomes the subject of an emergency action or a limitation suspension, fine, or termination action initiated by the Department or a guaranty agency.Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort HB June 20172-79Effects of waivers\u2014examples Example 1: The school is still required to have its administration of the FSA programs audited for the waiver period. If a school is granted a waiver for three years, when the waiver period expires, the next audit must cover the school's administration of the FSA programs since the end of the period covered by its last submitted compliance audit. For example, if a school's fiscal year coincides with an award year (July 1-June 30) and it submits a compliance audit for its fiscal year that ends on June 30, 2016, and then receives a waiver, its next compliance audit is due six months after the end of its 2018-2019 fiscal year. When it submits that audit, it must cover the 2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019 fiscal years. Example 2: If a school's fiscal year ends June 30, 2016, and the school receives a waiver on May 1, 2016, that includes the 2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019 fiscal years, the next compliance audit is due six months after the end of the school's 2018-2019 fiscal year.Qualifying for and Effects of Waivers Qualifying for a waiver To qualify for a waiver, a school must demonstrate that it: is not a foreign school; disbursed less than $200,000 in FSA program funds during each of the two completed award years prior to the audit period; agrees to keep records relating to each award year in the unaudited period for two years after the end of the regular record retention period for the award year; has participated in the FSA programs under the same ownership for at least three award years preceding the school's waiver request; is financially responsible under the general requirements of financial responsibility and does not rely on the alternative standards and requirements of exceptions to participate in the FSA programs; is not receiving funds under the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment; has not been the subject of a limitation, suspension, fine, or termination proceeding, or emergency action initiated by the Department or a guaranty agency in the three years preceding the school's waiver request; has submitted its compliance audits and audited financial statements for the previous two fiscal years, and no individual audit disclosed liabilities in excess of $10,000; and submits a letter of credit in the amount as determined below, which must remain in effect Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-80STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR FSA AUDITS Audited financial statement requirement A school's audited financial statement must cover the school's most recently completed fiscal year. The Department uses the information in a school's audited financial statement to evaluate the school's status vis- a-vis the financial standards discussed in this chapter. In addition to a school's audited financial statement, the Department may require that the school submit additional information. For example, the Department may require a school to submit or provide access to the auditor's work papers. Also, if the Department finds it necessary to evaluate a particular school's financial condition, the Department can require a school to submit audited financial statements more frequently than once a year. FSA compliance audits Compliance audits must be conducted in accordance with the general standards and the standards for compliance audits contained in the U.S. General Accountability Office's (GAO's) Government Auditing Standards. In addition, the auditor should use the following guidance, based on school type: OMB Circular A-133 for public and private nonprofit schools audited under the Single Audit Act the latest Audit Guide for the FSA programs (see sidebar) for for-profit schools, foreign schools, and third-party servicers In conducting an audit, the auditor may also find it useful to consult the accounting and record keeping guidance in the FSA Handbook and the G5 Users Guide , as applicable. A school (or third-party servicer) may use the same independent auditor or auditing firm for its required nonfederal audit as the one that usually audits its fiscal transactions. To produce unbiased conclusions, the auditor must be independent of those authorizing the expenditure of FSA funds. The Department may require a school to provide a copy of its compliance audit report to guaranty agencies, lenders, state agencies, other federal agencies, or accrediting agencies. Financial statements, accrual basis, and GAAP standards Financial statements must be prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited by an independent auditor in accordance with GAGAS and other guidance contained in OMB Circular A-133, or in the Department's Audit Guide (for FSA school audits).Audit guide (for FSA programs) The official title of the Inspector General's audit guide for the FSA programs is Audits of Federal Student Financial Assistance Programs at Participating Institutions and Institution Servicers. The audit guide is available on the IFAP website ( ifap.ed.gov ) under \"Publications.\" The G5 is available at ( www. g5.gov/ ).Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, June 20172-81Submitting A-133 audits The Form SF-SAC and the Single Audit Reporting packages for fiscal periods ending on or after January 1, 2008, must be submitted online to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse. harvester.census.gov/facweb/ Annual financial statement Section 487(c) of the HEA provides that all schools participating in the Federal Student Aid programs must submit annual financial statements to the Department. This applies to all schools, including nonprofit schools that are otherwise exempt from submitting annual audited financial statements under the A-133 standards. Circular A-133 and the Single Audit Act Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133 was issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act of 1984. The Single Audit Act was amended in 1996\u2014the current requirements are found in Chapter 75 of title 31, U.S. Code . Circular A-133 is titled \"Audits of States, Local Governments, and Nonprofit Organizations \" and is applicable to nonprofit postsecondary schools, states, local governments, and Indian tribal governments. For many schools, this is a combined audit of all the federal programs at that school. OMB circular A-133 is available through the OMB homepage at https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/ whitehouse.gov/files/omb/circulars/A133/ a133.pdfSingle Audit Act (A-133 audit) guidelines Nonprofit and public schools are required to have audits performed under the guidelines of the Single Audit Act. (These audits are also known as \"A-133 audits\" because the audit guidelines are established in OMB Circular A-133). A-133 audits satisfy the Department's audit requirements. A-133 audits have distinct auditing and submission requirements and must be submitted to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse. (A copy of the audit must also be submitted to the Department through the eZ-Audit website.) A school submitting an audit under the guidelines of the Single Audit Act must use the submission deadlines established by the Single Audit Act. Exemptions A school that expends less than $750,000 of federal funds during a fiscal year is exempt from submitting an annual A-133 audit. However, a school that spends less than $750,000 in all federal funds is still required to submit a financial statement to the Department within six months after the close of its fiscal year. The financial statement does not have to be audited by a CPA and may be created as compiled or reviewed statements. If the school has prepared a set of audited financial statements for its own use or for another entity, the school must submit those audited financial statements to the Department no later than six months after the end of the institution's fiscal year. Circular A-133 permits the submission of program-specific audits if an entity expends funds in only one federal program and the program's regulations do not require a financial statement audit. The FSA program regulations require a financial statement audit. Therefore, a school may not submit a program-specific audit to satisfy the Department's audit submission requirements. Circular A-133 also now allows an independent auditor to use professional judgment to determine whether certain federal programs must be included in the scope of an audit. An independent auditor can exclude certain program components, such as FSA program funds, if they fall below a predetermined dollar and risk threshold. The independent auditor must make an annual assessment of the dollar and risk conditions and determine whether such exclusions are appropriate and whether any FSA programs must be included within the scope of the audit. You can find additional information on this topic in the latest Compliance Supplement to Circular A-133.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA 20172-82FSA consolidated statements In some cases, a school's relationship with another entity may cause the Department to require a school to submit additional financial statements both of the school and the entity, such as audited consolidated financial statements; audited full consolidated financial statements; audited combined financial statements; or, under certain circumstances, audited financial statements of one or more related parties. This occurs when the Department determines that the activities or financial health of another entity may impact the school's total financial health. So that the Department can make this determination, a school must include in its audited financial statements a detailed description of related entities based on the definition of a related entity in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 57 . In addition, the description must include all related parties and a level of detail that would enable the Department to easily identify them. This information may include but is not limited to the name, location, and description of the related entity, including the nature and amount of any transaction between the entity and the school, financial or otherwise, regardless of when it occurred. 90/10 REVENUE TEST A proprietary school must disclose the percentage of its revenues derived from the FSA programs that the school received during the fiscal year covered by the audit as a footnote to its audited financial statements. The school must also report in the footnote the dollar amount of the numerator and denominator of its 90/10 ratio as well as the individual revenue amounts identified in section 2 of appendix C to subpart B of part 668 (see sidebar). A school that converts from a for-profit to a nonprofit status must report its compliance with the 90/10 revenue test for the first year after its conversion. A school changing from for-profit to nonprofit must continue to file this report for the first year of its nonprofit status. To be eligible for FSA participation, a proprietary school must derive at least 10% of its revenues for each fiscal year from sources other than the FSA programs, or be subject to sanctions. The calculation of this percentage and the funds included must be arrived at using the cash basis of accounting. A school must determine its revenue percentages using the formula described on the following pages each fiscal year.90/10 Rule Guidance on footnote disclosures can be found in the FSA Audit Guide , in 34 CFR 668.23(d)(4), and in appropriate accounting references. See DCL GEN-08-12 for changes made by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (section 493), moving 90/10 rule to the Program Participation Agreement (from the definition of a proprietary institution of higher education). Earlier guidance on 90/10 and institutional loans and scholarships can be found in Dear Partner Letter GEN-99-33 and Dear CPA Letters CPA-99-01 and CPA-99-02. HEA section 487 34 CFR 668.14(b)(16) 34 CFR 668.28 Notifying ED\u201490/10 A school must send notice of its failure to satisfy the 90/10 Rule to the Department by U.S. mail or commercial overnight to the following address: U.S. Department of Education, Federal Student Aid School Eligibility Service Group 830 First Street, NE Washington, DC 20202-5403 General e-mail: Caseteams@ed.gov Contact phone numbers for the teams are provided at ( www.eligcert.ed.gov/ ).Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, DCL FSA HB June 20172-83Proprietary schools have 45 days after their most recent fiscal year has ended to report to the Department if they did not satisfy the 90/10 Rule for that period. If a school fails to satisfy the 90/10 rule for any fiscal year, it be - comes provisionally certified for up to two fiscal years after the fiscal year it failed to satisfy the revenue requirement. (Among other factors, the provisional certification is limited by the ex - piration date of the school's program participation agreement.) If a school fails to satisfy the 90/10 rule for two consecutive fiscal years, it loses its eligibility to participate in the FSA pro - grams for at least two fiscal years. If the school loses eligibility, it must immediately stop awarding FSA funds and follow the closeout procedures described in Chapter 8 . Volume 2\u2014School Operations 2017-2018CFR revenues for the 90/10 rule Section 668.28(a) of the Student Assistance General Provisions provides the following explanation of how to count revenue from ... (3) Revenue generated from programs and activities. The institution must consider as revenue only those funds it generates from\u2014 (i) Tuition, fees, and other institutional charges for students enrolled in eligible programs as defined in \u00a7668.8; (ii) Activities conducted by the institution that are necessary for the education and training of its students provided those activities are\u2014 (A) Conducted on campus or at a facility under the institution's control; (B) Performed under the supervision of a member of the institution's faculty; and (C) Required to be performed by all students in a specific educational program at the institution; and (iii) Funds paid by a student, or on behalf of a student by a party other than the institution, for an education or training program that is not eligible under \u00a7668.8 if the program\u2014 (A) Is approved or licensed by the appropriate state agency; (B) Is accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary under 34 CFR part 602; (C) Provides an industry-recognized credential or certification, or prepares students to take an examination for an industry-recognized credential or certification issued by an independent third party; (D) Provides training needed for students to maintain state licensing requirements; or (E) Provides training needed for students to meet additional licensing requirements for specialized training for practitioners that already meet the general licensing requirements in that field. (4) Application of funds. The institution must presume that any Title IV, HEA program funds it disburses, or delivers, to or on behalf of a student will be used to pay the student's tuition, fees, or institutional charges, regardless of whether the institution credits the funds to the student's account or pays the funds directly to the student, except to the extent that the student's tuition, fees, or other charges are satisfied by\u2014 (i) Grant funds provided by non-federal public agencies or private sources independent of the institution; (ii) Funds provided under a contractual arrangement with a federal, state, or local government agency for the purpose of providing job training to low-income individuals who need that training; (iii) Funds used by a student from a savings plan for educational expenses established by or on behalf of the student if the saving plan qualifies for special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or (iv) Institutional scholarships that meet the requirements in paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section.(5) Revenue generated from institutional aid. The institution must include the following institutional aid as revenue: (i) For loans made to students and credited in full to the students' accounts at the institution on or after July 1, 2008, and prior to July 1, 2012, include as revenue the net present value of the loans made to students during the fiscal year, as calculated under paragraph (b) of this section, if the loans\u2014 (A) Are bona fide as evidenced by standalone repayment agreements between the students and the institution that are enforceable promissory notes; (B) Are issued at intervals related to the institution's enrollment periods; (C) Are subject to regular loan repayments and collections by the institution; and (D) Are separate from the enrollment contracts signed by the students. [For rules on calculating the net present value of these loans, see 34 CFR 668.28(b) and Appendix C to Subpart B.] (ii) For loans made to students before July 1, 2008, include as revenue only the amount of payments made on those loans that the institution received during the fiscal year. (iii) For loans made to students on or after July 1, 2012, include as revenue only the amount of payments made on those loans that the institution received during the fiscal year. (iv) For scholarships provided by the institution in the form of monetary aid or tuition discount and based on the academic achievement or financial need of its students, include as revenue the amount disbursed to students during the fiscal year. The scholarships must be disbursed from an established restricted account and only to the extent that the funds in that account represent designated funds from an outside source or income earned on those funds. ... (7) Funds excluded from revenues. For the fiscal year, the institution does not include\u2014 (i) The amount of Federal Work-Study (FWS) wages paid directly to the student. However, if the institution credits the student's account with FWS funds, those funds are included as revenue; (ii) The amount of funds received by the institution from a state under the LEAP , SLEAP , or GAP programs; (iii) The amount of institutional funds used to match Title IV, HEA program funds; (iv) The amount of Title IV, HEA program funds refunded or returned under \u00a7668.22. If any funds from the loan disbursement used in the return calculation under \u00a7668.22 were counted as non-title IV revenue under paragraph (a) (6) of this section, the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds refunded or returned under \u00a7668.22 is considered to consist of pre-ECASLA loan amounts and loan amounts in excess of the loan limits prior to ECASLA in the same proportion to the loan disbursement; orChapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, HB June 20172-85Other 90/10 guidance Cash basis of accounting Except for institutional loans made to students under 34 CFR 668.28(a)(5)(i), a proprietary school must use the cash basis of accounting in calculating its revenue percentage under the 90/10 Rule. Under the cash basis of accounting, revenue is recognized when received rather than when it is earned. Revenue For the purpose of calculating the qualifying percentages under the 90/10 Rule, revenue is an inflow or other enhancement of assets to an entity, or a reduction of its liabilities resulting from the delivery or production of goods or services. A school may recognize revenue only when the school receives cash, i.e., when there is an inflow of cash. As a result, in order for a school to recognize revenue under the cash basis of accounting, that revenue must represent cash received from a source outside the institution. Tuition waivers Institutional grants in the form of tuition waivers do not count as revenue because no new revenue is generated. Similarly, internal transfers of cash among accounts are not considered revenue because they are not an inflow of cash to the school. Institutional scholarships are not revenues generated by the school unless they are donated by an unrelated or outside party. An exception is permitted for schools to use donations from a related party to create restricted accounts for institutional scholarships, but only the amount earned on the restricted account and used for scholarships would count as revenue in the denominator of the calculation. Funds held as credit balances in institutional accounts cannot be counted in the 90/10 formula. However, once funds held as credit balances are used to satisfy institutional charges, they would be counted in both the numerator and the denominator of the formula.Revenues from loans When a school makes a loan to a student, it does not receive cash from an outside source. Accordingly, cash revenue from institutional loans is recognized only when those loans are repaid, because that is when there is an inflow of cash from an outside source. Loan proceeds from institutional loans that were disbursed to students may not be counted in the denominator of the fraction, because these proceeds neither generate nor represent actual inflows of cash. The school may include only loan repayments it received during the appropriate fiscal year for previously disbursed institutional loans. Loans made by a private lender that are in any manner guaranteed by the school are known as recourse loans. The proceeds from recourse loans may be included in the denominator of an institution's 90/10 calculation for the fiscal year in which the revenues were received, provided that the institution's reported revenues are also reduced by the amount of recourse loan payments made to recourse loan holders during that fiscal year. Note that recourse loan payments may be for recourse loans that were made in a prior fiscal year. Under the cash basis of accounting, the reductions to total revenues in the denominator of the 90/10 calculation are reported in the fiscal year when the payments are made. The nonrecourse portion of a partial recourse loan may be included in a 90/10 calculation. In order to include a partial recourse loan in a 90/10 calculation, the contract must identify the percentage of the sale that is nonrecourse; only that percentage may be included. Furthermore, no after-the-fact adjustments may be provided for. Revenue generated from the sale of nonrecourse institutional loans to an unrelated third party may be counted as revenue in the denominator of the 90/10 calculation to the extent that the revenues represent actual proceeds from the sale. The sale of institutional loan receivables is distinguishable from the sale of a school's other assets because receivables from institutional loans are produced by transactions that generate tuition revenue. Tuition revenue represents income from the major service provided by a school. That would not be true in the case of the sale of other school assets. (v) The amount the student is charged for books, supplies, and equipment unless the institution includes that amount as tuition, fees, or other institutional charges.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-86AUDIT AND AUDIT REVIEW PROCESS Having the audit performed The school or servicer must make its program and fiscal records, as well as individual student records, available to the auditor. (Required recordkeeping is discussed in Chapter 7 .) Both the financial aid and business offices should be aware of the dates the auditors will be at the school, and make sure that someone is on hand to provide requested documents and answer questions during that period. At the end of the on-site review, the auditor conducts an exit interview. At a school, this exit interview is usually conducted with the personnel from the school's financial aid and other relevant offices. The exit interview is not only an opportunity for the auditor to suggest improvements in procedures, but it also gives the school or servicer a chance to discuss the draft report and review any discrepancies cited in the report. The exit interview is a good time to resolve any disagreements before the final report is prepared. The final report is prepared by the auditor and submitted to the school or servicer. Review of FSA audit submissions The Department reviews the audit report for format and completeness and to ensure that it complies with the government's auditing standards. We will use the general information to make an initial determination of whether the audits are materially complete and conducted in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Based on the financial data, we will also make a preliminary determination as to whether your school is financially responsible with respect to the financial responsibility ratios, or in the case of a change in ownership resulting in a change in control, whether the school satisfies the financial ratio requirements (discussed later in this chapter). Later, the Department will review submissions to determine whether the school must provide additional information or ED should take further action. Based on the audit findings and the school's or servicer's written explanation, the Department will determine if any funds were spent improperly. Unless the school or servicer has properly appealed the decision, the school or servicer must repay any improperly spent funds within 45 days.Use of eZ-Audit required Schools are required to submit their compliance audits, audited financial statements, and letters confirming their status as public schools through the Department's eZ-Audit Electronic Financial Reporting System. This requirement applies to any compliance audits or financial statements required under 34 CFR 600.20(a) or (b) to begin or continue participating in the FSA programs, any financial statements required due to a change in ownership resulting in a change in control as provided under 34 CFR 600.20(g), any compliance audits and financial statements required annually under 34 CFR 668.23, and any compliance audits and financial statements required when a school ceases to participate in the FSA programs as provided under 34 CFR June 20172-87eZ-Audit The eZ-Audit website provides a paperless single point of submission for financial statements and audits (i.e., compliance reports). eZ-Audit provides automatic error checking as you enter the data and before submission. In addition, it gives you instant acknowledgment of receipt. All schools that participate in the FSA programs must use eZ-Audit to submit financial statements and compliance audits (including copies of the A-133 reports that nonprofit and public institutions file with the Federal Audit Clearinghouse). Nonprofit and public institutions are still required to submit their A-133 audits in writing to the federal clearinghouse. The eZ-Audit process To access the eZ-Audit website, you must be a registered user. Each school must select an eZ-Audit institution administrator who will be responsible for managing your school's access to the eZ-Audit website. This institution administrator will receive the user name and password necessary for your school's access and will be responsible for granting access to others you name as additional users. Each registered user must sign and retain the eZ-Audit rules of behavior. For registration instructions and to download the rules of behavior, please visit ( www.ezaudit.ed.gov ). Once you have obtained your school ID, you will access the appropriate page on the audit website and 1. enter general information about your school's compliance audit and financial statement, 2. enter specific financial data directly from the audited financial statement, and 3. attach authentic electronic copies of the audit originals. After you have entered the required information, you must attach a copy of the audit prepared and signed by the independent auditor. The copy must be in a non-editable, portable document format (PDF) created using Adobe Acrobat version 5.0 or higher.Cooperation with audit and review process Throughout the audit process, and for other examinations such as program reviews and state reviews, the school or servicer is required to cooperate fully with its independent auditor, the Department and its Inspector General, the Comptroller General of the United States, its accrediting agency, and the appropriate guaranty agency.Access to records Once the audit is complete, the school or servicer must give the Department and the OIG access to all records and documents needed to review the audit. A school that uses a third-party servicer must give the Department and the OIG access to all records and documents needed to review a third-party servicer's compliance or financial statement audit. In addition, the school's or servicer's contract with the auditor must specify that the auditor will give the Department and the OIG access to the records and documents related to the audit, including work papers. Cooperation includes providing timely and reasonable access to records (including computer records) for examination and copying and to personnel for the purpose of obtaining relevant information. Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations apply to third-party servicers. If a servicer contracts with several FSA schools, a single compliance audit can be performed that covers its administrative services for all schools. If a servicer contracts with only one FSA school and that school's own audit sufficiently covers the functions performed by the servicer, the servicer does not have to submit a compliance audit. A servicer must submit its compliance audit within six months after the last day of the servicer's fiscal year. The Department may require a servicer to provide a copy of its compliance audit report to guaranty agencies, lenders, state agencies, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or accrediting agencies. In addition to submitting a compliance audit, a servicer that enters into a contract with a lender or guaranty agency to administer any aspect of the lender's or guaranty agency's programs must submit annually audited financial statements. The financial statements must be prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP) and audited by an independent auditor in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards ( GAGAS) and any other guidance contained in audit guides issued by the Department's Office of the Inspector General. If the Department determines that, based on audit findings and responses, a third-party servicer owes a liability for its administration of the FSA programs, the servicer must notify each school with which it has a contract of the liability. Generally, unless they submit an appeal, schools and servicers owing liabilities must repay those liabilities within 45 days of being notified by the Department. As noted earlier, a school may never use a third-party servicer's audit in place of its own required audit because the school is ultimately liable for its own violations as well as those incurred by its third-party servicers. (See Chapter 3 for more information on third-party servicers.)Third-party servicers Guidance for audits of third-party servicers is found in the January 2000 Department of Education's \"Audit Guide, Audits of Federal Student Aid Programs at Participating Institutions and Institution Servicers.\" 34 CFR 668.23(a)(3) and (c) 34 CFR 668.23(d)(4) Failure to submit audits The Department is aware that some third-party servicers have told schools not to report them as servicers, creating confusion about who should be reported. Also, some servicers have not filed annual compliance audits because they incorrectly determined that they don't meet the regulatory definition of a third-party servicer or because of the omission of specific audit procedures in the OIG Audit Guide for some services or functions performed on behalf of colleges. See DCL GEN-15-01 for clarification of the third-party servicer requirements in the regulations.

Higher Education Act 34 CFR 668 Subpart LDEMONSTRATING FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY To participate in the FSA programs, a school must demonstrate that it is financially responsible. To provide the Department with the information necessary to evaluate a school's financial responsibility, schools are required to submit financial information to the Department every year. A school must provide this financial information in the form of an audited financial statement as part of a combined submission that also includes the school's compliance audit. For-profit schools have six months from the end of the schools' fiscal year to provide the combined submission; other schools have nine months. What follows is an overview of the financial responsibility standards. Schools should refer to Subpart L of the Student Assistance General Provisions for complete information. The Department determines whether a school is financially responsible based on the school's ability to provide the services described in its official publications and statements, properly administer the FSA programs in which the school participates, and meet all of its financial obligations. The financial responsibility standards can be divided into two categories: (1) general standards, which are the basic standards used to evaluate a school's financial health, and (2) performance and affiliation standards, which are standards used to evaluate a school's past performance and to evaluate individuals affiliated with the school. Financial responsibility for public schools A public school is financially responsible if its debts and liabilities are backed by the full faith and credit of the state or another government entity. The Department considers a public school to have that backing if the school notifies the Department that it is designated as a public school by the state, local, or municipal government entity, tribal authority, or other government entity that has the legal authority to make that designation. The school must also provide the Department with a letter from an official of the appropriate government entity confirming the school's status as a public school. A letter from a government entity may include a confirmation of public school status for more than one school under that government's purview. The letter is a one-time submission and should be submitted as a separate document. Public schools also must meet the past performance and affiliation standards discussed later and must submit financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and prepared on the accrual basis. Tuition recovery funds When a state submits a tuition recovery fund for approval by the Department, the Department will consider the extent to which the recovery fund: provides returns to both in-state and out-of-state students; complies with FSA requirements for the order of return of funds to sources of assistance; and is replenished if any claims arise that deplete the fund.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-90Financial responsibility for proprietary or private nonprofit schools A proprietary or private nonprofit school is financially responsible if the Department determines that the school has a composite score of at least 1.5; the school has sufficient cash reserves to make the required refunds, including the return of Title IV funds (these require - ments are known as the refund reserve standards); the school is meeting all of its financial obligations, including making required refunds, including the return of Title IV funds and making repayments to cover FSA program debts and li - abilities; and the school is current in its debt payments. These requirements are discussed in more detail in the next section. Even if a school meets all of the general requirements, the Department does not consider the school to be financially responsible if\u2014 in the school's audited financial statement the opinion ex - pressed by the auditor was adverse, qualified, or disclaimed, or the auditor expressed doubt about the continued existence of the school as a going concern (unless the Department deter - mines that a qualified or disclaimed opinion does not have a significant bearing on the school's financial condition), or the school violated one of the past performance requirements discussed later in this chapter.Deposit to operating account or separate federal bank account A school that maintains a separate federal bank account must deposit to that account, or transfer from its operating account to its federal account, the amount of unearned program funds, as determined under the Return of Title IV funds regulations. The date the school makes that deposit or transfer is the date used to determine whether the school returned the funds within the 45-day time frame permitted in the regulations. Unless the Department requires a school to use a separate account, the school may use its operating account for FSA purposes. In this case the school must designate that account as its federal bank account and have an auditable system of records showing that the funds have been allocated properly and returned in a timely manner. If there is no clear audit trail, the Department can require the school to begin maintaining FSA funds in a separate bank account. See the sections on accounting for funds and depository accounts in Chapter 1 of Volume 4 . 34 CFR 668.163(a)Change in ownership When a change in ownership occurs, the Department applies the standards in 34 CFR 668.15. Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, DCL FSA HB June 20172-91Additional information on composite scores For complete information on the calculation of the composite score, schools should refer to Appendices A and B of Subpart L in the General Provisions regulations. The Department has issued guidance on the treatment of long-term and other debt in calculating these ratios. The most recent can be found in DCL GEN-03-08. STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Composite score The composite score standard combines different measures of fundamental elements of financial health to yield a single measure of a school's overall financial health. This method allows financial strength in one area to make up for financial weakness in another area and gives an equitable measure of the financial health of schools of different sizes. The composite score methodology takes into account the differences between proprietary schools and private nonprofit schools. The variance takes into account the accounting differences between these sectors of postsecondary schools. However, the basic steps used to arrive at the composite score are the same. These steps are described later in this section. Refund reserve standards One of the standards that a school must satisfy to be considered financially responsible is that it must have sufficient cash reserves to return FSA funds when a student withdraws. A school is considered to have sufficient cash reserves if it is located in a state that has an ED-approved tuition recovery fund and the school contributes to that fund, or for its two most recently completed fiscal years, the school made all required returns in a timely manner (see Volume 5, Chapter 2 for more information on returns, including timely payment). Returning funds in a timely manner Unearned funds must be returned no later than 45 days after the date of the school's determination that the student withdrew. ED considers the school to have returned funds, depending upon the method it uses to return them. Specifically, the regulations provide that a school has returned funds when it has deposited or transferred the funds into the bank account it maintains for federal funds (see sidebar) no later than 45 days after the date it determines that the student withdrew, initiated an electronic funds transfer (EFT) no later than 45 days after the date it determines that the student withdrew, or issued a check no later than 45 days (as supported by the school's records) after the date it determines that the student withdrew. If a check is used to return unearned funds, the Department requires that the check be endorsed by ED no later than 60 days after the school's determination that a student withdrew to be considered a timely return.Return of Title IV funds The requirements for return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw from the educational program are described in Volume 5 . Making new awards with returned funds After a school has returned unearned funds to its federal account, provided those funds were originally received from the Department or from an FFEL lender under a process that allows the school to reuse the unearned funds, the school can use the funds to make disbursements to other eligible students.Financial responsibility Treatment of long-term debt DCL GEN 03-08, July 2003 34 CFR 668, Subpart L, Appendices A and B Ratios 34 CFR 668.172 Refund reserve standards 34 CFR 668.173 Returning funds in a timely manner 34 20172-92Compliance thresholds for timely return of funds The Department provides for a small margin of error in determining that a school has paid all required refunds and returns on time. The Department considers a school to have paid returns in a timely manner if\u2014 there is less than a 5% error rate in a sample of returns (com - posed of students for whom the school was required to return unearned funds) examined in a compliance audit, an audit con - ducted by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), or a pro - gram review conducted by the Department or guaranty agency, or there are no more than two late returns in the sample (regard - less of the number or percentage of late returns in the sample). In addition, if the reviewer or auditor finds a material weakness or reportable condition in the school's report on internal controls relating to the return of unearned Title IV aid, the Department considers the school to have not paid returns in a timely manner. Letter of credit required when funds are not returned in a timely manner Public schools and schools covered by a state tuition recovery fund that has been approved by the Department are not subject to the letter of credit requirements. If any other school exceeds the compliance thresholds in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years, the school must submit an irrevocable letter of credit acceptable and payable to the Department. The letter of credit must be equal to 25% of the returns the school made or should have made during its most recently completed fiscal year. A school that is required to submit a letter of credit must do so no later than 30 days after the earlier of the date that: the school is required to submit its compliance audit; the OIG issues a final audit report; the designated department official issues a final program review determination; the Department issues a preliminary program review report or draft audit report, or a guaranty agency issues a preliminary re - port showing that the school did not return unearned funds for more than 10% of the sampled students; or ED sends a written notice to the school requesting the letter of credit that explains why the school has failed to return un - earned funds in a timely manner.Address for Letters of Credit Letters of credit are submitted to: Director Performance Improvement & Procedures U.S. Department of Education Federal Student Aid 830 First Street, NE UCP-3, MS 5435 Washington, DC 20002-8019Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-93If the finding in the preliminary report is that the school did not return unearned funds in a timely manner for 10% or fewer of the sampled students, a school would generally be required to submit the letter of credit only if the final report shows that the school did not return unearned funds in a timely manner for 5% or more of all the students in the sample. If the final report indicates that a letter of credit is required, the school would have to submit it no later than 30 days after the final report is issued. Exceptions to the letter of credit requirement A school is not required to submit a letter of credit of less than $5,000. However, to meet the reserve requirement, such a school would need to demonstrate that it has available at all times cash reserves of at least $5,000 to make required returns. In addition, a school may delay submitting a letter of credit while it asks for reconsideration of a finding that it failed to return unearned FSA funds in a timely manner. A school may request that the Department reconsider its finding if the school submits documents showing that the unearned FSA funds were not returned in a timely manner solely because of exceptional circumstances beyond the school's control and that the school would not have exceeded the ap - plicable threshold had it not been for the exceptional circum - stances; or it did not fail to make timely returns. A school that submits an appeal, together with all required supporting documents, by the date the letter of credit would be due is not required to submit a letter of credit unless the Department notifies the school that its request has been denied. Current in debt payments A school is not current in its debt payments if it is in violation of any existing loan agreement at its fiscal year end, as disclosed in a note to its audited financial statements or audit opinion, or it fails to make a payment in accordance with existing debt ob - ligations for more than 120 days, and at least one creditor has filed suit to recover funds under those obligations. Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-94The first step in calculating a school's composite score is to determine the school's primary reserve, equity, and net income ratios by using information from the school's audited financial statement. These ratios take into account the total financial resources of the school. The Primary Reserve Ratio represents a measure of a school's viability and liquidity. The Equity Ratio represents a measure of a school's capital resources and its ability to borrow. The Net Income Ratio represents a measure of a school's profitability. Upon review, some items from a school's audited financial statement may be excluded from the calculation of the ratios. For example, the Department may exclude the effects of questionable accounting treatments, such as excessive capitalization of marketing costs, from the ratio calculations. (See the regulatory exclusions below.) All long-term debt obtained for the school's purposes may be included for purposes of the Primary Reserve Ratio calculation. However, it is important to note that the overall level of debt obtained for long-term purposes that can be included in the numerator of the Primary Reserve Ratio is limited under the regulations. It cannot exceed the amount of the school's net property, plant, and equipment. A strength factor score is then calculated for each ratio using equations established by the Department. A strength factor score reflects a school's relative strength or weakness in a fundamental element of financial health, as measured by the ratios. Specifically, the strength factor scores reflect the extent to which a school has the financial resources to: 1) replace existing technology with newer technology; 2) replace physical capital that wears out over time; 3) recruit, retain, and retrain faculty and staff (human capital); and 4) develop new programs. A weighting percentage is applied to each strength factor score to obtain a weighted score for each ratio. The weighting percentages reflect the relative importance that each fundamental element has for a school in a particular sector (proprietary or private nonprofit). The sum of the weighted scores equals the school's composite score. Because the weighted scores reflect the strengths and weaknesses represented by the ratios and take into account the importance of those strengths and weaknesses, a strength in the weighted score of one ratio may compensate for a weakness in the weighted score of another ratio. Once a composite score is calculated, it is measured along a common scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0 as indicated in the diagram on page 75. This scale reflects the probability a school will be able to continue operations and meet its obligations to students and the Department.Calculating a composite score Excluded items. In calculating an institution's ratios, the Secretary\u2014 (1) Generally excludes extraordinary gains or losses, income or losses from discontinued operations, prior period adjustments, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, and the effect of changes in accounting estimates; (2) May include or exclude the effects of questionable accounting treatments, such as excessive capitalization of marketing costs; (3) Excludes all unsecured or uncollateralized related- party receivables; (4) Excludes all intangible assets defined as intangible in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and(5) Excludes from the ratio calculations federal funds provided to an institution by the Secretary under program authorized by the HEA only if\u2014 (i) In the notes to the institution's audited financial statement, or as a separate attestation, the auditor discloses by name and Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number the amount of HEA program funds reported as expenses in the Statement of Activities for the fiscal year covered by that audit or attestation; and (ii) The institution's composite score, as determined by the Secretary, is less than 1.5 before the reported expenses arising from those HEA funds are excluded from the ratio calculations. 34 CFR 172(c)Exclusions Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, DCL FSA HB June 20172-95Example: Calculation of a composite score for a proprietary institution* Calculation of Ratios Primary Reserve = = = 0.0800 Ratio Equity Ratio = = = 0.3320 Net Income = = = 0.0509 Ratio Calculation of Strength Factor Score Primary Reserve Strength Factor Score = 20 x Primary Reserve Ratio 20 x 0.0800 = 1.6000 Equity Strength Factor Score = 6 x Equity Ratio 6 x 0.3320 = 1.9920 Net Income Strength Factor Score = 1 + (33.3 x Net Income Ratio) 1 + (33.3 x 0.0509) = 2.6950 Calculation of Weighted Score Primary Reserve Weighted Score = 30% x Primary Reserve Strength Factor Score 0.30 x 1.6000 = 0.4800 Equity Weighted Score = 40% x Equity Strength Factor Score 0.40 x 1.9920 = 0.7968 Net Income Weighted Score = 30% x Net Income Strength Factor Score 0.30 x 2.698 = 0.8094 Composite Score Sum of All Weighted Scores 0.4800 + 0.7968 + 0.8094 = 2.0862 rounded to 2.1 * The definition of terms used in the ratios and the applicable strength factor algorithms and weighting percentages are found in the Student Assistance General Provisions (regulations) (34 CFR 668) Subpart L, Appendix A for proprietary schools and Appendix B for private nonprofit schools.Composite score scale 1.5 to 3.0 Financially responsible without further oversight. 1.0 to 1.4 In the \"Zone. \" The school is considered financially responsible, but additional oversight is required. -1.0 to 0.9 Not financially responsible. The school must submit a letter of credit of at least 50% of its FSA funding. The school may be permitted to participate under provisional certification with a smaller letter of credit\u2014with a minimum of 10% of its FSA funding and additional oversight.1.5 - 3.0-1.0 - 0.9 1.0 - 1.4 Adjusted equity Total expenses Modified equity Modified Assets Income before taxes Total revenues$760,000 $9,500,000 standards and requirements 34 CFR 668.175ALTERNATIVES TO THE GENERAL FINANCIAL STANDARDS If a school does not meet the general standards for financial responsibility, the Department may still consider the school to be financially responsible or may allow the school to participate under provisional certification if the school qualifies for an alternative standard. If the Department determines that a school that does not meet one or more of the general standards and does not qualify for an alternative, the Department may initiate a limitation, suspension, or termination action against the school (see Chapter 8 for more information on corrective actions and sanctions). Letter of credit alternative for new schools A new school (a school that seeks to participate in the FSA programs for the first time) that does not meet the composite score standard (i.e., has a composite score of less than 1.5) but meets all other standards may demonstrate financial responsibility by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit to the Department. The letter of credit must be acceptable and payable to the Department and equal to at least 50% of the FSA program funds that the Department determines that the school will receive during its initial year of participation. Letter of credit alternative for participating schools A participating proprietary or private nonprofit school that fails to meet one or more of the general standards or is not financially responsible because it has an adverse audit opinion may demonstrate financial responsibility by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit to the Department. The letter must be acceptable and payable to the Department and equal to at least 50% of the FSA program funds the school received during its most recently completed fiscal year. The school is then considered to be financially responsible.Provisional certification 34 CFR 668.13Chapter 4\u2014Audits, FSA HB June 20172-97Zone alternative A participating school that fails to meet the composite score standard (i.e., has a composite score of less than 1.5) but meets all other standards may demonstrate financial responsibility for up to three consecutive fiscal years if the Department determines that the school's composite score is equal to 1.0 to 1.4 for each of those years and the school meets specific monitoring requirements. This alternative gives a school the opportunity to improve its financial condition over time without requiring the school to post a letter of credit or participate under provisional certification. Under the zone alternative, a school's operations, including its administration of the FSA programs, are monitored more closely. If a school does not score at least 1.0 in one of the three subsequent fiscal years or does not improve its financial condition to attain a composite score of at least 1.5 by the end of the three-year period, the school must satisfy another alternative standard to continue participating. In addition, if a school fails to comply with the information reporting or payment method requirements, the Department may determine that the school no longer qualifies under this alternative. Under the zone alternative, a school must request and receive funds under the cash monitoring or reimbursement payment methods, as specified by the Depart - ment (see Volume 4, Chapter 2 ); must provide timely information regarding certain oversight and financial events (see the sidebar); may be required to submit its financial statement and compli - ance audit earlier than normally required (see the discussion of audit submission deadlines earlier in this chapter); and may be required to provide information about its current op - erations and future plans. The school must also require its auditor to express an opinion, as part of the school's compliance audit, on the school's compliance with the requirements of the zone alternative, including the school's administration of the payment method under which the school received and disbursed FSA program funds. Information to be provided under the zone alternative The school must provide timely information regarding any of the following oversight and financial events: Any adverse action, including a probation or similar action, taken against the school by its accrediting agency; Any event that causes the school, or related entity as defined in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 57 , to realize any liability that was noted as a contingent liability in the institution's or related entity's most recent audited financial statement; Any violation by the school of any loan agreement; Any failure of the school to make a payment in accordance with its debt obligations that results in a creditor filing suit to recover funds under those obligations; Any withdrawal of owner's equity from the school by any means, including declaring a dividend; or Any extraordinary losses, as defined according to Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 30. The school may also be required to: submit its financial statement and compliance audits earlier than the time specified under 34 CFR 668.23(a)(4); and provide information about its current operations and future plans. 34 CFR 668.175(d)(2)Volume 2\u2014School June 20172-98Provisional certification for schools not meeting standards The Department may permit a participating proprietary or private nonprofit school to participate under provisional certification for up to three years if the school is not financially responsible because it does not satisfy one or more of the general standards, has an unacceptable audit opinion, or has a past performance problem that has been resolved. If the Department permits a school to participate under provisional certification, it will require the school to submit a letter of credit, payable and acceptable to the De - partment, for a percentage (10%-100%) of the FSA program funds received by the school during its most recent fiscal year; and to demonstrate that it has met all of its financial obligations and was current on debt payments for its two most recent fiscal years. Moreover, the school must comply with the requirement under the zone alternative that it provide timely information regarding certain oversight and financial events. Finally, a school that is required to post a letter of credit will be placed on heightened cash monitoring or reimbursement. If a school is still not financially responsible at the end of a period of provisional certification, the Department may again permit provisional certification. However, the Department may require the school or persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the school to submit financial guarantees to the Department to satisfy any potential liabilities arising from the school's FSA program participation. The same persons may be required to agree to be jointly and severally liable for any FSA program liabilities. The Department is not required to offer provisional certification to a school. It is an alternative that the Department may choose to offer in exceptional circumstances.Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort Default RatesCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-99Provisional certification for schools where persons or entities owe liabilities If a school is not financially responsible because the persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the school owe an FSA program liability, the Department may permit the school to participate under provisional certification if: the persons or entities that owe the liability repay or enter into an agreement with the Department to repay the liability (or the school assumes the liability and repays or enters into an agree - ment to repay the liability); the school meets all the general standards of financial respon - sibility and demonstrates that it has met all of its financial ob - ligations and was current on its debt payments for its two most recent fiscal years; and the school submits to the Department a letter of credit, payable and acceptable to the Department, for an amount determined by the Department (at least 10% of the FSA program funds re - ceived by the school during its most recent fiscal year). The school also must comply with the requirements under the zone alternative. In addition, the Department may require the school or persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the school to submit financial guarantees to the Department to satisfy any potential liabilities arising from the school's FSA program participation. The same persons may be required to agree to be jointly and severally liable for any FSA program performance 34 CFR 668.174 Notifying the Department of change of control A school must report any changes of control under which a person acquires the ability to affect substantially the actions of the school. Such changes in control trigger a review to determine if the school is financially responsible (see Chapter 5 ).PAST PERFORMANCE AND AFFILIATION STANDARDS In addition to meeting the numeric standards of financial responsibility and fulfilling all its financial obligations, a school must demonstrate that it properly administers the FSA programs in which it participates. Past actions of the school or individuals affiliated with the school may reveal mismanagement of FSA program funds, thereby demonstrating that a school is not financially responsible. Therefore, in evaluating the way a school administers the FSA programs, the Department considers the past performance of both the school and individuals affiliated with the school. Past performance of a school A school is not financially responsible if it in the last five years, has been subject to a limitation, suspen - sion, or termination action or has entered into an agreement to resolve a limitation, suspension, or termination action initiated by the Department or a guaranty agency; in either of its two most recent FSA program reviews or audits, has had findings for the current fiscal year or two preceding fis - cal years that required repayment of more than 5% of the FSA program funds received by the school; has been cited during the last five years for failing to submit au - dits as required; or has failed to satisfactorily resolve any compliance issues identified in program reviews or audit reports, upheld in a final decision of the Department. Past performance of persons affiliated with a school A school is not financially responsible if any person who exercises substantial control over the school (or any members of the person's family alone or together) owes a liability for an FSA program violation or has ever exercised substantial control over another school (or a third-party servicer) that owes a liability for an FSA program violation, unless that person, family member, school, or servicer demonstrates that the liability is being repaid in accordance with an agreement with the Department.Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort Default RatesCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-101The Department may consider a school that does not meet this requirement to be financially responsible if the school notifies the Department that the individual repaid to the De - partment an acceptable portion of the liability, in accordance with the regulations; notifies the Department that the liability is currently being re - paid in accordance with a written agreement with the Depart - ment; or demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Department: (1) why the person who exercises substantial control should nevertheless be considered to lack that control, or (2) why the person who exercises substantial control and each member of that person's family does not or did not exercise substantial control over the school or servicer that owes the liability. LIMITATIONS An otherwise eligible institution becomes an ineligible institution if the school exceeds the 50% limit on students without a high school diploma or equivalent, the incarcerated student limitation (25%), or the correspondence course limitation (50%) or the correspon - dence student limitation (50%). A school must calculate these percentages to demonstrate compliance with a requirement or to demonstrate eligibility for a limitation waiver. For each of the tests, the calculation performed by the school must be attested to by the independent auditor who prepares the school's audited financial statement or its FSA compliance audit. If a school's initial or previous calculation was in error, the auditor's report must be part of the audit workpapers and must include a recalculation. The auditor's attestation report must indicate whether the school's determinations (including any relevant waiver or exception) are accurate. For each of the limitation requirements, the school must notify the Department (via Section G of the E-App) of the school's failure to meet a requirement, its falling within a prohibited limitation, or its ineligibility for a continued waiver, as applicable. The school's notification must occur by July 31 following the end of an award year. A school that fails to meet any of these requirements loses its eligibility to participate in any FSA program as of the last day of the most recent award year for which the school failed to meet the requirement .Conditions of institutional ineligibility 34 CFR 600.7 In addition to the limitations discussed in this chapter, a school is not eligible if it (or its owner) files for bankruptcy or if the school, its owner, or its CEO is responsible for a crime involving FSA program funds. See chapters 1 and 3. A school that becomes ineligible because of one of these factors must immediately stop awarding FSA funds and must follow the requirements for a school that has lost its FSA participation (see Chapter 8) .Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-102If a school loses its eligibility because it failed to meet one or more of the limitation requirements, the school cannot regain eligibility until it can demonstrate that it was in compliance with all of the limitation requirements for the most recently completed award year. Once this has occurred, the school may apply to regain its eligibility. In addition, it must also show how its administrative practices and policies have been changed to ensure that it will not fall within prohibited limits in the future. Limitation on students admitted without a high school diploma or equivalent A school that does not provide a 4-year bachelor's degree program or a 2-year associate degree program is ineligible if, for its latest complete award year, more than 50% of its regular enrolled students had neither a high school diploma nor its equivalent. If a public or private nonprofit institution exceeds the 50% limit because it serves significant numbers of these students through contracts with federal, state, or local government agencies, the Department may waive the limitation. The waiver will only be granted if no more than 40% of school's regular students (those students not receiving job training through contracts with federal, state, or local government agencies) do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent. If granted, the waiver may be extended in each year the public or private nonprofit school continues to meet the requirements. The public or private nonprofit school's calculation must be attested to by an independent auditor each year an audit is conducted. Incarcerated student limitation and waiver A school is ineligible if, in its latest complete award year, more than 25% of its regular students are incarcerated. For information on the eligibility of incarcerated students for FSA, see Volume 1, Chapter 1 . A public or private nonprofit school can ask the Department to waive this limitation. If granted, the waiver is effective as long as the school continues to meet the waiver requirements each award year. For a school offering only 2-year or 4-year programs that lead to associate or bachelor's degrees, the waiver applies to all programs at the school. But if the school offers other types of programs, the waiver would apply to any of the school's 2-year associate degree programs or 4-year bachelor's degree programs and also to any other programs in which the incarcerated regular students enrolled have a 50% or greater completion rate. The calculation of this completion rate is specified in 34 CFR 600.7(e)(2) of the institutional eligibility regulations and must be attested to by an independent auditor. A public or private nonprofit school may request the waiver using the E-App ( www.eligcert.ed.gov ) by answering the questions in Section G and explaining in question 69.Incarcerated student definition A student who is serving a criminal sentence in a federal, state, or local penitentiary, prison, jail, reformatory, work farm, or other similar correctional institution (this does not include detention in a halfway house, home detention, or weekend-only sentences).Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, FSA HB June 20172-103A school is the sum only of its eligible programs Some postsecondary institutions offer programs that are eligible for FSA as well as programs that are not FSA-eligible. For FSA program purposes, we consider an eligible institution is the sum of its eligible programs. To minimize the effect on its institutional eligibility of offering programs solely by correspondence that do not lead to a degree, a school might choose to identify those programs as not part of its FSA-eligible programs. A program (and students enrolled therein) that was so identified would not be considered part of the school in these two formulas.Correspondence student eligibility For information about a student's eligibility for FSA funds while enrolled in a correspondence course and cost of attendance information for correspondence courses, see Volume 1, Chapter 1 and Volume 3, Chapter 2 . Limitations on incarcerated students and correspondence study Incarcerated students 34 CFR 600.7(a)(1)(iii) and 600.7(c) Correspondence study Sec. 102(a)(3)(A) and (B) of the HEA 34 CFR 600.7(a)(1)(i) and (ii) and 600.7(b)(2)(i) and (ii) Notifying ED when limit is exceeded 34 CFR 600.7(h) If there is a change to any of a school's answers to the Yes/No questions in Section G of a submitted Electronic Application (E-App) (which deal with enrollment thresholds in these areas), the school must notify the Department via the E-App (see Chapter 5 ). The Department will advise the school of its options, including whether it might be eligible for a waiver. (Waivers are available for the limitations for correspondence students, incarcerated students, and students without a high school diploma or equivalent.)Correspondence course and correspondence student limitation In general, a school is ineligible if for the latest complete award year more than 50% of the school's courses were correspondence courses (correspondence course limitation) or 50% or more of the school's regular students were enrolled in correspondence courses (correspondence student limitation). This limitation may be waived for a school that offers a 2-year associate degree or 4-year baccalaureate degree program if the school demonstrates to the Department that in that award year, the students enrolled in its correspondence courses receive no more than 5% of the total FSA program funds received by all of the school's students. Note that the correspondence course and student limitations do not apply to a school that exclusively or mainly provides vocational adult education or job training as defined under Sec. 3(3)(C) of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006. Also note that the 50% limits apply to the school, not to its individual programs. An educational program composed entirely of correspondence courses could still be an eligible program if no more than 50% of the school's courses were offered through correspondence and the program met other eligibility requirements. The school's correspondence course calculation and correspondence student calculation must be attested to by an independent auditor. For additional information on correspondence study in the context of program eligibility, see Chapter 2. Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 20 U.S.C. 2301Volume 2\u2014School June 20172-104 If a school offers a course both by correspondence and residential training, the course counts twice, as a correspondence course and as a residential course. Thus, it would count as one in the numerator and as two in the denominator. Regardless of how many sections of a course or program are offered during the award year (as a residential or as a correspondence course), the course is counted only once under each type. A program not offered in courses or modules counts as one correspondence course. Using the latest complete award year, the formula for determining the percentage of correspondence courses is as follows: All regular students enrolled in an institution's Title IV-eligible programs must be counted. (A regular student is \"a person enrolled for the purpose of obtaining a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential offered by the school.\") A school must use a straight head count of enrolled students, including full-time and part-time students and students who don't receive aid as well as FSA recipients. If a student withdrew from the school and received a full refund, the student is not counted. Using the latest complete award year, the formula for determining the percentage of enrolled students is as follows: Calculating the Percentages Calculating the percentage of Correspondence courses Calculating the percentage of correspondence studentsnumber of school's correspondence courses total number of school's courses= % of correspondence courses number of regular students enrolled in the school's correspondence courses number of regular students enrolled in all of the school 's courses= % of correspondence studentsChapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, RatesCFR HB June 20172-105COHORT DEFAULT RATES A school's eligibility for the FSA programs can be affected by a high cohort default rate (CDR). The Department calculates a school's CDR based on information from guaranty agencies and federal loan servicers. The Department sends draft default rates to participating schools in February to allow each school an opportunity to review and correct the data that will be used to calculate its official cohort default rates. In September of each year, the Department issues the official cohort default rates. These rates are electronically delivered to schools and posted on the NSLDS Professional Access website. A school must be enrolled in the eCDR process for electronic delivery of the rates (see sidebar note for instructions and appeal procedures). Time frames for cohort default rates A school's annual CDR is based on a \"cohort\" of students who received FFEL or Direct Loans at the school and entered repayment in a single fiscal year\u2014the federal fiscal year, October 1-September 30. For instance, a school's FY2013 CDR is based on the cohort of students who received FFEL or Direct Loans at the school and entered repayment on those loans between October 1, 2012, and September 30, 2013. This number becomes the denominator (the lower part of the fraction) in the CDR calculation. X Total borrowers who entered repayment during FY2013 The Department tracks this group of students during the fiscal year in which they enter repayment and through the end of the second following fiscal year. The number of students who default on their loans (or meet other related conditions) during those three fiscal years becomes the numerator (top part of the fraction) in the CDR calculation. Total borrowers who entered repayment in FY2013 and defaulted in FY2013, 2014, and 2015 Total borrowers who entered repayment during FY2013 Because it takes three years to track the outcomes, the initial FY2013 CDR for a school is not released until three years later, at the beginning of 2016. This is one of the reasons that schools should closely monitor student borrowing and implement effective default prevention procedures as soon as possible. The steps taken to help students this year may reduce the number of defaults in the CDR three years from now. The terminology, criteria, calculations, and exceptions for the rates are described in more detail in the Cohort Default Rate Guide .The eCDR process ED sends the draft and official cohort default rates electronically to all schools participating in the FSA Programs. You must enroll in the eCDR process to receive your rates. If your school is not enrolled, go to ( https:// fsawebenroll.ed.gov/ ).

(www.ifap.ed.gov/DefaultManagement/ finalcdrg.html ) Default rates on the Web Searchable default rates for all schools participating in the FSA programs are posted on the Web at ( www.ed.gov/FSA/ defaultmanagement ). The Department also publishes Budget Lifetime Default Rates and Cumulative Lifetime Default Rates for the FFEL and Direct Loan Programs. These rates, which include additional defaults in years after the close of the CDR \"default window,\" do not affect June 20172-106Consequences of high cohort default rates Schools face sanctions under the following conditions: For a cohort default rate of greater than 40 percent for any year, schools lose eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan Pro - gram. For a default rate of 30 percent or more for any year, they must create a default prevention taskforce that will develop and im - plement a plan to address the high default rate. That plan must be submitted to the Department for review. For a default rate of 30 percent or more for a second consecu - tive year, they must submit to the Department a revised default prevention plan and may be placed on provisional certification. For a cohort default rate of 30 percent or more for three con - secutive years, schools lose eligibility to participate in both the Direct Loan Program and the Federal Pell Grant Program. Moreover, a school is not considered to be administratively capable when the CDR for Federal Stafford/SLS loans or Direct Subsidized/ Unsubsidized Loans made to students for attendance at the school equals or exceeds 30% for two of the three most recent fiscal years or the CDR for Perkins loans made to students for attendance at the school exceeds 15%. See Volume 6 for other rules and asso - ciated penalties related specifically to high Perkins default rates. When a high default rate demonstrates a lack of administrative capability, a school may become ineligible to participate in the Direct Loan, Pell Grant, or Perkins programs, or the Department may choose to provisionally certify such a school. For detailed information on default rates, including challenges and appeals, refer to the Cohort Default Rate Guide on the IFAP website.Contacting the default office The Operations Performance Division in Federal Student Aid responds to questions about FFEL/DL cohort default rates, and reviews FFEL/DL cohort default rate challenges, adjustments, and appeals. It also provides technical assistance and outreach to schools to assist them in lowering their default CFR 668.217 See ( www.ifap.ed.gov/ DefaultPreventionResourceInfo/index. html ) for more information.

A school must submit its default prevention plan to its school participation division for review. If the cohort default rate is equal to or greater than 30% for two consecutive fiscal years, the default prevention plan must be revised and submitted again for review. Default prevention and management plan for new schools New schools are required to implement a default prevention and management plan prior to certification. In addition, a school that undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change in control or a school that changes its status as a main campus, branch campus, or additional location must implement a default management plan. A school applying to participate is exempt from submitting a default plan if the school, including its main campus and any branch campus, does not have a cohort default rate greater than 10% and the new owner of the school does not own and has not owned any other school that had a cohort default rate greater than 10% during the owner's 20172-108DEBT-TO-EARNINGS (D/E) RATES FOR GE PROGRAMS As with cohort default rates and financial standard composite scores, the D/E rates for schools' gainful employment (GE) programs are a measure that bears on eligibility, in this case the eligibility of specific programs. Schools must report for an award year information on each student who received Title IV aid for enrollment in a GE program. The information includes private and institutional loans and other financing for the student's enrollment, as well as the amount assessed for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment. Refer to the NSLDS Gainful Employment User Guide for the specific data to report for each student each award year. The information reported will be used by the Department for calculating D/E rates and creating other information that schools must disclose: e.g., completion, median earnings and loan debt. Schools must report GE data annually by October 1 following the end of the award year (e.g., October 1, 2016, for the 2015-2016 award year), unless the Secretary establishes a different date. In cases where a student received Title IV aid for more than one GE program, he is reported for each program. If he was enrolled in a program for more than one award year, he is reported separately for each year, beginning with the year he first received Title IV aid for the program and for each following year even if he does not receive Title IV aid in that year. If he withdrew from a GE program and then re-enrolled in it, he is reported separately for each enrollment even if they were in the same award year.Gainful employment programs 34 CFR 668 Subpart Q DCL publications The webpage at ( http://ifap.ed.gov/ GainfulEmploymentInfo/indexV2.html ) is a compilation of GE materials. Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort Default RatesCFR Glossary DCL FSA June 20172-109Calculation of D/E rates The Department calculates D/E rates for each GE program for each award year using the debt and earnings of students who completed the program during a specified cohort period. That period will be two years if 30 or more students completed the program during that period or four years if fewer than 30 students completed the program in two years. If fewer than 30 students finished in the four-year cohort, D/E rates will not be calculated for that GE program. Students who qualify for exclusion are not included in that number. The two-year and four-year cohorts comprise students who completed the program during the third and fourth years and the third through sixth years respectively prior to the award year the D/E rates are being calculated for. For example, to determine the D/E rates for the 2016-2017 award year, the two-year cohort period will be award years 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, and the four-year cohort period will be 2010- 2011 through 2013-2014. We calculate separately an annual earnings rate and a discretionary income rate. The annual earnings rate equals Annual loan payment The higher of the mean or median annual earnings The discretionary income rate equals Annual loan payment The higher of the mean or median annual earnings - (1.5 \u00d7 HHS poverty guideline) The annual loan payment is determined by amortizing the median loan debt of students who completed the GE program during the cohort period. Median loan debt includes not only the amount of Title IV loans that students borrowed for enrollment in the GE program, but also private education loans and the total amount outstanding, as of the date they completed the program, on any other credit (including unpaid charges) extended by or on behalf of the institution that the students are obligated to repay. For the purpose of this calculation, students' loan debt is capped at the lesser of the debt they incurred for enrollment in the program or the total amount of their tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment.Challenges to draft rates 34 CFR 668.405(f)Calculating D/E 20172-110The median loan debt is amortized over a repayment period of 10 years for a program leading to an undergraduate certificate, a post-baccalaureate certificate, an associate degree, or a gradu - ate certificate; 15 years for a program leading to a bachelor's or master's degree; or 20 years for a program leading to a doctoral or first professional degree. We calculate the annual loan payment using the average interest rate over a three-year or six-year period ending in the last year of the cohort period: for programs two years or less in length, we use a three-year period, and we use a six-year period for programs longer than two years. The average rate for undergraduate (or graduate, respectively) programs is based on the statutory interest rate on Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans applicable to undergraduate (or graduate) students for the three- or six- year period. The Department gets the annual earnings by using the student information, mentioned earlier, that a school reports. We create for each award year a list of students who received Title IV aid and completed the GE program during the cohort period. We also indicate which students we intend to exclude and then submit the list to the school for its review. It may make corrections to the list and challenge the exclusion or inclusion of any students; the burden of proof for substantiating this is on the school. After reviewing corrections or challenges , we provide the school with a final list and submit it to the Social Security Administration (SSA). The SSA calculates and sends the Department the mean and median annual earnings of students on the final list for whom it was able to match data for the \"earnings year,\" which is the first of the calendar years in the award year for which the D/E rates are calculated. For example, for the D/E rates that will be calculated for the 2014-2015 award year, the SSA earnings year will be calendar year 2014. When calculating a program's D/E rates, we use the higher of the SSA-reported mean or median earnings. The SSA does not send the Department any individual earnings data or the identity of any students and is prohibited by law from doing so.Chapter 4\u2014Audits, Standards, Limitations, & Cohort Default RatesCFR Glossary DCL HB June 20172-111Exclusions Students are excluded from the D/E rates calculation if one or more of their Title IV loans were in a military-related deferment status at any time during the calendar year for which earnings information was received from SSA; one or more of their Title IV loans have been approved or are under consideration for a total and permanent disability discharge; they were enrolled in any other eligible program at any school during the calendar year for which SSA earnings were received; for undergraduate or graduate GE programs, they later completed a higher-credentialed undergraduate or graduate GE program respectively at the same school (see below about stu - dents completing more than one GE program); the student is dead. Students may complete more than one GE program at different credential levels. For example, they might enroll in and complete a one- year certificate program and the enroll in and complete an associate degree program at the same school. To account for this, we attribute the loan debt from the lower-credentialed program to the higher-credentialed program completed. This \"rolling-up\" of loan debt only happens if both programs are GE undergraduate programs or both are GE graduate programs, and if the higher credential is completed subsequent to completion of the lower credential. Draft rates and challenges We will calculate and send schools the draft D/E rates with the source data used to calculate the annual loan payment. Draft rates are released only to the school; they are not made public. A school may challenge the accuracy of information we used to calculate a GE program's median loan debt no later than 45 days after the school is notified of the program's draft rates. The challenge must provide satisfactory evidence that all or some of the information used to calculate the program's median loan debt is incorrect. As with challenges or corrections to the student list, the burden of proof for substantiating this challenge is on the school. After the 45-day period and after adjusting for any accepted challenges, the GE program's draft D/E rates become the final rates.Student exclusions 20172-112Outcomes of the D/E rates measure A GE program passes the D/E rates measure if its annual earnings rate is less than or equal to 8 percent or its discretionary income rate is less than or equal to 20 percent. The program fails if both parts of this test are met: (1) the annual earnings rate is greater than 12 percent or the denominator of the rate (annual earnings) is zero and (2) its discretionary income rate is greater than 30 percent or the income for the denominator of the rate (discretionary earnings) is negative or zero. A program with rates that are neither passing nor failing is in the \"zone.\" A program becomes ineligible for Title IV program funds if it (1) fails the D/E rates measure for two of any three consecutive award years for which rates were calculated or (2) has a combination of zone and failing D/E rates for four consecutive award years for which rates were calculated. We inform an institution through a Notice of Determination of a GE program's final D/E rates whether the program is passing, failing, in the zone, or ineligible; whether it could become ineligible based on final D/E rates for the next award year; whether the school is required to provide student warnings; and, if the program's final rates are failing or in the zone, how it may make an alternate earnings appeal. The determination is effective on the date specified in the notice and constitutes the final decision of the Department with respect to the D/E rates for the program. Transition period calculation For several years we will calculate alternate D/E rates that use the loan debt of a more recent one-year cohort of students who completed the program to calculate the annual loan payment (the same earnings information from SSA will be used). As a result, a school may improve a program's D/E rates in the initial years after the regulations take effect. For example, a school might reduce tuition and fees for the more recent cohort such that there would be a lower annual loan payment amount for the transitional D/E rate calculations. For a GE program of one year or less, the transition period is the first five award years for which the Department calculates D/E rates. For programs more than one and less than or equal to two years in length, the transition period is the first six award years. For programs longer than two years, the transition period is seven award years. Each of the years for which we issue any D/E rates is included in the transition period whether or not we issued rates for a specific GE program. During the transition period, if the program is failing or in the zone based on its draft D/E rates, we will calculate transitional draft rates using the median loan debt of students who completed the program in the most recently completed award year, not the median loan debt for the applicable two-year or four-year cohort period. Final rates for the program will be the better of the draft or transitional draft D/E rates.D/E rates outcomes 34 CFR 668.403(c)Chapter FSA HB June 20172-113Appealing final rates If a GE program is failing or in the zone, a school may file an appeal to request recalculation of the program's most recent final D/E rates. The appeal must be based on the actual earnings of all the students who received Title IV aid and completed the program during the same or a comparable cohort period. The school must use the annual loan payment data used in the calculation of the final D/E rates. The school may obtain alternate earnings data from a survey it conducts of its graduates or from a state-sponsored data system, and would then use the higher of the mean or median alternate earnings for the appeal. Using a survey to get earnings data The Department's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has developed an earnings survey, and standards for its administration, that schools can use called the Recent Graduates Employment and Earnings Survey (RGEES). NCES has also developed a Best Practices Guide with explanations and examples of how to implement the standards in their collection of graduate earnings. The appeal must include a certification signed by the school's chief executive officer (CEO) attesting that the survey was conducted according to RGEES standards and that the mean or median earnings figure used to recalculate the D/E rates was accurately determined. The school must also submit an examination-level attestation engagement report prepared by an independent public accountant or independent government auditor attesting that the survey was conducted according to the requirements of the RGEES. The Department may also require additional supporting documentation. Using a state-sponsored data system for earnings data With this method a school must submit to the administrator of each state-sponsored data system used for the appeal a list of all students who received Title IV aid and completed the program during the same cohort period the Department used to calculate the final rates. The school must demonstrate that it obtained annual earnings data for more than 50% of the number of students in the cohort period and alternate earnings data for 30 or more of those students. The school must include with the appeal a certification signed by its CEO attesting that state-provided data were accurately used to recalculate the D/E rates. The Department may also require more supporting documentation.Alternate earnings appeals 34 CFR 668.406 Gainful Employment Electronic Announcement #95 - Debt-to-Earnings Rate Alternate Earnings Appeals, October 26, 2016 Gainful Employment Electronic Announcement #105 - Additional Time for Submission of an Alternate Earnings Appeal and to Comply with Gainful Employment (GE) Disclosure Requirements, March 6, 2017 For a complete list of Gainful Employment Electronic Announcements and Dear Colleague Letters, please visit https://ifap.ed.gov/GainfulEmploymentInfo/ GEDCLandEAV2.htmlVolume 2\u2014School June 20172-114Timing of an appeal A school must submit notice of its intent to appeal no earlier than the date the Department provides it with its draft D/E rates but no later than 14 days after the Department issues the notice of determination that as a result of the program's final rates, the program either failed or was in the zone. The school must then submit its appeal, including its recalculated rates, certifications, and any supporting documentation, no later than 60 days after the date the Department issues the notice of determination. When a timely and complete appeal has been submitted, the school is not subject to any consequences (i.e., student warnings and loss of program eligibility) while the appeal is considered. If the Department denies the appeal, it notifies the school of the reasons for the denial and the program's final rates previously issued in the notice of determination will stand. If the appeal is granted, the institution is notified of the recalculated rates, which become the new final D/E rates for the program. Consequences of failing and zone rates For three years after the date of a voluntary discontinuation a school may not (1) reestablish the eligibility of an ineligible program or of a failing or zone program that it discontinued voluntarily or (2) establish the eligibility of a program that is substantially similar to the discontinued or ineligible program. Two programs are substantially similar if they share the same four-digit CIP code. If a GE program could become ineligible based on its final D/E rates for the next award year, the school must warn students and prospective students. The warnings must contain language specified in the regulations or alternate language subsequently provided by the Department and must refer students and prospective students to, and include a link for, the Department's College Navigator website for information about similar programs. Warnings to students enrolled in the GE program must: Describe the academic and financial options available to stu - dents to continue their education in another program at the school, including whether they can transfer credits (and which credits) earned in the program to another program. Indicate whether, if the program loses Title IV eligibility, the school will continue to provide instruction allowing students to complete the program or will refund tuition, fees, and other required charges. Explain whether students could transfer credits earned in the program to another institution.GE program warning content 34 CFR 668.410(a)(2)(i)Chapter 4\u2014Audits, FSA HB June 20172-115The school must provide the warning in writing to each enrolled student no later than 30 days after the date of the Department's notice of determination. The school must either hand deliver the warning as a separate document or send it to the student's primary email address with the warning as the only substantive content in the email. If email is used, the school must receive an electronic or written acknowledgment that the student received the email. You may not deliver an initial warning using regular U.S. Postal Service mail or commercial courier service. If a resp onse indicating that the email could not be delivered is received, the warning must be sent using a different address or method of delivery, which could include U.S. Postal Service mail or commercial courier service. A school must keep records of its efforts to provide warnings. Requirements for delivering warnings to prospective students are similar to those for enrolled students except that the warning must be provided at the point when the prospective student initially contacts the school about the program. Also, schools have the additional options of providing prospective students with a copy of the disclosure template that includes the warning or providing them the warning orally if the contact is by telephone. However, a school may not enroll or register students or have them enter into a financial commitment after receiving just an oral warning. Accordingly, any student who received an oral warning must, prior to enrolling, registering, or entering into a financial commitment with the school, receive a non-oral warning as described above. A school may not enroll, register, or enter into a financial commitment with a prospective student earlier than three business days after it first provides that warning to the student or, if more than 30 days have elapsed since the warning was first given, three business days after an additional warning is given. In addition to providing warnings directly to students and prospective students, the school must update the disclosure template for the GE program to include the warning within 30 days of receiving notice from the Department that a warning must be provided for the program.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility describes the regular recertification of schools, as well as changes that can affect a school's participation and how and when to report these changes to the Department on the E-App .Updating Application Information FSA HB June 20172-117RECERTIFICATION A school may be certified to participate for up to six years. Recertification is the process through which a school that is presently certified to participate in the FSA programs applies to have its participation extended beyond the expiration date of its current Program Participation Agreement (PPA) . The Department will notify a school six months prior to the expiration of the school's PPA. The school must submit a materially complete application before the expiration date listed in its PPA. If a school that is currently certified submits its materially complete application to the Department no later than 90 calendar days before its PPA expires, its PPA remains valid, and its eligibility to participate in the FSA programs continues until its application is either approved or not approved. This is true even if the Department does not complete its evaluation of the application before the PPA's expiration date. (For example, if a school's PPA expires on June 30 and it submits its application by March 31, the school remains certified during the Department's review period\u2014even if the review period extends beyond June 30.) If the 90th day before the PPA's expiration falls on a weekend or a federal holiday and the school submits its application (E-App) no later than the next business day, the Department considers the application to be submitted 90 days before the PPA expires. If the school's application is not received at least 90 days before the PPA expires or is not materially complete by that date, the school's PPA will expire on the scheduled expiration date and the FSA program funding will cease. If a school's eligibility lapses, the school may not continue to disburse FSA funds until it receives the Department's notification that the school is again eligible to participate in the programs. Following submission of an application, the school participation division will contact the school if it has questions about the application. Generally, this will be within 90 days of the Department receiving an application. If a school's application has been approved, the Department will send an electronic notice to the president and financial aid officer notifying them that the school's PPA is available to print, review, sign, and return. If the school's application is not approved, ED will notify the school and explain why. Recertification Sec 498(g) and (h) of the HEA 34 CFR 600.20(b) and (f) Eligible nonparticipating school Nonparticipating eligible schools are only required to renew their eligibility when the Department requests it. Their eligibility status continues indefinitely as long as they continue to meet the institutional eligibility requirements. If a school wants to be certified to participate in the FSA programs, it must submit an application and supporting documentation (see Chapter 1 ). 34 CFR 600.20(b)(1)FSA Assessment modules To assess your compliance with the provisions of this chapter see \"Recertification,\" at (www.ifap.ed.gov/qahome/ qaassessments/institutionalelig.html HB June 20172-118CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP Changes at public institutions The Department does not consider that a public institution has undergone a change in ownership that results in a change of control if there is a change in governance, and the institution after the change remains a public institution, provided the new governing authority is in the same state as included in the institution's program participation agreement; and the new governing authority has acknowledged the public insti - tution's continued responsibilities under its PPA. Within 10 days of undergoing a change in governance, however, a public institution must report that change to the Department. The institution must also explicitly acknowledge its continued responsibilities under its PPA. If the documentation transferring control of a public institution to another in-state entity does not specifically acknowledge the aforementioned responsibilities, the institution must acknowledge them in a separate letter or notice. Change in ownership that results in a change of control, structure, or governance A change in ownership and control occurs when a person or corporation obtains new authority to control a school's actions, whether the school is a proprietorship, partnership, or corporation. A change in ownership that results in a change in control includes any change through which a person or corporation acquires an ownership interest in the entity that owns the school or the parent corporation of that entity, or who owns or acquires an ownership interest attains or loses the ability to control the school.

Parent corporation An institution that is a wholly-owned subsidiary changes ownership and control when the parent corporation changes ownership and control as described in this section.Chapter 5\u2014Updating Application InformationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-119The most common example of this change in controlling interest is when the school is sold to a new owner. Other kinds of \"covered transactions\" include the transfer of the controlling interest of stock of the school or its parent corporation; the merger of two or more eligible schools; the division of one school into two or more schools; the transfer of the liabilities of a school to its parent corpora - tion; a transfer of assets that comprise a substantial portion of the educational business of the school, except if it is exclusively in the granting of a security interest in those assets; or a conversion of the school from a for-profit to a nonprofit school or a nonprofit to a for-profit. Change in ownership for closely held corporations A closely held corporation (including the term close corporation ) is a corporation that qualifies under the law of the state of its in - corporation as a closely held corporation; or if the state of incorporation has no definition of closely held corporation, a corporation whose stock is held by no more than 30 persons and has not been and is not planned to be publicly offered. For a closely held corporation, a change in ownership and control occurs when a person acquires more than 50% of the total outstanding vot - ing stock of the corporation; a person who holds an ownership interest in the corporation acquires control of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation; or a person who holds or controls 50% or more of the total out - standing stock of the corporation ceases to hold or control that proportion of the stock of the corporation.Excluded transactions\u2014transfers to family members Changes of ownership do not include a transfer of ownership and control to a member of the owner's family (whether or not the family member works at the school) that includes: parent, stepparent, sibling, step-sibling, spouse, child or stepparent, sibling, step-sibling, - child or step-grandchild; child's spouse; and sibling's spouse. Nor does it include a transfer of ownership and control, upon the retirement or death of the owner, to a person (who is not a family member) with an ownership interest in the school who has been involved in management of the school for at least two years preceding the transfer and who has established and retained the ownership interest for at least two years prior to the transfer. These are known as excluded transactions, and they apply only to the transfer of the entire portion of the owner's interest. 34 CFR 600.21(f) 34 CFR 600.31(e) Training requirement after a change in ownership or control If a school undergoes a change in ownership, the school's chief financial aid administrator and its chief administrator (or a high-level school official designated by the chief administrator) must attend Fundamentals of Title IV Training. If the financial aid administrator and/or the chief administrator have not changed, the school may request a waiver of the training requirement from its school participation division. ED may grant or deny the waiver for the required individual, require another official to take the training, or require alternative training.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-120Change in ownership for publicly traded corporations For publicly traded corporations , a change in ownership and control occurs when a person acquires ownership and control of the corporation such that the corporation is required to file a Form 8K with the Securities and Exchange Commission notifying that agency of the change in control; or a person who is a controlling shareholder of the corporation ceases to be a controlling shareholder. A controlling shareholder is a shareholder who holds or controls through agreement both 25% or more of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and more shares of voting stock than any other shareholder. A controlling shareholder for this purpose does not include a shareholder whose sole stock ownership is held as a U.S. institutional investor, held in mutual funds, held through a profit-sharing plan, or held in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. For a publicly traded corporation, when a change of ownership occurs, instead of a same-day balance sheet, the school may submit its most recent quarterly financial statement as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Together with its quarterly financial statement, the school must submit copies of all other SEC filings made after the close of the fiscal year for which a compliance audit has been submitted to ED. Consider a publicly traded school that is provisionally certified because of a change in ownership that experiences another change of ownership. If any controlling shareholder on the newer change of ownership application was listed on the ownership application for which the provisional approval was granted, the expiration date for the original provisional certification remains unchanged if the newer application is approved. Change in ownership for corporations that are not closely held or registered with the SEC A change in ownership and control of a corporation that is neither closely held nor required to be registered with the SEC occurs when a person who has or acquires an ownership interest acquires both control of at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and managing control of the corporation.Default management plan after change in ownership or status A school that changes ownership or changes its status as a parent or subordinate institution must adopt the Sample Default Prevention Plan or develop its own default management plan that is approved by the Department. The school must implement the plan for at least two years. A school is exempt from submitting a default management plan if the parent school and the subordinate school both have a cohort default rate of 10% or less, and the new owner of the parent or subordi - nate school does not own, and has not owned, any other school with a cohort default rate over 10%. Chapter 5\u2014Updating Application InformationCFR Glossary IN OWNERSHIP INTEREST AND 25% THRESHOLD Ownership or ownership interest means a legal or beneficial interest in a school or its corporate parent or a right to share in the profits derived from the operation of a school or its corporate parent. The school must report any change in ownership interests whenever an owner acquires a total interest of 25% or greater; an owner who held a 25% or greater interest reduces his or her interest to less than 25%; or an owner of a 25% or greater interest increases or reduces his or her interest but remains the holder of at least a 25% owner - ship interest. Because of these reporting requirements, even though transferring ownership interest through death or retirement may be excluded from being considered a change in ownership resulting in a change of control, the resulting change in percentages of ownership interests must be reported to the Department.Ownership interest Ownership or ownership interest does not include an ownership interest held by: 1. a mutual fund that is regularly and publicly traded; 2. a U.S. institutional investor as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission; 3. a profit-sharing plan of the school or its corporate parent (provided that all full-time permanent employees of the school or corporate parent are included in the plan); or 4. an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).Preacquisition review Schools may submit an E-App marked \"preacquisition review\" before a change in ownership takes place. The purpose of this review is to determine whether the school has answered all the questions completely and accurately. A preacquisition review application must be submitted at least 45 days prior to the expected date of the transaction. The SPD will notify the school of the results of the review. However, the school will not be given a decision whether or not its application would be approved as a result of this preacquisition review. Please note that a preacquisition review is not required; it is an option. If the potential owner decides not to purchase the school, he or she must notify the school participation division of the decision to withdraw the application. If the potential owner considering the change in ownership decides to go through with the purchase and wants to participate in the FSA programs, he or she must notify the Department within 10 days of the date the change in ownership actually took place (if this date falls on a weekend or a federal holiday, the notification may be no later than the next business day); and submit the supporting documents required for a materially complete application. (Refer to section \"M\" of the E-App for the list of specific forms to submit.) 25% Threshold 34 CFR June 20172-122A school must report any changes that result in an individual or owner (including a corporation or unincorporated business entity) acquiring the ability to substantially affect the actions of the school. Such a change must be reported within 10 days of the change. A school owned by a publicly traded corporation must report the change within 10 days after the corporation learns of the change. Adherence to these requirements is enforced during the institutional participation approval process, program reviews, and audit process. All schools are bound by these reporting requirements, and substantial penalties may be imposed on schools that fail to comply with them. An individual or corporation has the ability to substantially affect the school's actions when he, she, or it personally holds, or holds in partnership with one or more family members, at least a 25% ownership interest in the school; personally represents (with voting trust, power of attorney, or proxy authority), or represents in partnership with one or more family members, any individual or group holding at least a 25% ownership interest in the school; is the school's general partner, chief executive officer (or other executive officer), chief financial officer, individual designated as the lead program administrator for the FSA programs at the school, or a member of the school's board of directors; or is the chief executive officer (or other officer) for any entity that holds at least a 25% ownership interest in the school or is a member of the board of directors for such an entity. To ensure that its FSA program participation isn't jeopardized, a school must report to the Department an ownership change (including the names of persons involved). On receiving the notification, the Department will investigate and notify the school whether a change in ownership resulting in a change of control has occurred that will require the school to submit a materially complete application.Chapter 5\u2014Updating Application InformationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-123STEPS TO BE TAKEN DURING A CHANGE IN OWNER - SHIP Steps to be taken by former owners If a school is changing control, the former owners must notify the Department about the change and the date it occurs, and provide any supporting information the Department requests. This must be at the same time that the owner notifies the school's accrediting agency but no later than 10 days after the change occurs. (If the former owner fails to notify the Department, the prospective owner is responsible for doing so.) The current owner also must notify the state agency that licenses or approves the school. Steps to be taken by prospective owners The prospective owner should ask the former owner for copies of the school's Eligibility and Certification Approval Report (ECAR), refund policy, return of FSA funds policy, any required default management plan, program reviews, audited financial statements (for at least the two most recently completed fiscal years), and compliance audits. The prospective owner will need this information to receive approval to participate. Accompanying the application must be audited financial statements for the school's two most recently completed fiscal years (if the school has not yet submitted statements for those years), an audited balance sheet showing the financial condition of the school at the time of the change, and a default management plan (if required). Each participating school must demonstrate financial responsibility independently. If the entity that has acquired the school is an ongoing entity (partnership or corporation), the school must also submit completed audited financial statements of the acquiring entity for the last two consecutive fiscal years. For information on financial responsibility and submitting audited financial statements see Chapter 4 . The school also must submit proof that its accreditation is continued under the new ownership or control, along with a photocopy of its state legal authorization under the new ownership. The school may not award FSA program funds until it receives a new PPA signed on behalf of the Secretary.Audits and closeout procedures Although a separate financial aid compliance audit is not required when there is a change in ownership, structure, or governance, the prospective owner may choose to have the accounts audited before they are closed out. Questions about FSA accounts or closeout procedures should be addressed to the appropriate school participation division.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-124Accepting liabilities and responsibility for return of funds If new owners acquire a school or if a school is the result of the merger of two or more schools that formerly were operating separately, the new owner is liable for any debts that accrued from the former owner's FSA program administration. A new owner accepts liability for any federal funds that were given to the school but that were improperly spent before the date the change in ownership, structure, or governance became effective. A new owner must also abide by the school's refund and the FSA Return of Funds policy for students enrolled before the date the change became effective, and must honor all student enrollment contracts signed before the date of the change. Payments to eligible students Before the change in ownership, structure, or governance takes place, the former owner should make sure that all students receive any FSA payments already due them for the current payment period and that all records are current and comply with federal regulations. If the school needs additional funds for its students for the current payment period, it should request them and disburse them to all eligible students before the change takes place. The school loses its approval to participate in the FSA programs when the change takes place. Generally, a school may use Pell or TEACH Grant or Campus-Based funds that it has received or request additional Pell Grant or Campus-Based funds from the Department to satisfy any unpaid commitment made to a student from the date the school's participation end - ed until the scheduled completion date of the payment period; and credit a student's account with the proceeds of a second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan to satisfy any un - paid commitment made to the student under the Direct Loan Program from the date participation ends until the scheduled completion of that period of enrollment. (The proceeds of the first disbursement of the loan must have been delivered to the student or credited to the student's account prior to the end of the participation.) The school must notify all new students that no federal aid funds can be disbursed until the school's eligibility is established and a new PPA signed by the Department is received. Chapter 5\u2014Updating Application InformationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-125Beginning on the date that the change becomes effective, the school may no longer award FSA funds. If the school's prospective owners wish the school to participate in one or more of the FSA programs, the school must submit a materially complete application to the Department. The school can apply for preacquisition review (described in the previous section) and temporary provisional approval after the change in ownership (described in the next section). TEMPORARY APPROVAL FOR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION The Department, at its discretion, may permit a school undergoing a change in ownership that results in a change in control to continue to participate in the FSA programs on a provisional basis if the school meets the following specific requirement. The school must submit a materially complete application that must be received by the Department no later than 10 business days after the change becomes effective. A materially complete application for the purpose of applying for a temporary approval must include a completed application form; a copy of the school's state license or equivalent that was in ef - fect on the day before the change in ownership took place; a copy of the accrediting agency's approval (in effect on the day before the change in ownership) that granted the school ac - creditation status including an approval of the nondegree pro - grams it offers; financial statements of the school's two most recently complet - ed fiscal years that are prepared and audited in accordance with the requirements of the generally accepted accounting prin - ciples (GAAP), published by the Financial Accounting Stan - dards Board, and the generally accepted governmental auditing standards (GAGAS) published by the U.S. General Accounting Office (submitted via eZ-Audit at www.ezaudit.ed.gov ); audited financial statements for the school's new owner's two most recently completed fiscal years that are prepared and audited in accordance with GAAP and GAGAS, or acceptable equivalent information for that owner (submitted via eZ-Audit at www.ezaudit.ed.gov ); and a completed signature page, Section L.Temporary approval Temporary approval Sec. 498(i)(4) of the HEA 34 CFR 600.20(g) and (h) Audits June 20172-126If the application is approved, the school participation division will send the school a Temporary Provisional Program Participation Agreement (Temporary PPA). The Temporary PPA extends the terms and conditions of the PPA that were in effect for the school before its change of ownership. The Temporary PPA expires on the earliest of the date that the Department signs a new program participation agreement; date that the Department notifies the school that its application is denied; or last day of the month following the month in which the change of ownership occurred unless the school provides the necessary documents described as follows. The Department can automatically extend the Temporary PPA on a month-to-month extension if, prior to the expiration date, the school submits a same day balance sheet showing the school's financial posi - tion on the day the ownership changed, prepared in accordance with GAAP and audited in accordance with GAGAS; approval of the change of ownership from the school's state agency that legally authorizes postsecondary education in that state (if not already provided); approval of the change of ownership from the school's accredit - ing agency (if not already provided); and a default management plan that follows examples provided by the Department or notification that it is using the Department's plan or is exempt from providing a InformationCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-127REPORTING SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES A school is required to report changes to certain information on its approved application, as listed on the following pages. A school may also wish to expand its FSA eligibility and certification. Some of these changes require the Department's written approval before the school may disburse the FSA program funds; others do not. If a change occurs in an E-App item not listed on the following pages , the school must update the information when it applies for recertification. When the Department is notified of a change, if further action is needed, it will tell the school how to proceed, including what materials and what additional completed sections of the E-App need to be submitted. If a school has questions about changes and procedures, it should contact its school participation division. After receiving the required materials (and depending on the circumstances), the Department will evaluate the changes, approve or deny them, and notify the school. Approval required from accreditor and state agency For a change requiring written approval from the Department (unless otherwise noted) and for some changes that do not require written approval from the Department, a school must obtain approval from the appropriate accrediting agency and state authorizing agency. Notification of school closure or bankruptcy If a school closes or files for bankruptcy, the school must notify the Department within 10 calendar days of either event by sending a letter on the school's letterhead that indicates the date the school closed or plans to close, or the date the school filed for bankruptcy, as appropriate.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA 20172-128CHANGES TO LOCATION, BRANCH, OR CAMPUS The ECAR that the Department sends to the school lists the educational programs and locations that are eligible. (The eligibility of a school and its programs does not automatically include separate locations and extensions.) If, after receipt of the ECAR, a school wishes to add a location at which at least 50% of an educational program is offered, it must notify the Department. Eligibility of additional locations For purposes of qualifying as an eligible location, an additional location is not required to satisfy the two-year requirement unless the location was a facility of another school that has closed or ceased to provide educational programs for a reason other than a normal vacation period or a natural disaster that directly af - fects the school or the school's students; the applicant school acquired, either directly from the school that closed or ceased to provide educational programs, or through an intermediary, the assets at the location; and the school from which the applicant school acquired the assets of the location is not making payments in accordance with an agreement to repay a liability for a violation of FSA program requirements. An additional location that falls into one of the aforementioned categories is not required to satisfy the two-year rule (see Chapter 1 ) if the applicant school agrees: to be liable for all improperly expended or unspent FSA funds received by the school that has closed or ceased to provide edu - cational programs, to be liable for all unpaid refunds owed to students who re - ceived FSA funds, and to abide by the policy of the school that has closed or ceased to provide educational programs regarding refunds of institutional charges to students in effect before the date of the acquisition of the assets of the additional location for the students who were enrolled before that date. Each site must be legally authorized. To apply for eligibility for an added location, the school must submit an E-App to the Department with the required application sections completed, a copy of the accrediting agency's notice certifying that the new location is included in the school's accredited status, and a copy of the state legal authorization from the state in which the additional site is physically located.Notifying ED if school exceeds limitations on types of students If there is a change to any of a school's answers to the Yes/No questions in Section G of a submitted application (limitations on students who are enrolled without a high school diploma or equivalent, incarcerated students, and correspondence study), the school must notify ED via the E-App. ED will advise the school of its options, including whether the school might be eligible for a waiver. (See Chapter 4 for additional information.)Teach-outs at closed school locations A school that conducts a teach-out at a site of a closed school may apply to have that site approved as an additional location if the closed school ceased operations and the Department has taken a limitation, suspension, termination, or emergency action, regardless of whether the Department took that action before or after the school closed. The teach-out must be approved by the school's accrediting agency. The school that conducts the teach-out may establish a permanent additional location at the closed school without having to satisfy the 2-year requirement and without assuming the liabilities and cohort default rate of the closed institution, provided the schools are not commonly owned or managed. See 34 CFR 600.32(d), as amended on October 29, 2009, for further details. HEOA 2008, \u00a7496 , HEA \u00a7498 Effective 600.20(f)(3) 34 CFR 600.21(d) Electronic submission required Changes to previous applications, including changes in ownership, reporting, expanding eligibility, and certification, must be submitted to the Department through the new location All schools are required to report (using the E-App) to the Department when adding an additional accredited and licensed location where they will be offering 50% or more of an eligible program if the school wants to disburse FSA program funds to students enrolled at that location. Schools must not disburse FSA program funds to students at a new location before the school has reported that location and submitted any required supporting documents to the Department. Once it has reported a new licensed and accredited location, unless it is a school that is required to apply for approval for a new location (see below), a school may disburse FSA program funds to students enrolled at that location. Applying for approval of a new location If a school meets one or more of the following criteria, it must apply for and wait for approval before disbursing FSA funds at an additional location where it will be offering 50% or more of an eligible program: The school is provisionally certified. The school is on the cash monitoring or reimbursement system of payment. The school has acquired the assets of another school that pro - vided educational programs at that location during the preced - ing year, and the other school participated in the FSA programs during that year. The school would be subject to a loss of eligibility under the co - hort default rate regulations if it adds that location. The school was previously notified by the Department that it must apply for approval of an additional location. The Department will review the information and will evaluate the school's financial responsibility, administrative capability, and eligibility. Depending upon the circumstances, the Department may conduct an on-site review. If it approves the additional location, a revised ECAR and Approval Letter will be issued. The location is eligible as of the date of the Department's determination. Liability for disbursements if change not approved If a school does not obtain ED approval for a new location, branch, program, or increase in program offering, the school is liable for all FSA funds it disburses to students enrolled at that location or branch or in that program.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-130Changing the status of a campus or branch If a school wishes to seek approval for a branch campus, the school must submit a completed application with the required supplemental documentation (see the following list) on (1) the main campus and (2) the proposed branch campus. A branch campus of an eligible proprietary institution of higher education or postsecondary vocational school must be in existence for at least two years (after it is certified in writing by the Department as a branch campus) before seeking to be designated as a main campus or a freestanding school. CHANGES TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS Adding a program\u2014when a school may make eligibility determinations After a school has received an ECAR, the school may add an educational program and determine the program's eligibility unless the school has been provisionally certified, the school is receiving funds under heightened cash manage - ment, progress in the program is measured by direct assessment, the school is subject to the two-year rule, the program is a comprehensive transition and postsecondary program, or the Department has informed the school that it must request approval before adding additional programs. Before the school may determine these programs to be eligible and disburse funds to enrolled students, the school must have received both the required state and accrediting agency approvals. The school must include any \"self-certified\" programs on its next recertification application, and provide copies of the state and accreditor approvals. For new GE programs, the school must update the ECAR within 10 days of the school receiving final approval from its accreditation agency, governing authority, and other oversight bodies to make the change.Effects of closure of branch or additional location A school that is considering adding a branch or an additional location should include in its deliberations the effect that a closure of a branch or additional location might have on the school's financial condition. If a branch or additional location of an institution closes and borrowers who attended the school obtain loan discharges by reason of the closure of the branch or location (or improper loan certifications), the Department will pursue recovery against the larger institution, its affiliates, and its principals. HEA 437(c)(1) Reporting self-determined programs on the E-App Institutions are encouraged to report programs for which they have made a self- determination, at either recertification or sooner. The eligibility of these programs will be reviewed prior to the program being added to the ECAR as an eligible program. 34 CFR 600.20 (c)(3), 600.10 (c) Consequences of erroneous self- determination If the school's self-determination of eligibility for an educational program is found to be incorrect, the school is liable for all FSA program funds received for the program and all FSA program funds received by or for students enrolled in that program.ClarificationChapter 5\u2014Updating Application \"Gainful employment\" refers to certain programs offered at public, private nonprofit, and proprietary institutions, as defined in Chapter 2 .All other program additions must be reported to the Department and approved before FSA program funds can be awarded. Within 10 days of the school receiving final approval from its accreditation agency, governing authority, and other oversight bodies to add the program, the school must submit an E-App with the appropriate sections completed and copies of the approval of the new program from its accrediting agency and state authorizing agency. The Department will evaluate the new program and the school addition of that program. If the Department approves the school adding the additional program, the Department will issue a revised ECAR and Approval Letter and send them to the school. For more on program eligibility, see Chapter 2 . Updating a program The school must update information about its educational programs when completing its recertification application. This includes updating CIP codes, program names, and program lengths. A school must update its E-App with changes to GE programs within 10 days of making the change. Schools should note that making a substantive change to a program may result in the creation of a new program. CIP codes Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes are developed by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. (http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode ) Approval for clock-hour programs at proprietary schools If a proprietary school submitting an E-App is in provisional status, any new program needs to have been continuously provided for at least two (2) years prior to the application date, or it can not be approved until the school reaches the two year mark. Short-term programs at all institutions must have been continuously provided for twelve months to be considered for approval. Limitations for schools subject to \"2-year rule\" For schools subject to the 2-year rule (see Chapter 1 ), during the school's initial period of participation in the FSA programs, the Department will not approve adding programs that would expand the school's eligibility beyond the current ECAR. An exception may be considered if the school can demonstrate that the program was legally authorized and continuously provided for at least two years prior to the date of the request. In addition, a school subject to the 2-year rule may not award FSA funds to a student in a program that is not included in the school's approval documents. ClarificationVolume 2\u2014School FSA HB June 20172-132CHANGES IN ACCREDITATION A school must notify the Department if the school changes its institution-wide accreditation (primary accrediting agency), or decides to seek institution-wide accreditation by an additional agency. Change in institution-wide accreditation If the school decides to change its institution-wide accreditation (primary accrediting agency ), it must notify the Department when it begins the accreditation application process with a different agency. (Note that it must also notify the Department when it completes the process.) As part of the notice, the school must submit materials about its current accreditation and materials demonstrating reasonable cause for changing accreditation. If the school fails to notify the Department of the proposed change to its institution-wide accreditation, or if the school does not provide the materials just described, the Department will not recognize the school's existing accreditation. If this happens, or if the school drops its association with its former accreditor before obtaining Department approval of the change, the school would no longer have accredited status and would no longer be eligible to award FSA funds. Therefore, when a school secures new institution-wide accreditation, it must notify the Department using the online electronic application (E-App). At that time, it must advise the Department which accrediting agency will be its accreditor for purposes of FSA gatekeeping. Only after the Department provides written notice that it recognizes the new accreditor as the institution's primary accreditor should the school drop its association with its prior accreditor. Changing accrediting by more than one institution-wide accrediting agency If the school decides to become accredited by more than one institution-wide accrediting agency, it must notify the Department when it begins the process of obtaining additional accreditation. As part of the notice, the school must report (in question 15 of the E-App) its current institution-wide accrediting agency, the prospective institution-wide accrediting agency, and the reason (in question 69 of the E-App) it wishes to be accredited by more than one agency. If the school obtains the additional institution-wide accreditation and fails to notify the Department of the reason for the additional accreditation, the Department will not recognize the school's accredited status with either agency. This means the school would lose its accredited status and its eligibility to award FSA funds. If a school becomes accredited by more than one agency, it must notify its school participation division of which agency's accreditation the school will use for determining its eligibility for the FSA programs. Loss of accreditation If a school loses its primary accreditation, it is ineligible to participate in the FSA programs and must notify the Department within 10 days of the loss of accreditation. (For any dispute involving the termination of accreditation, an accredited or preaccredited school must agree to submit to binding arbitration before initiating any other legal action.) However, if a school's accrediting agency loses its recognition from the Department, the school has up to 18 months in which to obtain accreditation from another recognized agency. Other changes in accreditation may also jeopardize institutional participation. Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICERS required to notify the Department of all third-party servicer contracts. If a school has submitted information regarding its third-party servicers as part of applying for certification or recertification, no additional submission is required. The school must promptly notify the Department of any of the following changes to servicer arrangements: the school enters into a contract with a new third-party ser - vicer, the school significantly modifies a contract with an existing third-party servicer, the school or one of its third-party servicers terminates a con - tract, or a third-party servicer ceases to provide contracted services, goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy. A school notifies the Department by updating Section J of the E-App within 10 days of the date of the change or action. This notification must include the name and address of the servicer and the nature of the change or action. A school is only required to submit a copy of its contract with a third- party servicer if the Department requests it. A school is not required to submit the contract as part of the recertification process. (See Chapter 3 for more information about contracts third-party Requiring Written Approval From the Department All schools must report and wait for written approval from the U.S. Department of Education before disbursing funds when the following occur : 1. a change in accrediting agency (notify the Department when you begin making any change that deals with your school's institution-wide accreditation); 2. a change in state authorizing agency; 3. a change in institutional structure; 4. an increase in the level of educational programs (e.g. associate degree to baccalaureate degree programs, baccalaureate degree to graduate degree programs, etc.) beyond the scope of current approval; 5. the addition of short-term (300-599 clock-hour) programs ; 6. the addition of direct assessment programs or comprehensive transition and postsecondary programs; 7. changes to the FSA programs (Pell Grants, Direct Loans, etc.) for which the school is approved* (Approvals from your accrediting agency and state authorizing agency are not required for this change.); 8. a change in the type of ownership; 9. a change in ownership; 10. the addition of an accredited and licensed location if the institution would be subject to a loss of eligibility under the cohort default rate regulations (34 CFR 668.188) if it adds that location; 11. the addition of an educational program or a location at which the school offers or will offer 50 percent or more of an educational program if a school a) is provisionally certified; or b) is on the cash monitoring or reimbursement system of payment; or c) has acquired the assets of another school that provided educational programs at that loca - tion during the preceding year, and the other school participated in the FSA programs during that year; or d) has been advised by the Department that the Department must approve any new location or program before the school may begin disbursing FSA funds . When one of the changes that requires the Department's written approval occurs, a school must notify the Department.

This is information about: financial aid; the school's campus, facilities, student athletes, and gainful employment programs; as well as campus security and fire safety, drug and alcohol abuse prevention, and programs about them. The chapter also discusses counseling for students receiving FSA loans and disclosures that must be made for private education loans. Additional disclosure requirements that are specific to disbursements of FSA loans are described in Volume 4 .AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION Notice to enrolled students Each year a school must distribute to all enrolled students a notice of the availability of the information it must provide in the following general categories: general disclosures for enrolled or prospective students, annual security report and annual fire safety report, report on athletic program participation rates and financial support data (Equity in Athletics Data or EADA), and FERPA information (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, discussed in Chapter 7) . The notice must list and briefly describe the information and tell students how to obtain it. It must be provided on an individual basis through an appropriate mailing or publication, including direct mailing through the U.S. Postal Service, campus mail, or electronic mail. Posting on an Internet or intranet website does not constitute a notice.Consumer information HEA Sec. 485(f); 20 USC 1092 staff: 34 CFR 668.44 Sample notice of FERPA rights You can find a sample notification at the Department's FERPA website (www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ ferpa/ps-officials.html ).

If more than one person is designated, their combined work schedules must be arranged so that at least one of them is available upon reasonable notice throughout the normal administrative working hours of the school. The Department may waive this requirement if the school's total enrollment or the portion participating in the FSA programs is too small to necessitate an employee or group of employees being available on a full-time basis. The granting of a waiver does not exempt an institution from designating a specific employee or group of employees to carry out on a part-time basis the information dissemination requirements. The school must request this waiver from the Department.

Summary of Civil and Criminal Penalties for Violation of Federal Copyright Laws Copyright infringement is the act of exercising, without permission or legal authority, one or more of the exclusive rights granted to the copyright owner under section 106 of the Copyright Act (Title 17 of the United States Code). These rights include the right to reproduce or distribute a copyrighted work. In the file- sharing context, downloading or uploading substantial parts of a copyrighted work without authority constitutes an infringement. Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or \"statutory\" damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For \"willful\" infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorneys' fees. For details, see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505. Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense. For more information, please see the website of the U.S. Copyright Office at ( www.copyright.gov ).Copyright information The sample statement and other copyright requirements are included in GEN 10-08.

Net price calculator All Title IV schools that enroll full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking undergraduate students must have on their website a net price calculator. The net price is defined as the cost of attendance minus the average yearly grant and scholarship aid. The calculator provides estimated net price information to current and prospective students and should be based, as much as possible, on their individual circumstances. ED's National Center for Education Statistics has developed a template that schools can use to create their own customized net price calculator, or they can develop their own calculator. If they develop their own, it must include at a minimum the same data elements found in the Department's calculator template. Estimates produced by the net price calculator must be accompanied by a clear and conspicuous disclaimer stating that the estimate may change; that it does not represent a final determination or actual award; and that it is not binding on the Department, the school, or the state. The disclaimer must also include a link to the FAFSA website and state that students must complete the FAFSA to receive an actual Title IV financial aid award. The Financial Aid Shopping Sheet The Shopping Sheet is a resource to help consumers understand their educational costs and the aid available to meet those costs. It is a single page the Department developed that may be used as a stand-alone award letter or as a cover sheet with an institution's existing award letter. The standard format helps consumers easily compare the cost of attendance and aid awards across schools. Use of the Shopping Sheet is voluntary, though we encourage institutions to adopt it for their students. Also, for schools that receive federal funds under the military and veterans educational benefits programs, use of the Shopping Sheet helps meet a disclosure requirement of Executive Order 13607 (see the end of Chapter 3).Financial Aid Shopping Sheet See https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/ guid/aid-offer/index.html for more information, including links to guidance and implementation resources, and see DCL GEN-13-26 and the Electronic Announcement of November 14, 2016 (Revised January 13, 2017) for templates and specifications.Net Price Calculator HEA Sec. 132(h)(3) and (4) The Net Price Calculator Information Center at (http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/Section/Net_ price_calculator ) provides the template as well as FAQs, a zipped file with links to other schools' calculators, and resources for schools to develop their own calculators.

If the school's mission includes providing substantial preparation for students to enroll in another eligible school, it must also determine the transfer-out rate of its certificate- or degree-seeking, first-time, full-time undergraduate students. The annual rates are based on the 12-month period that ended August 31 of the prior year. The rates will track the outcomes for students for whom 150% of the normal time for completion or graduation has elapsed. Normal time is the amount of time necessary for a student to complete all requirements for a degree or certificate according to the institution's catalog. This is typically four years for a bachelor's degree in a standard term-based institution, two years for an associate degree in a standard term-based institution, and the various scheduled times for certificate programs. (See the IPEDS instructions for further details on calculating the rate.) A school must make these annual rates available to the public no later than July 1. With requests from prospective students, the information must be made available prior to them enrolling or entering into any financial obligation with the school.Retention rates 34 CFR 668.41c and 45 Reporting rates to IPEDS The graduation, completion, and transfer- out rates are reported through the Department's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) website.

The log must also include the nature, date, time, and general location of each crime and the disposition of the complaint if known. The school must make an entry or an addition to an entry to the log within two business days (Monday-Friday, except days when the school is closed) of the report of the information to the campus police or security department unless that disclosure is prohibited by law or would jeopardize the confidentiality of the victim. A school may withhold one or more of the required pieces of information if there is clear and convincing evidence that the release of the information would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation or the safety of an individual, cause a suspect to flee or evade detection, or result in the destruction of evidence. However, the school must disclose any information withheld for any of these reasons once the adverse effect is no longer likely to occur. The school must make the crime log for the most recent 60-day period open to public inspection during normal business hours. The school must make any portion of the log older than 60 days available within two business days of a request for public inspection.Crime and fire data on the Web The campus crime and fire safety statistics for schools are at ( http://ope.ed.gov/ security/ ). Crime statistics are also on the College Navigator site ( http://nces.ed.gov/ collegenavigator/ ).VAWA tools The Department of Justice website ( www. changingourcampus.org ) is an online clearinghouse of resources addressing sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. The Department of Education also has an online list of resources that might help schools with their sexual assault training and prevention: https://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/ 20172-153Clery geography \u2014For the purpose of collecting statistics on the crimes described under Crimes to be reported later in this chapter , Clery geography includes buildings and property that are part of the institution's campus, the institution's non-campus buildings and property, and public property within or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus.

It has been amended several times, most recently by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA) enacted March 7, 2013. Among other provisions, VAWA requires institutions to compile statistics for certain crimes that are reported to campus security authorities or local police agencies, including incidents of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. These crime statistics must be reported to the Department through the web-based data collection. Schools must also include certain policies, procedures, and programs pertaining to these crimes in their annual security reports. Final regulations to implement these statutory changes to the Clery Act were published on October 20, 2014, and went into effect on July 1, 2015. See DCL GEN-15-15 for a summary of major changes to the Clery Act regulations. HEA Sec. 485(f) 20 U.S.C. 1092(f) 34 CFR 668.46Crimes to be reported A school must report to the Department and disclose in its annual security report statistics for the three most recent calendar years the number of each of the following crimes that occurred on or within its Clery geography (see Definitions Related to Crime Reporting earlier in this Chapter) and that are reported to local police agencies or to a campus security authority: 4. Primary crimes, including criminal homicide (murder, non- negligent manslaughter, and negligent manslaughter); sex of - fenses (rape, fondling, incest, and statutory assault; burglary; motor vehicle theft; arson; 5. Arrests and referrals for disciplinary actions, including arrests for liquor law violations, drug law violations, and illegal weap - ons possession and persons not arrested for one of those of - fenses but who were referred for campus disciplinary action; 6. Hate crimes, including the number of each type of primary crime listed above that is determined to be a hate crime and the number of the following that are determined to be hate crimes: larceny-theft, simple assault, intimidation, destruction/damage/ vandalism of property; 7. Dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Reported crimes must be recorded A school must include in its crime statistics all crimes listed above occurring on or within its Clery geography that are reported to a campus security authority for the purpose of Clery Act reporting. Clery Act reporting does not require initiating an investigation or disclosing personally identifying information about the victim. A school may not withhold or remove a reported crime from its crime statistics based on a decision by a court, coroner, jury, prosecutor, or other similar noncampus official. But a school may withhold or remove a reported crime from its statistics when sworn or commissioned law enforcement personnel have fully investigated the reported crime and have made a formal determination that the crime report is false or baseless and therefore unfounded. Only sworn or commissioned law enforcement personnel may \"unfound\" a crime report for these purposes. The recovery of stolen property, the low value of stolen property, the refusal of the victim to cooperate with the prosecution, and the failure to make an arrest do not unfound a crime report. A school must report to the Department and disclose in its annual security report statistics the total number of crime reports that were unfounded and subsequently withheld from its crime statistics.Citations Crime log: 34 CFR 668.46(f) 20172-157Fire log A school that has any on-campus student housing facility must maintain a written, easily understood log that records, by the date that the fire was reported, any fire that occurred in an on-campus student housing facility. This log must include the nature, date, time, and general location of each fire. The school must: make an entry or an addition to an entry to the log within two business days of the receipt of the information, make the fire log for the most recent 60-day period open to public inspection during normal business hours, and make any portion of the log older than 60 days available within two business days of a request for public inspection. A school must annually submit a copy of the fire safety statistics to the Department and include the fire safety statistics in its annual report to the campus community.Sample Statement of Availability Schools may use the following sample notice to inform students and employees of the availability of its Combined Annual Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report: MWAH is committed to assisting all members of the MWAH community in providing for their own safety and security. The annual security and fire safety compliance document is available on the UPD website . If you would like to receive the combined Annual Security and Fire Safety Report which contains this information, you can stop by the University Police Department at 6666 President Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20001 or you can request that a copy be mailed to you by calling (XXX) XXX-XXXX. The website and booklet contain information regarding campus security and personal safety including topics such as: crime prevention, fire safety, university police law enforcement authority, crime reporting policies, disciplinary procedures and other matters of importance related to security and safety on campus. They also contain information about crime statistics for the three previous calendar years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus; in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by MWAH; and on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. Fire safety Fire safety requirements were added by the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) of 2008 HEA 485(i) 34 June 20172-158Annual submission of campus security and fire safety statistics Each year, the Department sends a letter to the school's president or chief executive officer with information on accessing the Campus Safety and Security Survey website ( https://surveys.ope.ed.gov/security ), where schools submit statistics for the crimes described under Crimes to be Reported earlier in this Chapter, and for fire safety (see below) for the three most recent calendar years that have available data. The website explains how to tabulate these statistics. The letter contains any changes to the survey, the collection dates for the survey, the name of the person who completed the reporting (the campus safety survey administrator) at the school the previous year, and a new ID and password for completing the survey. Schools with any on-campus student housing facility must submit annual fire safety statistics to the Department. The report must include statistics on the number and causes of fires, as well as fire-related injuries, death, and property damage for each on-campus student housing facility. The fire safety statistics are due at the same time as the crime statistics. Distributing security and fire safety reports to enrolled students and current employees By October 1 of each year, a school must distribute to all enrolled students and current employees its annual security report and fire safety reports through appropriate publications and mailings including direct mailing to each individual through the U.S. Postal Ser - vice, campus mail, or electronic mail; a publication or publications provided directly to each indi - vidual; or posting on an Internet or intranet website (see conditions for Web distribution at the beginning of this chapter).Bookstores and safety reporting If a school contracts with an entity to provide bookstore services and the bookstore is located on-campus, or if it is in any off-campus building or property owned or controlled by the school, the school must include the bookstore among the locations for which it reports campus crime and safety information as provided in 34 CFR 668.46. Handbook for campus crime reporting To assist schools in fully complying with the Clery Act, the Department has developed The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting . The handbook defines the categories of crime and procedures for reporting them, as well as the requirements for timely warnings and maintenance of a daily crime log. The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting also covers fire safety and the required fire safety log. The handbook is available at https://ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/attachments/HandbookforCampusSafetyandSecurityReporting.pdfChapter 6\u2014Consumer DCL FSA HB June 20172-159The two reports can be published together or separately. If published together, the title of the document must clearly state that it contains both the Annual Security Report and the Annual Fire Safety Report. If published separately, each report must contain information on how to directly access the other report. Disseminating reports to prospective students and employees For each of the reports, the school must provide a notice to prospective students and prospective employees that includes a statement of the report's availability, a description of its contents, and an opportunity to request a copy. A school must provide its annual security report and annual fire safety report, upon request, to a prospective student or prospective employee. If the school chooses to provide either its annual security report or annual fire safety report to prospective students and prospective employees by posting the disclosure on an Internet website, the school must follow the procedures for Web dissemination described earlier. Missing persons procedures A school that provides on-campus student housing must establish a missing student notification policy and include a description of the policy in its annual security report to the campus community. The policy must include a list of titles of the persons or organizations to which students, employees, or other individuals should report that a student has been missing for 24 hours; require that any missing student report be referred immediately to the school's police or campus security department (if the school doesn't have such a department, it must refer the report to the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction in the area); and include an option for each student to identify a contact person or persons whom the school shall notify within 24 hours of a determination (by the school's police or campus security department or the local law enforcement agency) that the student is missing.Missing persons procedures\u2014 private right of action The requirements for a school to establish missing persons procedures do not provide a private right of action to any person to enforce a provision of the subsection or create a cause of action against any institution of higher education or any employee of the institution for any civil liability. HEA section 485(j)Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-160Students must be advised that their contact information will be registered confidentially, that this information will be accessible only to authorized campus officials, and that it may not be disclosed, except to law enforcement personnel in furtherance of a missing person in - vestigation; if they are under 18 years of age and not emancipated, the school must notify a custodial parent or guardian within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing, in addition to notifying any additional contact person designated by the student; and the school will notify the local law enforcement agency within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing unless the local law enforcement agency was the entity that made the determination that the student is missing. When a student who resides in an on-campus student housing facility is determined to have been missing for 24 hours, the school must notify within 24 hours the contact person (if the student has designated one), and the student's custodial parent or guardian (if the student is less than 18 years old and is not emancipated). In all cases, the school must inform the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction in the area within 24 hours that the student is missing. Emergency response and evacuation A school must develop emergency response and evacuation procedures and include a description of its procedures in its annual security report to the campus community. A school must develop procedures to immediately notify the campus community upon the confirmation of a significant emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees occurring on the campus. At a minimum, schools must have procedures to confirm that a significant emergency or dangerous situation (as described above) exists; determine the appropriate segment or segments of the campus community to receive a notification, the content of the notification; and to initiate the notification system;Definition of \"test\" Regularly scheduled drills, exercises, and appropriate follow-through activities designed for assessment and evaluation of emergency plans and capabilities.Publicizing procedures The school must publicize its emergency response and evacuation procedures in conjunction with at least one test per calendar year. The school must document each test with a description of the exercise, stating the date and time, and indicating whether it was announced or unannounced.Chapter 6\u2014Consumer Information & School ReportingCFR Glossary DCL FSA 20172-161 disseminate emergency information to the larger community; and test the emergency response and evacuation procedures on at least an annual basis, including announced or unannounced tests. The school must compile a list of the titles of those persons or organizations responsible for determining whether an emergency or dangerous situation exists and who are authorized to initiate the notification process and include this information in the annual report. In an emergency or a dangerous situation, a school must, without delay and accounting for the safety of the community, determine the content of the notification and initiate the notification system unless issuing a notification will, in the judgment of responsible authorities, compromise efforts to assist a victim or contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the emergency. Timely warning and emergency notification A school must, in a manner that is timely, that withholds as confidential the names and other identifying information of victims , and that will aid in the prevention of similar crimes, report to the campus community on crimes that are included in its campus crime statistics (see the discussion under Crimes to be Reported earlier in this Chapter), or reported to local police agencies or to campus security authorities (as identified under the school's statement of current campus policies), and considered by the school to represent a threat to students and employees. A school is not required to provide a timely warning with respect to crimes reported to a pastoral or professional counselor. If there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees occurring on campus, a school must follow its emergency notification procedures. A school that follows its emergency notification procedures is not required to issue a timely warning based on the same circumstances; however, the school must provide adequate follow-up information to the community as needed.Volume 2\u2014School 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-162DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE PREVENTION A school that participates in the FSA programs must provide to its students, faculty, and employees information to prevent drug and alcohol abuse, and it must also have a drug and alcohol prevention program, as discussed later. In addition, a school that participates in the Campus-Based Programs must have a drug-free awareness program for its employees that includes a notice to them of unlawful activities and the actions the school will take against an employee who violates these prohibitions. Information to be included in drug prevention materials for students and employees A school must provide the following in its materials: standards of conduct that clearly prohibit, at a minimum, the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of drugs and alcohol by students and employees on the school's property or as part of the school's activities; a description of the sanctions under local, state, and federal law for unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol; a description of any drug and alcohol counseling, treatment, or rehabilitation programs available to students and employees; a description of the health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs and alcohol; and a clear statement that the school will impose sanctions on stu - dents and employees for violations of the standards of conduct (consistent with local, state, and federal law) and a description of these sanctions, up to and including expulsion, termination of employment, and referral for prosecution. Distribution of materials to all students and employees The school may include this information in publications such as student or employee handbooks, provided that these publications are distributed to each student and employee. Merely making drug prevention materials available to those who wish to take them is not sufficient. The school must use a method that will reach every student and employee, such as the method used to distribute grade reports or paychecks. The school must distribute these materials annually. If new students enroll or new employees are hired after the initial distribution for the year, the school must make sure that they also receive the materials.Drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs These requirements are found in 34 CFR 86\u2014Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention. The regulations published in the Federal Register , August 16, 1990, offer a number of suggestions for developing a drug prevention program. Drug-Free Workplace The FSA requirements are derived from the 1989 Amendments to the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Acts of 1986 and 1988. See Public Law 101-226. Because a school applies for and receives its Campus-Based allocation directly from the Department, the school is considered to be a federal grant recipient and as such is required to make a good faith effort on a continuing basis to maintain a drug-free workplace. 34 CFR Part 84 Also see the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (Public Law 101-690) Drug and alcohol prevention Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (Public Law 101-226) Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (Public Law 101-690) 34 CFR 84 Government-Wide Requirements for Drug-Free Workplace 34 CFR 86 Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention 34 CFR 668.14(c) Notice of penalties A school must provide to every student upon enrollment a separate, clear, and conspicuous written notice with information on the penalties associated with drug- related offenses. For students who have lost Title IV eligibility due to drug convictions, the school must provide a separate, clear notice of the loss and how to regain eligibility. See Volume 1 of the Handbook for information about losing and regaining eligibility in these cases. HEA section 485(k)Failure to have a prevention program 34 CFR June 20172-163Drug & alcohol abuse prevention program Every participating school must certify that on the date it signs the Program Participation Agreement it has a drug and acohol abuse prevention program in operation that is accessible to any officer, employee, or student at the school. The program adopted by the school must include an annual distribution to all students, faculty, and staff of information concerning drug and alcohol abuse and the school's prevention program. A school must review its program once every two years to determine its effectiveness and to ensure that its sanctions are being enforced. As a part of this biennial review, the school must determine the number of drug and alcohol-related violations and fatalities that occur on a school's campus or as part of any of the school's activities and that are reported to campus officials; and the number and type of sanctions that are imposed by the school as a result of drug and alcohol-related violations and fatalities on the school's campus or as part of any of the school's activities. The school must make available upon request the results of the review as well as the data and methods supporting its conclusions. If a school does not certify that it has a prevention program or fails to carry out a prevention program, the Department may terminate any or all forms of federal financial aid to the school and may require it to repay any or all federal financial aid that it received while not in compliance. Drug-Free Workplace requirements for Campus-Based schools A school that participates in the Campus-Based Programs must take certain steps to provide a drug-free workplace, including establishing a drug-free awareness program to provide infor - mation to employees, distributing a notice to its employees of prohibited unlawful activities and the school's planned actions against an employee who violates these prohibitions, and notifying the Department and taking appropriate action when it learns of an employee's conviction under any criminal drug statute. A school's administrative cost allowance may be used to help defray related expenses, such as the cost of printing informational materials given to employees. The administrative cost allowance is discussed in Volume 6: Campus-Based Programs .Additional sources of information The following resources are available for schools that are developing prevention programs: The Drug-Free Workplace Helpline\u2014 Provides information to private entities about workplace programs and drug testing. Proprietary and private nonprofit schools may call this line (1-800-967-5752). (www.samhsa.gov/workplace ) Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration\u2014SAMHSA (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services) Treatment and Referral Hotline 1-800-662-HELP (1-800-662-4357) Publications: (http://store.samhsa.gov/home ) Measuring the effectiveness of prevention programs The effectiveness of a school's prevention program may be measured by tracking the number of drug- and alcohol-related disciplinary actions, treatment referrals, and incidents recorded by campus police or other law enforcement officials. You may also find it useful to track the number of students or employees attending self-help or other counseling groups related to alcohol or drug abuse and to survey student, faculty, and employee attitudes and perceptions about the drug and alcohol problem on campus.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility 20172-164The drug-free workplace requirements apply to all offices and departments of a school that receives Campus-Based funds. Organizations that contract with the school are considered subgrantees not subject to the requirements of the Drug-Free Workplace Act. INFORMATION ABOUT ATHLETICS The EADA Report The Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) requires a school that has an intercollegiate athletic program to make prospective students aware of its commitment to providing equitable athletic opportunities for its male and female students. As part of this requirement, each fall schools must make certain information available to students, prospective students, and the public in easily accessible places and must also report the information to the Department. The annual report, officially called The Report on Athletic Program Participation Rates and Financial Support Data and commonly referred to as the EADA Report, must include information on the number of male and female full-time undergraduate stu - dents that attended the school (undergraduate students are those who are consistently designated as such by the school), the total amount and ratio of athletically related student aid awarded to male athletes compared to female athletes, the expenses incurred by the school for men's and women's sports, total annual revenues for men's or women's sports, the annual school salary of non-volunteer head coaches and as - sistant coaches for men's and women's teams, and for each varsity team in intercollegiate competition, the num - ber and gender of participants and coaches, operating expenses, etc. A school must publish its EADA report by October 15 and make it available upon request to students, prospective students, and the public. For example, a school may make hard copies of the report available in intercollegiate athletic offices, admissions offices, or libraries, or by providing a copy to all students in their electronic mailbox. Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) HEA Section 485(e) and (g) 668.41(g) 34 CFR 668.47 EADA data on the Web The Department posts the EADA reports for participating schools on the Web at (http://ope.ed.gov/athletics/ ). Definitions Undergraduate students\u2014 For purposes of \u00a7668.45 and 668.48 (completion and graduation rates for students and student athletes) only, means students enrolled in a bachelor's degree program, an associate degree program, or a vocational or technical program below the baccalaureate. 34 CFR 668.41(a) Certificate or degree-seeking student \u2014a student enrolled in a course of credit who is recognized by the institution as seeking a degree or certificate.Chapter 6\u2014Consumer Information & School 20172-165Exception to providing completion/ graduation rates for student athletes A school does not have to provide a report on completion or graduation rates to the prospective student athlete and the athlete's parents, high school coach, and guidance counselor, if\u2014 (A) The institution is a member of a national collegiate athletic association, (B) The association compiles data on behalf of its member institutions, which the Department determines are substantially comparable to those required by \u00a7668.48(a), and (C) The association distributes the compilation to all secondary schools in the United States. 34 CFR 668.41(f)A school must provide the report promptly to anyone who requests the information. For example, a school may not refuse to provide a copy of the report to the news media, and the school may not require an individual requesting the information to come to the school to view the report. A school may not charge a fee for the information. A school must submit its equity in athletics report to the Department via the EADA survey website ( https://surveys.ope.ed.gov/athletics ) annually within 15 days of making it available to students, prospective students, and the public. Note that a password and user ID are required for use of this website. They are sent by the Department to the chief administrator at the school. For help with this site, contact eadahelp@ westat.com . For specific categories and reporting rules, please see the EADA User's Guide for the online survey. Completion and graduation rates for student athletes Schools that offer athletically related student aid must produce an annual report that includes: The number of students, categorized by race and gender, who attended the school in the year prior to the submission of the report. The number of the students above who received athletically related student aid, categorized by race and gender within each sport. The completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer- out rate of all the entering, certificate- or degree-seeking, full- time, undergraduate students described in 34 CFR \u00a7668.45(a) (1), categorized by race and gender. The completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer- out rate of the entering students described in \u00a7668.45(a)(1) who received athletically related student aid, categorized by race and gender within each sport. The average completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer-out rate for the four most recent completing or gradu - ating classes of entering students described in \u00a7668.45(a)(1), (3), and (4), categorized by race and gender. If a school has rates for fewer than four of those classes, it must disclose the rates it has.Waiver of completion/graduation data calculation A school does not have to calculate and make available its completion or graduation rate (and, if applicable, transfer-out rate) if it is a member of an athletic association or conference that has voluntarily published completion or graduation rate data or has agreed to publish data and the Department has granted a waiver of the requirements to provide these rates to coaches and guidance counselors. To receive a waiver, your school or its athletic association or conference must submit a written application to the Department that explains why it believes the data the athletic association or conference publishes are accurate and substantially comparable to the information required by this section. Even if the waiver is granted, your school must comply with the requirements of \u00a7668.41(d)(3) (upon request, providing its retention rate to a prospective student) and (f) (providing retention rates and completion or graduation rates for prospective student athletes and their parents, high school coach, and guidance counselor). 34 CFR 668.45(e)(1)Volume 2\u2014School June 20172-166 The average completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer-out rate of the four most recent completing or graduat - ing classes of entering students described in \u00a7668.45 (a)(1) who received athletically related student aid, categorized by race and gender within each sport. If a school has rates for fewer than four of those classes, it must disclose the rates it has. A school must provide this report to prospective student athletes, their parents, high school coach, and guidance counselor (see the sidebar exception). The school must also submit this report to the Department each year by July 1 through the IPEDS website. The definition of athletically related student aid used here is the same definition that is also used for the EADA disclosure requirements. The definitions of certificate- or degree-seeking students, first-time undergraduate students, undergraduate students, and normal time are the same as those used for the calculation of completion or graduation and transfer-out rates for a school's general student body DCL 20172-167TEXTBOOK INFORMATION To the maximum extent practicable, a school must post verified textbook pricing information for both required and recommended materials for all classes (i.e., not just the school's online classes) on the schedule that the school has posted online. This pricing information must include the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) and retail price for all required and recommended textbooks and supplemental materials for each course listed in the institution's course schedule used for preregistration and registration. If the ISBN is not available, the pricing information must include the publisher and copyright date, as well as the title and author. If the school determines that disclosure of this pricing information is not practicable, it may substitute the designation \"To Be Determined (TBD)\" in lieu of the required pricing information. If applicable, the school must include on its written course schedule a reference to the textbook information available on its Internet schedule and the Internet address for that schedule. Schools are encouraged to provide information on renting textbooks, purchasing used textbooks, textbook buy-back programs, and alternative content delivery programs. A school must provide the following information to its bookstore if the bookstore requests it: the school's course schedule for the subsequent academic pe - riod; and for each course or class offered, the information it must include on its Internet course schedule for required and recommended textbooks and supplemental material, the number of students enrolled, and the maximum student enrollment.Textbook information The statutory requirement regarding textbook disclosures was described in DCL GEN-08-12. Further guidance was given in GEN-10-09. Also note that the law requires textbook publishers to provide information to faculty about pricing, copyright dates of previous editions, content revisions, alternate formats, etc. HEA section 133Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-168LOAN COUNSELING Entrance counseling Entrance counseling is required for all first-time student Direct Loan borrowers. Before making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loan to a borrower who has not received a prior Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loan or Federal Stafford or SLS Loan, you must ensure that he receives entrance counseling. Similarly, you must ensure that a graduate or professional student who is borrowing a Direct PLUS Loan has received entrance counseling, unless he received a prior graduate/professional Direct or Federal PLUS Loan. While there are disclosure requirements for Perkins loan borrowers, entrance loan counseling is recommended but not required (see Volume 6 ), nor is it required for parent PLUS borrowers except as explained in the margin. For information on counseling requirements for the TEACH Grant program, please see the sidebar on TEACH Grant Counseling found next to the discussion under TEACH exit counseling later in this chapter. You may not require that students complete additional counseling (except for exit counseling), but you may provide more information, resources, and advisement that students can choose to make use of. (See the discussion under Providing additional information later in this chapter.) Also, you may include in your entrance counseling more material and information than what is required in the regulations (in the discussion under DL Entrance Counseling\u2014Required Elements later in this chapter). This extra content can be provided as part of in-person individual or group training or through your website, other electronic means, written materials, or different methods. The added material must be reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to students' borrowing decisions and may not be administered in a way that unreasonably impedes their ability to borrow. So you can require that students take a test or evaluation of what they learned in counseling, but you cannot establish a passing score that they must get to receive a Direct Loan. You can require first-time student borrowers to complete a worksheet, budget, or other exercise designed to improve financial literacy and understanding of the implications of borrowing, but you cannot require them to justify the need for a loan. Your required entrance counseling may consist of a workshop, loan orientation presentation, or similar activity. See DCL GEN-15-06 for more information.Loan counseling and disclosures 34 CFR 674.16(a) See also DCL GEN-16-05 about the Perkins Loan Extension Act of 2015 for Perkins disclosures in addition to those in the regulation cited above. Alternative entrance counseling approaches The DL regulations explain how a school may adopt alternative approaches as a part of its quality assurance plan; see 34 CFR 685.304(a)(8).Loan counseling materials Schools can order counseling materials, such as the entrance and exit counseling guides, from the FSA Pubs website at ( www. fsapubs.gov ). Special PLUS loan counseling Special loan counseling is required for any PLUS Loan applicant, student or parent, who has an adverse credit history but who qualifies for a PLUS Loan either by getting a loan endorser or being reconsidered due to extenuating circumstances. While the counseling is mandatory only for these borrowers, the Department offers voluntary counseling for all PLUS borrowers. Note that this special counseling is separate from the entrance counseling that all graduate and professional student PLUS Loan borrowers must complete. See 34 CFR 685.304(a)(2) and the electronic announcement from January 27, & School ReportingCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-169Exit counseling A Perkins Loan borrower or Direct Loan student borrower who is graduating, leaving school, or dropping below half-time enrollment is required to complete exit counseling. If the borrower drops out without notifying your school, you must confirm that he has completed online counseling or mail exit counseling material to him at his last known address. It is also acceptable to email the information to his home (not school) email address if you have it. The print or PDF version of the Exit Counseling Guide for Federal Student Loan Borrowers satisfies this requirement for Direct Loan student borrowers. Whatever material you use, you must mail or email it within 30 days of learning that the borrower has withdrawn or failed to participate in an exit counseling session. When mailing exit materials to students who have left school, you're not required to use certified mail with a return receipt requested, but you must document in their file that the materials were sent. If they fail to provide updated contact information, you are not required to take further action. Providing borrower information at separation Personal information collected for exit counseling provided by the school must be given to students' loan servicer within 60 days. Students authorize their school to release information to lenders in the loan promissory note they signed. No further permission is needed. Students who complete loan exit counseling online at ( www.studentloans.gov ) fulfill this requirement; NSLDS provides the completion information to the loan holders. Counseling methods The Direct Loan Program offers both entrance and exit counseling on the Web for students. There is PLUS Loan counseling for parents and graduate students as well. Your school may also elect to provide entrance counseling through an in-person session or by providing a separate written form to the student that she signs and returns to the school. If your staff are conducting in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions can help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive programs to ensure that the student understands the terms and conditions of his loans. Regardless of the counseling methods your school uses, it must document that the student received entrance and exit counseling, and it must ensure that an individual with expertise in the FSA programs is reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer the student's questions.Updating borrower information A Direct Loan school should send updated borrower information obtained during school-provided exit counseling to the federal loan servicer to whom the loan has been assigned. DL Online Counseling Students can take loan entrance and exit counseling at https://studentloans.gov. PLUS Loan counseling for parents and graduate students is also available. Your school will receive notification (via SAIG) of online loan counseling completed by borrowers. Completed loan counseling can also be viewed on the COD website at https://cod.ed.gov/. If your school documents that borrowers have completed the Department's online counseling, it has satisfied its responsibility for electronic counseling.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-170Entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans 34 CFR 685.304(a)(6) Entrance counseling for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loan borrowers must: (i) Explain the use of a master promissory note (MPN); (ii Emphasize to the borrower the seriousness and importance of the repayment obligation the student borrower is assuming; (iii) Describe the likely consequences of default, including adverse credit reports, delinquent debt collection procedures under federal law, and litigation; (iv) Emphasize that the student borrower is obligated to repay the full amount of the loan even if the student borrower does not complete the program, does not complete the program within the regular time for program completion, is unable to obtain employment upon completion, or is otherwise dissatisfied with or does not receive the educational or other services that the student borrower purchased from the school; (v) Inform the student borrower of sample monthly repayment amounts based on\u2014 (A) A range of student levels of indebtedness of Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrowers or student borrowers with Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, and Direct PLUS Loans, depending on the types of loans the borrower has obtained; or (B) The average indebtedness of other borrowers in the same program at the same school as the borrower; (vi) To the extent practicable, explain the effect of accepting the loan to be disbursed on the eligibility of the borrower for other forms of student financial assistance; (vii) Provide information on how interest accrues and is capitalized during periods when the interest is not paid by either the borrower or the Secretary; (viii) Inform the borrower of the option to pay the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan while the borrower is in school; (ix) Explain the definition of half-time enrollment at the school, during regular terms and summer school, if applicable, and the consequences of not maintaining half-time enrollment; (x) Explain the importance of contacting the appropriate offices at the school if the borrower withdraws prior to completing the borrower's program of study so that the school can provide exit counseling, including information regarding the borrower's repayment options and loan consolidation; (xi) Provide information on the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and how the borrower can access the borrower's records; (xii) Provide the name of and contact information for the individual the borrower may contact if the borrower has any questions about the borrower's rights and responsibilities or the terms and conditions of the loan; and (xiii) For first-time borrowers, explain the limitation on eligibility for Direct Subsidized Loans and possible borrower responsibility for accruing interest, including\u2014DL Entrance Counseling\u2014Required Elements (A) The possible loss of eligibility for additional Direct Subsidized Loans; (B) How a borrower's maximum eligibility period, remaining eligibility period, and subsidized usage period are calculated; (C) The possibility that the borrower could become responsible for accruing interest on previously received Direct Subsidized Loans and the portion of a Direct Consolidation Loan that repaid a Direct Subsidized Loan during in-school status, the grace period, authorized periods of deferment, and certain periods under the Income-Based Repayment and Pay As You Earn Repayment plans; and (D) The impact of borrower responsibility for accruing interest on the borrower's total debt.

Also, all recipients must receive TEACH Grant exit counseling, which is on the NSLDS Student Access site ( www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA ). You will receive reports from NSLDS on all students who have completed TEACH exit counseling. If they don't complete exit counseling on the NSLDS website, you must ensure that the counseling is provided either in person, through interactive electronic means, or by mailing written counseling materials (such as the PDF version of the exit counseling program on the NSLDS website) to their last known address. With an unannounced withdrawal of a grant recipient from school (or from a TEACH Grant-eligible program), you must provide this counseling within 30 days of learning of the withdrawal. Counseling for correspondence and study-abroad students If the student has enrolled in a study-abroad program (approved by a U.S. school for credit) or a correspondence or distance learning program and has not previously received an FFEL or Direct Loan at that school, the school must document that the student has completed online entrance counseling that meets FSA requirements or provide entrance counseling information by mail before releasing loan money. In the case of exit counseling for correspondence programs or study abroad programs, the school may mail or email the borrower written counseling materials within 30 days after the borrower completes the program, with a request that he provide the contact and personal information that would ordinarily have been collected through the counseling process.TEACH Grant Counseling Students complete TEACH Grant initial and subsequent counseling and agreement to serve (ATS) processes at https://studentloans.gov . Students complete TEACH Grant exit counseling on the NSLDS Student Access site at www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA/ . Schools are responsible for TEACH recipients receiving exit counseling when they are no longer enrolled in the program. See NSLDS Newsletter #33 on http://ifap.ed.gov for information on TEACH exit counseling and on related reporting tools on the NSLDS Professional Access site at https://www.nsldsfap.ed.gov/nslds_FAP/Chapter 6\u2014Consumer Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-173Providing additional information Your school can take additional steps to counsel students, for example, in developing a budget, estimating need for loans, and planning for repayment. You can reinforce messages to borrowers; with each disbursement you can remind them about the importance of SAP, planning for future employment, and staying in touch with the loan servicer. More ideas for loan counseling are given in the \"Sample Default Management and Prevention Plan.\" Financial literacy You should provide borrowers with counseling at various stages of enrollment, interactive tools to manage debt, repayment options, school contact information, and information about the income potential of occupations relevant to their course of study. You can give this information through a variety of media such as face-to-face counseling, classes, publications, e-tutorials, e-mailed newsletters, and supplements to award letters. You can offer a financial literacy course on a credit or non- credit basis as long as receiving a loan is not contingent upon taking the course. In addition, you should also refer borrowers to the Department's Financial Awareness Counseling Tool (FACT) available at https:// studentaid.ed.gov/sa/prepare-for-college/budgeting/creating-your- budget. At-risk students You should identify and provide special counseling for at-risk students, such as those who withdraw prematurely from their educational programs, who do not meet SAP standards, or both. The most recent sample default plan was an attachment to GEN-05-14 and is also available under \"Default Prevention Resources\" on June 20172-174PRIVATE EDUCATION LOANS A private education loan is a non-FSA loan that is made to a borrower expressly for postsecondary education expenses, regardless of whether the loan is provided through the educational institution that the student attends or directly to the borrower from the private educational lender. (See the sidebar definition for exclusions.) Private education loans made by schools include Public Health Service Loans, such as Health Professions Student Loans. However, Federal Perkins Loans are not considered to be private educational loans. If a private education loan is part of a preferred lender arrangement, it is subject to the rules for those arrangements (described later in this section). Disclosures required for private education loans A school or affiliated organization that provides information regarding a private education loan from a lender to a prospective borrower must provide the following disclosures, even if it does not participate in a preferred lender arrangement. The private education loan disclosures must provide the prospective borrower with the information re - quired by 15 U.S.C. 1638(e)(1) [12 CFR 226.47(a) in the Fed - eral Reserve System regulations], and inform the prospective borrower that she may qualify for FSA loans or other assistance from the FSA programs and that the terms and conditions of an FSA loan may be more favorable than the provisions of private education loans. The school or affiliate must ensure that information about private education loans is presented in such a manner as to be distinct from information about FSA loans. The school must, upon the request of the applicant, discuss with her the availability of federal, state, and institutional student financial aid.Private education loans 34 CFR 668.14(b)(28) and (29) Requirements for preferred lender list 34 CFR 601.10 Self-certification form 34 CFR 601.11(d) Information required to complete the self- certification form 34 CFR 668.14(b)(29) Private education loan definition The definition of a private education loan given at the beginning of this section is based on the definition given in the Federal Reserve System regulations, which excludes some forms of credit, including: (1) An extension of credit under an open end consumer credit plan, a reverse mortgage transaction, a residential mortgage transaction, or any other loan that is secured by real property or a dwelling; or (2) An extension of credit in which the educational institution is the lender if\u2014 (i) The term of the extension of credit is 90 days or less; or (ii) An interest rate will not be applied to the credit balance and the term of the extension of credit is one year or less, even if the credit is payable in more than four installments. 12 CFR 226.46(b)(5) Authority: 20 USC 1019 Private educational lender definition 15 USC 1650(a)(6) (A) a financial institution, as defined in section 1813 of Title 12 that solicits, makes, or extends private education loans; (B) a federal credit union, as defined in section 1752 of Title 12 that solicits, makes, or extends private education loans; and (C) any other person engaged in the business of soliciting, making, or extending private education loans. Definition 34 CFR 601.2 Institution-affiliated organization \u2014one that is directly or indirectly related to a covered institution and that recommends, promotes, or endorses education loans for students attending the covered institution or their families. An institution- affiliated organization may include an alumni organization, athletic organization, foundation, or social, academic, or professional organization of a covered institution and does not include any lender with respect to any education loan secured, made, or extended by such lender.Chapter 6\u2014Consumer Information & School ReportingCFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-175Self-certification form for private education loans A lender must obtain a signed, completed self-certification form from the loan applicant before initiating a private education loan. The applicant may obtain a copy of the self-certification form from the private lender and submit it to your school for completion or confirmation. Your school may also, at its option, provide the information needed to complete the form directly to the lender. If the loan applicant (the student or parent) requests a copy of the self-certification form from your school, you must provide it. He may also request, if the student has been enrolled or admitted to your school, that you complete section 2 before providing him the form. You must do that to the extent that you have the information. Section 2 of the form collects the student's cost of attendance (see Volume 3, Chapter 2 ), the estimated financial assistance (EFA), and the difference between them. The EFA includes, for students who have completed the FAFSA, the amounts of aid that replace the EFC, which you determined according to the rules in Volume 3, Chapter 7 ; it does not include the private education loan(s) that the self-certification form is for. Schools as private lenders Note that if a school solicits, makes, or extends private education loans, it is considered to be a private educational lender that is subject to the Federal Reserve's regulations on private educational lenders. When the school is the private education lender, it must complete and provide the self-certification form to the loan applicant and subsequently obtain the signed form from the applicant before consummating the private education loan. In some cases a school may be making more than one private education loan to an applicant. For example, a school may be providing a loan funded by the school (or from donor-directed contributions) and a Public Health Service loan. In such cases, the school can provide one self- certification form to the applicant.Self-certification form for private education loans Schools must provide the Private Education Loan Applicant Self-Certification (see DCL GEN-13-15) upon request from the loan applicant. A school may post an exact copy of the self-certification form on its website for applicants to download, or it may provide them a paper copy directly. The self-certification must be printed by the school or lender with black ink on white paper. The typeface, point size, and general presentation of the form may not be changed from the version approved by OMB. The only changes that may be made to the self-certification form are: Bold type in section headings may be removed, and bold or italic type may be added to the instructions. Schools and lenders may use any blank spaces at the top, bottom, or sides of the form for bar coding or other school/ lender-specific information.

Public health service loans Loans made under Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act are considered to be private education loans, including Health Professions Student Loan (HPSL) Primary Care Loan (PCL) Loans for Disadvantaged Students (LDS) Nursing Student Loan (NSL) These loans are administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (www.hrsa.gov ).Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-176Preferred lender lists For any year in which the school has a preferred lender arrangement, it will at least annually compile, maintain, and make available for students attending the school and the families of such students a list in print or other medium of the specific lenders for private education loans that the school recommends, promotes, or endorses in accordance with such preferred lender arrangement. The school's preferred lender list must fully disclose why it participates in a preferred lender arrangement with each lender on the preferred lender list, particularly with respect to terms and conditions or provisions favorable to the borrower; and that the students attending the school (or their families) do not have to borrow from a lender on the preferred lender list; and when available, the information identified on a model disclo - sure form to be developed by the Department for each type of education loan that is offered through a preferred lender arrangement to the school's students or their families.

A misleading statement includes any statement that has the likelihood or tendency to mislead. Misrepresentation includes any statement that omits information in such a way as to make the statement false, erroneous, or misleading. Thus, a statement may still be misleading, even if it is true on its face. A statement is any communication made in writing, visually, orally, or through other means. This definition applies to statements made by an eligible school, the school's representatives, or any ineligible institution, organization, or person with whom the eligible institution has an agreement to provide educational programs or those that provide marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services. Misrepresentation includes the dissemination of a student endorsement or testimonial that a student gives either under duress or because the school required the student to make such an endorsement or testimonial to participate in a program. A school, one of its representatives, or a related party (see above) engages in substantial misrepresentation when it does so about the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. Substantial misrepresentation is defined as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person's detriment. Substantial misrepresentations are prohibited in all forms, including those made in any advertising or promotional materials or in the marketing or sale of courses or programs of instruction offered by the institution. A school is responsible for the harm caused by its misrepresentations, even if such misrepresentations cannot be attributed to institutional intent or knowledge and are the result of inadvertent or innocent mistakes. Sanctions If the Department determines that an eligible institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, it may revoke the eligible institution's program participation agreement if the institu - tion is provisionally certified under 34 CFR 668.13(c); impose limitations on the institution's participation in the FSA programs if the institution is provisionally certified un - der 34 CFR 668.13(c); deny participation applications made on behalf of the institution; or initiate a proceeding against the eligible institution under subpart G of 34 CFR 668.Misrepresentation 34 CFR Subpart F 34 CFR 668.71(c) Misrepresenting educational program CFR 668.72 Misrepresenting financial 34 CFR 668.73 Employability of graduates 34 CFR 668.74 Relationship with CFR 668.72 Nature of educational program Misrepresentation concerning the nature of an eligible institution's educational program includes but is not limited to false, erroneous, or misleading statements concerning\u2014 (a) The particular type(s), specific source(s), nature and extent of its institutional, programmatic, or specialized accreditation; (b)(1) Whether a student may transfer course credits earned at the institution to any other institution; (2) Conditions under which the institution will accept transfer credits earned at another institution; (c) Whether successful completion of a course of instruction qualifies a student\u2014 (1) For acceptance to a labor union or similar organization; or (2) To receive, to apply to take, or to take the examination required to receive, a local, state, or federal license, or a nongovernmental certification required as a precondition for employment, or to perform certain functions in the states in which the educational program is offered, or to meet additional conditions that the institution knows or reasonably should know are generally needed to secure employment in a recognized occupation for which the program is represented to prepare students; (d) The requirements for successfully completing the course of study or program and the circumstances that would constitute grounds for terminating the student's enrollment; (e) Whether its courses are recommended or have been the subject of unsolicited testimonials or endorsements by\u2014 (1) Vocational counselors, high schools, colleges, educational organizations, employment agencies, members of a particular industry, students, former students, or others; or (2) Governmental officials for governmental employment; (f) Its size, location, facilities, or equipment; (g) The availability, frequency, and appropriateness of its courses and programs to the employment objectives that it states its programs are designed to meet; (h) The nature, age, and availability of its training devices or equipment and their appropriateness to the employment objectives that it states its programs and courses are designed to meet; (i) The number, availability, and qualifications, including the training and experience, of its faculty and other personnel; (j) The availability of part-time employment or other forms of financial assistance; (k) The nature and availability of any tutorial or specialized instruction, guidance and counseling, or other supplementary assistance it will provide its students before, during or after the completion of a course; (l) The nature or extent of any prerequisites established for enrollment in any course; (m) The subject matter, content of the course of study, or any other fact related to the degree, diploma, certificate of completion, or any similar document that the student is to be, or is, awarded upon completion of the course of study; (n) Whether the academic, professional, or occupational degree that the institution will confer upon completion of the course of study has been authorized by the appropriate state educational agency. This type of misrepresentation includes, in the case of a degree that has not been authorized by the appropriate state educational agency or that requires specialized accreditation, any failure by an eligible institution to disclose these facts in any advertising or promotional materials that reference such degree; or (o) Any matters required to be disclosed to prospective students under \u00a7\u00a7 668.42 and 668.43 of this part.

(Authority: 20 June 20172-180REPORTING ON FOREIGN SOURCES GIFTS Federal law requires most 2-year and 4-year postsecondary schools (whether or not they are eligible to participate in the FSA programs) to report ownership or control by foreign sources and contracts with or gifts from the same foreign source that, alone or combined, have a value of $250,000 or more for a calendar year. Who must report A school (and each campus of a multi-campus school) must report this information if it is legally authorized to provide a program beyond the second - ary level within a state, provides a program that awards a bachelor's degree or a more advanced degree, or provides at least a two-year program ac - ceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree, is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency, and is extended any federal financial aid (directly or indirectly through another entity or person) or receives support from the extension of any such federal assistance to the school's sub- units. Timing and content of submission A school must report this information by January 31 or July 31 (whichever is sooner) after the date of receipt of the gifts, date of the contract, or date of ownership or control. The January 31 report should cover the period July 1-December 31 of the previous year, and the July 31 report should cover January 1-June 30 of the same year. Information to be reported Using the E-App, you must report the following information in Section K, question 71: for gifts received from or contracts entered into with a for - eign government, the name of the country and the aggregate amount of all gifts and contracts received from each foreign government;Definitions A foreign source is a foreign government, including an agency of a foreign government; a legal entity created solely under the laws of a foreign state or states; an individual who is not a citizen or na - tional of the United States; and an agent acting on behalf of a foreign source. A gift is any gift of money or property. A contract is any agreement for the acquisition by purchase, lease, or barter of property or services for the direct benefit or use of either of the parties. Restricted or conditional gift or contract A restricted or conditional gift or contract is any endowment, gift, grant, contract, award, present, or property of any kind that includes provisions regarding the employment, assignment, or termi - nation of faculty; the establishment of departments, cen - ters, research or lecture programs, or new faculty positions; the selection or admission of students; or the award of grants, loans, scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial aid restricted to students of a specified country, religion, sex, ethnic origin, or political opinion.Foreign gifts references Higher Education Act: Sec. 117 Reminder to schools of requirements for reporting foreign gifts. DCL GEN-04-11, Oct. 4, FSA HB June 20172-181Penalties If a school fails to comply with the requirements of this law in a timely manner, the Department is authorized to undertake a civil action in federal district court to ensure compliance. Following a knowing or willful failure to comply, a school must reimburse the U.S. Treasury for the full cost of obtaining compliance.

The school must provide the Department with a statement from the appropriate state official indicating that the school has met the state requirements. If another department, agency, or bureau of the executive branch of the federal government has substantially similar re - quirements for public disclosure of gifts from or contracts with a foreign source, the school may submit a copy of this report to the Department. ANTI-LOBBYING PROVISIONS Prohibition on use of FSA funds FSA funds may not be used to pay any person for trying to influence a member of Congress or an employee of a member of Con - gress, or an officer or employee of Congress or any agency. This prohibition applies to the making of a federal grant or loan, awarding federal contracts, and entering into federal cooperative agreements, as well as to the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement. In addition, FSA funds may not be used to hire a registered lobbyist or to pay any person or entity for securing an earmark. Schools receiving FSA funds will have to certify their compliance with these requirements annually.Anti-lobbying certification and disclosure Section 319 of Pub. L. 101-121, enacted October 23, 1989, amended title 31, United States Code, by adding a new section 1352, entitled \"Limitation on Use of Appropriated Funds to Influence Certain Federal Contracting and Financial Transactions,'' commonly known as the Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment. As a result of that legislation, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued interim final common regulations on February 26, 1990, for implementing and complying with the law. See 34 CFR Part 82.Prohibition on use of FSA funds HEOA 2008 section 119 (no corresponding HEA section) Effective date: August 14, 2008Chapter 6\u2014Consumer FSA HB June 20172-183Campus-Based disclosure If a school that receives more than $100,000 in Campus-Based funds has used non-federal funds to pay any person for lobbying activities in connection with the Campus-Based Programs, the school must submit a disclosure form (Standard Form LLL) to the Department. The school must update this disclosure at least annually and when changes occur. The disclosure form must be signed by the chief executive officer (CEO). A school is advised to retain a copy in its files. The school must require that this certification be included in the award documents for all subawards at all tiers (including subcontracts, subgrants, and contracts under grants, loans, and cooperative agreements) and that all subrecipients shall certify and disclose accordingly. VOTER REGISTRATION If a participating school is located in a state that requires voter registration prior to election day and/or does not allow registration at the time of voting, then the school must make a good-faith effort to distribute voter registration forms to its students. This requirement was included in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (also known as the \"NVRA\" or \"motor voter law\"). The Department of Justice identified that the requirements of the NVRA apply to 44 states and the District of Columbia. Six states\u2014Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming\u2014 are exempt from the NVRA. Likewise, the territories are not covered by the NVRA (Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, American Samoa). The school must make the voter registration forms widely available to its students and must individually distribute the forms to its degree- or certificate-seeking (FSA-eligible) students. The school can mail paper copies, or it may send an electronic message to each student with a voter registration form or with an Internet address where the form can be downloaded. The message must be devoted exclusively to voter registration. In applicable states, schools must request voter registration forms from the state 120 days prior to the state's deadline for registering to vote. This provision applies to general and special elections for federal office and to the elections of governors and other chief executives within a state. If a school does not receive the forms within 60 days prior to the deadline for registering to vote in the state, it is not liable for failing to meet the requirement during that election year.ACA may not be used for association membership A school may not use its administrative cost allowance (ACA) to pay for its membership in professional associations (such as the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, the National Association of College and University Business Officers, etc.), regardless of whether the association engages in lobbying activities. Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and must maintain detailed records to show that FSA funds are disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students. These records must be retained for a certain amount of time and made available to authorized parties in the course of audits, program reviews, or investigations. Personally identifiable information in these records must be safeguarded and may only be released to other parties under certain conditions specified in the regulations. You may wish to share the contents of this chapter with your school's IT office or provider.Record Keeping, Privacy, & Electronic ProcessesREQUIRED RECORDS A school must keep comprehensive, accurate program and fiscal records related to its use of FSA program funds. The importance of main - taining complete, accurate records cannot be overemphasized. Program and fiscal records must demonstrate the school is capable of meeting the administrative and fiscal requirements for participating in the FSA pro - grams. In addition, records must demonstrate proper administration of FSA program funds and must show a clear audit trail for FSA program expenditures. For example, records for each FSA recipient must clearly show that the student was eligible for the funds received and that the funds were disbursed in accordance with program regulations. In addition to the general institutional record keeping requirements discussed here, a school must also comply with all program-specific record keeping requirements contained in the individual FSA regulations. Records related to school eligibility A school must establish and maintain on a current basis any application the school submitted for FSA program funds. Other program records that must be maintained include: program participation agreement, approval letter, and Eligibility and Certification Approval Report (ECAR), application portion of the FISAP , accrediting and licensing agency reviews, approvals, and reports, state agency reports, audit and program review reports, self-evaluation reports, and other records, as specified in regulation, that pertain to factors of financial responsibility and standards of administrative capability. Record keeping 34 CFR 668.24FSA Assessment module To assess your compliance with the provisions of this chapter, see Activity 2 under \"Fiscal Management\" at ifap.ed.gov/qahome/qaassessments/ fiscalmanagement.html Closed school records If a school closes, stops providing educational programs, is terminated or suspended from the FSA programs, or undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change of control, it must provide for the retention of required records. It must also provide for access to those records for inspection and copying by the Department. A school that formerly participated in the FFEL Program must also provide access for the appropriate guaranty agency.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-186 Records relating to student eligibility A school must keep records that substantiate the eligibility of students for FSA funds, such as: cost of attendance information, documentation of a student's satisfactory academic progress (SAP), documentation of student's program of study and the courses in which the student was enrolled, data used to establish student's admission, enrollment status, and period of enrollment, required student certification statements and supporting documentation, documents used to verify applicant data and resolve conflicting information, documentation of all professional judgment decisions, financial aid history information for transfer students. Fiscal records A school must keep fiscal records to demonstrate its proper use of FSA funds. A school's fiscal records must provide a clear audit trail that shows that funds were received, managed, disbursed, and returned in ac - cordance with federal requirements. The fiscal records a school must maintain include but are not limited to the following: records of all FSA program transactions, bank statements for all accounts containing FSA funds, records of student accounts, including each student's institu - tional charges, cash payments, FSA payments, cash disburse - ments, refunds, returns, and overpayments required for each enrollment period, general ledger (control accounts) and related subsidiary ledgers that identify each FSA program transaction (FSA transactions must be separate from school's other financial transactions), Federal Work-Study payroll records, and FISOP portion of the FISAP .Retaining records for a branch that closes If a school has an additional location or branch that closes, the school should maintain its loan records beyond the end of the three-year record retention requirement to respond to the Department or to refute borrower claims of eligibility for discharge. FWS records See Volume 6\u2014Campus-Based Programs , Chapter 1 , for a detailed discussion of the record keeping requirements for the FWS program.Chapter 7\u2014Record Keeping, HB June 20172-187A school must also maintain records that support data appearing on required reports, such as: Pell Grant statements of accounts, cash requests and quarterly or monthly reports from the G5 payment system, FSA program reconciliation reports, audit reports and school responses, state grant and scholarship award rosters and reports, accrediting and licensing agency reports, and records used to prepare the income grid on the FISAP . Loan program records There are special record keeping requirements in the Direct and FFEL loan programs. A school must maintain A copy of the paper or electronic loan certification or origination record, including the amount of the loan and the period of enroll - ment. The cost of attendance, estimated financial assistance, and expected family contribution used to calculate the loan amount (and any other information that may be required to determine the borrower's eligibility, such as the student's Federal Pell Grant eligibility or ineligibility). The date(s) the school disbursed the loan funds to the student (or to the parent borrower), and the amount(s) disbursed. (For loans delivered to the school by check, the date the school en - dorsed each loan check, if required.) Documentation of the confirmation process for each academic year in which the school uses the multi-year feature of the Master Promissory Note. This may be part of the borrower's file, but acceptable documentation can also include a statement of the confirmation process that was printed in a student handbook or other financial aid publication for that school year. The documentation may be kept in paper or electronic form. There is no retention limit for this documentation; you must keep it indefinitely because it may affect the enforceability of loans. A school must keep records relating to a student or parent borrower's eligibility and participation in the Direct Loan or FFEL program for three years after the end of the award year in which the student last attended the school. A school must keep all other records relating to the school's participation in the Direct Loan or FFEL program for at least three years af - ter the end of the award year in which the records are submitted.Perkins Loan Program records See Volume 6\u2014Campus-Based Programs , Chapter 1 , for a detailed discussion of the record keeping requirements for the Perkins Loan program.Loan program records 34 CFR 668.24, HB June 20172-188RECORD RETENTION PERIODS Schools must retain all required records for a minimum of three years from the end of the award year. However, the starting point for the three- year period is not the same for all records. For example, FFEL/DL reports must be kept for three years after the end of the award year in which they were submitted, while borrower records must be kept for three years from the end of the award year in which the student last attended. Different retention periods are necessary to ensure enforcement and repayment of Perkins loans, which are normally held by the school. Perkins Loan repayment records, including cancellation and deferment records, must be kept for three years from the date that the loan was assigned to the Department, cancelled, or repaid. Perkins original promissory notes and original repayment schedules must be kept until the loan is satisfied or needed to enforce the obligation (for more informa - tion, see Volume 6\u2014Campus-Based Programs ). A school may retain records longer than the minimum period required. Moreover, a school may be required to retain records involved in any loan, claim, or expenditure questioned in any FSA program review, audit, investigation, or other review, for more than three years (see Chapter 8 for information on program reviews and audits). If the three- year retention period expires before the issue in question is resolved, the school must continue to retain all records until resolution is reached. There are also additional record retention requirements that apply to schools granted waivers of the audit submission requirements.Retaining FISAP records Schools participating in the Campus-Based Programs must keep the Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP) and any records necessary to support their data (e.g., the source data for the income grid) for three years from the end of the award year in which the FISAP is submitted. For instance, records for a FISAP submitted during the 2017-2018 award year must be kept until at least June 30, 2020, three years from the last day of the award year. That FISAP is the record for the previous year, 2016-2017, and the application to participate for the coming year, 2018-2019.Records 34 CFR 668.24 and FSA 20172-189Summary of Record Retention Requirements From 34 CFR 668.24 Record retention and examinations.

Documentation of and information collected at any initial or exit loan counseling required by applicable program regulations, Reports and forms used by the school in its participation in an FSA program, and any records needed to verify data that appear in those reports and forms, Documentation supporting the school's calculation of its completion or graduation rates, and transfer-out rates (see Chapter 6 ).Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-190Pell and TEACH grants, Campus-Based Programs : 3 years from the end of the award year for which the aid was awarded Except: Fiscal Operations Report (FISAP) and supporting records\u20143 years from the end of the award year in which the report was submitted Perkins repayment records*\u2014Until the loan is satisfied, or the documents are no longer needed to enforce the obligation Perkins original promissory notes\u20143 years from the date the loan is assigned to ED, canceled, or repaid Direct Loans & FFEL Records related to borrower's eligibility and participation\u20143 years from the end of the award year in which the student last attended All other records, including any other reports or forms\u20143 years from the end of the award year in which the report was submitted * includes original repayment schedule, though manner of retention remains same as promissory noteMinimum Record Retention PeriodsChapter DCL FSA HB June 20172-191RECORD MAINTENANCE Acceptable formats A school must maintain all required records in a systematically organized manner. Unless a specific format is required, a school may keep required records in: hard copy optical disk microform CD-ROM computer file other media formats Record retention requirements for the Institutional Student Infor - mation Record (ISIR) are discussed here. All other record information, regardless of the format used, must be retrievable in a coherent hard copy format (for example, an easily understandable printout of a computer file) or in a media format acceptable to the Department. Any document that contains a signature, seal, certification, or any other image or mark required to validate the authenticity of its informa - tion must be maintained in its original hard copy or in an imaged media format. This includes tax returns, verification statements, and Student Aid Reports (SARs) used to determine eligibility, and any other document when a signature, seal, etc., contained on it is necessary for the document to be used for the purposes for which it is being retained. A school may maintain a record in an imaged media format only if the format is capable of reproducing an accurate, legible, and complete copy of the original document. When printed, the copy must be approxi - mately the same size as the original document. Please note that promissory notes that are signed electronically must be stored electronically and the promissory note must be retrievable in a coherent format. Because MPNs are stored in COD, this requirement can be satisfied through COD. Special requirements for SARs and ISIRs Special maintenance and availability requirements apply for SARs and ISIRs used to determine eligibility. It is essential that these basic eligibility records be available in a consistent, comprehensive, and verifiable format for program review and audit purposes. Hard copies of SARs that students submit to schools must be main - tained and available in their original format or in an imaged media for - mat. The ISIR, an electronic record, must be maintained and available in its original format (e.g., as it was archived using EDExpress software supplied to the school). A school that uses EDExpress has the ability to preserve the ISIR data that it has maintained during the applicable award year by archiving the data to a disk or other computer format. New media formats The requirement providing for other media formats acceptable to the Department allows for the use of new technology as it is developed. The Department will notify schools of acceptable media formats; schools should not apply for approval of a media format. Requirements for electronic promissory notes 34 CFR 668.24(d)(3)(i) HB June 20172-192EXAMINATION OF RECORDS Location A school must make its records available to the Department at a location of the school designated by the Department. These records must be readily available for review, including any records of transactions between a school and the financial institution where the school deposits any FSA funds. A school is not required to maintain records in any specific location. For example, it may be more appropriate for a school to maintain some records in the financial aid office while maintaining others in the business office, the admissions office, or the office of the registrar. The responsible administrator in the office maintaining the records should be aware of all applicable record retention requirements. Cooperation with agency representatives A school that participates in any FSA program and the school's third- party servicers, if any, must cooperate with the agencies and individuals involved in conducting any audit, program review, investigation, or other review authorized by law (see sidebar) . A school must cooperate by providing Timely access to requested records, pertinent books, documents, papers, or computer programs for examination and copying by any of the agents listed above. The records to which timely access must be provided include but are not limited to computerized records and records reflecting transactions with any financial institution with which the school or servicer deposits or has deposited any FSA program funds. Reasonable access to all personnel associated with the school's or servicer's administration of the FSA programs so that any of the agents listed above may obtain relevant information. A school or servicer must allow those personnel to supply all relevant information and allow those personnel to be inter - viewed without the presence of the school's or servicer's management (or tape-recording of the interviews by the school or servicer). If requested by the Department, a school or servicer must provide promptly any information the school or servicer has regarding the last known address, full name, telephone number, enrollment information, employer, and employer address of a recipient of FSA program funds who attends or attended the school. A school must also provide this informa - tion, upon request, to a lender or guaranty agency in the case of a borrower under the FFEL Program.Cooperation with agency representatives Cooperation must be extended to the following individuals and their authorized representatives: an independent auditor, the Secretary of the Department of Education, the Department's Inspector General, and the Comptroller General of the United States. See Chapter 4 for more information on independent audits and Chapter 8 for information on program reviews. A school must also provide this cooperation to any guaranty agency in whose program the school participates and to the school's accrediting agency.Sole possession records Sole possession records are exempted from the definition of \"education record\" and thus are not subject to FERPA. They are kept in the sole possession of the maker of the record and are used as a memory or reference tool, not accessible or revealed to any other person except a temporary substitute for the maker of the record, and maintained by the school official unbeknownst to and not shared with other individuals, except persons acting as a temporary substitute for a school official.Chapter 7\u2014Record Keeping, Privacy, & Electronic ProcessesCFR Glossary June 20172-193PRIVACY OF STUDENT INFORMATION UNDER FERPA The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects the privacy of students' education records. The term \"education records\" means those records that are: (1) directly related to a student; and (2) maintained by an education agency or postsecondary institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution. At the postsecondary level, FERPA affords eligible students with certain rights. FERPA defines an \"eligible student\" as a student who has reached 18 years of age or is attending an institution of postsecondary education at any age. With exceptions such as those noted in this section, FERPA affords postsecondary students the right to inspect and review their education records, the right to seek to have their records amend ed and the right to have some control over the disclosure of personally identifiable information from their education records. These rules apply to all education records a school keeps, including admissions records (only if the student was admitted), academic records, and any financial aid records pertaining to the student. Therefore, the financial aid office is not usually the office that develops a school's FERPA policy or the notification to students and parents, although it may have some input.FERPA citations 34 CFR 99.7 Notification of FERPA Rights 34 CFR 99.8 Law enforcement unit records 34 CFR 99.10-12 Right of student to review records 34 CFR 99.20-22 Right of student to request amendment to records 34 CFR 99.30 Prior consent requirement 34 CFR 99.31 When prior consent is not required to disclose information 34 CFR 99.32 Record keeping requirement 34 CFR 99.33 Limitations on redisclosure 34 CFR 99.34 Disclosure to other agencies/ institutions 34 CFR 99.35 Disclosure to certain authorities for audit or evaluation of education programs FERPA scope The relevant law is the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 . Do not confuse FERPA with the Privacy Act of 1974 that governs the records kept by government agencies, including the application records in the federal processing system. 20 USC 1232g FERPA resources The Department has posted a model notification on the Family Policy Compliance Office website at www.rems.ed.gov/docs/REMS_IHE_Guide_508.pdf The Guide for Developing High-Quality Emergency Operations Plans for Institutions of Higher Education includes a helpful FERPA section, among other guidance. Third-party housing records A student housing facility owned by a third party that has a contract with a school to provide housing for its students is considered under the control of the school (whether the rent is paid directly by the student or by the school on her behalf). Records maintained by the third party or the school related to students living in that housing are subject to FERPA.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and and parents' rights to review educational records under FERPA A school must provide a student with an opportunity to review his or her education records within 45 days of the receipt of a request. A school is required to provide the student with copies of education records or make other arrangements to provide the student access to the records if a failure to do so would effectively prevent the student from obtaining ac - cess to the records. While the school may not charge a fee for retrieving the records, it may charge a reasonable fee for providing copies of the re - cords, provided that the fee would not prevent access to the records. While the rights under FERPA have transferred from a student's par - ents to the student when the student attends a postsecondary institution, FERPA does permit a school to disclose a student's education records to his or her parents if the student is a dependent student under IRS rules. Note that the IRS definition of a dependent is quite different from that of a dependent student for FSA purposes. For IRS purposes, students are dependent if they are listed as dependents on their parent's income tax returns. (If the student is a dependent as defined by the IRS, disclosure may be made to either parent, regardless of which parent claims the stu - dent as a dependent.) There are several other situations in which a school official may dis - close information about the student to the student's parents, as noted in the sidebar. Prior written consent to disclose the student's records Except under one of the special conditions described in this section, a student must provide written consent before an education agency or institution may disclose personally identifiable information from the stu - dent's education records. The written consent must state the purpose of the disclosure, specify the records that may be disclosed, identify the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure may be made, and be signed and dated. If the consent is given electronically, the consent form must identify and authenticate a particular person as the source of the electronic consent and indicate that person's approval of the information con - tained in the electronic consent. The FERPA regulations include a list of exceptions where the school may disclose personally identifiable information from the student's file without prior written consent. Several of these allowable disclosures are of particular interest to the financial aid office, since they are likely to involve the release of financial aid records.Additional FERPA disclosures to parents A school may disclose information from a student's education records to parents in the case of a health or safety emergency that involves the student. A school may let parents of students under the age of 21 know when the student has violated any law or policy concerning the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance. A school official may share with parents information that is based on that official's personal knowledge or observation and that is not based on information contained in an education record. Disclosures via website Subject to certain conditions, disclosure may be made through Internet or intranet sites. CFR 34 668.41(b) & (c)Chapter FSA HB June 20172-195Disclosures to school officials Some of these disclosures may be made to officials at your school or another school under certain conditions. Typically, these might include disclosures of admissions records, grades, or financial aid records. Disclosure may be made to the following individuals: other school officials, including teachers, within the school whom the school has determined to have legitimate educational interests, and officials of another postsecondary school or school system where the student receives services or seeks to enroll. Third-party servicers that your school has contracted with to perform Title IV functions are considered school officials under FERPA when they perform any of the following: perform a school service or function for which your school would otherwise use employees, are under the control of your school with respect to the use and maintenance of education records, and comply with FERPA requirements about the use of personal in - formation from education records. A school official may disclose personal information from student education records to a servicer who meets the above criteria if the official determines that the servicer has a \"legitimate educational interest.\" Your school must include in its annual notification of rights under FERPA the criteria for determining who is a school official and what constitutes a le - gitimate educational interest. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to ful - fill his or her professional responsibility. Also, for such servicers to receive disclosures without student consent as though they were school officials, they must not use that personal information to set up a bank account or maintain a credit balance for students. See DCL GEN-12-08. If your school routinely discloses information to other schools where students seek to enroll, it should include this information in its annual privacy notification to students, or, if not, your school must make a rea - sonable attempt to notify students at their last known address.FERPA and crime records There are two different FERPA provisions concerning the release of records relating to a violent crime. One concerns the release to the victim of any outcome involving an alleged crime of violence [34 CFR 99.31(a) (13)]. A separate provision permits a school to disclose to anyone the final results of any disciplinary hearing against an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence where that student was found in violation of the school's policy on the offense [34 CFR 99.31(a)(14)].Campus security records Records created and maintained by a school's law enforcement unit are exempt from the privacy restrictions of FERPA. A school may disclose information from these \"law enforcement unit records\" to anyone\u2014 including parents or federal, state, or local law enforcement authorities\u2014without the consent of the student pursuant to school policy and/or state law.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-196Disclosures to government agencies Disclosures may be made for audit, evaluation, and enforcement purposes to authorized representatives of the U.S. Department of Educa - tion, which include employees of the Department\u2014such as those of the National Center for Education Statistics and the offices of Federal Student Aid, Postsecondary Educatio n, Inspector General and Civil Rights\u2014as well as firms under contract to the Department to perform certain admin - istrative functions or studies. In addition, disclosure may be made if it is in connection with finan - cial aid the student has received or applied for. Such disclosure may only be made if the student information is needed to determine the amount of the aid or the conditions or student's eligibility for the aid or to enforce the terms or conditions of the aid. Schools may, without violating FERPA, release personally identifiable information on nonimmigrant students with an F, J, or M visa to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in compliance with the Student Exchange Visitor Information System program. Disclosures in response to subpoenas or court orders FERPA permits schools to disclose personally identifiable informa - tion from a student's education records without the student's consent to comply with a lawfully issued subpoena or court order. In most cases the school must make a reasonable effort to notify the student who is the sub - ject of the subpoena or court order before complying so that he may seek protective action. However, the school does not have to notify the student if the court or issuing agency has prohibited such disclosure if certain conditions are met. A school may also disclose information from education records, with - out the consent or knowledge of the student, to representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice in response to an ex parte order issued in connec - tion with the investigation of crimes of terrorism.Patriot Act changes A Dear Colleague Letter issued April 12, 2002, on changes made to FERPA by the 2001 Patriot Act is posted in PDF at (www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/pdf/ htterrorism.pdf ). Documentation of request not required A school does not have to record instances where the request for access is made by: The parent or eligible student. A school official who has a legitimate educational interest. A party with written consent from the parent or eligible student. A party seeking directory information. Certain court orders or subpoenas. Subpoena citations 20 USC 1232g(b)(1)(J)(i) and (ii), defined in 18 USC FSA HB June 20172-197Documenting the disclosure of information Except as noted in the sidebar earlier in this chapter, a school must keep a record of each request for access and each disclosure of personally identifiable student information to other parties. The record of the request and disclosure must identify the parties who requested the information and their legitimate interest in the information. This record must be maintained in the student's file as long as the educational records them - selves are kept. For instance, if Department officials request student records in the course of a program review, the school must document in each student's file that his or her records were disclosed to representatives of the Depart - ment. An easy way for the school to do this is to photocopy a statement to this effect and include it in each student's file. A statement such as the following would be appropriate for a program review conducted by a De - partment regional office. These financial aid records were disclosed to representatives of the U.S. Department of Education, School Participation Division, Region __, on (Month/Day/Year) to determine compliance with financial aid require - ments, under 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(4). When redisclosure is anticipated, the additional parties to whom the information will be disclosed must be included in the record of the original disclosure. For instance, to continue the example for an FSA program review, the following statement might be added. The School Participation Division may make further disclosures of this information to the Department's Office of Inspector General and to the U.S. Department of Justice under 34 CFR 99.33(b). Schools should check with the program review staff to find out if any redisclosure is antici - pated.HIPAA and FERPA Joint guidance on HIPPA and FERPA developed jointly by The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and the Department of Education can be found at http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/ fpco/doc/ferpa-hipaa-guidance.pdf Other information about HIPPA and postsecondary institutions can be found at the HIPPA and Professionals section of the HHS website at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for- 2\u2014School 20172-198HIPAA (Privacy of Health Records) and FERPA The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) sets standards to protect the confidentiality of health information. However, the HIPAA Privacy Rule excludes from its coverage those records that are protected by FERPA at school districts and postsecondary institutions that provide health or medical services to students. This is because Congress specifically addressed how education records should be protected under FERPA. For this reason, records that are pro - tected by FERPA are not subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and may be shared with parents under the circumstances described here. Your school's disability services office normally obtains and maintains health records for each student who applies for services or waivers, so the receipt and maintenance of health records by student services units is well established. Note: In many cases a student receiving a waiver from a school's academic progress policy would also have applied for services from your school's disability services office. Since most financial aid offices are not used to handling medical records, you may find it more practical to have the disability services office maintain the record and to refer - ence that record in your file in the financial aid office. Of course, you will have to ensure that the record maintenance requirements are complied with. For joint guidance on FERPA and HIPPA, see https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/doc/ferpa-hipaa-guidance.pdf For more information on HIPAA, see the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services website www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/ HIPAA regulations are published as 45 CFR Parts 160, 162, and 164.A school is required to\u2014 annually notify students of their rights under FERPA; include in that notification the procedure for exercising their rights to inspect and review education records; and maintain a record in a student's file listing to whom personally identifiable information was disclosed and the legitimate interests the parties had in obtaining the information (does not apply to school officials with a legitimate educational interest or to directory information). A student has the right to\u2014 inspect and review any education records pertaining to the student; request an amendment to his/her records; and consent to disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records, except when FERPA permits disclosure without consent.FERPA Responsibilities and Student RightsChapter Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-199HIGHER EDUCATION ACT DATA USE LIMITATIONS The HEA also provides limitations on the uses of certain types of data. The provisions of the HEA apply differently to information collected or derived from the FAFSA/ISIR (including institutional award and dis - bursement information) and to data included in NSLDS (including data on the ISIR from NSLDS). The HEA restricts the use of the FAFSA/ISIR data to the application, award, and administration of aid awarded under federal student aid programs, state aid, or aid awarded by eligible institutions. The Department interprets \"administration of aid\" to include audits and program evaluations necessary for the efficient and effective administration of those student aid programs. The HEA also prohibits nongovernmental researchers or policy analysts from accessing PII from NSLDS and prohibits the use of NSLDS data for marketing purposes. It is important to note that these prohibitions are applicable to all NSLDS data, including NSLDS data received by institutions via the ISIR. Guidance on the Use of Financial Aid Information for Program Evaluation and Research The Department of Education's Privacy Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) has published Joint Guidance on the Use of Financial Aid Information for Program Evaluation and Research , to help schools understand using student financial aid information for program evaluation and research. That guidance is available at https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/doc/ferpa-hipaa-guidance.pdf The Department established PTAC as a \"one-stop\" resource for education stakeholders to learn about data privacy, confidentiality, and security practices related to student-level longitudinal data systems and other uses of student data. Additional information regarding these matters may be found at PTAC's website. The Assistance Center's resources on disclosure avoidance and de-identification, is available at ptac.ed.gov If you have questions about the PTAC guidance or other privacy or security matters related to student financial aid information, please contact the PTAC Help Desk by email at PrivacyTA@ed.gov or by phone at 855-249-3072 .TIPNEWFAFSA data restrictions HEA Section 483(a)(3)(E) NSLDS restrictions THE E-SIGN ACT AND INFORMATION SECURITY The E-Sign Act permits lenders, guaranty agencies, and schools to use electronic signatures and electronic records in place of traditional signa - tures and records that, under the HEA and underlying regulations, other - wise must be provided or maintained in hard-copy format. The E-Sign Act provides specifically for the creation and retention of electronic records. Therefore, unless a statute or regulation specifically requires a school to provide or maintain a record or document on paper, your school may provide and maintain that record electronically. Simi - larly, unless a statute or regulation specifically requires schools to obtain a pen and paper signature, you may obtain the signature electronically as long as the electronic process complies with the E-Sign Act and all other applicable laws. Obtaining voluntary consent for electronic transactions Before using electronic transactions to communicate with a recipient of FSA funds, the recipient must affirmatively consent to the use of an electronic record. The recipient's consent must be voluntary and based on accurate information about the transactions to be completed. The consent must be obtained in a manner that reasonably demon - strates that the person can access the information to be provided in an electronic form. For example, if you are going to send financial informa - tion by email, you could send a request for consent to the recipient via email, require the recipient to respond in a like manner, and maintain a record of that response.Using electronic processes for notifications and authorizations So long as there are no regulations specifically requiring that a notification or authorization be sent via U.S. mail, a school may provide notices or receive authorizations electronically. You may also use an electronic process to provide required notices and make disclosures by directing students to a secure website that contains the required notifications and disclosures. For additional information on electronic transactions involving student loans, see Section 2 of Standards for Electronic Signatures in Electronic Student Loan Transactions , in GEN-01-06, May 2001.E-Sign Act The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) was enacted on June 30, 2000. The E-Sign Act provides, in part, that a signature, contract, or other record relating to a transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form or because an electronic signature or electronic record was used in its formation. Voluntary consent required Voluntary consent to participate in electronic transactions is required for all financial information provided or made available to student loan borrowers and for all notices and authorizations to FSA recipients required under 34 CFR 668.165\u2014 Notices and Authorizations. See Volume 4 for more information on notices and authorizations for disbursements.Chapter 7\u2014Record Keeping, FSA HB June 20172-201Safeguarding confidential information in electronic processes Any time a school uses an electronic process to record or transmit confidential information or obtain a student's confirmation, acknowledg - ment, or approval, the school must adopt reasonable safeguards against possible fraud and abuse. Reasonable safeguards a school might take include password protection, password changes at set intervals, access revocation for unsuccessful logins, user identification and entry-point tracking, random audit surveys, and security tests of the code access. If your school uses an electronic process to provide notices, make disclosures, and direct students to a secure website, it must provide notice of this each year to each student, whether via email, campus mail, or the traditional mail of the U.S. Postal Service. The annual individual notice must identify the information required to be disclosed that year , provide the exact Web address for the information, state that persons are entitled to a paper copy upon request, and inform students how to request a paper copy. Establishing and maintaining an information security program The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has ruled that most colleges are subject to the provisions of the Financial Services Act's Security Provi - sions (also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act). In the regulation, the commission created a definition of financial institutions that includes most colleges on the basis of the financial relationships they have with students, donors, and others. Consequently, colleges must adopt an information security program and draft detailed policies for handling financial data covered by the law, such as parents' annual income, and take steps to protect the data from falling into the wrong hands. For specific requirements, see the discussion under FTC Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information later in this chapter. While colleges have flexibility in choosing a system that provides for electronic requests for release of personally identifiable information, they must ensure that their systems provide adequate safeguards. Also, the FTC requirements apply to Title IV third-party servicers, so colleges must use servicers that are capable of maintaining such safeguards and must require servicers by contract to implement and maintain those safeguards.Reporting security breaches to students and the Department Schools are strongly encouraged to inform their students of any breaches of security of student records and information. Schools' SAIG Agreement includes a provision that they must immediately notify FSA at CPSSAIG@ed.gov when there is such a breach. The Department considers any breach to the security of student records and information as a demonstration of a potential lack of administrative capability.Information security requirements Federal Trade Commission regulations: 16 CFR 313.3(n) and 16 CFR 314.1-5 Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or GLB Act) Pub. L. No. 106-102 Sections 501 and 505(b)(2) 15 USC 6801(b), 6805(b)(2) GEN-16-12, July 1, 2016 See also GEN-15-18 on protecting student information. It gives suggestions and resources for following industry standards and best practices on managing information systems. Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018CFR Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-202National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-171 The Department strongly encourages schools to review and understand the standards defined in National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication (NIST SP) 800-171, the recognized information security publication for protecting \"Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI),\" a subset of Federal data that includes unclassified information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with law, regulations, and Federal policies. NIST SP 800-171 identifies specific recommended requirements for non-Federal entities that handle CUI. The Department understands the investment and effort required by institutions to meet and maintain the security standards established under NIST SP 800-171. Nonetheless, across the public and private sectors, it is imperative that organizations continue to enhance cybersecurity in order to meet evolving threats to CUI and challenges to the security of such organizations. Therefore, the Department strongly encourages those institutions that fall short of NIST standards to assess their current gaps and immediately begin to design and implement plans in order to close those gaps using the NIST standards as a model.Protecting student information Under their Program Participation Agreement (PPA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Public Law 106-102), schools must protect student financial aid information, with particular attention to information provided to institutions by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the administration of the federal student financial aid programs. The GLBA requires institutions to, among other things Develop, implement, and maintain a written information security program; Designate the employee(s) responsible for coordinating the information security program; Identify and assess risks to customer information; Design and implement an information safeguards program; Select appropriate service providers that are capable of maintaining appropriate safeguards; and Periodically evaluate and update their security program. Presidents and Chief Information Officers of institutions should have, at a minimum, evaluated and documented their current security posture against the requirements of GLBA and have taken immediate action to remediate any identified deficiencies. The Department is incorporating the GLBA security controls into the Annual Audit Guide in order to assess and confirm schools' compliance with the GLBA. The Department will require the examination of evidence of GLBA compliance as part of schools' annual student aid compliance audit.NEWChapter 7\u2014Record Keeping, ProcessesCFR Glossary DCL 20172-203Copyright requirements Program Participation Agreement 34 CFR 668.14(b)(30) See Chapter 6 for requirement to disseminate copyright policies. Examples of deterrents Technology-based deterrents include bandwidth shaping, traffic monitoring, accepting and responding to Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notices, and commercial products designed to reduce or block illegal file sharing. GEN-10-08PREVENTING COPYRIGHT VIOLATIONS A school must implement written plans to effectively combat the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material by users of the school's network without unduly interfering with educational and research use of the network. These plans must include the use of one or more technology-based deterrents and procedures for handling unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material (including disciplinary procedures). No particular technology measures are favored or required for inclusion in the school's plans, and each school retains the authority to determine its own plans, including those that prohibit content monitoring. The school's plans must also include measures to educate its community about appropriate versus inappropriate use of copyrighted material, including the information described under the student consumer information rules in Chapter 6 . These mechanisms may include any additional information and approaches that the school determines will contribute to the effectiveness of the plans. For instance, the school might include pertinent information in student handbooks, honor codes, and codes of conduct in addition to email and/or paper disclosures. The school must have a written plan for the periodic review of the effectiveness of these measures, using relevant assessment criteria. The school must, in consultation with its chief technology officer (or other designated officer), periodically review the legal alternatives for downloading or otherwise acquiring copyrighted material (and disseminate the results, as described in Chapter 6 ) and offer legal alter - natives for downloading or otherwise acquiring copyrighted material (to the extent practicable and as determined by the school). The Department anticipates that individual institutions, national associations, and commercial entities will develop and maintain up-to- date lists that may be referenced for compliance with this provision.Volume 2\u2014School Glossary DCL FSA HB June 20172-204FTC Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information Colleges participating in the FSA programs are subject to the information security requirements established by the FTC for financial institutions. Customer information that must be safeguarded These requirements apply to all customer information in your school's possession, regardless of whether it pertains to students, parents, or other individuals your school has a cus - tomer relationship with or pertains to the customers of other financial institutions that have provided such information to you. Customer information means any record containing non - public personal information1 about a customer of a financial institution, whether in paper, electronic, or other form, that is handled or maintained by or on behalf of you or your affili - ates. Establishing and maintaining an information security program As a financial institution covered under these information security requirements, your school must develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive information security program.2 The information security program must be written in one or more readily accessible parts and contain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that are appropriate to the size and complexity of the school, the nature and scope of its activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. The safeguards shall be reasonably designed to achieve the following objectives: insure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Required elements of an information security program Designated coordinators. Your school must designate an em - ployee or employees to coordinate its information security program.Risk assessment. Your school must identify reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of customer informa - tion that could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, destruction, or other compromise of such information and assess the sufficiency of any safeguards in place to control these risks. At a minimum, the school's risk assessment should include consideration of risks in each relevant area of your operations, including employee training and management, information systems, including network and soft- ware design, as well as information processing, storage, transmission, and disposal, and detecting, preventing, and responding to attacks, intrusions, or other system failures. Safeguards and testing/monitoring. Your school must design and implement information safeguards to control the risks you identify through risk assessment, and regularly test or otherwise monitor the effective - ness of the safeguards' key controls, systems, and procedures. Evaluation and adjustment. Your school must evaluate and adjust its information security program in light of the results of the required testing and monitoring, as well as for any material changes to your operations or business arrangements or any other circumstances that it has reason to know may have a material impact on your school's information security program. Overseeing service providers. A service provider is any person or entity that receives, maintains, processes, or otherwise is permitted access to customer informa - tion through its provision of services directly to your school. Your school must take reasonable steps to select and retain service providers that are capable of maintaining appropriate safeguards for the customer information at issue and require your service provid - ers by contract to implement and maintain such safe - guards. 1 Personally identifiable financial information; and any list, description, or other grouping of consumers (and publicly available information pertaining to them) that is derived using any personally identifiable finan - cial information that is not publically available. 2 The administrative, technical, or physical safeguards you use to access, collect, distribute, process, protect, store, use, transmit, dispose of, or otherwise handle customer information. Sources: FTC regulations: 16 CFR 313.3(n) Sanctions, & Closeout In this chapter we discuss program reviews conducted at schools, sanctions and corrective actions, and procedures for schools that are ending their participation in one or more of the FSA programs.PROGRAM REVIEWS BY THE DEPARTMENT The Department of Education oversees the FSA programs to ensure they are administered properly. One way we do this is by conducting program reviews to confirm that schools meet FSA requirements for insti - tutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability. Program reviews identify compliance problems and suggest corrective actions. If a school is cited in a program review for improperly disbursing FSA program funds or other serious violations, it must restore the funds as ap - propriate. In addition to having to restore the funds it dispersed in error, a school may also be subject to correction actions and sanctions such as fines, emergency action, limitation, suspension, or termination, as dis - cussed later in this chapter. A program review covers many of the same areas as an audit (see Chapter 4 ), including fiscal operations and accounting procedures as well as compliance with the specific program requirements for student eligibil - ity and awards. However, program reviews are not conducted annually at every school; priority is given to schools that meet criteria specified in the law (see the sidebar note on the next page). Department program reviewers will analyze school records and identify weaknesses in the school's procedures for administering FSA funds; determine how those weaknesses may subject FSA funds to po - tential or actual fraud, waste, and abuse; identify corrective actions that will strengthen the school's fu - ture compliance with FSA rules and regulations; quantify the harm from any failings of the school and identify liabilities where noncompliance has lead to loss, misuse, or un - necessary spending of federal funds; and when necessary, refer schools for administrative action to pro - tect the interests of students and taxpayers.FSA assessments To assess your school's compliance with the provisions of this chapter, see the FSA Assessment module for \"Institutional Eligibility\" (www.ifap.ed.gov/qahome/ qaassessments/institutionalelig.html ).Related information Audit requirements\u2014 Chapter 4 Updating the E-App for changes to programs and locations\u2014 Chapter 5Volume and Operations 2017-2018FSA HB June 20172-206CFR Glossary DCL Scope of the review A program review may be either a general assessment review, a fo - cused review, or a compliance assurance review. A general assessment review is the most common type of review and is normally conducted to evaluate the school's overall performance in meeting FSA administrative and financial requirements. A focused review is normally conducted to determine if the school has problems with specific areas of FSA program compliance. A compliance assurance review is a tool that is used to help validate the Department's risk assessment system. For general assessment, compliance assurance, and some focused reviews, the review team will randomly select student files. In general, a sample consists of 15 students from each award year under review. The review team will analyze the academic file, student account ledger, student financial aid file, and admissions file for each student in the sample. Reviewers will also examine school records that are not specific to in - dividual students. These records include required policies and procedures, fiscal records, and consumer information (i.e., the school's website, school catalog[s], pamphlets, etc.). It may be necessary for the reviewer to conduct interviews with school officials, including academic or education personnel or the regis - trar, admissions personnel, financial aid personnel, fiscal office personnel, placement officer, and/or campus security personnel. In addition, the re - viewer may interview students. Location of the review Program reviews are typically conducted at the institution. However, in some circumstances institutions are asked to submit copies of selected records to the Department for review at its offices, and interviews are con - ducted via telephone rather than in person. Notification of the review Most reviews are announced up to 30 days prior to the review by a telephone call to the president and financial aid administrator. The school also receives written notice of the review and is asked to provide relevant materials prior to the start of the review (e.g., policies and procedures, consumer publications, a list of FSA recipients, etc.). The school will also be expected to make other records available on-site at the start of the review. In some cases, notice for the review is given the day before the review (via overnight delivery or fax), the morning of the review (via fax), or at the time the review team arrives at the school. Schools are required to cooperate with the Department in the event of a program review and provide unrestricted access to any and all information requested to conduct the review. Failure to provide this access to the program review team may lead to an adverse administrative action.Program review priority The law specifies that the Department gives priority in program reviews to schools that have a high cohort default rate or dollar volume of default, have a significant fluctuation in Pell Grant awards or FSA loan volume that is not accounted for by changes in the programs, are reported to have deficiencies or financial aid problems by the appropriate state agency or accrediting agency, have high annual dropout rates, or the Department determines may pose a significant risk of failing to comply with the administrative capability or financial responsibility requirements. 20 USC 1099c-1(a)(2) Administrative subpoena authority HEA Sec. 490A The Department has the authority to issue administrative subpoenas to assist in conducting investigations of possible violations of the provisions of FSA programs. In addition, the law authorizes the Department to request the Attorney General to invoke the assistance of any court of the United States for purposes of enforcing a subpoena if necessary.Access to records Access includes the right to copy records (including computer records), to examine computer programs and data, and to interview employees without the presence of management or the presence of the school's or a servicer's tape recorder. Access and examination cite 34 CFR 668.24(f)Chapter Reviews, Sanctions, & CloseoutFSA HB June 20172-207CFR Glossary DCL The School Participation Divisions conduct pro - gram reviews and review compliance audits, financial statements, and initial eligibility and recertification applications to get a picture of a school's overall compliance. FSA's School Eligibil - ity Service Group (SESG) coordinates the School Participation Divisions, which are staffed by personnel in the regions and in Washington, DC. Each division is assigned a portfolio of schools and is responsible for the oversight functions mentioned above for those schools. The entire division will evaluate information on the school from a variety of sources to identify any compliance issues at the school. The division can then assess potential risk to the FSA pro - grams and determine appropriate action. Once appropriate actions are decided upon, the person assigned to the school ensures that the recom - mended actions are taken. School Participation Divisions will collect and re - view information on a school from many sources, including but not limited to: applications for recertification, financial and compliance audits, state agencies, accrediting agencies and licensing boards, student complaints, and Department databases.A School Participation Division may decide to take actions that include but are not limited to: renewing full recertification or awarding only provisional certification; initiating a program review; establishing liabilities; developing a strategy for providing tech - nical assistance; transferring the school to the cash monitoring or reimbursement payment method (see Volume 4: Processing Aid and Managing FSA Funds ); requiring a letter of credit; and referring the school for an enforcement action. Actions do not always have to be negative. For example, the School Participation Division can rec - ommend a school for participation in the Experi - mental Sites Program. Such oversight provides the additional benefit of permitting a school to contact one team that will have all information on the school available in one place. For a list of phone numbers for the regional School Participation Divisions, go to the IFAP web - site ( http://ifap.ed.gov ) and click on Help > Con - tact Information > Federal Student Aid Offices.School Participation DivisionVolume and Operations 2017-2018FSA HB June 20172-208CFR Glossary DCL Department obligations For its part in program reviews, the Department is required to establish guidelines designed to ensure uniformity of practice in the conduct of program reviews; make copies of all review guidelines and procedures available to all participating schools; permit schools to correct administrative, accounting, or record keeping errors if the errors are not part of a pattern and there is no evidence of fraud or misconduct; base any civil penalty assessed against a school resulting from a program review or audit on the gravity of the violation, failure, or misrepresentation; inform the appropriate state and accrediting agency whenever it takes action against a school; provide schools an adequate opportunity to review and respond to any program review report and related materials before a fi - nal report is issued; and consider a school's response in any final program review report or audit determination and include in that (1) a written state - ment addressing the school's response, (2) a written statement of the basis for the report or determination; and (3) a copy of the school's response. [20 USC 1099c-1(b)] Entrance and exit/status conference The review team will hold an entrance conference with school officials at the beginning of the review. The purpose of the entrance conference is to provide school officials with information about the review and the pro - gram review process and for reviewers to learn how federal student aid is processed at the school. The review team will hold an exit or status conference at the end of a program review. The purpose of the exit conference is to inform school officials about the next steps in the process, summarize preliminary findings, advise school officials of any immediate changes that must be made, and/or provide details of any remaining outstanding items. If the fieldwork is not complete or the data has not been fully analyzed, a status meeting is conducted. A return visit may be necessary or an exit confer - ence may be conducted via telephone after further analysis is completed.Communication with state agencies The HEA requires that each state, through at least one state agency, must furnish the Department, upon request, with information regarding licensing and other authorization for a school to oper - ate in that state; promptly notify the Department of revo - cations of licensure or authorization; and promptly notify the Department of cred - ible evidence that a school has commit - ted fraud in the administration of the FSA programs or has substantially violated a provision of the HEA. Department's recognition of state agencies Sec. 495 of the HEA 20 USC 1087-1(b) 34 CFR 20172-209CFR Glossary DCL Written report The program review team prepares a preliminary written report after completion of the review. In most instances, this report will be sent to the school within 75 days of the review. The school may respond to this report if it wishes to offer additional information to support its position or if it disagrees with any of the report's findings. When the Department has fully considered the school's response and any additional documentation provided by the school, the Department will send a Final Program Review Determination (FPRD) letter to the school. Final Program Review Determination (FPRD) An FPRD is a report that includes each finding identified in the pro - gram review report, the school's response, and the Department's final determination. The FPRD may require the school to take further action to resolve one or more of the findings. This action may include making student level adjustments in COD and the G5 payment system, and paying liabilities to the Department, student, or lenders on behalf of the student. Any funds the school owes as a result of the FPRD must be repaid within 45 days of the school's receipt of the FPRD unless the school submits an appeal to the Department or enters into a payment plan with the Department's Financial Management Group. The cover letter of the FPRD provides instructions on how to file an appeal. If payment or an appeal is not received within 45 days, the Department may elect to use administrative offset to collect the funds owed.Appealing audit and program review determinations The law allows for appeals of final audit or program review determinations. Note that only a final determination may be appealed. The letter conveying a final audit determination is clearly identified as a Final Audit Determination Letter and explains the appeals procedures. For a program review, the final determination letter is identified as a Final Program Review Determination Letter. 34 CFR Part 668 Subpart HVolume June 20172-210CFR Glossary DCL The goal of accreditation is to ensure that the education provided by postsecondary educational institutions meets an acceptable level of quality. The Department recognizes agencies that meet es - tablished criteria, and such recognition is a sign that an agency has been determined to be a reliable au - thority on the quality of the institutions or programs the agency accredits. An accrediting agency can be recognized by the De - partment for institutional or programmatic accredi - tation. An institutional accreditation agency accred - its an entire institution. A programmatic accrediting agency accredits specific educational programs, departments, or schools within an institution. An agency must have standards that effectively ad - dress the quality of a school or program in the fol - lowing areas: success with respect to student achieve - ment in relation to mission, including, as appropriate, consideration of course com - pletion, state licensing examination, and job placement rates; curricula; faculty; facilities, equipment, and supplies; fiscal and administrative capacity as appro - priate to the specific scale of operations; student support services; recruiting and admissions practices, aca - demic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading, and advertising; measures of program length and the objec - tives of the degrees or credentials offered; record of student complaints received by, or available to, the agency; record of compliance with the school's FSA program responsibilities, based on items such as default rate data and the results of compliance audits and program reviews and any other information that the Depart - ment may provide to the agency; and any additional accreditation standards the accrediting agency deems appropriate.Accrediting Agency Role There are many additional statutory requirements a national accrediting agency must meet to qualify for recognition. For example, an accreditation agency must: consistently apply and enforce standards for accreditation that ensure that the educa - tion or training offered by an institution or program, including any offered through cor - respondence or distance education, is of suf - ficient quality to achieve its stated objectives for the duration of the school's accreditation period; perform, at regularly established intervals, on-site inspections and reviews of institu - tions of higher education (that may include unannounced site visits), with particular focus on educational quality and program ef - fectiveness; agree to submit any dispute involving the final denial, withdrawal, or termination of ac - creditation to initial arbitration prior to any other legal action; and if it is an institutional accrediting agency, maintain adequate substantive change poli - cies that ensure that any substantive change to the educational mission, program, or pro - grams of an institution after an agency has accredited or preaccredited the institution do not adversely affect the capacity of the institution to continue meeting the agency's standards. Information and a complete list of agencies recognized by the Department can be found at (www.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/index.html). Department's recognition of accrediting agencies Sec. 496 of the HEA 20 USC 1099b 34 CFR 20172-211CFR Glossary DCL Regulations on corrective actions and sanctions For details on steps that a school should follow in any of these situations, see Subpart G of the general provisions regulations and Section 600.41 of the institutional eligibility regulations. Criminal penalties HEA Sec. 490CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND SANCTIONS Sanctions Sanctions include emergency actions, fines, limitations, suspensions, and terminations (see descriptions on next page). The Department may initiate actions against any school that: violates the law or regulations governing the FSA programs, its Program Participation Agreement, or any agreement made under the law or regulations; or substantially misrepresents the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges, or its graduates' employability. For details on misrepresentation, see Chapter 6 . In addition, the Department has the authority to terminate a school or program that no longer meets the eligibility criteria given in Chapter 1 . Similarly, the Department may also sanction a third-party servicer that performs functions related to the FSA programs. Further, the Department has the authority to sanction a group of schools or servicers if it finds that a person or entity with substantial control over all schools or servicers within the group has violated any of the FSA program requirements or has been suspended or debarred from program participation. See Chapters 1 and 4. Criminal penalties The law provides that any person who knowingly and willfully embezzles; misapplies; steals; obtains by fraud, false statement, or forgery; or fails to refund any funds, assets, or property provided or insured under Title IV of the Higher Education Act; or attempts to commit any of these crimes will be fined up to $20,000 or imprisoned for up to five years, or both. If the amount of funds involved in the crime is $200 or less, the penalties are fines up to $5,000 or imprisonment up to one year, or both. Any person who knowingly and willfully makes false statements, furnishes false information, or conceals material information in connection with the assignment of an FSA program loan or attempts to do so, will, upon conviction, be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned for up to one year, or both. This penalty also applies to any person who knowingly and willfully : makes, or attempts to make, an unlawful payment to an eligible lender of loans as an inducement to make, or to acquire by assignment, a loan insured under such part. destroys or conceals, or attempts to destroy or conceal, any record relating to the provision of FSA program assistance with intent to defraud the United States or to prevent the United States from enforcing any right obtained by subrogation under this part.Actions due to program violations or misrepresentation If a school has violated the FSA program regulations, the Department may (at its sole discretion) allow the school to respond to the problem and indicate how it will correct it. However, if the school has repeatedly violated the law or regulations, or the Department has determined that the violations are egregious, the Department may take an emergency action, fine the school, or initiate a limitation, suspension, or termination of FSA program participation. Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018FSA HB June 20172-212CFR Glossary DCL Emergency action The Department may take an emergency action to withhold FSA program funds from a school or its stu - dents if the Department receives information, deter - mined by a Department official to be reliable, that the school is violating applicable laws, regulations, special arrangements, agreements, or limitations. To take an emergency action, the Department official must deter - mine that: The school is misusing federal funds. Immediate action is necessary to stop this misuse. The potential loss outweighs the importance of using established procedures for limitation, suspension, and termination. The school is notified by registered mail (or other expeditious means) of the emergency action and the reasons for it. The action becomes effective on the date the notice is mailed. An emergency action suspends the school's par - ticipation in all FSA programs and prohibits the school from disbursing FSA program funds or certifying FFEL applications. The action may not last more than 30 days unless a limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding is initiated during that period. In that case, the emergency action is extended until the proceed - ing, including any appeal, is concluded. The school is given an opportunity to show cause that the action is unwarranted. Fine The Department may fine a school up to $27,500 for each statutory or regulatory violation. In determin - ing the amount of the fine, the Department considers the gravity of the offense, the nature of the violation, and the school's size. The school is notified by certified mail of the fine action, the amount of the fine, and the basis for the action. A school has 20 days from the date of mailing to submit a written request for a hear - ing or to submit written material indicating why the fine should not be imposed. Limitation Under a limitation, which lasts for at least 12 months, the Department imposes specific conditions or restrictions upon a school and its administration Corrective Actions and Sanctions of the FSA programs. As a result, the school is allowed to continue participating in those programs. If the school fails to abide by the limitation's conditions, a termination proceeding may be initiated. Suspension A suspension removes a school from participation in the FSA programs for a period not to exceed 60 days (unless a limitation or termination proceeding has been initiated or the Department and the school agree to an extension). A suspension action is used when a school can be expected to correct an FSA program violation in a short time. Corrective action As part of any fine, limitation, or suspension proceed - ing, the Department may require a school to take correc - tive action. This may include making payments to eligible students from its own funds or repaying illegally used funds to the Department. In addition, the Department may offset any funds to be repaid against any benefits or claims due the school. Termination A termination ends a school's participation in the FSA programs. A school that has violated the law or regula - tions governing the FSA programs, its PPA, or any other agreement made under FSA regulations and was termi - nated from participating in the FSA programs generally may not apply to be reinstated for at least 18 months. Possibility of reinstatement A school requesting reinstatement in the FSA pro - grams must submit a fully completed E-App to the De - partment and demonstrate that it meets the standards in 34 CFR Part 668. As part of the reinstatement process, the school must show that it has corrected the violation(s) on which its termination was based, including repaying all funds (to the Department or to the eligible recipients) that were improperly received, disbursed, caused to be disbursed, or withheld. The Department may approve the request, deny the request, or approve the request subject to limitations (such as granting the school provisional certification). If the Department approves the reinstate - ment request, the school will receive a new ECAR and enter into a new PPA.Chapter 8\u2014Program Reviews, Sanctions, & CloseoutFSA requirement 34 CFR 600.40 ... (d) Except as otherwise provided in this part, if an institution ceases to satisfy any of the requirements for eligibility under this part\u2014 (1) It must notify the Secretary within 30 days of the date that it ceases to satisfy that requirement; and (2) It becomes ineligible to continue to participate in any HEA program as of the date it ceases to satisfy any of the requirements.CLOSEOUT PROCEDURES (WHEN FSA PARTICIPATION ENDS) A school may stop participating in the FSA programs voluntarily or may be required to leave involuntarily, as described below. In either situation, it must follow the closeout procedures specified in the FSA regulations. Involuntary withdrawal from FSA participation A school's participation ends in the following circumstances: the school closes or stops providing instruction for a reason other than normal vacation periods or as a result of a natural disaster that directly affects the school or its students; the school loses its accreditation; the school loses its state licensure; the school loses its eligibility; the school's PPA expires; the school's participation is terminated under Subpart G; the school's provisional certification is revoked by the Department; the school's cohort default rate exceeds allowable limits; or the school files a petition for bankruptcy or the school, its owner, or its CEO is responsible for a crime involving FSA funds. Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2017-2018FSA HB June 20172-214CFR Glossary DCL Closeout procedures In general, a school that ceases to be eligible must notify its School Participation Division within 30 days of its loss of eligibility to participate in the FSA programs. The school must also comply with the following minimum requirements: Within 45 days of the effective ending date of participation, submit to the Department all financial reports, performance re - ports, and other reports, as well as a dated letter of engagement for an audit by an independent certified public accountant of all FSA program funds received. The completed audit report must be submitted to the Department within 45 days after the date of the letter of engagement. Report to the Department on the arrangements for retaining and storing (for the remainder of the appropriate retention pe - riod described in Chapter 7 ) all records concerning the school's management of the appropriate FSA programs. Tell the Department how the school will provide for collecting any outstanding FSA loans held by the school. Refund students' unearned FSA student assistance. (See Volume 5, Chapter 2 .) In addition, a school that closes must refund to the federal govern - ment or, following written instructions from the Department, otherwise distribute any unexpended FSA funds it has received (minus its adminis - trative cost allowance, if applicable). Unpaid commitments and loss of program eligibility If a school's participation ends during a payment period or if a program loses its eligibility, but the school continues to provide education in the formerly eligible program until the end of the payment or enrollment period, the school may use FSA funds it possesses to satisfy unpaid Pell Grant or Campus-Based Program commitments made to students for that payment period or for previously completed payment periods before the school's participation ended; use the FSA funds in its possession to satisfy unpaid Direct Loan commitments made to students for that period of enroll - ment before participation ended by delivering subsequent Di - rect Loan disbursements to the students or by crediting them to their accounts (if the first disbursement already was delivered or credited to the students' accounts before the school's partici - pation ended). Note that the school may request additional funds from the Department to meet these commitments.Definition of commitment A commitment under the Pell and TEACH grant programs occurs when a student is enrolled and attending the school and has submitted a valid Student Aid Report to the school or when a school has received a valid institutional student information report. A commitment under the Campus-Based Programs occurs when a student is enrolled and attending the school and has received a notice from the school of the amount that he or she can expect to receive and how and when that amount will be paid. 34 CFR 668.26(e)(1) Effect on student eligibility for interest subsidies A student enrolled at a school that loses eligibility or discontinues participation in the Direct Loan program can continue to receive interest subsidies if the student enrolls and remains enrolled at an eligible school.Chapter 8\u2014Program Reviews, Sanctions, & CloseoutFSA HB June 20172-215CFR Glossary DCL Recovery of loan discharges when branch/location closes If an additional location or branch of an institution closes and borrowers who attended the school obtain loan discharges by reason of the closure of the location or branch (or improper ATB or loan certifications), the Department will pursue recovery against the larger institution, its affiliates, and its principals. 20 USC 1087(c)(1)Teach-out plan 34 CFR 668.14(b)(31) Federal Register October 29, 2009 Also see: Teach-out plan definition 34 CFR 600.2 Eligibility of additional locations for teach- out purposes 34 CFR 600.32(d)Teach-out plan A school must submit a teach-out plan to its accrediting agency if the Department initiates an emergency action or initiates the lim - itation, suspension, or termination of the school's participation in any FSA program; the school's accrediting agency acts to withdraw, terminate, or suspend the accreditation or preaccreditation; the school's state licensing or authorizing agency revokes the in - stitution's license or legal authorization to provide an educational program; the school intends to close a location that provides 100% of at least one program; or the school otherwise intends to cease operations. Closure of a branch or location A separate closeout audit is not required if a school closes an ad - ditional location or a branch campus because the next due compliance audit for the school must report on the use of FSA program funds at the closed location. However, the school must notify the Department of the additional location or branch closure. See Chapter 5 for information on reporting information to the Department. Loss of eligibility or withdrawal from the Direct Loan Program If a school is notified that it has lost its eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan Program and the school does not intend to appeal the deci - sion, it must immediately inform all current and prospective students of its loss of eligibility. The school must also explain that it can no longer originate Direct Loans for students or parents. If the school appeals its loss of eligibility within the required timeframe, the school may continue originating Direct Loans during the appeal process. Once a final decision on the appeal is made, the school must take the actions described in the Department's final appeal determination letter. If a school plans to withdraw from participation in the Direct Loan Program, it must notify the Department of its decision in writing. Once the effective date of withdrawal has been established, the school is prohib - ited from disbursing loan funds to the student. However, if your school made a first disbursement to the student before it lost eligibility, it may still be able to make a subsequent disbursement to that student. See the conditions in 34 CFR 668.26(d).Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and DCL End of FSA Participation School closes or stops providing instruction If the school closes its main campus or stops providing instruction on its main campus, its loss of eligibility includes all its locations and programs. If a school ceases to provide educational instruction in all FSA-eligible programs, the school should make arrangements for its students to complete their academic programs. If the school chooses to enter into a formal teach-out arrangement, it should contact its school participation division for guidance. School loses eligibility A school loses its eligibility to participate in the FSA programs when it no longer meets the requirements of 34 CFR Part 600, certain requirements of Part 668, or when the Department terminates the school under Subpart G of the General Provisions. Voluntary withdrawal from FSA participation For many reasons a school may voluntarily withdraw from participating in one or all of the FSA programs. For instance, a school might wish to withdraw from the Perkins Loan Program to work on lowering high student loan cohort default rates. To withdraw from one or all of the FSA programs, the school must notify the Department via the electronic application. The school participation division has more information on these requirements and procedures. A school that withdrew voluntarily (for instance, to lower its default rate) can request to participate again without the waiting period required for a school that was terminated from the program involuntarily or withdrew voluntarily while under a show cause or suspension order. Withdrawing from the FSA programs while under a termination order or other sanction \u2014or to avoid being placed under them\u2014is not considered a voluntary withdrawal. School loses primary accreditation When a school loses its institution-wide accreditation, the Department generally may not certify or recertify that school to participate in any FSA program for two years after the school has had its accreditation withdrawn, revoked, or otherwise terminated for cause or after a school has voluntarily withdrawn under a show cause or suspension or - der. If a school wishes to be reinstated, it must submit a fully completed E-App to the Department. The Department will not recertify a school that has lost its institution-wide accreditation in the previous two years unless the original accrediting agency rescinds its decision to terminate the school's accreditation. In addition, if a school voluntarily withdrew from accreditation during the last two years under a show cause or suspension order, the Department will not recertify the school unless the original order is rescinded by the accrediting agency. Finally, a school may not be recertified on the basis of accreditation granted by a different accrediting agency during the two-year period. There are two exceptions to the two-year rule: 1. If the Department determines that loss of institution-wide accreditation was due to the school's religious mission or affiliation, the school can remain certified for up to 18 months while it obtains alternative ac - creditation. 2. If a school's institution-wide accrediting agency loses its Department recognition, the school has up to 18 months to obtain new accreditation. Note: It is possible for accreditation to be withdrawn from one of the programs at a school without affecting the accreditation (and eligibility) of other programs at the school. "}
