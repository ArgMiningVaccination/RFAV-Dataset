Coronavirus disease 2019, better known as Covid-19, is an illness of the lungs caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2), which is seen to infect humans for the very first time. Covid-19 is a highly infectious viral disease that spreads from one person to another at a very fast pace. Persons suffering from Covid-19 are likely to have breathing difficulties, fever and cough as the major symptoms. Q. What is Desrem Injection? What is it used for? Desrem Injection is a medicine that belongs to a class of medicines called antiviral medicines. In recent laboratory studies, Desrem Injection has shown to be effective in managing hospitalized patients suffering from severe Covid-19 infection. Although Desrem Injection has not been approved for treating Covid-19 patients, some studies suggest that patients who were treated with Desrem Injection showed faster recovery compared to those who were taking some other treatment. However, the safety and efficiency of Desrem Injection in the treatment of Covid-19 is yet to be established and there are many clinical trials going on for the same. Q. What is Emergency Use Authorization? Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a declaration issued by the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDA) to use certain medicines, vaccines or devices to diagnose, treat or prevent a serious medical condition (such as Covid-19 in the current scenario) in case there is an outbreak of such an illness that poses threat to public health. FDA may not approve the use of any such medical measures but may still allow it to be used against the illness weighing the benefits against the risks involved. Q. How is Desrem Injection administered? Desrem Injection is administered only in hospitalized patients, both children as well as adults, who have severe Covid-19 infection, as an injection intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor only and should not be self-administered. Severe Covid-19 infection means those patients whose oxygen saturation (SpO2) 94% on room air or those who require supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Follow your doctor's instructions carefully to get maximum benefit from Desrem Injection. Q. Who can be treated with Desrem Injection? EUA has recently permitted the use of Desrem Injection in managing only hospitalized patients who are suspected to have or are suffering from severe Covid-19 infection, as it has shown quicker recovery in both adults and children who are facing serious breathing difficulties due to severe Covid-19 infection. Q. How does Desrem Injection work? Desrem Injection is still being studied in the various ongoing clinical trials. So far, it is seen that Desrem Injection inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19), a process by which this virus multiplies and helps in spreading the infection. In this way the amount of virus in the human body decreases, thereby leading to faster recovery. Q. What are the possible side effects of Desrem Injection? The possible side effects of Desrem Injection may be anemia (low number of red blood cells), fever, kidney damage, nausea, vomiting, shivering, sweating, low blood pressure and increased levels of liver enzymes. However, these are not all of the side effects of Desrem Injection and we are yet to know more of the side effects. Desrem Injection and its use in treating Covid-19 is still being studied and evaluated. Therefore, it is important to know that there might be more risks involved with the use of Desrem Injection. Q. Is Desrem Injection safe? There is limited data available to support the safety or effectiveness of Desrem Injection in managing hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19 patients. Its use has been permitted for treating severely infected hospitalized patients, both adults and children, only after weighing the benefits against the possible side effects and risks involved.
