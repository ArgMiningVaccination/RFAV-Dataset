It is often seen as a luxury or a splurge rather than an essential. Ayurveda has a very different standpoint in this regard. Apart from some conditions, massage is a non-negotiable when it comes to self-care. In some instances, the whole body receives massage, and in other cases, specific regions, such as marma points, are given special attention.

It is a back-bending asana where the majority of the movement comes from the thoracic spine, a place where our culture has become limited in motion. With its expansiveness across the chest, it earns its merit as a \"heart opener,\" but its name \"cobra\" comes from its shape, which is reflective of a serpent.

Learn more about these books at her [website](https://sarahkucera.com/). Sarah's Point of View How were you introduced to Ayurveda? I was introduced to Ayurveda through its [sister science](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/living-ayurveda/yoga/) of yoga. I signed up for a workshop at a yoga studio and was immediately hooked. I found it to be a perfect bridge between my yoga and chiropractic practice. When are you most likely to go out of balance and how do you bring yourself back in balance using Ayurveda? [Pitta](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/learning-ayurveda/glossary-of-ayurvedic-terms/) accumulates in me quite easily. I manage many things day-to-day, and I always have high expectations for myself. It can show up as me getting burned out, feeling frustrated or resentful, and being really hard on myself. When I see this rearing its head, I take more breaks throughout the day, go on extra walks, aim for an earlier bedtime, and make sure I'm eating enough and at very consistent times. What does the future of Ayurveda look like to you? Ayurveda has my heart, and for that, I hope to see it keep its essence and tradition as it is made accessible to our modern society. With that, I do see its popularity on the rise and can see it finding its way into the mainstream. What's one Ayurvedic practice anyone can implement to spur change in their life, right here, right now?
