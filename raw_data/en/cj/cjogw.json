Requirements for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund Loan Assistance. Synopsis: The Department of Health and Environmental Control ( \"Department\") repeals R.61 -67.1. The regulation describes the process the Dep artment and the former South Carolina Budget and Control Board followed in administering the State Water Pollution Revolving Fund received in federal grants from the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") . In 1992, the General Assembly repealed S.C. Code Section 48-6-10 et seq . and replaced it with the South Carolina Water Quality Revolving Fund Authority Act (S.C. Code Section 48 -5-10 et seq .). Passage of the South Carolina Water Quality Revolving Fund Authority Act (\"Act\") has rendered R.61 -67.1 obsolete . The Act provides authority for the Department and the South Carolina Water Quality Revolving Fund Authority to administer the South Carolina clean water and drinking water revolving funds program and federal grants received as supplements to the revolving funds from the EPA . The South Carolina Water Quality Revolving Fund Authority comprises the members of the State Fiscal Accountability Authority, with administrative and implementation support from the South Carolina Rural Infrastructure Authority (\"RIA\" ). Repeal of the regulation will have no impact or implications for the current administration and implementation of the South Carolina Clean Water State Revolving Fund (\"CWSRF\") . The CWSRF, like its predecessor, the State Water Pollution Revolving Fund under the repealed Title 48, Chapter 6, provides low interest loans to public utilities and local governments for wastewater and stormwater infrastructure projects. The Department an d RIA are able to effectively administer and implement the state revolving funds program using the state statute, Title 48, Chapter 5, and federal laws, regulations, and grant requirements that govern the use of the funds . Other existing state laws and reg ulations also are used to implement the program such as environmental permitting regulations that govern the design and construction of wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. The Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Section 1 -23-120(A), requires General Assembly review of this repeal. The Department had a Notice of Drafting published in the June 22, 2018, South Carolina State Register . Section -by-Section Discussion of Repeal: Regulation 61-67.1 is repealed in its entirety as it is obsolete due to repeal of the original authorizing statute ( Title 48, Chapter 6 of the South Carolina Code ). Please see the Statement of Need and Reasonableness herein . 2 Instructions: Repeal R.61 -67.1, Requirements for State Water Pollution Revolving Fund Loan Assistance, in the South Carolina Code of Regulations. Indicates Matter Stricken Indicates New Matter Text: 61-67.1. Requirements for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund Loan Assistance. I. Introduction A. Authorization The Federal Water Pollution Act (92 -500) as amended, otherwise known as the Clean Water Act (CWA), sets forth a schedule and mechanism for completing the transition to full State and Local responsibility for construction of Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW ). To replace the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Construction Grants Program, new authority is given to EPA to make grants to capitalize State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs), the primary purpose of which is to provide loans and other financial assistance for the construction of wastewater treatment facilities. SRF capitalization grants are authorized from Fiscal Year 1989 through Fiscal Year 1994. After the Fiscal Year 1994 funds are spent, the Federal role will no longer include f inancial assistance to States or Municipalities for wastewater treatment facilities construction. The States and Municipalities will thereafter have the sole responsibility for providing financing to meet the enforceable requirements of the Act. The 1987 South Carolina General Assembly created the State Water Pollution Revolving Fund, Title 48, Chapter 6. This legislation gives the Budget and Control Board the responsibility for managing the fiscal aspects of the Fund and Department of Health and Environ mental Control (DHEC) the responsibility for administering the technical and programmatic portions of the Fund. B. Objectives The purpose of the State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund is to create a financial assistance program, as mandated under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1987, to: 1. Assist project sponsors in meeting Federal and State mandated wastewater treatment levels and service standards. 2. Provide a long-term source of financing for wastewater treatment needs. 3. Encourage self -sufficiency at the State and Local levels for wastewater financing. 4. Provide affordable financing to eligible project sponsors. C. Definitions The following terms as used in these regulations shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this chapter: 3 1. \"Act\" means Public Law 92 -500 as amended by Public Law 100-4; the \"Water Quality Act of 1987.\" 2. \"Agency\" means the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 3. \"Board\" means the South Carolina B udget and Control Board. 4. \"Department\" means the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. 5. \"Fund\" means the money initially received from capitalization grants pursuant to the Act, all associated State match money, repayments of all principal and interest on loans made from the Fund, interest accruing to the Fund and any leveraged money applied to the Fund. 6. \"Loan Agreement\" means the agreement or contract made between a project sponsor and the Board which provides for State assistance to the project sponsor and for the repayment thereof by the project sponsor. 7. \"Project Sponsor or Loan Recipient\" means any county, municipality, intermunicipal, interstate or state agency, or special purpose district, exclu ding any special purpose districts (e.g. a school, an airport, etc.) whose primary purpose is not wastewater treatment. D. Eligible Applicants Any municipality, county, intermunicipal, interstate or state agency, or special purpose district whose primary function is wastewater treatment, is eligible to seek financial assistance from the SRF. E. Eligible Types of Financial Assistance All monies within the Fund must be used solely to provide loans and other authorized forms of financial assistance, but not grants. Other forms of financial assistance may include the following: 1. Guarantees - The Fund may be used to guarantee local debt obligations or purchase bond insurance where such actions would improve credit market access or reduce interest rates. Any project receiving this type of assistance must comply with all requirements applicable to projects financed directly by Fund loans. No monies in the Fund may be used to finance a reserve account for a municipal bond issue. 2. Refinancin g - The Fund may be used to refinance a local debt obligation at or below market rate when such debt was incurred after March 7, 1985. The project, however, must have complied with all requirements applicable to projects initially financed by Fund loans. F urthermore, where the original debt was in the form of a multi -purpose bond incurred for purposes extending beyond wastewater treatment facility construction, the Fund may provide refinancing only for eligible purposes and not for the entire debt. F. Eligible Types of Activities Financial assistance for eligible sponsors is limited to the following uses: 1. Construction of projects for secondary treatment, advanced treatment, or any cost effective alternative to secondary or advanced treatment, new interceptors and appurtenances and infiltration/inflow correction. Up to 20% of the Fund may be used for major rehabilitation or replacement 4 of collectors, provided the collectors are needed to assure the total integrity of the system, or for new collect ors in an existing community, where sufficient treatment capacity exists. 2. Implementation of a non-point source pollution control management program. The project must be consistent with plans developed under Section 319 of the Act. 3. Development and implementation of an estuary conservation and management plan. The project must be consistent with plans developed under Section 320 of the Act. All projects subject to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 must appear on the State 's annual priority list. G. Impact of Future Agency Rules and Regulations Any provision of the State regulations contained herein that is contrary to or inconsistent with subsequent Agency guidance, rules or regulations shall be immediately deemed null and void, and any associated changes shall be addressed through State policy memoranda. II. Requirements Placed on Loan Recipients This chapter provides an overview of the primary Federal and State requirements which will apply to recipients of financial assistance from the Fund. As prescribed by the Act, Federal requirements for the Fund largely parallel the Title II Construction Grants Regulations. Additional cross cutting Federal laws and directives will also apply to the Fund 's use. The Department will apply most of the constru ction grant regulations but will streamline those procedures, to the extent permissible, to more appropriately address financing by loans. In addition, the Department will issue guidance for project sponsor 's responsibilities under other Federal laws and directives. Necessary additional requirements and compliance standards will be addressed through separate program guidance. This guidance will identify areas of compliance by subject or requirement, identify the sponsor 's role, it 's responsibility and the required compliance documentation needed. The State 's role in the review and approval process will also be identified. A. Federal Programmatic Requirements An overview of the Federal regulations applicable to all loan recipients is presented in this section. Many of the Federal requirements are planning regulations and apply to completion of a facilities plan as has been required under the Agency 's construction grants program. A facilities plan must be prepared for all projects, except nonpoint sourc e and estuary projects which will require specific planning. The facilities plan and final plans and specifications must be approved prior to the submission of an application for construction financing. The cost of preparing a facilities plan and final plans and specifications may be eligible for reimbursement through the loan program once a construction loan is approved. The following summarizes the Federal requirements that must be met for all loan applicants and recipients pursuant to the provisions of the Act. 1. Best Practicable Waste Treatment Technology - Section 201(b) requires that projects apply best practicable waste treatment technology (see CFR 35.2005(b)(7): Definition of BPWTT, 40 CFR 35.2030(b)(2): Facilities Planning); 2. Categories of Need - Section 201(g)(1) limits assistance to projects for secondary treatment, advanced treatment, or any cost -effective alternative, new interceptors and appurtenances, and infiltration 5 - inflow correction. This Section retains the Governor 's discretionary set -aside by which a State can use up to 20 percent of its allotment for other projects within the definition of treatment works in Section 212(2), and for certain nonpoint source control and groundwater protection purposes, as defined in Section 319 of the Act and subsequent Agency regulations (40 CFR 35.2015(b)(2)(ii -iv): State Priority System and Project Priority List); 3. Alternative Waste Management Techniques - Section 201(g)(2) requires that alternative technologies be considered in project design (40 CFR 35.2030: Facilities Planning); 4. Infiltration/Inflow - Section 201(g)(3) requires the applicant to show that the related sewer collection system is not subject to excessiv e infiltration (40 CFR 35.2030(b)(4): Facilities Planning, 40 CFR 35.2120: Infiltration/Inflow); 5. Innovative/Alternative Technology - Section 201(g)(5) requires that applicants study innovative and alternative treatment technologies and take into account opportunities to construct revenue producing facilities and to make more efficient uses of energy and resources (40 CFR, 35.2030: Facilities Planning); 6. Recreation and Open Space Opportunities - Section 201(g)(6) requires that the applicant analyze the potential recreation and open space opportunities in the planning of the proposed facilities (40 CFR 35.2030(b)(5): Facilities Planning); 7. Water Quality Management Planning - Section 204(a)(1) and (2) requires that treatment works projects be included in plans developed under Sections 208 and 303(e), (40 CFR 35.2101: Water Quality Management Plans); 8. Sewer Use Ordinance/User Charge System - Section 204(b)(1) requires communities to develop user charge systems and to have the legal, insti tutional, managerial, and financial capability to construct, operate, and maintain the treatment works (40 CFR 35.2208: Adoption of Sewer Use Ordinance and User Charge System, 35.2130: Sewer Use Ordinance, 35.2140: User Charge System, and 35.2214: Grantee Responsibilities, 35.2122: Approval of User Charge System and proposed Sewer Use Ordinance, 35.2110: Access to Individual Systems, and 35.2206(a): Operation and Maintenance); 9. Project Performance - Section 204(d)(2) requires that one year after the date of construction the owner/operator of the treatment works must certify that the facility meets design specifications and effluent limitations included in its permit (40 CFR 35.2218(c), (d) and (e)(2): Project Performance); 10. Governor 's Discretion ary Fund - Section 211 provides that major rehabilitation or replacement of collectors is not eligible under the Governor 's 20 percent discretionary authority of 201(g)(1) unless the collector is needed to assure the total integrity of the treatment works, or that, for a new collector, adequate capacity exists at the facilities (40 CFR 35.2116 Collection System); 11. Value Engineering - Section 218 assures that treatment systems are cost -effective and requires that projects of over $10 million include a value engineering review (40 CFR 35.2030(b)(3): Cost-Effectiveness, Facilities Planning, and 35.2114: Value Engineering). 12. Environmental Review - Section 511(c)(1). Under Title VI of the Act, the State must conduct a NEPA (National Environmental Po licy Act) -like review (as conducted under the Agency Construction Grants Program) of projects constructed with monies from the Fund program. South Carolina must assure that all treatment works constructed in whole or in part with monies provided from the F und, will be subject to a NEPA-like review to evaluate the possible environmental impacts, including secondary impacts, associated with such construction. This environmental review requirement is included because 6 the potential exists for undesirable enviro nmental side-effects resulting from inappropriate design or site location, or from the promotion of uncontrolled residential, commercial, or industrial development. These reviews will provide for adequate public involvement. The Department will use the NEP A review process until such time as its own procedures have been developed and approved by EPA. 13. For the environmental assessment review and requirements cited above, the following Federal acts and rules may also apply to the loan project: 1. Archeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974 2. Executive Order 11990 Protection of Wetlands 3. National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as awarded 4. Executive Order 11988 Floodplain Management 5. Clean Air Act 6. Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended 7. State Clearinghouse Presidential Executive Order 12372. Consideration to the above acts, legislation and authority rules must be given during the Environmental Assessment Review. 14. Davis - Bacon Act - Section 513 applies Davis-Bacon labor wage provisions to treatment works construction (see 29 CFR Part 5). Wages paid for the construction of treatment works must conform to the prevailing wage rates established for the locality by the U. S. Depar tment of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act (Section 513, applies 40 U.S.C. 276 et seq.). 15. Other cross cutting Federal laws and directives as mandated by the Agency that may impact the loan project include, but not limited to, the following: 1. Co peland \"Anti -Kickback\" Act. 2. Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act. 3. Federal Equal Opportunity, Non-Discrimination and Civil Rights Act and Laws. 4. Buy American (Executive Order). B. State Programmatic Requirements 1. The sponsor is responsible for compliance with: a. The South Carolina Pollution Control Act. b. State guidance issued for procurement, property management and other applicable procedures. 7 c. Laws, rules and regulations and guidance documents governing the planning, design and construction of the project. d. The development and maintenance of records, documents, and procedures to establish adherence to all State issued guidance. 2. The Department will perform site visits and routine inspe ctions of facilities in order to resolve problems, provide technical and administrative assistance, and ensure compliance in all program areas or support any deviations or variances necessary prior to a project compliance audit. The Department will perform interim and final construction inspections to ensure construction consistency and adequacy. 3. The project sponsor will be responsible for the preparation and submission of all data and reports determined necessary by the Department and the Board. C. Financial Requirements The following identifies major financial requirements that will apply to all loan recipients. Additional financial requirements and responsibilities governing loans from the Fund will be defined in the loan application package, the loan agreement and specific guidance memoranda as appropriate. 1. Each loan applicant must establish one or more dedicated repayment sources that contain sufficient revenues to operate and maintain the system and cover debt service payments for the duration of the loan. Dedicated sources of revenue may be user charges, special assessments, general taxes, general obligation bonds, revenue bonds or other sources available to the project sponsor. 2. All loan recipients must maintain separate pro ject accounts in accordance with \"generally accepted government accounting standards.\" Unless otherwise directed by the Board, these standards are defined as those contained in the U. S. General Accounting Office publication \"Standards for Audit of Governm ental Organizations, Programs, Activities and Functions,\" dated 2/27/81. 3. Each loan recipient is required to conduct an annual audit and submit it to the Board. Audit guidelines are set forth in the Single Audit Act of 1984, OMB Circular A -128 and the U. S. General Accounting Office' s \"Standards for Audit of Governmental Organization, Programs, Activities and Functions.\" 4. Each project sponsor must comply with all terms and conditions set forth in the legally binding loan agreement which will be executed between the loan recipient and the Board before any monies are awarded. III. Priority, Selection and Application Process The following represents a general description of the process and procedures involved in applying for a loan from the Fund. Further information will be available through public notices and mass mailings. Instructions and guidance detailing specific requirements will also be provided to potential loan applicants. 1. To be eligible for consideration for a loan in any given y ear, the project must be on the State' s annual project priority list for that year. Placement on the priority list is dependent upon the project sponsor submitting a complete priority list questionnaire to the Department within the prescribed time frame. Q uestionnaires are available from the Department or the Board. 8 2. The priority system for ranking and selecting projects on the annual priority list will be developed by the Department and the Board and will be available for public comment. It should be noted that due to new Agency requirements, readiness to proceed will be a dominant factor in determining which projects on the list will be eligible to apply for loans. Higher ranked projects that are not ready to proceed will lose the opportunity for a loan to lower ranked projects that are ready. 3. Once a project is determined to be a potential loan recipient and the project sponsor has satisfied all technical and programmatic requirements as defined by the Department, the project sponsor will then submit a complete loan application to the Board. Loan applications will be available from the Board or the Department. 4. Project Sponsors fulfilling all programmatic requirements, satisfying all requirements of the financial review, and evidencing a soun d ability to repay the financial assistance will be offered a loan. 5. The loan becomes final when the project sponsor enters into a legally binding loan agreement with the Board. IV. Financial Provisions A. Loan Policies Specific loan policies, including but not limited to interest rates, terms, deferments, funding caps, repayment provisions and disbursement requirements will be established by the Board in advance of Fund implementation and made available for distribution to potential project sponsors. B. Loan Agreements Prior to awarding any loan, the project sponsor and the Board shall enter into a loan agreement containing, without limitation, the following: 1. The cost of the project, the amount of the loan, the terms of repayment a nd security for the loan. 2. The specific purpose for which proceeds of the loan may be expended, the requirements and procedures for disbursement of the loan and the duties and obligations imposed upon the loan recipient regarding the construction or completion of the project. 3. The agreement of the loan recipient to impose, collect and, if required to ensure repayment of the obligations according to the terms of the loan agreement, increase user charges, taxes or other dedicated revenue sources i dentified for the loan repayment. 4. The agreement of the loan recipient to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations issued by the Department, the Board or other State, Federal and Local bodies in regard to the financing, construction, operation, maintenance and use of the wastewater facilities project. C. Loan Delinquency Provisions Pursuant to authority provided in Section 48-6 -70(B) of Title 48 of the 1976 South Carolina Code of Laws, as amended, any failure of the project sponsor to make payment to the Board according to the prescribed repayment schedule will result in the Board requiring the State Treasurer and the Comptroller General to pay the Board the amount of other State aid the local unit may become entitled to until all delinquent payments plus interest have been paid. If the loan recipient is a special purpose district and 9 receives no other State aid, the Board will notify the Controller General to levy, and require the applicable County Treasurer to collect and remit to the Board, a special tax sufficient to cover the delinquent payments plus interest, and, if necessary, to ensure continued repayment of the loan. Additionally, should the loan of any project sponsor be declared delinquent, the Board may also take action to preclude the loan recipient from receiving grant funds or other types of financial assistance available from State agencies, unless otherwise prohibited by law, until such time as all amounts due on the loan have been paid and the loan is declared current .[Repealed]. Fiscal Impact Statement : There are no anticipated new costs associated with the repeal of this regulation to the state or its political subdivisions. Statement of Need and Reasonableness: The following presents an analysis of the factors listed in 1976 Code Section 1-23-115(C)(1)-(3) and (9)-(11): DESCRIPTION OF REGULATION: 61-67.1, Requirements for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund Loan Assistance. Purpose: The Department repeals R.61 -67.1, Requirements for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund Loan Assistance. This regulation is obsolete due to repeal of the original authorizing statute ( Title 48, Chapter 6 of the South Carolina Code ). In 1992, the General Assembly repealed Title 48, Chapter 6 and replaced it with the South Carolina Water Quality Revolving Fund Authority Act (Title 48, Chapter 5). Legal Authority: 1976 Code Sections 48-5 -10 et seq. Plan for Implementation: The DHEC Regulation Development Update (accessible at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/) provides a summary of and link to this repeal . Additionally, printed copies are available for a fee from the Department 's Freedom of Information Office . Upon taking legal effect, Department personnel will take appropriate steps to inform the regulated community of the repeal and any associated information. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND REASONABLENESS OF THE REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: In the interest of good government and efficie ncy, t he Department repeal s R.61 -67.1, Requirements for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund Loan Assistance . The regulation describes the process the Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") and the former South Carolina Budget and Control Board followed in administering the State Water Pollution Revolving Fund received in federal grants from the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") . In 1992, the General Assembly repealed S.C. Code Section 48 -6-10 et seq. and replaced it with the South Carolina Water Quality Revolving Fund Authority Act (S.C. Code Section 48 -5-10 et seq.) . Passage of the South Carolina Water Quality Revolving Fund Authority Act (\"Act\") has rendered R.61 -67.1 obsolete . The Act provides authority for the Department a nd the South Carolina Water Quality Revolving Fund Authority to administer the South Carolina clean water and drinking water revolving funds program and federal grants received as supplements to the revolving funds from the EPA . The South Carolina Water Qu ality Revolving Fund Authority comprises the members of the State Fiscal Accountability Authority, with 10 administrative and implementation support from the South Carolina Rural Infrastructure Authority (\"RIA\"). In accordance with the Act, the State Water P ollution Revolving Fund (\"SRF\") authorized under the former statute (Title 48, Chapter 6) remains in existence and is now referred to as the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (\"CWSRF\") . The CWSRF, like the former State Water Pollution Revolving Fund, provides low interest loans to public utilities and local governments for wastewater and stormwater infrastructure projects. The General Assembly amended Title 48, Chapter 5 in 1997 to include the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (\"DWSRF\"), which provides low interest loans to public utilities and local governments for public drinking water infrastructure projects . The 1987 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Act, otherwise known as the Clean Water Act, authorized federal funding for the CWSRF and the fo rmer State Water Pollution Revolving Fund . The 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act authorized federal funding for the DWSRF . The CWSRF and DWSRF are revolving funds because they receive repayments and interest from the loans made from the funds. Additional money comes into the funds through interest on investments and annual federal grants received from EPA . Repeal of the regulation will have no impact or implications for the current administration and implementation of the CWSRF or DWSRF . The Department does not propose replacing this regulation with a new regulation. The Department and RIA are able to effectively administer and implement the SRF program using the state statute, Title 48, Chapter 5, and federal laws, regulations, and grant requirements that govern the use of the funds. Other existing state laws and regulations also are used to implement the program such as environmental permitting regulations that govern the design and construction of wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: The Department anticipates no fiscal or economic impact on the state or its political subdivisions and the regulated community by the repeal of this regulation. Repeal of the regulation will have no impact or implications for the current administration and implementation of the South Carolina CWSRF . The CWSRF, like its predecessor, the State Water Pollution Revolving Fund under the repealed Title 48, Chapter 6, provides low interest loans to public utilities and local governments for wastewater and stormwater infrastructure projects. The Department and RIA are able to effectively administer and implement the CWSRF and DWSRF using the state statute, Title 48, Chapter 5, and federal laws, regulations, and grant requirements that govern the use of the funds . Other existing state laws and regulations also are used to implement the program such as environmental permitting regulations that govern the design and construction of wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: None. EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: Repealing the regulation will have no effect on the environment and public health. The Department and RIA are able to effectively administer and implement th e CWSRF and DWSRF using the state statute, Title 48, Chapter 5, and federal laws, regulations, and grant requirements that govern the use of the funds . Other existing state laws and regulations also are used to implement the program such as environmental permitting regulations that govern the design and construction of wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. 11 DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED: Repealing R.61-67.1 has no legal effect , as it has been obsolete since the repeal of S.C. Code Section 48-6-10 et seq . Statement of Rationale: R.61 -67.1 is repealed as it is obsolete due to repeal of the original authorizing statute ( Title 48, Chapter 6). The General Assembly repealed Title 48, Chapter 6 and replaced it with the South Carolina Water Quality Revolving Fund Authority Act (Title 48, Chapter 5) . The Department does not propose replacing this regulation with a new regulation . The Department and RIA are able to effectively administ er and implement the CWSRF and DWSRF using the state statute, Title 48, Chapter 5, and federal laws, regulations, and grant requirements that govern the use of the funds. Other existing state laws and regulations also are used to implement the program such as environmental permitting regulations that govern the design and construction of wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. Date: December 13, 2018 To: S.C. Board of Health and Environmental Control From: Bureau of Land and Waste Management Re: Public Hearing for Notice of Final Regulation Proposed Amendment of R.61- 79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulat ions For General Assembly Review Document No. 4841 I. Introduction The Bureau of Land and Waste Management (\"Bureau\") proposes the attached Notice of Final Regulation amending R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations . Legal authority resides in the South Carolina Hazardous Waste Management Act, S.C. Code Ann. Section 44-56-30, which authorizes the Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") to promulgate hazardo us waste management regulations, procedures, or standards as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment . The Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Section 1- 23-120(A), requires General Assembly review of this amendment . II. Facts 1. The Bureau proposes amend ing R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations , to adopt the Environmental Protection Agency's (\"EPA\") Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule published November 28, 2016, at 81 FR 85732- 85829. The Hazardous Waste Gene rator Improvements Rule reorganizes the hazardous waste generator regulations to improve their usability by the regulated community, provide a better understanding of how the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") hazardous waste generator regulat ory program works, address gaps in existing regulations to strengthen environmental protections, provide greater flexibility for hazardous waste generators to manage their hazardous waste in a cost -effective and protective manner, and make technical corrections to address inadvertent errors and remove obsolete references to programs that no longer exist. 2. The Department had a Notice of Drafting published in the April 27, 2018, State Register . 3. Appropriate Department staff conducted an internal revie w of the proposed amendment on August 7, 2018. 4. The Department conducted outreach meetings with the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce Environmental Technical Committee on January 5, 2018, March 2, 2018 and August 3, 2018 . The Department also published a notice on the Regulation Development Update webpage and provided notice to interested parties via email. 5. The Department had a Notice of Proposed Regulation published in the October 26, 2018, State Register . The Department did not receive public comments by the November 26, 2018, close of the public comment period. III. Request for Approval The Bureau respectthlly requests the Board to grant a finding of need and reasonableness of the attached Notice of Final Regulation to proceed with submission to the General Assembly.

Notice of Final Regulation 1 ATTACHMENT A STATE REGISTER NOTICE OF FINAL REGULATION FOR R.61- 79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations December 13, 2018 Document No. 4841 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL CHAPTER 61 Statutory Authority: 1976 Code Section 44- 56-30 61-79. Hazardous Waste Management Regulations. Synopsis: The Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") amends R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations, to adopt the Environmental Protection Agency's (\"EPA\") Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule published November 28, 2016, at 81 FR 85732- 85829. The amendments support the Department's goal of promoting and protecting the health of the public and the environm ent in a more efficient and effective manner. The amendments reorganize the hazardous waste generator regulations to improve their usability by the regulated community, provide a better understanding of how the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") hazardous waste generator regulatory program works, address gaps in existing regulations to strengthen environmental protections, provide greater flexibility for hazardous waste generators to manage their hazardous waste in a cost -effective and protec tive manner, and make technical corrections to address inadvertent errors and remove obsolete references to programs that no longer exist. The EPA periodically promulgates regulations that are either mandatory for authorized state programs to adopt or ma intain program equivalency or are optional for states because the changes are less stringent than the current federal regulations. While the majority of the EPA's Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule is equivalent to current state regulations and optional for state adoption, several provisions are more stringent and must be adopted by the Department to maintain federal program authorization. Due to the interrelated nature of the equivalent provisions and the more stringent provisions, the Department has adopt ed the rule in a single drafting that require d General Assembly review. The Department had a Notice of Drafting published in the April 27, 2018, South Carolina State Register. Section -by-Section Discussion of Amendment: 260.3.

A person who generates a solid waste, as defined in R.61- 79.261.2 must accurately determine if make an accurate determination as to whether that waste is a hazardous waste using the following methodin order to ensure wastes are properly managed according to applicable RCRA regulations. A hazardous waste determination is made using the following steps : (a) He should first determine if the waste is excluded from regulation under R.61- 79.261.4 The hazardous waste determination for each solid waste must be made at the point of waste generation, before any dil ution, 34 mixing, or other alteration of the waste occurs, and at any time in the course of its management that it has, or may have, changed its properties as a result of exposure to the environment or other factors that may change the properties of the waste such that the RCRA classification of the waste may change. (b) He must then determine if the waste is listed as a hazardous waste in subpart D of R.61 -79.261A person must determine whether the solid waste is excluded from regulation under R.61 -79.261.4. (c) For purposes of compliance with 268, or if the waste is not listed in subpart D of R.61- 79.261, the generator must then determine whether the waste is identified in subpart C of R.61 -79.261 by either: If the waste is not excluded under R.61- 79.261.4, the person must then use knowledge of the waste to determine whether the waste meets any of the listing descriptions under subpart D of R.61- 79.261. Acceptable knowledge that may be used in making an accurate determination as to whether the waste is listed may include waste origin, composition, the process producing the waste, feedstock, and other reliable and relevant information. If the waste is listed, the person may file a delisting petition under R.61- 79.260.20 and 260.22 to demonstrate to the Departm ent that the waste from this particular site or operation is not a hazardous waste. (1) Testing the waste according to the methods set forth in Subpart C of R.61- 79.261, or according to an equivalent method approved by the Department under R.61- 79.260.21; or (2) Applying knowledge of the hazard characteristic of the waste in light of the materials or the processes used. Revise 61- 79.262.11(d) and add items 262.11(d)(1) to (d)(2) to read: (d) If the waste is determined to be hazardous, the generator must refer to parts 261, 264, 265, 266, 268 and 273 for possible exclusions or restrictions pertaining to management of the specific waste. The person then must also determine whether the waste exhibits one or more hazardous characteristics as identified i n subpart C of R.61- 79.261 by following the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, or a combination of both. (amended 11/90; 5/96) (1) The person must apply knowledge of the hazard characteristic of the waste in light of the materials or the processes used to generate the waste. Acceptable knowledge may include process knowledge (e.g., information about chemical feedstocks and other inputs to the production process); knowledge of products, by-products, and intermediates produced by the ma nufacturing process; chemical or physical characterization of wastes; information on the chemical and physical properties of the chemicals used or produced by the process or otherwise contained in the waste; testing that illustrates the properties of the waste; or other reliable and relevant information about the properties of the waste or its constituents. A test other than a test method set forth in subpart C of R.61 -79.261, or an equivalent test method approved by the Department under R.61 -79.260.21, may be used as part of a person's knowledge to determine whether a solid waste exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste. However, such tests do not, by themselves, provide definitive results. Persons testing their waste must obtain a representative sample of the waste for the testing, as defined at R.61- 79.260.10. (2) When available knowledge is inadequate to make an accurate determination, the person must test the waste according to the applicable methods set forth in subpart C of R.61- 79.261 or according to an equivalent method approved by the Department under R.61- 79.260.21 and in accordance with the following: (i) Persons testing their waste must obtain a representative sample of the waste for the testing, as defined at R.61- 79.260.10. 35 (ii) Where a test method is specified in subpart C of R.61- 79.261, the results of the regulatory test, when properly performed, are definitive for determining the regulatory status of the waste. Revise 61- 79.262.11(e) to read: (e) Finally, he must make a determination if the waste is listed in Appendix XI of R.61- 79.261.

Revise 61- 79.262.11 to add subsections 262.11(f) to 262.11(g) to read: (f) Recordkeeping for small and large quantity generators. A small or large quantity generator must maintain records supporting its hazardous waste determinations, including records that identify whether a solid waste is a hazardous waste, as defined by R.61- 79.261.3. Records must be maintained for at least three (3) years from the date that the waste was last sent to on -site or off -site treatment, storage, or disposal. These records must comprise the generator's knowledge of the waste and support the generator's determination, as described at paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The records must include, but are not limited to, the following types of information: the results of any tests, sampling, waste analyses, or other determinations made in accordance with this section; records documenting the tests, sampling, and analytical methods used to demonstrate the validity and relevance of such tests; records consulte d in order to determine the process by which the waste was generated, the composition of the waste, and the properties of the waste; and records which explain the knowledge basis for the generator's determination, as described at R.61- 79 paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The periods of record retention referred to in this section are extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Department. (g) Identifying hazardous wa ste numbers for small and large quantity generators. If the waste is determined to be hazardous, small quantity generators and large quantity generators must identify all applicable EPA hazardous waste numbers (EPA hazardous waste codes) in subparts C and D of R.61- 79.261. Prior to shipping the waste off site, the generator also must mark its containers with all applicable EPA hazardous waste numbers (EPA hazardous waste codes) according to section 262.32. Revise 61- 79.262.12 to read: 262.12. Identificati on Numbers.

(b) If the generator has already prepared a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan in accordance with 40 CFR part 112, or some other emergency or contingency plan, it need only amend that plan to incorporate hazardous waste management provisions that are sufficient to comply with the standards of this part. The generator may develop one contingency plan that meets all regulatory standards. The Department recommends that the plan be based on the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (\"One Plan\"). (c) The plan must describe arrangements agreed to with the local police department, fire department, other emergency response teams, emergency response contractors, equipment suppliers, local hospitals or, if applicable, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, pursuant to R.61- 79.262.256. (d) The plan must l ist names and emergency telephone numbers of all persons qualified to act as emergency coordinator (see R.61- 79.262.264), and this list must be kept up to date. Where more than one person is listed, one must be named as primary emergency coordinator and ot hers must be listed in the order in which they will assume responsibility as alternates. In situations where the generator facility has an emergency coordinator continuously on duty because it operates twenty -four (24) hours per day, every day of the year, the plan may list the staffed position ( e.g., operations manager, shift coordinator, shift operations supervisor) as well as an emergency telephone number that can be guaranteed to be answered at all times. (e) The plan must include a list of all emergency equipment at the facility (such as fire extinguishing systems, spill control equipment, communications and alarm systems (internal and external), and decontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. This list must be kept up to date. In addition, the plan must include the location and a physical description of each item on the list, and a brief outline of its capabilities. (f) The plan must include an evacuation plan for generator personnel where there is a possibility that evacuation cou ld be necessary. This plan must describe signal(s) to be used to begin evacuation, evacuation 78 routes, and alternate evacuation routes (in cases where the primary routes could be blocked by releases of hazardous waste or fires). 262.262. Copies of continge ncy plan. A copy of the contingency plan and all revisions to the plan must be maintained at the large quantity generator and \u2014 (a) The large quantity generator must submit a copy of the contingency plan and all revisions to all local emergency responder s (i.e., police departments, fire departments, hospitals, and state and local emergency response teams that may be called upon to provide emergency services). This document may also be submitted to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, as appropriate. (b) A large quantity generator that first becomes subject to these provisions after May 30, 2017, or a large quantity generator that is otherwise amending its contingency plan must at that time submit a quick reference guide of the contingency plan to the local emergency responders identified at paragraph (a) of this section or, as appropriate, the Local Emergency Planning Committee. The quick reference guide must include the following elements: (1) The types/names of hazardous wastes in layman's terms and the associated hazard associated with each hazardous waste present at any one time ( e.g., toxic paint wastes, spent ignitable solvent, corrosive acid); (2) The estimated maximum amount of each hazardous waste that may be present at any one time; (3) The identification of any hazardous wastes where exposure would require unique or special treatment by medical or hospital staff; (4) A map of the facility showing where hazardous wastes are generated, accumulated, and treated and routes for accessing these wastes; (5) A street map of the facility in relation to surrounding businesses, schools, and residential areas to understand how best to get to the facility and also evacuate citizens and workers; (6) The locations of water supply ( e.g., fire hydrant and its flow rate); (7) The identification of on- site notification systems ( e.g., a fire alarm that rings off site, smoke alarms); and (8) The name of the emergency coordinator(s) and twenty- four (24) hour, seven (7) -days-a-week emer gency telephone number(s) or, in the case of a facility where an emergency coordinator is continuously on duty, the emergency telephone number for the emergency coordinator. (c) Generators must update, if necessary, their quick reference guides, whenever the contingency plan is amended and submit these documents to the local emergency responders identified at paragraph (a) of this section or, as appropriate, the Local Emergency Planning Committee. 262.263. Amendment of contingency plan. The contingency plan must be reviewed, and immediately amended, if necessary, whenever: 79 (a) Applicable regulations are revised; (b) The plan fails in an emergency; (c) The generator facility changes\u2014 in its design, construction, operation, maintenance, or other circu mstances\u2014 in a way that materially increases the potential for fires, explosions, or releases of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents, or changes the response necessary in an emergency; (d) The list of emergency coordinators changes; or (e) The list of emergency equipment changes. 262.264. Emergency coordinator. At all times, there must be at least one employee either on the generator's premises or on call ( i.e., available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short p eriod of time) with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures and implementing the necessary emergency procedures outlined in R.61- 79.262.265. Although responsibilities may vary depending on factors such as type and variety of haz ardous waste(s) handled by the facility, as well as type and complexity of the facility, this emergency coordinator must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the generator's contingency plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the locatio n and characteristics of hazardous waste handled, the location of all records within the facility, and the facility's layout. In addition, this person must have the authority to commit the resources needed to carry out the contingency plan. 262.265. Emerg ency procedures. (a) Whenever there is an imminent or actual emergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or his designee when the emergency coordinator is on call) must immediately: (1) Activate internal facility alarms or communication systems, w here applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and (2) Notify appropriate state or local agencies with designated response roles if their help is needed. (b) Whenever there is a release, fire, or explosion, the emergency coordinator must immediately identify the character, exact source, amount, and areal extent of any released materials. The emergency coordinator may do this by observation or review of the facility records or manifests and, if necessary, by chemical analysis. (c) Concurr ently, the emergency coordinator must assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion ( e.g., the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run -offs from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat -induced explosions). (d) If the emergency coordinator deter mines that the facility has had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or the environment, outside the facility, the emergency coordinator must report the findings as follows: 80 (1) If the assessment indicates that evacuation of local areas may be advisable, the emergency coordinator must immediately notify appropriate local authorities. The emergency coordinator must be available to help appropriate officials decide whether local areas should be evacuated; and (2) The emergency coordinator must immediately notify either the government official designated as the on -scene coordinator for that geographical area, or the National Response Center (using their 24 -hour toll free number 800/424- 8802). The report must include: (i) Name and telephone number of reporter; (ii) Name and address of the generator; (iii) Time and type of incident (e.g., release, fire); (iv) Name and quantity of material(s) involved, to the extent known; (v) The extent of injuries, if any; a nd (vi) The possible hazards to human health, or the environment, outside the facility. (e) During an emergency, the emergency coordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other hazardous waste at the generator's facility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing released hazardous waste, and removing or isolating containers. (f) If the genera tor stops operations in response to a fire, explosion or release, the emergency coordinator must monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, wherever this is appropriate. (g) Immediately after an emergency, the emergency coordinator must provide for treating, storing, or disposing of recovered waste, contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that results from a release, fire, or explosion at the facility. Unless the generator can d emonstrate, in accordance with section 261.3(c) or (d), that the recovered material is not a hazardous waste, then it is a newly generated hazardous waste that must be managed in accordance with all the applicable requirements and conditions for exemption in R.61- 79.262, 263, and 265. (h) The emergency coordinator must ensure that, in the affected area(s) of the facility: (1) No hazardous waste that may be incompatible with the released material is treated, stored, or disposed of until cleanup procedur es are completed; and (2) All emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are resumed. (i) The generator must note in the operating record the time, date, and details of any incident that requires implementing the contingency plan. Within fifteen (15) days after the incident, the generator must submit a written report on the incident to the Department. The report must include: (1) Name, address, and telephone number of the generator ; (2) Date, time, and type of incident (e.g., fire, explosion); 81 (3) Name and quantity of material(s) involved; (4) The extent of injuries, if any; (5) An assessment of actual or potential hazards to human health or the environment, where this i s applicable; and (6) Estimated quantity and disposition of recovered material that resulted from the incident.

Legal Authority: 1976 Code Section 44- 56-30. Plan for Implementation: The DHEC Regulation Development Update (accessible at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/) provides a summary of and link to this amendment. Additionally, printed copies are avai lable for a fee from the Department's Freedom of Information Office. Upon taking legal effect, Department personnel will take appropriate steps to inform the regulated community of the amendment and any associated information. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND RE ASONABLENESS OF THE REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: The Department amends R.61- 79 to adopt the EPA's Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule, published on November 28, 2016, at 81 FR 85732- 85829. The rule amends the exist ing hazardous waste generator regulatory program by reorganizing the hazardous waste generator regulations to improve their usability by the regulated community. This rule clarifies how the RCRA hazardous waste generator regulatory program works and addres ses gaps in the existing regulations to strengthen environmental protections. This rule provides greater flexibility for generators to manage hazardous waste in a cost-effective and protective manner, and makes technical corrections and changes to address inadvertent errors and remove outdated references to programs that no longer exist. While the majority of the rule is equivalent to current state regulations and optional for state adoption, several provisions are more stringent and must be adopted by the Department to maintain federal program authorization. Due to the interrelated nature of the equivalent provisions and the more stringent provisions, the Department adopts the rule in a single drafting that requires General Assembly review. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: There is no anticipated increased cost to the state or its political subdivisions resulting from this revision. There will likely be a slight increase in costs to the regulated community for compliance from this revision. The amendme nts to R.61- 79 reorganize the hazardous waste generator regulations to improve their usability by the regulated community, provide a better understanding of how the RCRA hazardous waste generator regulatory program works, address gaps in existing regulations to strengthen environmental protections, provide greater flexibility for hazardous waste generators to manage their hazardous waste in a cost-effective and protective manner, and make technical corrections to address inadvertent errors and remove obsole te references to programs that no longer exist. UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: There are no uncertainties of estimates regarding costs to the state or its political subdivisions. 89 EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: The revision to R.61- 79 provide s continued protection of the environment and public health, as indicated above. DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED: If the regulation is not implemented, there will be a detrimental effect on the environment and public health because the South Carolina would not be implementing or realizing the benefits of the EPA's Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule. Stateme nt of Rationale: R.61- 79 contains requirements for hazardous waste management, including identification of waste, standards for generators, transporters, and owners/operators of treatment, storage, and disposal (\"TSD\") facilities, procedures for permits f or TSD facilities, investigation and cleanup of hazardous waste; and closure and post -closure requirements. As an authorized state program, the regulation must be equivalent to and consistent with the U.S. EPA's RCRA regulations, 42 U.S.C. Sections 6901 et seq. The EPA periodically promulgates regulations that are either mandatory for authorized state programs to adopt or maintain program equivalency or are optional for states because the changes are less stringent than the current federal regulations. Whil e the majority of the EPA's Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule is equivalent to current state regulations and optional for state adoption, several provisions are more stringent and must be adopted by the Department to maintain federal program authorization. Due to the interrelated nature of the equivalent provisions and the more stringent provisions, the Department has adopt ed the rule in a single drafting that require d General Assembly review. Date: December 13, 2018 To: S.C. Board of Health and Environmental Control From: Bureau of Land and Waste Management Re: Public Hearing for Notice of Final Regulation Proposed Amendment of R.61- 79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations Legislative Review is Not Required Document No. 4840 I. Introduction The Bureau of Land and Waste Management (\"Bureau\") proposes the attached Notice of Final Regulation amending R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations, for publication in the December 28, 2018, South Carolina State Register (\"State Register \"). Legal authority resides in South Carolina Hazardous Wast e Management Act, S.C. Code Ann. Section 44 -56-30, which authorizes the Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") to promulgate hazardous waste management regulations, procedures, or standards as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment. The Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Section 1- 23-120(H)(1), exempts this amendment from General Assembly review, as the Department promulgates this amendment for compliance with federal law. The amendment will take legal ef fect as of the December 2 8, 2018, publication in the State Register. II. Facts 1. The Bureau proposes amending R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations, to adopt the Imports and Exports of Hazardous Waste Rule published November 28, 2016, at 81 FR 85696- 85729 and published on August 29, 2017, at 82 FR 41015- 41016 in the Federal Register by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). The Imports and Exports of Hazardous Waste Rule amends existing requirements regarding the import an d export of hazardous wastes from and into the United States. The Department proposed adopting the rule to maintain compliance with federal law and provide greater protection to human health and the environment by making existing import - and export -related requirements more consistent with the current import -export requirements for shipments between members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, enabling electronic submittal to the EPA of all import - and export -related documents (e.g., export notices, export annual reports), and enabling electronic validation of consent in the Automated Export System for export shipments subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") export consent requirements prior to exit. 2. The D epartment had a Notice of Drafting published in the April 27, 2018, State Register . 3. Appropriate Department staff conducted an internal review of the proposed amendment on August 7, 2018. 4. The Department conducted outreach meetings with the South C arolina Chamber of Commerce Environmental Technical Committee on January 5, 2018, March 2, 2018 and August 3, 2018 . The Department also published a notice on the Regulation Development Update website and provided notice to interested parties via email. 5. The Department had a Notice of Proposed Regulation published in the October 26, 2018, State Register . The Department did not receive public comments by the November 26, 2018, close of the public comment period. III.

In such an event, the responsibilities of the Amber control procedures shift as provided: country that cons iders the waste hazardous, and are not subject to the requirements of this subpart. All responsibilities of the importer or exporter shift to the foreign importer or foreign exporter in the other country that considers the waste hazardous unless the partie s make other arrangements through contracts. Note to paragraph (a)(2): Some wastes subject to the Amber control procedures Amber list wastes are not listed or otherwise identified as hazardous under RCRA, and therefore are not subject to the Amber control procedures requirements of this subpart. Regardless of the status of the waste under RCRA, however, other Federal environmental statutes (e.g., the Toxic Substances Control Act) restrict certain waste imports or exports. Such restrictions continue to appl y with regard to this subpart . (3) Procedures for mixtures of wastes Mixtures of wastes. (i) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more other Green wastes such that the resulting mixture is not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in 262.80(a) shall be subject to the Green control procedures, provided the composition of this mixture does not impair its environmentally sound recovery hazardous waste is not subject to the requirements of this subpart . 28 Note to Paragraph (a)(3)(i): The regulated community should note that some OECD Member countries may require, by domestic law, that mixtures of different Green wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures. (ii) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more Amber wastes, i n any amount, de minimis or otherwise, or a mixture of two or more Amber wastes, such that the resulting waste mixture is considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in 262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures, provided the composition of this mixture does not impair its environmentally sound recovery hazardous waste is subject to the requirements of this subpart . Note to Paragraph (a)(3)(ii): The regulated community should note that some OECD Member countries may require, by domestic law, that a mixture of a Green waste and more than a de minimis amount of an Amber waste or a mixture of two or more Amber wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures.

Purpose: The purpose of the amendment is to maintain state consistency with regulations of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which published the f inal rule on November 28, 2016, at 81 FR 85696- 85729. Legal Authority: 1976 Code Section 44- 56-30. Plan for Implementation: The DHEC Regulation Development Update (accessible at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/RegulationDevelopmentUpda te/) provides a summary of and link to this amendment. Additionally, printed copies are available for a fee from the Department 's Freedom of Information Office. Upon taking legal effect, Department personnel will take appropriate steps to inform the regula ted community of the amendment and any associated information. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND REASONABLENESS OF THE REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: The Bureau of Land and Waste Management adopt s the Imports and Exports of Hazardous Waste Rule published on November 28, 2016, at 81 FR 85696- 85729. The rule amends the existing import and export of hazardous wastes regulations from and into the United States. This rule provides greater protection to human health and the environment by making existing import - and export -related requirements more consistent with the current import -export requirements for shipments between member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), enable s electronic submittal to EPA of all import - and export -related documents, and enables electronic validation of consent in the Automated Export System (AES) for export shipments subject to RCRA export consent requirements prior to exit. Adoption of this ru le is required to comply with federal law and bring s R.61- 79 into conformity with the federal regulation. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: There is no anticipated increased cost to the state or its political subdivisions resulting from this revision . There will likely be a slight increase in costs to the regulated community f or compliance from this revision. Amendments to R.61- 79 will make existing import- and export -related requirements more consistent with the current import -export requirements for shipments between members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, enable electronic submittal to the EPA of all import - and export -related 64 documents, and enable electronic validation of consent in the Automated Export System for export shipments to the RCRA export consent requirements prior to exit. UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: There are no uncertainties of estimates relative to the costs to the state or its political subdivisions. EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: The revision to R.61- 79 will provide continued protection of the environment and human health in accordance with updates to federal law. DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED: If the regulation is not implemented the EPA 's delegation of authority to the state to implement environmental protection programs would be compromised. As a delegated state program, the EPA requires that the state 's regulations be at least as stringent as, and equivalent to, the federal regulations. Adoption of these revisions ensure equivalency with federal requirements. Date: December 13, 2018 To: S.C. Board of Health and Environmental Control From: Bureau of Environmental Health Services Re: Public Hearing for Notice of Final Regulation Proposed Amendment of R.61 -25, Retail Food Establishments Proposed Repeal of R.61 -37, Retail Food Establishment Inspection Fees Document No. 4842 I.

This would provide the retail food industry with one streamlined regulation while allowing for necessary program support through an increase in inspection fees. Finally, these amendments include other changes deemed ne cessary by the Department to improve the overall clarity, organization, and quality of the regulation. These proposed changes include, but are not limited to, stylistic changes, updates to definitions and exemptions, corrections for clarity, readability, g rammar, punctuation, references, codification, and overall improvement of the text of the regulation. 2.

[Repealed]. Fiscal Impact Statement: There are no anticipated new costs to the state or its political subdivisions associated with the implementation of this regulation. Statement of Need and Reasonableness: The following presents an analysis of the factors listed in 1976 Code Section 1 -23-115(C)(1) -(3) and (9)-(11): DESCRIPTION OF REGULATION: 61 -25, Retail Food Establishments ; and 61 -37, Retail Food Establishment Inspection Fees. Purpose: Th e Department repeals R.61 -37, Retail Food Establis hment Inspection Fees, in total and amends R.61 -25, Retail Food Establishments, to incorporate revised fee schedules currently residing in R.61 -37. Furthermore, the Department amends R.61 -25 to meet the current standards of the 2017 United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") Food Code. The FDA Food Code is the national standard for state, local, and tribal food protection programs. The FDA Food Code offers a practical, scientifically -sound technical and legal basis for regulating the retail food es tablishment segment of the food industry by addressing the risk factors known to cause foodborne illness outbreaks in retail food establishment settings. The amendments also include revisions to selected sections of R.61 -25 to reflect the current business models of the food service industry and incorporate comments and suggestions from the regulated community. The amendments also include other changes as deemed necessary by the Department to improve the overall clarity, organization, and quality of the regu lation. These changes include, but are not limited to, stylistic changes, updates to definitions and exemptions, corrections for clarity, readability, grammar, punctuation, references, codification, and overall improvement of the text of the regulation. Legal Authority: 1976 Code Sections 44 -1-140(2), 44 -1-150, and 44 -1-180. 204 Plan for Implementation: The DHEC Regulation Development Update (accessible at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/) provides a summary of a nd link to this amendment and repeal. Additionally, printed copies are available for a fee from the Department's Freedom of Information Office. Upon taking legal effect, Department personnel will take appropriate steps to inform the regulated community of the amendment/repeal and any associated information. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND REASONABLENESS OF THE REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: The amendments will allow the Department, through regulation, to meet the current standards of the 2017 United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") Food Code. The FDA Food Code is the national standard for state, local, and tribal food protection programs. The FDA Food Code offers practical, science -based guidance that addresses the risk factors known to cause foodborne illness outbreaks in retail food establishment settings. It is amended every two (2) years and published in full every four (4) years via the Conference for Food Protection, a national conference of food safety regulators, food scientists, industry representatives, and members of academia. The amendments also revise the regulation to reflect current business models within the food service industry not addressed by the FDA Food Code . The amendments also incorporate an incre ase in inspection fees, which will provide necessary program support. The amendments merge R.61 -37 into R.61 -25 to provide the retail food industry with one streamlined regulation. The amendments also include other changes as deemed necessary by the Department to improve the overall clarity, organization, and quality of the regulation. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: The amendments seek to benefit food safety in South Carolina and the health of South Carolina's citizens, as the intent of this r egulation is to provide consumers with safe, unadulterated food and food products at the retail level. The amendment of R.61 -25 will allow the regulation to conform to the current national standard set by the 2017 FDA Food Code. For the food service indust ry, including many establishments associated with national chains, the current edition of the FDA Food Code provides a needed uniformity and consistency with food safety rules nationally. Other changes to the regulation improve the overall clarity, organiz ation, quality, and consistency of the regulation, which benefits the public and regulated community by facilitating improved understanding and implementation of the regulation. The increase in fees will benefit the Bureau of Environmental Health Service s (\"Bureau\") and ease the burden on the general public by facilitating additional program support through increasing existing fees instead of requesting additional state taxpayer funding. The additional funds will generate more resources to fund Department development and provision of compliance assistance tools and training for the regulated community to support facilities in developing practical food safety systems for their operations. The fee increase is based on the Bureau's review of comparable regio nal food safety programs and evaluation of program needs due to retail food service industry growth. Existing program fees were established in 2000 and have not increased since such time. The following fee changes will both ensure fees for South Carolina f acilities remain in keeping with fees charged by other southeastern states and also generate much needed funds for the Bureau's permit and inspection programs. Under the amended regulation, the base annual inspection fee of sixty dollars ($60.00) will be increased to one hundred dollars 205 ($100.00). The annual inspection fee increases by increments of fifty dollars ($50.00) per tier up to a maximum inspection fee of four hundred and fifty dollars ($450.00), as compared to increments of thirty dollars ($30.00) per tier up to a maximum inspection fee of two hundred and seventy dollars ($270.00) under the preexisting regulation. To meet the growing demands for service and inspection, the Department also is increasing the initial permitting fee to include a one-time fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) in addition to the applicable tiered annual inspection fee. This increased fee will support the cost of conducting pre-operational and permit inspections. UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: None. EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONME NT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: Implementation of this regulation will not compromise the protection of the environment or the public health. The regulation will help to ensure that consumers are receiving safe, unadulterated food and food products at the retail le vel. The amendment of R.61 -25 to conform to the most recent edition of the FDA Food Code also provides effective means of reducing the risks of foodborne illnesses within retail food establishments, thus protecting consumers and industry from potentially d evastating public health consequences and financial losses. DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED: There will be no adverse effect on the environment if the regulations are not implemented. Not imple menting these regulations could have detrimental effect on public health. Not implementing these regulations will prevent the implementation of the latest sanitary standards and will impede the comprehensive approach to food safety management needed in add ressing food protection in the retail food industry. This could have a detrimental effect on the health of South Carolina's citizens and visitors. Failure to provide the necessary fee funding for the program may result in a decrease in effectiveness of the food safety oversight program as the industry continues to expand in size. The lack of increased fee funding also reduces Department compliance assistance resources for the regulated industry. Statement of Rationale: These amendments provide the retail food industry the regulatory framework to meet the latest sanitation requirements for providing safe, unadulterated food and food products to consumers. The FDA Food Code offers proven scientific reasons behind regulation and actively seeks input from the scientific and academic communities as their understanding of foodborne pathogens increases. The amendment of R.61 -25 to conform to the most recent edition of the FDA Food Code provides a comprehensive approach to food safety management, superior supporti ng documents and training, and is consistent with the national integrated food safety management system. Furthermore, the R.61 -25 amendments and R.61 -37 repeal provide the retail food industry with one streamlined regulation while allowing for necessary pr ogram support through an increase in inspection fees. Other revisions are intended to better reflect current business models within the food service industry. Other changes to the regulati on improve the overall clarity, organization, and quality, of the re gulation. 206 ATTACHMENT B SUMMARY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS AND DEPARTMENT RESPONSES Document No. 4842 R.61-25, Retail Food Establishments As of the November 26, 2018 , close of the Notice of Proposed Regulation c omment period: NAME SECTION CITATION PUBLIC COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE Douglas OFlaherty, IOM, Vice President, South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association Chapter 9 -6 Immediate Outdoor Cooking, Section (E)(1) We would like to see pizza ovens be added to the list of approved equipment.

R.61 -25, as revised, continues to satisfy Standard 1 (Regulatory Foundation) of the FDA's Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards. Testimony of William R. Jones , Ph.D. Acting Director, Office of Food Safety Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition U.S. Food and Drug Administration To the South Carolina and South Carolina Board of Health and Environmental Con trol, 11/21/2018 Regulation 61- 25, Retail Food Establishments and Regulation 61- 37, Retail Food Establishment Inspection Fees, Document #4842 Honorable Members of South Carolina and the South Carolina Board of Health and Environmental Control , thank you for the opportunity to submit written testimony in which we will discuss the public health significance and importance of the adoption and implementation of the FDA Food Code , along with stating several cross -cutting benefits to government and industry . The Public Health Service has determined through several studies that effective foodborne disease prevention requires the application of comprehensive food sanitation measures from production to consumption. FDA's purpose in maintaining an updated model food code is to assist food control jurisdictions at all levels of government by providing them with a scientifically sound, technical, and legal basis for regulating the retail segment of the food industry. The model Food Code provides guidance on food s afety, sanitation, and fair equitable advice that can be uniformly adopted for the retail segment of the food industry. The document is the cumulative result of the efforts and recommendations of many individuals, agencies, and organizations with years of experience using earlier model code editions. It embraces the concept that our quality of life, state of health, and the public welfare are directly affected by how we collectively provide and protect our food. Page 2 of 4 Foodborne illness in the United States is a major cause of personal distress, preventable death, and avoidable economic burden. Despite advances in food safety, foodborne illness remains a common occurrence in the United States . CDC estimates that each year roughly 1 out of 6 Americans (or 48 m illion people) gets sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die from foodborne diseases. The CDC states that reducing foodborne illness by just 1% would keep about 500,000 Americans from getting sick each year; reducing foodborne illness by 10% would keep about 5 million from getting sick. In 2014, FDA initiated a Retail Food Safety Initiative1 as part of its prevention- based, farm -to- table food safety strategy to reduce foodborne illness. A goal of F DA's Retail Food Safety Initiative is to \" Encourag e widespread, uniform, and complete adoption of the FDA Food Code.\" To address this goal, FDA emphasizes benefits that can be realized when State, territorial, local, and tribal governments adopt the Food Code in its entirety. An important step in this process is engaging all stakeholders . FDA gained insights from the Restaurant Food Safety Partnership and the Retail Food Store Partnership established under the FDA Retail Food Safety Initiative when developing the document entitled, \"Benefits Associated with Complete Adoption and Implementation of the FDA Food Code\". 2 As you seek to update the South Carolina food safety statutes, codes, and or dinances related to food safety, understanding and recognition of these twenty -one benefits by government , and the retail store, foodservice and vending industries should help to ensure complete and widespread Food Code adoption in South Carolina. Cross -cutting Benefits for Government and Industry 1. Promotes uniform national standards for retail food safety to redu ce complexity and better ensure compliance. 1 For more information regarding the FDA Food Safety Initiative visit the link: http:/ /www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/FoodborneIllnessRiskFactorReduction/ucm230315.htm 2 FDA thanks the Restaurant Food Safety Partnership and the Retail Food Store Partnership for their insight in developing this document at: https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/FoodCode/ucm494616.htm 2. Ensures food safety regulations reflect the most current science available and evolve to reflect new science and knowledge, emerging technologies and to remain current with other federal laws. 3. Created through a coordinated and collaborative process (Conference for Food Protection), the Food Code reflects input from all stakeholders: National, state and local regulators, industry, academia and consumers. 4. Stakeholders can take advantage of scientific and personnel r esources expended by FDA and other agencies to ensure the FDA Food Code is complete. 5. Provides effective controls as a means of reducing the risks of foodborne illnesses within retail establishments, thus protecting consumers and industry from potentially devastating health consequences and financial losses. 6. Provides a comprehensive approach to food safety management and provides extensive supporting documents and training. 7. Facilitates and allows for standardization of inspections and inspectors. 8. May result in cost savings related to the conduct of inspections. 9. Reduces complexity and the paperwork burden for industry and government alike. 10. Improves consumers' understanding of food safety expectations. 11. Creates a common/standardized food safety language that can improve communication between regulators and industry operators. 12. Uniformity of using the same Food Code allows comparison of performance across national chains by providing standardized inspection criteria. Thereby an establishment can target resources ac cording to science and risk to improve the public health performance of restaurants. 13. State and local agencies usage of FDA interpretations of Food Code reduces the work load associated with development of interpretations. 14. Creates a common/standardized lang uage between regulators and industry. 15. Fosters a common understanding of risk, risk control/management and food safety between industry and regulators. 16. Reduces industry Food Safety training costs by allowing the utilization of training materials which can b e used across all jurisdictions. Page 4 of 4 Regulatory Benefits 1. Ensures conformance with Standard No .1 - Regulatory Foundation of FDA's Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards. 2. Avoids errors caused when State and Local jurisdictions adopt only s elected sections of the FDA Food Code (cross references may be missed or overlooked or incorrectly referenced). 3. Makes the process for updating laws and regulations at the State and Local level more efficient through elimination of redundant food code creat ion processes at the state and local regulatory level. 4. Conserves resources by allowing regulatory software providers to develop inspection tools that work at all jurisdictions. 5. Demonstrates food safety commitment and therefore increases eligibility for fed eral training, grants, cooperative agreements and other resources. We are writing to you today to strongly encourage you to adopt the FDA Model Food Code as the South Carolina and South Carolina Board of Health and Environmental Control regulations governing food safety at the retail level. Recommendation: Adoption and implementation of all the provisions in the FDA Model Food Code by South Carolina and the South Carolina Board of Health and Environmental Control , can increase the safety of food sold a t retail, and provide needed protections for all consumers, especially those at high-risk of foodborne illness and its serious consequences. We urge you to adopt the provisions of the FDA Model Food Code in their entirety. Thank you for consideration of this information and recommendation. "}
