The earliest ancient texts trace its evolution through observation and response to laws of the natural world, where every living organism strives to live in harmony with its environment. The theories of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements of Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal describe the relationship between the natural world and the vital life force, or Qi, that flows through it. Early practitioners understood that human beings were also subject to these laws and over time developed the rich and varied arts of Chinese Medicine and acupuncture to keep us healthy and in balance with nature. How it works Acupuncture is the insertion of extremely thin, stainless steel needles into precise points along energy pathways on the body to increase oxygenation and blood flow and stimulate a cascade of healing endorphins, hormones and other substances that harness the body's innate wisdom and amplify its capacity to heal. We look for patterns through observation and questions. Point combinations are selected based on a person's unique makeup of story, signs, symptoms, diet, biological factors, environmental influences and more. Treating the Root Acupuncture is unique in that it focuses on whole body health and treats the underlying causes of disease. Treatments are aimed at the root causes of imbalances, not just the symptoms, and often result in improvement of other seemingly unrelated issues. Other modalities we employ can include cupping, gua sha, herbs and liniments, heat applications, low lever laser light therapy (LLLT), electrostimulation, laser therapy, and diagnostic muscle response testing.

Stress, illness, and traumatic events do happen, but the support of a caring and knowledgeable practitioner can make all the difference.

Formulas range from basic energy tonics to herbs for acute illness to prescriptions to shift the internal environment such as in fertility or menopausal issues. Chinese herbs are most often prescribed in conjunction with acupuncture treatments and are safe and effective with most western medications. Herbs and Nutritional Supplements Herbal and nutritional supplements can be an essential ingredient to overall good health. While they are part of most people's daily regimen, in times of stress or illness it is difficult to determine which additional herbs, vitamins, or minerals are needed for a therapeutic change. Full Circle Healing Arts practitioners can help determine the right formulas, dosages, and diagnostic testing options for you, taking the guess work out of self-prescribing and turning these natural substances into powerful prescriptions for optimum health and healing. Many herbal formulas and supplements are available at our in house pharmacy. Please ask you practitioner about registering with our online pharmacy to purchase herbs and supplements. Skin and Beauty Care (Clem) Chinese cosmetology, the art of beauty and longevity, has been cultivated for thousands of years and now the effects can be yours through Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture, Microneedling and low level laser light therapy(LLLT). Any one of these are a fantastic alternative to surgery or injections, as they decrease the effects and appearance of aging while promoting overall health, well-being, and radiance. Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture Treatment is done as a weekly series to enhance one's overall appearance by improving muscle tone and dermal contraction, reducing fine lines, puffiness, and age spots and by increasing collagen production and hormonal balance. Problem issues such as acne, scars, rosacea, alopecia, TMJ, sinus issues and headaches can also be successfully treated with this protocol. Facial exercises and special techniques are taught to ensure a beautiful and lasting outcome. Facial Rejuvenation can last for years with proper care and occasional maintenance treatment. - A course of twelve to fourteen weekly sessions is suggested for best outcome. - Facial Rejuvenation: $190 per session or pkg of 14 sessions $2,400 - Facial Rejuvenation with LLLT light therapy: $220 per session or pkg of 14 sessions $2,700 Microneedling is a breakthrough in anti-aging technology. This service uses a dermal pen device to create thousands of tiny channels in the skin to stimulate the healing response - building collagen and elastin fibers, reducing wrinkles, sun damage and scarring and improving hyperpigmentation. - A course of six microneedling sessions scheduled once a month is suggested for best outcome. - $325 per session or pkg of 6 sessions $1,700. Package includes custom growth factor serum. Celluma Light Therapy or low level light laser therapy (LLLLT) has been shown to decrease inflammation and increase microcirculation, bringing oxygen and nutrients to the skin, increasing tissue repair, wrinkle reduction, skin tone and firmness. LLLT enhances immune and lymphatic response and stimulates the production of ATP. It has been found to increase healing 3 - 6x the normal rate and can be used on all skin related conditions including acne, scarring, rosacea, psoriasis, hair loss, post-cosmetic procedures, post-surgical procedures, wound healing and pain. - Thirty-minute sessions once or twice a week for four or five weeks are recommended. - $40 per 1/2 hour session or pkg of 10 sessions $300 Ultimate 4 Month Beauty Package: $3,100 - 10 sessions Facial Rejuvenation with LLLT light therapy - 4 microneedling sessions - Includes free dermaroller, custom facial herbal serum, and Facial Exercise book Skin Care Products We recommend Asea skin care products, available through Full Circle, which have a triple A endorsement from the independent third party, BioAgilytix Laboratories.

Energy Healing (Susan) As traditional peoples have long predicted the great societal and collective changes occurring at this time, we are challenged to respond to their calling for a more spirit-filled life. Indeed, many of us are seeking a more purpose-driven and fulfilled life, in order to create a better world for all. To do that, we know that steps large and small are needed by each of us, and that the time for these changes is now. Shamanic spiritual traditions have been practiced by traditional cultures since the dawn of humanity. This spiritual pathway considers all things sacred and filled with living energy. As a consequence, shamanic traditions challenge us to live in harmony and reciprocity with the energies within and around us. Achieving this balance is difficult, however, for so many of life's experiences - trauma, abuse, grief, illness, among others - create terrible damage emotionally and spiritually. Yet, shamanic practices can help us heal and transform ourselves from the soul level out, so that we may better walk our path with grace and gratitude. Susan invites you to consider the soul level healing that shamanic work can offer and hopes that the following information on the shamanic ceremonies and practices she offers may be useful to your understanding. Learning to Journey - Connect with your Spirit Animals and Guides Through journeying, we connect with helping spirits to access knowledge and wisdom to further our life path and realize that we are not alone. In particular, we develop a relationship with our main spirit animal, known as our power animal, who becomes our main guide to the mystical realms. Channel and Crystal Consultations Shamans are known for their \"sight\" and their ability to channel information and guidance from higher sources. Channel sessions advise and mentor spiritual growth, while the potent protective and healing energies of crystals and stones can strengthen our connection to our way forward. Extraction and Restoration Many of us experience heavy energies in our bodies which may be the result of trauma or other life experiences, such as disease or psychic attack. Shamanic practices can safely release these and reconnect the body's energetic pathways to increase the flow of the life force. Soul Retrieval Our souls are quite delicate. When trauma occurs, the shock of its impact often causes the soul to shatter. We experience this as a loss of energy, depression, and perhaps, anxiety. We know something is missing. In this powerful ceremony, the soul pieces are searched for and returned from the spirit world, restoring energetic balance. Past Life Regression In a light trance, we can experience the past life or lives that are most strongly impacting this one at this time. Guided by the shaman, we can safely explore and understand these lessons and their gifts, thereby strengthening ourselves and our relationships in this life. Ancestral Clearing We carry the hopes of our ancestors and the energetic pieces of their burdens, as well. Many of our families and our own past lives have energetic shadows. With ancestral clearing, we go back in time to meet the well ancestors who will bring forth their energy to clear the darkness and lighten our pathway. Psychopomp and Space Clearings Many of us are aware of deceased beings who have not fully transitioned, known as \"hungry ghosts\". Shamanic ceremonies can clear houses or other spaces of these disturbed intrusions and can direct these spirits clinging to the earth plane into the Light, completing their transition. Despacho Blessing Ceremonies Despachos are exquisite, spiritual offerings of gratitude from the Andean traditions that are created to mark special occasions, like weddings and celestial events, or as supplications in times of need, or simply out of gratitude. In them, we honor the spirits of our Mother the Earth, our Father the Sun, and other guides, as appropriate, in order to request their blessings for ourselves, our relationships, our homes, and our futures.

Reiki Reiki is a safe, gentle, non-invasive form of energy healing that originated in Japan in the early 20th century. The practice is based on the idea that we all have a life force energy flowing through our bodies. The Reiki practitioner uses gentle hand movements over the clients clothed body to intentionally guide the flow of healing energy to places where it is most needed, thus creating a state of relaxation and balance. Studies have shown that Reiki can have measurable benefits, helping to improve sleep, lessen pain, reduce anxiety, improve immune response, and promote natural self healing. It is often used to support the wellbeing of people who are undergoing traditional medical treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, dialysis, and surgery. Reiki sessions are deeply relaxing and can be used preventatively to reduce stress and promote wellness. Our practitioners often incorporate it into their other modalities to enhance relaxation and create a meditative state. "}
