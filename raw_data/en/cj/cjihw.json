However, significant tumor reduction is very rarely obtained, usually in less than 10% of treated patients. Therefore, these drugs may be more effective in combination with other anticancer agents, including chemotherapy, targeted therapies as well as peptide receptor radiotherapy. Sorafenib and bevacizumab combination targeted therapy in advanced neuroendocrine tumour http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24012098 Journal : European Journal of Cancer Institution(s) : Hospital Universtitario, Madrid, Spain and others Corresponding author(s) : Daniel Castellano Major f inding : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of sorafenib and bevacizumab in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors. Sorafenib and bevacizumab combination showed clinical benefit but unfavorable safety results compared with drugs in monotherapy. Further development of this combination is not warranted and a sequential approach is recommended instead. A retrospective study of capecitabine/temozolomide in metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24018594 Journal : Journal of the Pancreas Institution(s) : Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA and others Corresponding author(s) : Muhammad Wasif Saif Major finding : The authors' retrospective study showed that modified CAPTEM (capecitabine and temozolomide) regimen was well -tolerated and produced comparable response to historical data in neuroendocrine tumors, including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). Their study is unique as it only included patients with pNETs. Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the combination of CAPTEM regimen with targeted therapies in pNETs. Antiproliferative Journal de la Santa Creu y Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain and others Corresponding a uthor(s) : Marta Mart\u00edn -Richard Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 1500 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 2 00 | Manhattan Beach, CA 90266 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org Major finding : Somatostatin analogues (SSAs) are indicated to relieve carcinoid syndrome but seem to have antiproliferative effects on neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This is the first prospective study investigating tumor stab ilization with the long -acting SSA lanreotide Autogel in patients with progressive NETs. Lanreotide Autogel provided effective tumor stabilization and PFS >12 months in patients with progressive NETs ineligible for surgery or chemotherapy, with a safety pr ofile consistent with the pharmacology of the class. The use of targeted therapies in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23997829 Journal : Therapeutic Advances in Medical Oncology Institution(s) : Northern Cancer Institute, Australia and others Corresponding author(s) : Meredith Cummins Major finding : Together with the use of novel oral targeted therapies, a multidisciplinary approach can be used to effectively tr eat patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs). Here the authors review the integration of the oncology nurse to the newly developed oral treatment setting for patients with pNETs. CANCER CONTROL, SURVIVORSHIP, AND OUTCOMES RESEARCH Trends in racial disparities in pancreatic cancer surgery http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24002757 Journal : Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery Institution(s) : Columbia University Medical Cent er, New York, NY and others Corresponding author(s) : Mathias Worni Pancreatic Cancer Action Rebekah White, MD: 2007 Seena Magowitz - Career Development Award Major finding : Although racial disparities in pancreatic cancer surger y refusal have diminished over the past two decades, significant disparities in the recommendation and performance of surgery persist. It is likely that both provider - and patient -level factors have a substantial impact on surgery recommendation and its ac ceptance. The identification of such factors is critical to design a framework for eliminating disparities in cancer -directed surgery for pancreatic cancer. Race does not impact pancreatic cancer treatment, survival in equal access federal health care sy stem http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24002535 Journal : Annals of Surgical Oncology Institution(s) : University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX and others Corresponding author(s ): Sukhyung Lee Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated author : Jason Fleming, MD: member, Medical Advisory Board Major finding : The authors observed no disparities in either management or survival between white and black patients with pancreatic duct al adenocarcinoma (PDAC) treated in the Department of Defense's equal access health care system. These data suggest that improving the access of minorities with PDAC to health care may reduce disparities in their oncologic outcomes. Marital status and su rvival in patients with cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24062405 Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 1500 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 2 00 | Manhattan Beach, CA 90266 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org Journal : Journal of Clinical Oncology Institution(s) : Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA and others Corresponding autho r(s): Paul Nguyen Major finding : Even after adjusting for known confounders, unmarried patients are at significantly higher risk of presentation with metastatic cancer, undertreatment, and death resulting from their cancer. This study highlights the potent ially significant impact that social support can have on cancer detection, treatment, and survival. Comparative study of 2 protocols for management of severe pain in unresectable pancreatic cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23917696 Journal : The Clinical Journal of Pain Institution(s) : Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt Corresponding author(s) : Mohamed Makharita Major finding : Controlling severe pain with medication and then performing the celiac block seems to be more effective in controlling pain, reducing opioid consumption, and improving the quality of life of patients with pancreatic cancer compared with performing the celiac block at the beginning followed by pharmacotherapy for pain r elief. Exercise as medicine in the management of pancreatic cancer: A case study http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24042308 Journal : Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise Institution(s) : Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, Australia and others Corresponding author(s) : Daniel Galv\u00e3o Major finding : In this first reported clinical case, exercise led to improvements in a variety of patient outcomes during adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer. This initial evidence has important clinical implications, indicating that exercise may be an effective adjunct therapy for the management of pancreatic cancer. Future trials are needed to confirm and expand the authors' initial findings.
