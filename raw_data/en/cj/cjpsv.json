It's one of my favorite times of the year! With fall comes....I'm going to say it\u2014Breast Cancer Awareness Month! As a reminder, and just coming off the heels of my own breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, I want to stress to all women\u2014mothers, daughters, grandmothers, aunts and sisters\u2014get your mammogram! It's one of the easiest ways to prevent and detect breast cancer. The flood of pink is everywhere, but it's more than a pretty color. Pink is a reminder that breast cancer strikes 813 women every day. That's unacceptable! Please take care of your breasts. I also want to remind you that the third annual art show submission deadline is October 21. Time is ticking away to be part of this very special survivor artist showcase. You can find more information on page 2. To view the 2014 show, visit our website gallery. Vaccines are very important to your overall health. All adults, regardless of age, need vaccines. Over the past year the CDC has made new recommendations and updates to many common vaccinations. On page 6, read the recommendations by our new physician Akeria Johnson. High blood pressure is a serious health concern, especially for women. Did you know that new recommendations suggest that we should keep our systolic number at 120 instead of 140? Find out on page 4 why researchers say the drop can make a big difference in your health. And if you or a woman you know experiences bladder leakage and pelvic pain, please read the article on page 2 by Stacey Clarke, DPT, WCS. It covers the benefits of pelvic floor therapy and how our program can help stop bladder leakage and relieve pain. Before the year winds down please make your health a priority, schedule any physical, annual screenings, vaccinations and your mammogram. Schedule your mammogram screening at one of our convenient UC Health Breast Imaging Center locations (513) 584-PINK (7465). OCTOBER 2015A Journey of Courage and Healing Annual Art Consignment Show Contributed by Melissa Mitchell, Juried Art Show Curator Art is known to have a positive impact on the mind, body and soul and can often help reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain - all which are common mental and physical symptoms a cancer survivor experiences. For centuries, art has been known to be a healing force that can help improve various mental and physical symptoms anyone can experience, especially a cancer survivor. A piece of art can reduce pain, anxiety, tension, and depression. As the curator for the third annual Women's Center art show, we're calling upon artists to submit their works for consideration as part of a year-long consignment opportunity. Using art as a therapy method has proven to be effective in cancer treatment as it helps manage the emotional and psychological side effects that often result from cancer diagnosis and treatment. Local artist and a 2014 Juried Art Show participant, Cedric Cox, loves having his art used for peace and tranquility. \"Art is communication and my paintings and drawings are intended to build bridges between the past, present and future,\" says Cox. Like Cedric, your art can be featured at the third Annual Juried Art Show; Survivor: A Journey of Courage and Healing. Art should represent cancer survivorship, strength, resilience, fearlessness, bravery, and conquering the climb to recovery. All mediums are being accepted for consideration, as long as they are wall art or larger free standing sculptures. Large hanging wall pieces are encouraged. Please no nudity or political statements.Up to three pieces may be submitted online through October 21, 2015. Artists will receive notice of acceptance on October 29, 2015.

It is commonly thought that this pain and incontinence are part of the natural aging process and body wear-and-tear, but that is not the case. Up to 57 percent of women ages 40 to 60 experience UI symptoms while 75 percent of women experience symptoms beginning at age 75. Pelvic pain is common at all ages and can present itself as pain with intercourse, pain with bowel movements, pain in the lower abdomen and groin, or vaginal or rectal pain with various activities. Regardless of what triggers the pain and UI, you don't have to suffer alone. As a Pelvic Health physical therapist and board certified Women's Health clinical specialist, I help women who experience UI and other pelvic health related conditions. We teach women exercises beyond the traditional Kegel that will help train their pelvic floor muscles and bladder to stop the bladder leakage and help relieve pain. The American College of Physicians (ACP) highly recommends women with stress UI focus on pelvic floor muscle training which consists of learning to properly perform a Kegel and to fully relax the pelvic floor. Being able to fully contract and fully relax the pelvic floor is essential in preventing urine or fecal leakage and pelvic pain. Pelvic floor physical therapy has been shown to be the best first line treatment for UI and yields greater reduction in UI than performing Kegels independently without guidance of a pelvic floor physical therapist. Your doctor, whether a urologist or primary care provider, will help determine the best treatment course which may include physical therapy with a pelvic health physical therapist. To begin receiving relief, talk to your doctor about pelvic floor physical therapy. The sooner treatment is underway, the sooner you regain control of your life.

And sadly, SIDS is the leading cause of death among infants between one month and one year of age. We can do something about this! Although health care providers and researchers don't know the exact causes of SIDS and other sleep-related sudden unexpected infant deaths, what we do know are methods to help reduce the risk. Here are a few easy steps to help reduce the risk of SIDS: Always place babies on their backs to sleep for every sleep. Use a firm sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety- approved crib, covered by a fitted sheet. Have the baby share your room, not your bed. A baby should not sleep in an adult bed, on a couch, or on a chair alone, with you, or with anyone else. Keep soft objects such as pillows, toys, crib bumpers and loose bedding out of your baby's sleep area. Prevent exposure to smoking during pregnancy and after birth because these are important risk factors for SIDS. The risk of SIDS is even stronger when a baby shares a bed with a smoker. Although the SIDS rate for African Americans has declined by 50 percent since 1994, today's African American infants are twice as likely as Caucasian infants to die of SIDS. Similarly, American Indian/Alaska Native infants today are three times as likely as Caucasian infants to die of SIDS, even though SIDS rates have also dropped significantly in this population during the last two decades. Locally in Hamilton County, too many babies die before their first birthday. The county is ranked among the bottom 10 percent of counties across the nation for infant mortality. Experts say we must invest in changing three things about our community\u2014the three S's: smoking, spacing, and sleep. To help prevent prematurity one should increase the amount of time between pregnancies, reduce tobacco use in pregnancy, and promote safe sleep for babies. To increase awareness of SIDS, Cradle Cincinnati, in partnership with Charlie's Kids and UC Health, is asking everyone to post a picture of an infant sleeping safely (following the ABC's of safe sleep) with #IAmSafeSleep during the month of October, which is Safe Sleep Awareness Month. Please visit cradlecincinnati.org to learn more. For all you soon-to-be moms, remember there are things you can do now to increase your chances of a healthy baby. Remember to schedule and go to all prenatal visits, do not smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs while pregnant or after birth and stay away from smokers and places where people smoke. page 4 UC Health Women's Center Most people with high blood pressure have no signs or symptoms, even if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels. As of 2013, approximately 30 percent of Americans over age 20 and over 50 percent of those ages 55 and older have elevated blood pressure (hypertension). While not a disease in and of itself, high blood pressure is strongly associated with conditions affecting the heart and vascular system. Research suggests that women with high blood pressure are at higher risk than their male counterparts, prompting researchers to recommend different treatments in women. In an on-going study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NHLBI) researchers found that lowering blood pressure - with a targeted systolic number of 120 instead of 140 - can significantly reduce the rates of cardiovascular disease. The study also found that lowering the systolic number to 120 can cut cardiovascular disease related deaths by 25 percent in adults 50 years and older who have high blood pressure. High blood pressure makes a person four times more likely to die from a stroke and three times more likely to die from heart disease. Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women, killing more women than all forms of cancer combined, and more women than men. Women have a greater risk of developing high blood pressure especially if you're overweight, have a family history of high blood pressure, or have reached menopause. Lifestyle choices are crucial to keep blood pressure at 120 or below. Below are my recommendations for maintaining a healthy blood pressure: If you're concerned about your blood pressure or other heart related conditions, give us a call. Our expert cardiologists conduct complete health assessments and review medical history to determine heart disease risk factors and how to reduce them. Shifting the Blood Pressure Danger Zone Contributed by Umara Raza, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine Check your blood pressure regularly Quit smoking Get six to eight hours of sleep each day Maintain total cholesterol level of less than 200 Eat a healthy diet with more fruits, vegetables, potassium and whole grains Limit alcohol to 1 drink per day for women and 2 drinks per day for men Exercise and maintain a healthy weight - Aim for 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every weekUCHealth.com/women page 5 Get to know Does not prefer the spotlight.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently changed the adult vaccine recommendations. So even if you think you've been keeping up with your vaccines that may not be the case. Pneumonia - nearly one million people contract this each year. Since its development in the early 1980s there are now two different types of pneumococcal vaccine. Pneumovax protects adults against 23 strains of Streptococcus pneumonia bacteria. The other, Prevnar 13, which is routinely given to infants and toddlers, was approved by the FDA in 2011 for use in adults ages 50 and older. Who needs it: Adults ages 65 and older need both vaccines. Those younger than 65 but have other risk factors - smoker, asthmatic or diabetic - should be vaccinated as well. Some may need more than one dose of both vaccines during their lifetime. Meningitis - a serious, potentially life-threatening inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Although it's not as contagious as other illnesses, such as a cold or the flu, it's easily spread by coughing, kissing, or sneezing. Good news is that it's preventable with a vaccine. Just this year, two serogroup B vaccines that protect against two forms of the disease were given FDA approval. Who needs it: Both vaccines have proven effective in protecting those ages 10-25, but have also been found to be useful for older adults. This vaccine is given routinely. Influenza (Flu) - a common, very contagious viral infection that can be deadly, especially in high-risk groups (children younger than 5, adults 65 years and older, pregnant women, and those with certain medical conditions). The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year. Who needs it: Everyone 6 months of age and older unless you have had a severe reaction to the flu shot in the past, allergic to eggs, or have or had Guillain-Barre syndrome. Flu shots are offered at most primary care offices and pharmacies September until March. Some businesses also offer the vaccine on site to their employees. Td (tetanus, diphtheria) and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) vaccines - if you've never received a Tdap vaccine, you should be vaccinated once, even if you are over age 65. A Td booster is needed every 10 years. Who needs it: Everyone, especially those in close contact with infants younger than 12 months of age. Hepatitis B vaccine - Hepatitis A and B are two members of a family of closely related diseases caused by a viral infection. Although different, the diseases are similar. Hepatitis is marked by liver inflammation, and it can be serious or even life-threatening. Who needs it: Children ages 12 to 23 months, adults 50 and older, and those at risk should receive all three vaccine doses at different times. The following people are considered at risk: Anyone who has sex with someone that has hepatitis B Anyone being evaluated or treated for an STD People who share needles used to inject drugs Anyone whose job routinely puts them at risk for coming in contact with blood or blood-contaminated body fluids Human papillomavirus (HPV) - Gardisil 9, a new HPV vaccine, protects against nine strains of the HPV virus that cause genital warts and seven common strains that can cause cancer. Who needs it: All boys and girls age 9 years and older should get vaccinated with the 3-dose series. Catch-up vaccines are recommended for males through age 21 and for females through age 26, if they did not get vaccinated when they were younger. Over and over we're finding that it's healthier, less expensive, and far less painful to prevent many diseases rather than treat them once they appear. These vaccine findings hold much promise for enlarging the group of conditions we can guard against, before they become potentially deadly. Please discuss your options with your health care provider. Chronic pain, every day ailments, stress, anxiety, and obesity affect millions of people. These conditions can cause physical or emotional symptoms. But did you know that a simple complementary treatment can help alleviate some of these concerns? Auricular (ear) acupuncture is a specialized complementary therapy that enables the body to restore its natural energy balance and improve overall health. Using small needles a specialist inserts the needles in specific points on the inner and outer ear lobe which are kept in place for 45 minutes. The protocol was originally developed to reduce symptoms of patterned behavior, addictions, cravings and substance use withdrawal management. Auricular therapy is based on the same ancient traditional Chinese medicine as acupuncture. It's been helpful in efforts to curb pesky food and nicotine cravings. Specific areas on the ears match, or target, different places in the body. When stimulation is applied the brain is sent signals. Once this occurs, patients experience a deep inner calmness, reduced anxiety, better sleep, and improvements in physical and emotional health. For those who suffer from chronic pain, tension, stress, anxiety, depression, obesity or want to stop smoking talk to one of the Integrative Medicine specialists.
