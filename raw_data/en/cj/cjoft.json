AuburnHospital(2015) I createdanEMR modification that has improved practice in three clinical areas (documenting patient allergies; confirming follow up on abnormal pap smears; scheduling childhood immunizations). These outcomes were reported at the American Family Practice Society meeting and I have been invited to discuss this system with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. Creation of Multidisciplinary Breast Center at Mass General (1999-2003)I co-established thefirst multidisciplinary disease center in the MGH Cancer Center. I reorganized the practice to include surgeons, radiation oncologists and medical oncologists in a single clinic for coordinated visits for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and for clinical trials, teaching and research activities. This model has since been replicated at two other NewEngland area hospitals. Clinical development of telotristatfor carcinoid syndrome (2017-)Iconceived and led the first clinical study of telotristat, a novel serotonin inhibitor, in patients with carcinoid syndrome. Based on the encouraging initial results, I led an international, placebo-controlled registration study which confirmed the activity (published in JCI, see ref 69). FDA review of telotristatfor the treatment of carcinoid is pending for 2020.

This program increased the participation of off-site fellows in group discussions by 5-fold over previous programs. Results of subsequent surveys indicated that 95% of fellows rated the conference series as \"Excellent\". The format of the program has since been adopted by two other divisions within the department. Performance: The Z Score system (2001-2005)Ico-designed a novel resident performance rating system, known as Z Score. Quarterly clinical performance reports are created for each resident and are used to identify performance issues which then result in faculty supervised plans for improvement. Reports contain Z scores, Competency flag density, written comments, statistical assessment of performance as compared to peers, and faculty confidence in allowing a resident to act in an unsupervised fashion. This assessment has been published in Academic Medicine (see Ref.13) and has been adopted at five institutions in the New England area. Examples of Teaching Innovations 57\u00a9 2020 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College Technological and Scientific Innovations 58\u00a9 2020 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College Examples of Technological and Scientific Innovations Method for reducing the scantime of phase contrast MRIUS Patent Serial Number:14/501,936; filed 9/30/2014Jointlydeveloped with C. Radcliffe, H. Erwin and Q. Fong. This method reduces scan time, eddy currents and image factors in dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging associated with at least a portion of k-space. The method includes scanning with an Echo-Planar Imaging (EPI) pulse sequence technique, allowing for enhanced reconstructionof three-dimensional images with reduced image acquisition time.
