Referred to Committee on Health & Long- Term Care. 1 AN ACT Relating to access to complementary and alternative health 2care practitioners; adding a new chapter to Title 18 RCW; providing an 3effective date; and declaring an emergency. 4BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON: 5 NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. This act may be known and cited as the 6access to alternative medicine act. 7 NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. (1) The legislature finds that, based upon 8a comprehensive report by the national institute of health, a study 9published by the New England Journal of Medicine, and other research 10data, hundreds of thousands of individuals in this state are presently 11receiving a substantial amount of health care from providers of health 12care services who are not licensed, registered, or certified by this 13state. Those studies further indicate that individuals from a wide 14variety of age, ethnic, socioeconomic, and other demographic categories 15utilize these health care services, often times referred to as 16complementary and alternative health care practices or natural healing 17therapies and modalities. p. 1 SB 6886 1 (2) The legislature, in RCW 18.120.010, stated its intent that all 2individuals should be permitted to enter into a health profession 3unless there is an overwhelming need for the state to protect the 4interests of the public by restricting entry into the profession and, 5where such a need is identified, the regulation adopted by the state 6should be set at the least restrictive level consistent with the public 7interest to be protected. This continues to be the intent of the 8legislature. However, notwithstanding this intent, health care service 9practitioners who are not licensed, certified, or registered by the 10state may be alleged to be in technical violation of the professional 11practice laws governing such health care practitioners. As a result, 12a practitioner of the healing arts who is not licensed, certified, or 13registered by this state as a member of a health profession as defined 14in RCW 18.120.020(4) could currently be subject to investigations, 15disciplinary actions, fines, penalties, the restriction of practice, or 16the issuance of a cease and desist order although the practice does not 17cross the threshold of state regulatory concern for the public as set 18out in chapter 18.120 RCW. 19 (3) It is the intent of the legislature to provide individuals a 20right to access every type of health care service provided by health 21care practitioners who are not licensed, certified, or registered by 22the state for any individual seeking such services. Unrestricted 23access to health care services, of necessity, means that the health 24care service practitioners who are not licensed, certified, or 25registered by the state must be able to provide the services that 26individuals seek without risking civil or criminal investigations or 27sanctions sought by the state, its agencies, boards, or commissions. 28 (4) It is the intent of the legislature to allow health care 29practitioners who are not licensed, certified, or registered by the 30state, to provide any health care services sought by individuals, 31unless there exists clear and convincing evidence that the specific 32health care service causes serious physical or mental harm or causes 33imminent and significant risk of discernable, significant, and serious 34physical or mental injury, under the circumstances in which the health 35care practitioner knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should 36have known, would result in such injury. 37 (5) It is recognized that this chapter may authorize conduct by 38health care practitioners who are not licensed, certified, or SB 6886 p. 2 1registered by the state, which may be interpreted by the department of 2health or regulatory boards or commissions as overlapping with the 3statutory definition of the unlicensed practice of a health profession 4in RCW 18.120.020(4). It is the intent of this chapter to provide 5those practicing under this chapter safe harbor from violations of 6other provisions in this title. 7 (6) Because the legislature finds that health care services 8provided by practitioners who are not regulated by the state are widely 9used and desirable under certain circumstances, and in order to 10maximize and protect consumer options in health care, the legislature 11intends to remove current barriers to the public's access to such 12practitioners providing health care services with appropriate consumer 13protections, as provided in this chapter. 14 NEW SECTION. Sec. 3. The definitions in this section apply 15throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise. 16 (1) \"Health care services\" means health care and healing therapies 17and methods that are not prohibited by section 4 of this act and that 18are provided by a person who is not licensed, certified, or registered 19as a health care practitioner by this state. \"Health care services\" 20include, but are not limited to, the use of: 21 (a) Natural elements such as air, heat, water, and light; 22 (b) Class I or class II medical devices approved by the federal 23food and drug administration for approved treatments as well as for 24off-label use; 25 (c) Other medical devices, tools, or procedures that may be 26nontraditional, unique, or experimental; 27 (d) Vitamins, minerals, herbs, natural food products and their 28extracts, and nutritional supplements; 29 (e) Dietary supplements as defined by the federal dietary 30supplement and health education act of 1994; 31 (f) Homeopathic remedies; 32 (g) Detoxification practices, including but not limited to sauna, 33foot baths, baths including the addition of herbs or other substances, 34colon hydrotherapy, and oxidative therapies; and 35 (h) Traditional cultural health care practices. 36 (2) \"Diagnosis\" means an intentional statement that someone has a 37specific medical condition reflected in the ICD-10 coding scheme or set p. 3 SB 6886 1out in an authoritative textbook relied upon by licensed practitioners 2of a specific regulated health care discipline. If a health care 3practitioner uses medical terminology or common words to advise a 4client to see a licensed, certified, or registered health care 5practitioner in order to rule out a diagnosable condition, it is not a 6diagnosis. A statement by a health care practitioner who is not 7licensed, certified, or registered that symptoms may be indicative of 8or consistent with a specific medical condition, or that they have some 9probability significantly less than one hundred percent of having a 10specific medical condition, is not a diagnosis. 11 NEW SECTION. Sec. 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 12a person who provides health care services in accordance with this 13chapter, but who is not licensed, certified, or registered by this 14state as a health care professional or practitioner, shall not be in 15violation of a law based on the unlicensed practice of a health 16profession as defined in RCW 18.120.020(4) unless the person: 17 (1) Performs surgery or any other procedure that harmfully severs 18or penetrates the tissue of the body, except for finger pricking for 19screening purposes. Penetration of natural body cavities or orifices 20is not penetration of tissues; 21 (2) Prescribes or administers X-ray radiation or any other form of 22ionizing radiation to any person; 23 (3) Prescribes or dispenses corrective vision lenses or prescribes 24or administers vision therapy; 25 (4) Prescribes or administers a legend drug or controlled substance 26that state or federal law requires be prescribed or dispensed to the 27end user exclusively by a licensed, certified, or registered health 28care practitioner; 29 (5) Performs a chiropractic adjustment of the articulations of 30joints or the spine; 31 (6) Provides deep stroking of the muscle tissue of the human body, 32or represents that a practice is massage therapy; 33 (7) Sets fractures; 34 (8) Performs a health care service that is specifically described 35as the exclusive purview of the licensed practitioner in the individual 36practice acts of health professions as defined in RCW 18.120.020(4) and 37is included in the curriculum of the profession's required educational SB 6886 p. 4 1programs, and is routinely practiced by members of that profession, 2provided that it does not fall under any exception in this chapter and 3is not routinely performed by laymen as self-directed care in private 4life; 5 (9) Intentionally diagnoses and treats a physical or mental 6condition of any person that causes an individual serious physical or 7mental harm or causes imminent and significant risk of discernable and 8significant physical or mental injury, under the circumstances in which 9the health care practitioner knew, or in the exercise of reasonable 10care should have known, would result in such injury. The potential for 11such injury must be easily recognizable and not remote or dependent 12upon tenuous argument and must be proven by clear and convincing 13evidence. Delay of conventional allopathic treatments alone cannot be 14determined to be, or potentially to be, serious physical or mental 15harm; or 16 (10) Holds out, states, indicates, advertises, or implies to any 17person that he or she is a licensed, certified, or registered health 18care practitioner under the laws of the state. 19 NEW SECTION. Sec. 5. Any person providing health care services 20who is not licensed, certified, or registered by this state and who is 21advertising or charging a fee for health care services, shall, prior to 22providing such services, disclose to the individual, in a plainly 23worded written statement that the practitioner is not a state licensed, 24certified, or registered practitioner. The practitioner must also 25obtain informed consent prior to providing services, as that term has 26been construed by common law. 27 NEW SECTION. Sec. 6. (1)(a) The legislature finds that the 28practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the 29public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection 30act, chapter 19.86 RCW. A violation of this chapter is not reasonable 31in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an 32unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of 33competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, 34chapter 19.86 RCW. 35 (b) The attorney general may bring an action to obtain a cease and 36desist order against a practitioner for a violation. In any proceeding p. 5 SB 6886 1under this chapter, the attorney general bears the burden of proof and 2must meet that burden with clear and convincing evidence. However, 3before enforcement proceedings may commence, good faith mediation must 4be utilized by the state in an attempt to bring a practitioner into 5voluntary compliance with this section. 6 (2) Notwithstanding state laws that define the unlicensed practice 7of a health profession as defined in RCW 18.120.020(4), any alternative 8or complementary health care services that are not customarily within 9the practice of health professions as defined in RCW 18.120.020(4) or 10not included in the curriculum of the required education for those 11professions, is outside the scope of the profession and, therefore, 12outside the scope and jurisdiction of the professional quality 13assurance commissions or regulatory boards. 14 NEW SECTION. Sec. 7. Any pending investigations or disciplinary 15actions that could not be brought under the provisions of this chapter 16shall be dismissed within thirty days of the effective date of this 17act. Any disciplinary sanctions that have been imposed in pending or 18final actions that could not be brought under the provisions of this 19chapter, are revoked and must be expunged within sixty days of the 20effective date of this act without application by the health care 21practitioner. All fines or costs collected shall be refunded. 22 NEW SECTION. Sec. 8. This act does not prevent any health care 23professional who is licensed, certified, or registered by this state, 24from providing health care services under this chapter. The scope of 25licensure of all licensed practitioners includes anything an unlicensed 26person can do. 27 NEW SECTION. Sec. 9. Sections 1 through 8 of this act constitute 28a new chapter in Title 18 RCW. 29 NEW SECTION. Sec. 10. This act is necessary for the immediate 30preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the 31state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect 32May 1, 2008. --- END --- SB 6886 p. 6 "}
