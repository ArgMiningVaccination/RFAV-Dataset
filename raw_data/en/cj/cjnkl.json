Best Turkey Day to all!-- the water tower Edsnews ticker: India pays people to be sterilized, botches surgery, human misery ensues +++ I weep in front of my computer screen +++ What if the news were more like G-Unit? g Americans eat a lot of meat. An ex- cessively large amount of meat. In 2013, the United States consumed 25.5 billion pounds of beef. The only way to meet the demand for this kind of consumption is raising ani-mals on factory farms, which can hardly be considered farms at all. Factory farms are highly industrialized institutions that mass-produce over 99% of America's farmed animal products. The result of raising so many animals in such a small space? Horrible, overcrowded, disease-ridden conditions. To ensure animal growth and survival in such disgusting squalor, animals are fed small doses of antibiotics on a daily basis. When animals receive antibiotics this fre-quently, they develop antibiotic-resistant bacterial responses to these drugs. This means that when humans are exposed to this antibiotic-resistant bacteria, we can contract it, with devastating effects. When people develop illnesses from bacteria immune to most antibiotics, we can no longer use traditional methods and go-to medications to fight these illnesses. These bacteria can and do easily spread from the farm to the plate, and there is a dangerously high possibility that one of these bacteria strains could then spread by human-to-human contact and grow into an epidemic. Vegetarianism is an alternative that many people have turned to as a healthi-er option, but it doesn't fix the root of the problem. A vegetarian lifestyle is unrealis-tic to apply to all of society, doesn't address the use of antibiotics on factory farms, and although vegetarians don't consume meat, they're still at risk of contracting antibiot-ic-resistant diseases: Manure from animals with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is often used for edible crops and can contami-nate them. It's a vicious cycle that exists on almost all of our farms in the United States. It takes bil- lions of dollars and many years to develop anti-biotics, whereas resistant bacteria can mutate and change within minutes. And when we've made factory farms a training camp for resilient bacteria, how can medicine ever win? The only way to fix this problem is to stop the overuse of antibiotics on factory farms. Changes in the medical field aren't the issue. Agricul-ture is where the problem lies, and agricul-ture practices need to be fixed. The harmful effects of industrial overuse of antibiot-ics have been known since the 1970s, yet nothing has been done in our government to abolish this terrible practice. Thus far, our government has not passed any federal legislation to create last-ing and needed changes to correct this evil, but there are many things that we can do as consumers! Buying and eating local and organic food is our best option. There are also organizations and movements devoted to fighting for this cause, but we need all the help we can get. Make smart choices, use your voice, and fight back against anti-biotics on factory farms! gby carastapleford On Tuesday, November 4th, voters in the District of Columbia opted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, along with Oregon, Alaska, and the U.S. territory of Guam. Initiative 71, the bill that would allow the possession of up to two ounces of marijuana and six plants in a private resi-dence, passed with 65% of the vote, with al-most 21,000 D.C. residents supporting the measure. Howev - er, support - ers of the new legislature should hold their excite-ment\u2014the battle has not yet been won. What with the Repub - lican domination that took place this past Election Day, there have been concerns about the bill's future. Because D.C. is technically a district and not a state (for now...but that's another issue), Congress must approve measures such as these for the nation's capital. Rep-resentative Andy Harris (R-MD) vowed to fight the passage of the bill in Congress, and the newly-Republican Congress may nix the bill, which probably won't be sub-mitted to the legislature until the next ses-sion of Congress. Many Congresswomen and men feel caught between a rock and a hard place: they don't want to go on record as support-ing marijuana but also want to respect the popular vote, which supported the legaliza-tion of cannabis by a large margin. In Mary-land, a state that both borders the nation's capital and prohibits recreational marijua-na use, legislators feel anxious about hav-ing a pot-friendly district as a neighbor. What would happen, for instance, if police stopped someone at the border carrying legally-purchased marijuana from the na- tion's capital into the Old Line State? However, pro-legalization supporters in Maryland feel that a D.C. where pot is legal will dem-onstrate the positive effects of legalization in an area that is more close to home, and thus harder to ignore, than Colorado or Alaska. For supporters of legalization at the federal level, the battle is far from over, but perhaps legalizing cannabis in the nation's capital, an area that arguably gets more me-dia recognition than anywhere else in the country, could prove that legalization is a positive and logical step that could benefit the country financially, regardless of the acerbic debates over health issues. Should Congress favor the passage of Initiative 71, D.C. will be forced to prove to the rest of the country the economic benefits of le-galization and that its citizens can handle it responsibly. All eyes will be on them. gby zacharynabors \"to ensure animal growth and survival in disgusting squalor, animals are fed small doses of antibiotics on a daily basis.\"\"d.c. will be forced to prove to the rest of the country the economic benefits of legal- ization and that its citizens can handle it responsibly.\" Y ou should have heard by now, but if you haven't, it's not your fault. On September 26th, 43 students at a teaching college in Mexico's southern Guerrero state boarded a bus to the state capital Iguala, where they planned to join a remembrance demonstration for the 1968 Tlatelolco Massacre of student protesters in Mexico City. The gathering was to be nonviolent yet critical towards the Mexican government and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Many Mexicans feel their government has failed to invest in the country's youth and, in an attempt to shift national and global focus towards their economy, has al-most completely ignored the violent insur - gency of drug cartels that has grown worse and worse over the past decade. These 43 students, from a university well known for Marxism and social protest, were ready to be heard. The city of Iguala's First Lady, Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Pineda, planned to speak at the event, and expected it to go smoothly. Ms. de los \u00c1ngeles is a connected woman, as many Mexican public officials are, and not just through her mayoral husband. He was good for getting the police involved, but her brother, a senior member of the Guer - reros Unidos gang, would do the heavy lift-ing. Unaware of what was in store, the bus of students sped on. Their journey would be cut short. Ar - riving in Iguala, they were immediately confronted by police. A few students were beaten, and all 43 were arrested and driven out of town, where they were handed over to the Guerreros Unidos. At home, mothers wrung their hands. One day later, three days, a week, and still no word from their children. And it took about that long for the national govern-ment to step in and begin an investigation. Federal police began scouring the re- gion for any trace of 43 young adults who had essentially disappeared. Meanwhile, the mayor and his wife fled. Officials soon discovered a mass grave; bones and body parts of over 20 people in a tangled pit. But these turned out to be vic-tims of some other massa - cre. They kept looking. Friends and family of the 43 missing marched in Mexico City, demanding an-swers, which even the President's personal condolences and promises to each family could not fulfill. All grieved. Some rioted, lighting a fire at the National Palace. Officials eventually found not a grave, but a dump. The students had been inciner - ated; it was difficult to determine whether dead or alive. The scorched ash was only identifiable by the few remaining teeth strewn about. Over the decades, many Mexicans have grown thick skin for this breed of hei-nous crime and are rarely shocked to find the government has a hand in it. They call it the narco-state for a reason. But they also admit that this recent massacre has struck a nerve in the country, perhaps because the victims were education students, perhaps due to the scale of the killing or the bla-tant gang-government ties. People are hurt, and their anger isn't subsiding any time soon. So why is it not your fault if you're just now learning about this? Because the American mass media (which is to say, American government and corporate in-terests) doesn't care about Mexicans until they show up at our borders. Our media has systematically exclud- ed Mexican and Latin American affairs because they are something the U.S. could be involved in but chooses to ignore. Bet-ter to talk about Syria, Somalia, Ukraine, these unstable states that we're working to secure; they're far away, but we promise we have the situation under control. Parts of Mexico bear all the signs of a failed state and could become a journalis-tic firestorm. But America's stake in Mexi-can violence\u2014and its lack of effort to quell it\u2014give the government every reason place some calls, kill some stories, and turn our heads to the east. But if Mexico keeps bubbling, we may find ourselves facing south anyway. gby kerrymartin I couldn't tell you the number of times I've heard some- thing along the lines of \"The party scene's been beat recently, I can't wait till we can just rage at the bars!\" on any given weekend at UVM. Many of my fellow under 21-year-olds at this university place the bars on a pedestal high above house parties because they just assume these places have an \"it\" factor. They're just not entirely sure what \"it\" is. The way these people glorify \"the bars, \" it's as if they are clubs where hip-hop music videos could be filmed, complete with supermodels, light shows, and a mas-sive dance floor. Obviously, this is an exaggeration. However, it is true that many of us underage drinkers do have a strong sense of false hope in the potential of the bars. In my opinion, the reason that many underage drinkers at UVM hold this notion of optimism is that they simply can't accept the fact that maybe house parties are just as good of a time as they'll have when going out on the town in Burlington. In other words, many of us ask ourselves after a disappoint-ing night of searching for parties, \"There has to be something more...right?\" The grass isn't always greener on the other side, unless, of course, \"greener\" implies spending at least two to three times as much money on alcohol on any given night. The bars run your pockets dry faster than the goddamn dry cleaners. Personally, I don't understand how a fairly large propor - tion of legal drinkers exclusively drink at the bars on Friday and Saturday nights. Splitting the cost of an 18-dollar thirty from Price Chopper with my roommate takes a big enough toll on my wallet. Y ou could get four, maybe five drinks at Red Square for the same price. What, does every beer come with a fucking baby golden retriever? (Alright, now that would just be awesome. But dangerous.) Anyway, you get the idea. On top of the fact that drinks cost an arm and a leg at pretty much any bar you go to, the social setting within these establishments is comparable to that of most house parties. There's a dance floor infested with sexually-frustrated horndogs, a select group of people significantly more sober than everyone else, and someone still has to bear the responsibility of initiating awkward small talk if he/she has any shot at getting lucky. And no, there's no escaping the sight of that guy walking away from the dance floor while trying to conceal his erection in such a way that he won't have to overtly stick his hand down his pants. I personally witnessed all of this at What Ales Y ou last weekend. I don't have a fake ID, but I successfully pulled off the fabled \"pass-back\" move with one of my 21-year-old friends with whom I share comparable facial features. It was the first time I had ever actually spent a whole night at the bars, and it was also the first time I spent over $50 on booze in one night. I should probably mention the fact that over half of that money was spent buying drinks for some flirty girl who ended up telling me she had a boyfriend after about an hour. It was like an ill-fated hookup, but even more depressing. I wanted the night to be special, but it just didn't work out like I thought it would. The reality is that the bars aren't necessarily \"better\" than house parties. They're simply a new environment for college kids to get drunk in. There's a reason that many 21-year-olds count on going to the bars merely as a backup if plans for going to a party fall through. If anything, partying at the same bar night after night is more monotonous than the hunt for parties underage drinkers embark on every Friday and Saturday night. Y ou can get a drink with your buddies no matter what setting you're in, and trust me: cracking open warm Busch's from a thirty will always be bet- ter than buying $8 appletinis. gby keithstone Take a drink when: Any member of the gang is drinking Charlie, Mac, and Dennis come up with a terrible idea Frank outsmarts any member of the gang Dee is compared to a bird Dennis talks about being a ladies' man Mac does or says anything homoerotic Charlie's illiteracy is brought up Mac uses the word \"jabroni\" Charlie talks about rats or spiders Someone sniffs glue, gasoline, or any like substance Any member of the gang talks about Charlie and Frank's sleeping ar - rangement Anytime they call Dee \"Sweet Dee\" Dee calls someone a \"boner\" Someone says \"goddammit!\" Someone refers to something as \"badass\" Someone says \"hey-oh!\" Frank refers to someone as a \"whore\" Finish your drink when: Any member of the gang does something overtly racist Charlie creates an original song Frank pulls out a gun, or any member of the gang pulls out a weapon Frank uses a knife to cut his toenails They run into the McPoyles The gang ruins someone's life gSeason nine of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is now on Netflix, and the gang is back at it.

Whether you're all caught up or just getting started, these rules work for any season (and just about every episode) of the show.it's always sunny in happy hour On a Sunday evening at 5:37pm, a college boy struts into Brennan's to the song \"Back in Black\" by AC/DC, ignoring the cashiers and cutting through the order line. This seemingly mischievous character makes a beeline to the trusty popcorn machine. His eyes cautiously scan the room, looking for someone to stop him in his tracks as he opens the precious chest of limitless popcorn, and then begins to fill his small paper bag to the brim. He quietly lays the scooper back in its place, as if no one was there, and blasts out of the restaurant without paying a single dime. The popcorn machine in Brennan's is notorious for being one of the well-known UVM \"freebies\" on campus. But this free factor is unsettling for some, creating some-what of a social stigma surrounding the machine. I set out undercover and observed these bizarre interactions of people in Brennan's who snatched some popcorn. I should say now that no one successfully retrieved the popcorn in a natural manner. Y ou can't do it and I don't care how comfortable you think you are with yourself. Here are some of my observations: 10:57 a.m. Brennan's has yet to even have their background restaurant tunes on and, lo and behold, I saw an old man in a suit with elbow pads munching on popcorn in a homey couch. Isn't it too early for this? Brennan's has yet to take an official order, but the pop-corn machine is already receiving some love. Is this his breakfast? Not to pigeonhole this man, but because of his older years you' d think he would have consumed a proper breakfast, as opposed to the college kids, who almost always ditch this meal. He looked uncomfortable, almost guilty, his shoulders crunched and locked up to his ears and his legs curled up on his seat. I was shocked that someone would be eating popcorn for breakfast at all, let alone be eating it even before the actual opening time of Brennan's. 11:08 a.m. A student, clearly living off-campus, with a heavily-stickered Nalgene and a bicycle helmet in hand, tiptoes behind the wall that blocks the cashiers from the popcorn ma-chine. He looks furtively around to ascertain if anyone is staring at him (little did he know about me). He fully opens the small paper bag, allowing himself optimum space to compact the largest amount of popcorn all at once, and slowly opens the doors to the machine, still looking around. Dude, what you are looking for? I want to yell at him and reassure him that the popcorn was free and he will not get in trouble. This proves that no matter how many years you've been attending UVM and having the popcorn, you will feel as if you are \"stealing\" it. Twenty minutes later he refills two more bags, possibly for lunch and dinner. 5:28 p.m. A student in an oversized flannel anxiously waits in line to get popcorn. As the serving spoon is passed onto her, the garbage collector of Brennan's walks by. She im-mediately turns beet-red and angles her shoulders away from the workers. Does she know that these Brennan's workers see people take the popcorn every single day? She fills her bag quickly, avoiding all possible eye contact, apparently feeling so embarrassed and rushed that she didn't even close the doors to the popcorn box. Workers have seen practically every kid on campus take this popcorn, lady; you're not the only one who does this. Her pointlessly uncomfortable behavior matched many of the other popcorn addicts, who were overly self-conscious as they availed themselves of this free treat.Seeing this all before my eyes gave me reassurance that I am not alone when it comes to feeling unnatural when taking this popcorn. I usually just avoid it at all costs to prevent such scenarios from occurring. But why do we all feel this way? Who is telling us that this is not acceptable? It seems that everyone, however externally different they may be, inwardly shares a strong moral compass that makes them feel peculiar for taking this free popcorn. It may be because we just aren't used to getting things for free, without someone sneakily throwing in other obligations or payments. I guarantee you that the popcorn machine here is anything but a scam\u2014no hidden fees or payments, just popcorn. Feel free to confront your superego and take some next time you find yourself in the Davis Center. g Well everyone, this is what it comes down to. Recently, it was released to the media world that the identity of Honey Boo-Boo's true father was unknown. But, with hard fast research and ad-vances in paternity testing, the mystery of \"Who Da Boo-Boo Daddy\" has been narrowed down to just a few candidates. While it would be easy to point the finger at her TV father \"Sugar Bear\" we at the research station believe there is much more to the story. This has been debatably the hottest topic in the news all year so, without further adieu, lets review who Honey Boo Boo's biological father might be. Contender Number One is the RAC - COON that's often seen outside the Boo-Boos house. TV viewers might guess that the raccoon is merely looking in the trash for his next meal, but I believe there's more to the story. I think that the raccoon is actually trying to get back in touch with his \"daughter\" , evidenced by the very real possibil-ity that Honey Boo-Boo is part feral animal. Contender Number Two is the entire early two thousands rap group, THREE 6 MAFIA . The Mafia, as they like to be called, was on quiBIG te the heater around the approximate date of BOO-BOOs inception. Three 6 was reported to be playing shows in rural Georgia around this time and, with the amount of cough syrup Three 6 was drinking, it is likely they are unaware that they could have fathered America's newest, youngest, and most dangerously-diabetic superstar. It's likely The Mafia has hundreds of love children all over the south, Boo-Boo was just the first one to make it to the spot light. I'm honestly surprised these dots have not been connected before now. Contender Number Three is the old OAK TREE in Boo-Boos backyard. The tree has been with the family since the beginning. I asked myself over and over while doing this research, \"who knows Boo-Boo best\" , and I honestly think that this tree has the best idea of what is going on in the family. The tree has been watching over Boo-Boo, watching her grow and learn her entire life. The tree gives her shade when it's sunny and protects her from the rain when it's pouring. This tree could have easily had a one night stand with Boo Boo's mother during one of those crazy Georgia nights. This is a mystery we are truly closer to solv- ing after diving deep into some old Georgian con-gressional notes and new papers from the 2000's. Hopefully I've shed some light on this scintillating topic. I will continue to do research until I find hard evidence as to who Boo-Boo's father is. g \"To the men on campus, please stop jacking off in the showers. It clogs the drains. \" There I was, witnessing my first ever college flyer on a real live university campus. I was shocked. I was excited. I was wondering exactly how much sexual frustration existed at this unnamed insti-tution (it was William and Mary) to produce enough cum to clog a shower drain. The potential nerdship of Williamsburg collegiates contemplated and noted, my teenage mind wondered, \"why do boys touch themselves so much?\" Because they CAN, that's why. And, I argue, society should en- courage girls to do the same. Female \"me-time\" , as it turns out, is an integral part of my femi- nist agenda. So, allow me to introduce you to a bit of femme theory which claims you can buzz and cum your way into smashing the patriarchal order: A purity myth has been quieting the fact that women are sex- loving, orgasm-chasing humans for a while now. It has placed wom-en in strategically manufactured schoolgirl fetishes, which reveal just enough skin to make us the object of desire, while locking the buttons on our imagined plaid skirts shut, preventing us from rip-ping the thing off and getting some. The patriarchy shames women out of our sex drives until we learn that we don't have the right to our own sexual satisfaction, whether it be through another person (slut) or ourselves (girls don't do that). Don't even get sexism started on lesbianism (\"that's not real sex; it just exists for straight men to fetishize\") or sex between non-binary people (\"what?\"). All in all, the female orgasm is painted as an elusive and rare phenomenon that is nonessential, really. Enter feminism, and along with it, sex positivity, because sexuality is a glorious human right. Want to start smashing the patriarchy with orgasms right now? I got you covered with an excellent place to start: an introduction to sex toys. To the catamounts in possession of a vagina, take this introduction to sextoys and go forth into revolutionary (solo) sex. Because, contrary to what the patriarchy may tell you, a schlong is not a mandated condition to sexual satisfaction. Additionally, learning how to make yourself cum will allow you to reclaim partner sex as a tool for your own orgasm, rather than, at least in many hetero circumstances, a period of thrusting followed by someone collapsing on top of you, leaving you wondering what bliss feels like. Y our partner, however, is not to blame. Maleness is not to blame. If you don't know how to get yourself there, how the hell should your sex buddy? So, whether or not sex toys interest you at all, because believe-you-me your hand has all kinds of game, here are some options. If you do not have a majestic bajingo, and/or if your orgasms don't involve female bits, I still have you covered. There are inclusive and kick ass sexsites at the end of the article because equality means toe curling for all. Welcome to sex for the revolution, we hope you have a euphoric time.

Try not to ruin any showers. g In light of the Republican Party's success in the recent midterm elections, I've decided to let slip a little secret of mine: I'm a conservative. I know what many of you are probably thinking\u2014why on earth would I come to a school, let alone a state like Vermont? The answer to that is that I simply enjoy skiing and cold-hearted, inhospitable behavior too much to go to school in the South. Plus, I prefer to be within reasonable driving distance of my cat. Politics had nothing to do with my decision to come here. I discovered I was a conservative sometime in high school. My parents never forced politics on me; in fact, they frequently refused to say whom they voted for in elections when I asked. I found my political ideology all on my own. While at first I thought I was more liberal, I found, slowly, that I disagreed with many of their policies, and after a few online quizzes, declared myself a conservative to a select few. Political ideology is a spectrum. Just because I align myself with the Repub- lican Party does not mean I support all of its opinions. Like many people my age, I am in favor of legalizing gay marriage. I am in favor of women having the right to choose. Believe it or not, it is possible for a conservative voter to swing to the left a little bit. On a campus like UVM's, I often feel isolated when it comes to political parties. In my classes, there were nothing but dismayed expressions when the elec-tion results were brought up. I know most of my professors try to keep their opinions to themselves and remain neutral, but even so, I could hear the disappointment in their voices when they talked about Mitch Mc-Connell's rise to Senate majority leader. I'm always hesitant to tell someone where I land on the political spectrum in fear that they won't even give me the time of day. I keep quiet on a variety of is-sues in some of my political science classes in order to not become \"that\" girl, the white girl with plenty of privilege to spare. At a school like UVM, this was the last thing I expected. I knew going in I would differ from the vast majority, but I didn't think this difference would inhibit me like it really does. As a school, we send a message that we are tolerant of all races, sexual orientations, genders, etc. But why does it seem like that tolerance stops when it comes to a political party? I'm not ashamed to say what I believe in. I think a smaller, national gov- ernment and more emphasis on state government, as well as more emphasis on things like free enterprise are exactly what this country needs. Not all Republicans are created equal. We're not all sexist, racist, white pigs (though I'm not denying this isn't the case for all of us). It's time to open your eyes and practice what you preach, UVM, because cooperation between parties solves problems, isolation does not. Maybe one day we can all coexist peacefully on this overwhelmingly liberal campus, but at this rate, it's going to be a long time before that can happen. g It was amidst the weekly meeting of the water tower staff when a colleague of mine voiced her ongoing struggle of trying to befriend a professor. It is an all too familiar chal-lenge of a college student, however, Despite the seemingly un-achievable nature of this task, it is not necessarily out of reach. Now I don't mean becoming absolute homies with each professor and partaking in thirsty Thursdays only to simulta-neously struggle to wake up the following morning in time for the class that they're teaching. I simply mean that interacting with your professor on a semi-regular basis is not out of the question. A cordial chat after class or perhaps even a chummy cup of coffee to indulge in a conversation on topics they've al-ready lost interest in after they taught it to you the day before. The misconception for many students is that professors are these cynical-beings who would rather spend hours up-dating their blackboard than to tell a student in person. In fact, I've found it to be quite the contrary\u2014professors are ea-ger to witness a student's passion for a class.There's a reason they spend countless office hours in absolute isolation week after week contemplating whether or not this is all worth ten-ure. I prefer to imagine that professors are fascinated in the collegiate mind; they feed off of what can only be chalked up to a sort of sustained ignorance. That is the intellectual free-dom we take for granted, that for many has been gradually chiseled away by the harsh realities of employment. We serve as a reminder of what tremendous optimism youth is capable of retaining until the moment graduation and a series of stu-dent loans decimate it in a magnificent fashion. However, this relationship is all but one-sided. There is purpose to befriending a professor past improving your grade with some \"extra credit\" behind closed office doors. The mind of an experienced professor, in some capacities, is equivalent to that of the restricted section of a library. They offer im-mense reserves of knowledge that extends beyond the class-room. The types of wisdom that can make you realize that there is existence beyond these four fleeting years of ski shots and KKD's. Professors operate within a different realm of life experi- ence, the sort where drinking the elixir of life doesn't refer to funneling Labatt ice. No professor is going to find it charming when you regale him or her with a tale of blacking out at 9:30 on halloweekend to eventually wake up in the dorm of that girl from sociology that you'll now make sport of avoiding eye contact with the remainder of college. These are the types of interests that professors have out- grown. Y ou wouldn't be enthralled by a middle schooler's sto-ry of overdosing on mountain dew and pulling an all nighter at their friend's house watching horror movies, talking about girls. Suffice to say, this is the fundamental difference between professor and student. This is not to say professors aren't in-terested in what you have to say. It's simply necessary to real-ize that the dynamic of professor and student is just that, a mutual opportunity to experience alternate perspectives with a hint of professionalism. Professors will always respond to an individual's insa- tiable desire to learn, but it is this very desire that they them-selves posses. We as students just so happen to be their area of study for the time being. In the end, gaining an audience with a professor is sim- ple\u2014e.... just ask. As long as you haven't proven to be an ab-solute terror in the classroom, they'll be inclined to accept the invite. So if you've met the qualifications this far, you'll be happy to know you just might have the exciting beginnings of a new professional acquaintance. And who knows, come graduation you just might have the pleasure of sharing a shot of Old Crow together as peers. When it comes to professors, the rules of engagement are simple, whether it is philosophy or fluid dynamics, mandarin or sociology. Be eager, be passionate, and above all else, be submissive. gName: John Barfuss Age: 19 Ye ar : Sophomore Major: Civil Engineering Likes: Tenure, office hours, racquet- ball. Dislikes: Budget cuts, cheating, snow Days, people's knees. by katelynpine \"it's time to practice what you preach, UVM, because cooperation between parties solves problems, isolation does not.\" by alvaswing \"if you don't know how to get yourself there, how the hell should your sex buddy?\"by johnbarfuss Say the words 'Green Mountain Coffee' and\u2014if you're as hooked on coffee as I am\u2014you'll probably groan. This is because the coffee served on campus,which generally sits in large plastic vats, is served under the guise of a myriad of flavors, most of them varying de-grees of awful. However, it may come as a shock that not only is GMC barely deserving of the moniker coffee, it is also politically reprehensible. As you have probably surmised, Green Moun- tain Coffee is not grown in Vermont; however, Green Mountain did start as a \"local\" company, as a cafe that roasted its own coffee. Currently, Green Mountain Cof-fee is actually known as Keurig Green Mountain, as they also own Keurig and their K-cups (if you are have ever thought, \"Man, I want coffee right now but I don't think that I will produce enough plastic waste, \" then K-cups are the product for you). Coca-Cola actually owns about 16 percent of the company, making them a majority shareholder with significant clout over Keurig Green Mountain's political agenda. Situations like this are common\u2014a corporation either buys a smaller brand outright (Celestial Season-ings, once owned by hippies collecting wild herbs in Colorado, is now owned by Kraft Foods) or becomes a majority shareholder (MacDonald's was once a majority shareholder of Chipotle, although they sold their stock a few years back). Typically, in these types of scenarios, the average consumer has no idea that the same product they used to buy now is part of Nestle, Kellogg, General Mills, Pepsico, Unilever or Coke's respective conglomer - ate empires. The reason this corporate shadow puppet bullshit matters right now is because Green Mountain has tag-teamed with other enemies of peace, love and brother - hood (Monsanto and Starbucks) to sue the state of Ver - mont over the pending legislation that would force foods with genetically modified ingredients to be labeled. Out-side of the US, legislation for GMO labeling is common-place, but right now there are no states with GMO label-ing laws. The opposition to the bill comes from a group called the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which Monsanto, Starbucks and close to three hundred other large food-related corporations belong to. For the briefest of overviews, GM seeds are sold by a handful of biotech com- panies, the largest and best-known of which is Monsanto. Though the seeds are developed to ostensibly produce higher crop yields and resist pesticides, so that they can be doused with strong insecticides without any punishment. Meanwhile, the prices are able to drive many farmers within and outside of the US into debt, and the seeds themselves often fail to deliver the desired effects. The proliferation of GMOs has caused fear, controversy, controversy over the controversy, and further fear and anger. People may express unease over insert-ing foreign bits of genetic material into plant cells, while others will say that hu-mans have manipulated plant and animal DNA for years, and that the GM plants have been shown to pose no danger to human health. For many, such as Vendana Shiva, who recently visited UVM, the problems are not with the cells, but with the corporatization of food that GMOs are an integral part of. And maybe, just maybe the fact that some of these GMO plants are bred to work with petrochemicals is an ethical no-no. I mean, maybe some of us like bees, and would like to live in a world where human breast milk is uncontaminated by traces of pesticides. Maybe those who oppose the corporatization of food find it outrageous that, on average, it takes ten or more calories of petroleum to produce one calorie of food. Maybe. So please, pay Bev in the Cyber Cafe a visit and purchase some of her much better Speeder and Earl's brew. I would recommend the hazelnut flavor, but use Speeder's blend, the triple-caffeine flavor, with caution. gI've always loved pizza, but about a year ago, while I was at a party, one of my buddies challenged me to convert my Instagram into a strictly pizza-based medium. Since then there has been no looking back. I love pizza more than just about anything in this world. I was raised to appreciate a good New Y ork slice by my parents, who lived an extensive part of their lives in the city. When I eat pizza, I pretty much look for a very thin slice with a mostly crispy bottom and an even ratio of cheese sauce and toppings. The crust must have some softness left on the in-side, but also a strong, crisp texture on the outside. I grade as fairly as I can although its impossible to say mood isn't a factor when eating a new pizza. Without any more words on my part, here are my ratings of a few different pizzas found on the UVM campus. The first slice I jumped into was the infamous Grundle a.k.a Harris-Millis dining hall's flatbread. The pizza was constructed extremely thin and pretty overcooked. This flatbread was adorned with some pretty wack vegetables, but I had never seen it before so I had to jump in. There were red and green peppers, jalepenos, zucchini, and sun dried tomatoes. I had lower expectations going into first bite of this slice but it still managed to disappoint. This was one of the first slices in years I haven't finished. It'll take some serious convincing to get me to drop back into another one of these slices. However, I'll probably eat this slice the next time I see it because I convinced myself there's no way it can taste worse and I'm an addict. Score: 1.34 out of 10. The next slice was Cook Commons' buffalo chicken. I' d say buffalo chicken is a bit of a fan fa-vorite and people definitely over-hype it. Nonethe-less, it's definitely a nice change up from the usual cheese bullshit we get in Cook. I managed to cop one thin slice fresh out the industrial oven that Sodexo probably tosses their frozen propaganda pizza in. This drastically changes the quality of Cook pizza. If they sit on those wooden slabs for too long they baste in whatever grease was there before, that's why I never grab a sloppy slice that looks like it's on the verge of disintegration. Score: 4.67 out of 10. Slice number three was that standard pepperoni slice at Simpson that always looks at you and in a quite voice and whispers, \"I'm mediocre, but I'm slightly less mediocre than most the food around you. \" That's the rea-son I probably eat three or four slices of this pepperoni a week. It has a crispier bottom because somehow the Simpson Sodexo workers are more capable than anywhere else on campus. As far as ingredients go, they don't have any real advantage over a slice from any of the other unlimited dining spots on campus. Simpson pepperoni scores a lukewarm 4.21 out of 10. The March\u00e9 pepperoni pizza is a dark horse for one of the better slices on campus. Coupled with a tight deal of a drink and a slice for fewer than four bucks, this is definitely one of the better bangs for your buck. If you know what's up, you'll ask one of the workers behind the counter to make your pizza well done. The bottom will actually get a nice crispy texture you' d expect from a legitimate pizza restaurant if you utilize this trick. I' d say what really hinders all the pizza on campus are just the ingredients. Y ou can't take a bite of any pizzas and not taste the chalky, grainy consis-tency and sauce that lacks any actual tomato flavor. March\u00e9 pizza scores a 5.39 out of 10. Unfortunately, Sodexo has a chokehold on the pizza world. Unless you feel like waiting a significant period of time for a delivery pizza to come, then you're out of luck. gby jessebaum by alvaswingsomeone on campus catch your eye ? couldn't get a name? submit your love anonymously uvm.edu/~watertwr/iwysb.htmloverheard a conversation in b-town? was it hilarious? dumb? inspirational? tell the ear and we'll print it. uvm.edu/~watertwr/ear.html The Grundle Knowledgable female : Boys are stupid.

Damon Albarn, the mastermind musical genius behind the group announced that he has plenty of material to release a new album under his Gorillaz project. Albarn, as you may recall, has released many albums with the Brit-pop legends Blur, as well as his own solo albums. Good thing he has carved out enough time to make more electronic music that we all love from Gorillaz. Noodle, 2D, Murdoc Niccals, and Russel Hobbs are back. In honor of this great virtual band, let's count down the top 10 Gorillaz songs. Really, there are too many to pick from, though. 8. Stylo This is a great groovy track that features a collabora-tion with Mos Def and Bobby Womack. The collabo-rations on Plastic Beach are incredible. Even though most of the Gorillaz' work features collaborations, Plastic Beach take the cake. Bobby Womack kills it on this track. R.I.P to this soul legend who passed away this year at age 70.9. Kids with Guns This spot was really up for grabs, as a number of songs could have slipped into it. However, I chose to give it to \"Kids with Guns, \" because of the way the song changes course. It begins with a twanging bass, changes to a twang-ing guitar, and then drops with a haunting chorus of \"turn-ing us into monsters. \" 10. Amarillo The only song on the list off of The Fall , \" Amarillo\" , like most of the songs on the album is very heav-ily electronic. Damon Albarn recorded The Fall on his iPad while touring for Plastic Beach , which helps to explain the lack of depth in most of its songs. 7. Feel Good Inc. This track off Demon Days is certainly the Gorillaz' most popular, and the one that gets stuck in my head in so many different ways. Whether it is the haunting bass solo, the odd back-ground whispering, the maniacal laughing of De La Soul, or the acoustic breakdown, this song fea-tures an oddly successful combination. 6. El Ma\u00f1ana The song immediately following \"Feel Good Inc. \" on the Demon Days tracklist, also follows it on this Top 10 list. I really dig the beat in this song. It just free flows, while pervading the song in despair. The song is definitely one of sadness and depression. 5. 19-2000 The funky beat on this song makes it impossible to forget once it gets into your head. This beat has become a quintessential Gorillaz beat that definite-ly paved the way for much of Demon Days and Plastic Beach . 4. On Melancholy Hill Plastic Beach is probably the best full album that the Goril-laz have released. Every song plays a specific roll in Albarn's critique of contemporary soci-ety, and \"On Melancholy Hill\" is my favorite stand out song. It takes on more of a poppy feel than most of the other tracks, and feels rhythmically happy. However, if you listen to the lyrics, and the title, you will re-alize that it is quite, well, mel-ancholy. 3. Dirty Harry Bootie Brown, from the hip-hop group Pharcyde, raps the impressive bit that forms the majority of this groovy song. This song contains many themes of war. 2. Tomorrow Comes Today This song is just phenomenal. It is slow, yet melodic, yet haunting. It has a lot of influences from Blur, but also marks the advent of his new project, the Gorillaz. This song tells the warning tale of the digital age, and I, much like Albarn, \"don't think I'll be here too long. \"1. Clint Eastwood Although many Gorillaz songs blend electronic and hip-hop, \"Clint East-wood\" does it best and it did it first. The verses in this song are rapped by Del the Funkee Homosapien who makes references to the song's namesake and to a variety of drug innuendos. woke up this morning in a puddle of my own piss Muddlin' my own wits, flesh but I feel boneless.What the fuck world is this?

Last time, in Grant Daverson: Ace Detective: A dinner party, the lights go out and\u2014a bang! The city treasurer lies dead\u2014but who lies about the dead city treasurer? We leave off after Mrs. O'Police refuted the accusation of sleeping with the dead man...by leonardbartenstein \"'i'd be slow clapping were i able, ' she said. 'but since i'm not, just understand that there's sarcasm implied. '\"\"Y our revulsion tells me that you detested the rumor that you may have been sleeping with him, \" said James Jay. \"Hated it so much that you might want to get him out of the picture?\" \"No!\" shouted Mrs. O'Police. \"I would never!\"\"I think a ballistics report is in order, \" said Pemble- ton, reaching into her handbag for a protractor to mea-sure the angle of the blood splatter on the wall behind the former city treasurer's body. \"Y ou' d like to do that report, wouldn't you?\" asked Jeanette, a new sort of vigor in her voice. \"So that you can show that it didn't come from you, and cover your tracks. Y ou're going to make it look like one of us did it, and you're going to be able to get away scot-free to your higher-up lizard council who live among us as others\u2014\" \"That's enough Jeanette, \" said James, placing a gentle hand over her mouth and ceas-ing her speaking. \"This is all well and good, \" said Daverson, \"and I would love to sit through whatever though up accusation you might have for me, claiming that I'm the killer, but I think it's about time I shed some light on how I, while you were bickering, deduced who was really the killer. \" \"What are you going on about?\" asked Chief O'Police.\"I know, \" said Daverson, speaking slowly for empha- size what he was saying, \"who did it. \" \"Enlighten us, then, \" said Mrs. O'Police.\"That's simple, \" said Daverson. \" And I will first reveal who the murderer is, so that they can be assured not to escape, and then I will tell you how and why they did it. \" \"We know how they did it, \" said Charlotte Howe. \"The gun\u2014we've got that. But who killed him?\" \"I'm getting to that, \" said Daverson. He straightened his messy attire as if that did anything. \"The person who killed the city treasurer, Bailey Dew, who was murdered\u2014the murderer's name is, the person who killed Treasurer Dew, \" he paused for effect, the anticipation hanging in the air like a freshly ironed pair of trousers, \"Jazzy Hall. \"The lightning crashed outside, as if to punctuate his words.\"Restrain her!\" exclaimed Diana, as she rushed around the table, pulling some handcuffs out of her handbag. The chief of police stood for a moment, dumb-founded, before he grabbed the shoulder of the woman as she was trying to run from the room. Diana came from behind and slapped on the cuffs. She then shoved the woman down into the chair. Jazzy turned to Daverson, a scowl on her face. \"How did you know?\" she asked. \" And that's not a confession. \" \"Well, it helps to start with the fact that you were in the perfect spot to shoot Treasurer Dew. He was directly across from you, wasn't he?\" Daverson gestured over to where the body was still slumped into his mashed pota-toes. \"But he wasn't your intended target, was he?\" \"Y ou tell me, you seem to know quite a bit, \" said Jazzy, spitting out the words like a beaten boxer might spit out teeth. \"Y ou actually intended to shoot Alderman Jay, didn't you?\" asked Daverson. \"Y ou just missed, in the dark. \" \"Me?\" asked the alderman, a hand going to his chest, as if to ask \"me?\" in disbelief. \"Y es, you, \" said Daverson. \"Her hand was probably jostled when the chief over here tried to cop a feel in the d a r k .\" \"Why would she want to kill me?\" asked the James Jay. \"Well, I'm getting to that, \" said Daverson. \"First, though, how did she get into this party in the first place? Besides the chief 's libido, I mean. I'll have you note, with the exception of Mr. Barton and myself, she was the last to be invited. And yet, she's here\u2014and there's no way that Mrs. O'Police would let in any floozy dame. And how did you get to this party?\" Daverson asked, looking now to Jazzy. \"She promised me free headshots with an agent she knew, \" said Mrs. O'Police. She made eye contact with Daverson, but then looked away, ashamed. \"She said she could get me a role in a local commercial. I thought if I were a big-shot like that, I could impress my husband again, and not have him flouncing around. \" \"Y ou think that lowly of me?\" asked Chief O'Police.\"Y ou've given me no reason not to, \" replied his wife.\"So that explains that, \" said Daverson. \"But I doubt that she would have been even able to get you those head-shots, Mrs. O'Police. \" He looked to Jazzy now. \"Because her name is not Jazzy Hall at all, but Carmen Valenc\u00e9, sis-ter and business partner of Rachael Valenc\u00e9!\" A gasp went through the room. Carmen's hands flut- tered behind her back in the chair, but they did nothing more, because they were handcuffed. \"I' d be slow clap-ping were I able, \" she said. \"But since I'm not, just un-derstand that there's sarcasm implied. Excellent work. Y ou've found me out. But why, sir detective, did I do it? And what made you find me out?\" \"It's easy, \" said Daverson. \" Alderman Jay wanted to cancel the lottery drawing for a longer time for the public access community announcements, thus pushing you off of the air.
