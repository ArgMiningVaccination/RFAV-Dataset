The second one is done at the baby's checkup at one to two weeks of age. Finding and treating these disorders early can prevent serious complications such as growth and developmental delays, deafness, blindness, intellectual disabilities, seizures, and sudden or early death. The lists below describe the core and secondary conditions for which babies in Texas are tested and include fact sheets for each condition that can be shared with parents or non-health professionals. Secondary conditions are believed to be clinically significant, but some may have an unclear natural history or lack appropriate medical therapy that affects long-term outcome. They are detected during screening for core conditions. Some secondary conditions may be as severe and life threatening as core conditions. Learn more about the [newborn screening tests](/sites/default/files/newborn/pdf/NBSForYourBabysHealth.pdf). In addition to the blood spot tests, newborns also receive the following two [point-of-service screenings](/newborn/screened_disorders.aspx#POS) at the birthing facility: Amino Acid Disorders Amino acid disorders are rare health conditions that affect a body's metabolism which is how the body changes food into the energy it needs to have normal physical and mental development. People who have an amino acid disorder cannot make or break down certain proteins. Treatment may include a low-protein diet and/or special medical foods and formula and medication. Core Conditions Argininosuccinic Acidemia (ASA) is a condition that causes dangerous amounts of ammonia to build up in the body. People with this condition cannot remove the waste product ammonia produced when the body breaks down amino acids. High ammonia in the body can cause muscle weakness, brain swelling, and coma that can lead to death if not treated. Fact Sheets: [ASA English](/sites/default/files/newborn/pdf/FactASA.pdf) - [ASA Spanish](/sites/default/files/newborn/pdf/FactASAsp.pdf) Citrullinemia (CIT) is a condition that causes dangerous amounts of ammonia to build up in the body. It happens when an enzyme called \"argininosuccinic acid synthetase\" (ASAS) is either missing or doesn't work right. ASAS helps break down amino acids and removes ammonia from the body. Too much ammonia can cause muscle weakness, breathing problems, seizures, brain damage, and death if untreated.

Treatment consists of medication including vitamin D and nitisinone, and a special restricted protein diet. Fact Sheets: [TYR 1 English](/sites/default/files/newborn/pdf/FactTYR1.pdf) - [TYR 1 Spanish](/sites/default/files/newborn/pdf/FactTYR1sp.pdf) Secondary Conditions Argininemia (ARG) is a condition that causes harmful amounts of ammonia and the amino acid arginine to build up in the body. If untreated, ARG can cause muscle problems and developmental delay. Fact Sheets: [ARG English](/sites/default/files/newborn/pdf/FactARG.pdf) - [ARG Spanish](/sites/default/files/newborn/pdf/FactARGsp.pdf) Benign Hyperphenylalaninemia mild form of phenylketonuria. People with H-PHE have problems breaking down an amino acid, a building block of proteins, known as phenylalanine (PKU). Most people with this condition experience mild symptoms or no symptoms. They can have healthy growth and development. However, some babies with H-PHE do have a small risk of brain damage without treatment. Fact Sheet: [H-PHE English](/sites/default/files/newborn/pdf/FactH-PHE.pdf) Biopterin Defect in Cofactor Biosynthesis (BIOPT-BS) is a condition that causes high amounts of phenylalanine and other harmful substances to build up in the body.

Without fatty acids, the body runs out of energy and cannot continue to function. Also, if fatty acids are not broken down, they build up in the body causing damage to important organs such as the heart and liver. Treatment may include a low fat diet, frequent food intake, supplementation with L-Carnitine (Carnitor) and medium-chain triglycerides. Core Conditions Carnitine Uptake Defect (CUD) is a condition in which the body cannot bring enough carnitine, a substance that helps the body make energy from fats, into the cells.

These motor neurons control certain muscles of the body. Over time, as a child loses more motor neurons, the muscles get weaker. Activities such as crawling, walking, and breathing become more difficult. Learning and intellectual abilities are not affected by SMA. Fact Sheet: [SMA English](/sites/default/files/newborn/pdf/SMA-FACT.PDF) X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a condition in the body's cells cannot break down very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). These build up and cause problems in the brain, spinal cord and adrenal glands. Fact Sheet: [X-ALD English](/sites/default/files/newborn/pdf/FACT-XALD.pdf), [X-ALD Spanish](/sites/default/files/newborn/pdf/XALD-FACT-Spanish.pdf). Secondary Conditions Related Lymphocyte Deficiencies are conditions in which the body's immune system is not working properly. The body's immune system is made up of different parts that work together to protect it from infection. T-cells are a specific type of white blood cell of the immune system that helps to protect the body from certain kinds of illnesses. Babies with T-cell deficiencies are born without enough working T-cells and may get repeated infections. Fact Sheets: [T-Cell Related Deficiencies Spanish](/sites/default/files/newborn/pdf/FactTCellLymphsp.pdf) Point-of-Service Screenings Point-of-Service Screenings are tests done at the birthing facility before the baby goes home. These screenings are separate from the blood spot screening. Critical Congenital Heart Disease (CCHD) refers to a group of serious heart defects that are present from birth. CCHD prevents the heart from pumping blood effectively or reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood. As a result, organs and tissues throughout the body do not receive enough oxygen that can lead to organ damage and life-threatening complications. [Read more about CCHD.](/newborn/cchd.aspx) Newborn Hearing Screening checks how well a baby can hear because some babies are born who deaf or hard of hearing. Most birthing facilities provide the screening before newborns go home. If a baby is born at home or in a birthing center that does not participate in hearing screening, they will refer parents to a certified program to schedule the hearing screening.
