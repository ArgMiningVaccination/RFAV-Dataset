Scientific research is increasingly dependent on access to cutting-edge technology. To provide itself with the capacity for innovation and technological development, and to translate technology into its laboratories, Inserm has developed its technology research accelerators (ARTs). These structures aim not only to develop innovative technologies, but also to make them available to the research teams who may benefit from them. An important component of their work is providing research staff with training in the use of technological innovations. Biomedical Ultrasound ART This first ART, created in 2016, is dedicated to research and use of medical ultrasound, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and in neurological and cardiovascular disease. This new theme-based structure brings together multiple skills within the same unit in order to develop innovative technologies and provide them to other Inserm laboratories. The Biomedical Ultrasound ART is part of the [Institut Physique pour la M\u00e9decine Paris](https://www.physicsformedicine.espci.fr), a joint research in the [PariSant\u00e9 Campus](https://parisantecampus.fr). Bioprinting ART This ART aims to support the integration of 3D cell printing within Inserm laboratories. Its objective is to accelerate the development of cellular models for fundamental research, organoids for research in pharmacology, and the uses of bioprinting for research in regenerative medicine. Notably it provides training and production services to Inserm laboratories. Created in 2017, this ART was developed in partnership with the Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux (Inserm unit 1026, [BioTis](http://www.biotis-bordeaux.com/index.html)). Genomic Therapy ART This third ART brings technological, preclinical and pharmaceutical skills for the development of innovation in gene therapy from Inserm laboratories. It focuses in particular on so-called genomic therapy approaches, which consist in stably modifying the genome of target somatic cells in order to obtain a lasting effect, including in tissues undergoing strong division. This approach, which has already shown its worth, makes it possible to combine gene and cell therapies. For example, it uses lentiviral vectors or CRISPR genome editing tools. Created on January 1, 2018, the Genomic Therapy ART is directed by Anne Galy. It will focus on immunology or hematology applications of genomic therapy. mRNA ART Created in September 2022, this ART aims to promote and accelerate the integration of technologies based on the biomedical use of messenger RNA in Inserm units. The development of these technologies undoubtedly offers the possibility of developing innovative therapeutic strategies for many diseases: beyond the success of mRNA vaccines against Covid-19, various works have indeed demonstrated the interest of these molecules in various therapeutic applications (immunotherapies, genome editing, transient protein delivery...). The promising results of ongoing clinical trials further strengthen the interest in these molecules. This ART will provide expertise and services related to mRNA technologies, thus completing the skills and resources of Inserm laboratories. Located at the Orleans University and University Hospital, it will rely on two platforms - the first dedicated to the production of mRNAs and the second to the development of systems for delivering them - to develop innovative tools and approaches.
