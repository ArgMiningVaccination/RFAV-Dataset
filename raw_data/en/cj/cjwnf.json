In the early 19th century, a major emphasis in higher education was on the study of Greek and Latin, with lit-tle attention to modern or contemporary subjects. The founders ofNew York University intended to enlarge the scope of higher edu-cation to meet the needs of persons aspiring to careers in business,industry, science, and the arts, as well as in law, medicine, and theministry. The opening of the University of London in 1828 con-vinced New Yorkers that their city, too, should have a university. The first president of New York University's governing council was Albert Gallatin, former adviser to Thomas Jeffersonand secretary of the treasury in Jefferson's cabinet. Gallatin andhis cofounders said that the new university was to be a \"nationaluniversity\" that would provide a \"rational and practical educationfor all.\" The result of the founders' foresight is today a universi- ty that is recognized both nationally and internationally as aleader in scholarship. Of the more than 3,000 colleges and uni-versities in America, only 61 private institutions are members ofthe distinguished Association of American Universities. NewYork University is one of the 61. Students come to the Univer- sity from all 50 states and from 125 foreign countries. The University includes 14 schools and colleges at six major centers in Manhattan. In addition, the University operatesbranch campus programs in Westchester County at Manhat-tanville College and in Rockland County at St. Thomas AquinasCollege. Certain of the University's research facilities, notablythe Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, are located inSterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York. Although overall theUniversity is large, the divisions are small- to moderate-sizedunits\u2014each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty. Enrollment in the undergraduate divisions ranges between 100 and 6,600. While some introductory classes insome programs have large numbers of students, many classes aresmall. More than 2,500 courses are offered, leading to more than25 different degrees.AN INTRODUCTION TO New Y ork University 1832 College of Arts and Science 1835 School of Law 1841 School of Medicine 1865 College of Dentistry 1886 Graduate School of Arts and Science 1890 School of Education 1900 Leonard N.

Unlike other institutions at the time, it was to be nonsec- tarian and to produce a different sort of elite citizen, not born to privilege but set apart forleadership by talent and effort. To that end it provided a more practical education, what the19th century called \"Useful Knowledge.\" Thus, in addition to offering the standard classical curriculum, early NYU was also a center for science. Samuel F. B. Morse, after whom the current core curriculum is named,invented the telegraph while teaching art and design; John W . Draper invented modernphotography; and the American Chemical Society was founded here. In the arts and culture, too, it can be argued that the College not only participated in, but also generated much, of the creative energy that has characterized Greenwich Village.The original University Building housed ateliers that were the forerunners of the currentdowntown art scene. And although Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was turned down for ateaching post, literature thrived, with University Building even featured in a novel by theeccentric Theodore Winthrop (1861). Finally, this neighborhood and this institution have had a long tradition of social and political activism\u2014from the Stonecutters Riot over the construction of the University'sfirst building in 1834 to the tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, a major eventin U.S. labor history that took place in what is now the Brown Building. From its earliest days, then, the College on Washington Square has been at the cut- ting edge of intellectual, cultural, and social developments. In 1895, however, NYU's greatchancellor, Henry MacCracken, decided to reserve Washington Square for the professionalschools, which proliferated under his leadership, and to move University College to a beau-tiful campus in the Bronx\u2014University Heights\u2014designed by Stanford White. The College's move to the Heights reflected MacCracken's \"Ivy\" aspirations for the school and his successful effort to raise quality by attracting the best students nationally.Also relevant was the ascendant, nonurban collegiate ideal of a residential community, withfine teaching, extracurricular activities, fraternities, and intercollegiate athletics. A few years later an undergraduate presence was restored downtown with the open- ing of a Collegiate Division (1903), soon to become Washington Square College (1913).This school had a more diverse student body, opening its doors to women, recent immi-grants, commuters, and professional students. For over 60 years, undergraduate liberal arts education at NYU took place in two locations\u2014University College (and the Engineering School) at the Heights and the College onWashington Square, both offering excellent, but different, educational and social experiences.A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE College of Arts and Science 14 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCEIn the 1970s the College under- went yet another major transforma-tion. In response to financial pres-sures, the Heights campus closed in1973 and University College mergedwith Washington Square College.The new institution, which is nowknown simply as the College of Artsand Science, is the beneficiary ofboth traditions\u2014the Heights' resi-dential and collegiate culture and theSquare's progressive urban focus. Atthat time, a decision was also madeto build aggressively for quality\u2014torecruit the very best faculty and stu- dents, to update and expand thephysical plant, and to create distin-guished programs both here andabroad. In recent years the College has become recognized as a nationalleader for its efforts to reinvent a lib-eral arts education for the 21st cen-tury. With a challenging liberal artscore, the Morse Academic Plan, atthe center of its curriculum, theCollege emphasizes student inquiryand research; offers unique opportu-nities for international and prepro- fessional study; and makes use of thecity as a site for learning and service.A liberal arts education thus recon-ceived is not only personally enrich-ing but also eminently practical indeveloping the skills and perspec-tives essential to assume a leadershiprole in the 21st century. As the newmillennium proceeds, the Collegecontinues to build on its founders'goal of providing \"UsefulKnowledge.\" COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE 15 COLLEGE DIRECTORY 17College Directory Administrators Matthew S.

Classification of CoursesThe bulletin contains descriptions of the College's departments, programs,and courses. Each course is assigneda letter prefix followed by a number.The prefix V indicates undergradu-ate courses offered in the College; Gindicates a graduate course offeredby the Graduate School of Arts andScience. Graduate courses open to qualified undergraduates are designated by the departments. The departmental poli-cy in this matter may be indicated in this bulletin or in the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science section ofthe directory of classes, which isavailable during each registrationperiod. Hyphenated courses (e.g., V77.0101-0102) are full-year cours-es. Each term is registered for indi-vidually, but no credit is granted forcompleting only the first term of thefull-year course. In the designationof a course where the numbers indi- cating each half of the course areseparated by a comma, not a hyphen,credit will be granted for complet-ing only the first term of the courseunless it is indicated otherwise.Students should be aware that in cer-tain of these courses, satisfactorycompletion of the first term of thecourse is a prerequisite for entry intothe second term of the course.MORSE ACADEMIC PLAN 23The Morse Academic Plan (MAP) of the College of Arts and Science is an integrated general education curriculum in the liberal arts. The MAP is named for Samuel F.B. Morse, an early faculty member of the University. Best known as inventor of the telegraph, Morse taught fine arts at NYU and was an eminent painter. In his breadth of tal-ent and high achievement as both an artist and scientist, Morse symbolizes the range ofskills and interests that the MAP is designed to foster. The MAP provides a core academic experience for undergraduates at NYU. Through a challenging array of foundational courses the program heightens cultural aware-ness, hones critical reading skills, promotes creative and logical thinking, and gives studentsextensive practice writing and speaking English and at least one other language. Ratherthan specifying a fixed canon of knowledge, the MAP focuses on modes and methods ofhumanistic and scientific inquiry. In each case, students are free to pursue particular inter-ests by choosing among a number of courses. Students examine our contemporary culture\u2014its origins and social structures, its modes of expression, and its inherent diversity and evolv-ing patterns of thought. In other classes, they consider the place and importance of modernscience\u2014its quantitative and analytical foundations, its processes of reasoning, and its rela-tionship to technology and to our views of the natural world. By helping them to broadentheir perspectives, gain new pathways for intellectual inquiry, and develop the skills, back-ground, and social awareness to thrive in dynamic circumstances, the MAP thus seeks toprepare students for their later studies and to equip them well for lives as thinking indi-viduals and members of society.The Morse Academic Plan DIRECTOR OF THE MORSE ACADEMIC PLAN: Professor Myers DIRECTOR OF THE EXPOS-ITORY WRITING PRO-GRAM: Professor Hoy Program The MAP has four components: 1.the Expository Writing Program, 2.study of foreign language, 3.the Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC), and 4.the Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI). Though structured and integrat- ed, the MAP curriculum affords stu-dents flexibility in a number ofways. It permits the following: choice of different tracks in all courses, satisfaction of some courses by examination or Advanced Placementcredit (foreign language, FSI), and substitution of departmental courses (FSI). Given this flexibility, students will work individually with advisersto plan course schedules that takeinto account, among other things,their past preparation, current inter-ests, and longer-term goals. Whilethere is no prescribed schedule ofcourses that will be appropriate forevery student, the following broadguidelines should be kept in mind. Incoming freshmen should nor- mally complete their MAP coursesby the end of sophomore year. Thiswill leave them free in the juniorand senior years to focus on theirmajor and elective courses. Some sci-ence majors, engineering students,premedical students, and studentsplaced in the International WritingWorkshop sequence may need to delay starting, and thus finishing, acomponent of the MAP for a semes-ter or more.24 MORSE ACADEMIC PLAN All students must begin the expos- itory writing component in their firstsemester and must register for theirremaining writing course(s) in thesemester(s) immediately following. Students who are placed into Mathematical Thinking, V63.0005,should enroll in this course in theirfirst semester in order to be able to proceed to Quantitative Reasoning in the second semester. Although Freshman Honors Seminars, V50.02XX, are not a partof the MAP , qualifying students arestrongly urged to register for one ofthese classes in their first semester.These seminars with distinguishedfaculty members promise an intellec-tually stimulating experience rightat the start of college. The MAP assures breadth and diversity of courses and subjects inthe first years. It is hoped that thebases laid and the interests awakenedby these courses will lead students topursue as electives further coursesoutside of their area of specialization. Expository WritingIt would be hard to exaggerate the value of the ability to communicateclearly and effectively in writing.The Expository Writing Program atNYU assumes that writing is notmerely a useful skill but also a wayof learning and knowing. Its coursesfocus on the examination of evi-dence, the development of ideas, andthe clear expression of those ideas ina variety of different kinds of essays.During the first semester, students move from exploration to argumentas they read and make use of varioustexts\u2014written, visual, experien-tial\u2014to create a spectrum of persua-sive essays. In the second semester,the examined texts become morecomplex, the writing tasks more dif-ficult. The semester's work movesstudents closer to the academic disci-plines and requires them to grapplewith intriguing questions that lead to richer ideas and more interestingforms of expression. The essays stu-dents write become more formal andargumentative, but no less com-pelling. For a complete description of the curriculum, see the Expository Writing Program (40) section of this bulletin. Foreign LanguageThe study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal arts educa-tion. It nurtures an awareness of thediversity of human culture andserves the practical need for languageskills in fields such as government,business, and research. New YorkUniversity is a particularly excitingsetting for language study because ofits location in a great cosmopolitancity, its international student body,its many renowned language pro-grams and centers, and its rapidlyexpanding opportunities for studyabroad. In addition to the foreign lan- guages courses offered for academiccredit, the College offers opportuni-ties for students of modern lan-guages to practice their skills in real-world situations outside the class-room. \"NYU Speaking Freely\" is afree, noncredit program that allowsstudents to practice their speakingand aural comprehension skills andto explore the linguistically diversecultures of New York City. For moreinformation about this popular pro-gram, contact the Office of theAssociate Dean for Students, MainBuilding, Room 909. Increasingly, college graduates must be prepared to function in aglobal society. Apart from the inher-ent interest of learning about othercultures, many NYU students takethe opportunity to study or travel abroad as preparation for their futurecareers. For more information aboutNYU Study Abroad Programs, visitthe Student Center for InternationalStudy, Main Building, Room 904,and consult the Programs Abroad sec- tion of this bulletin. Requirement. To fulfill the for- eign language component of theMorse Academic Plan, students mustshow or attain proficiency in a for-eign language through the interme-diate level. Ordinarily, this is accom-plished by the successful completionof two years of language study in theCollege, through the second semes-ter of a regular intermediate-levellanguage sequence. Some languagesare also taught in intensive courses,allowing students to complete theequivalent of two years of study in asingle year. After two years of college lan- guage study or the equivalentdemonstrated proficiency, studentsshould have gained a broad compe-tence in a language; but true fluencyof written or oral expression will notusually have been developed at thispoint. For this reason, all studentsare encouraged to continue their lan-guage study beyond the intermedi-ate level. In particular, studentsstudying modern languages will findit most beneficial to immerse them-selves in the living culture of a lan- guage by studying, traveling, orworking abroad. Likewise, studentsof all languages, whether ancient ormodern, are encouraged to continuetheir studies with elective courses inliterature at the advanced level. Exemptions. Students may ful- fill the foreign language componentof the MAP by presenting outstand-ing scores on the SAT II orAdvanced Placement Examinationsor by passing a departmental profi-ciency examination. For furtherinformation on language placementand exemption, see under\"Placement Examinations\" in theAcademic bul- letin. For Advanced PlacementExamination equivalencies, consultthe chart in the Admissions section, also in this bulletin. Students whose secondary school- ing was in a language other thanEnglish and other than a languageoffered in the College, or who com-plete the International WritingWorkshop sequence (V40.0003, V40.0004, V40.0009), are exemptfrom foreign language require-ment. Also exempt are students inthe B.S./B.E. program. Courses. Listed below are cours- es covering the second semester ofthe intermediate level of languagestudy. Intensive courses, which allowMORSE ACADEMIC PLAN 25students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year,are also listed where available.Completion of any of the followingcourses will fulfill the foreign lan-guage requirement.

Thanks to a new exchange arrangement with ColumbiaUniversity, students may also enrollin the following languages, offeredthrough the intermediate level andgiven at Columbia: Armenian,Polish, Sanskrit, and Ukrainian. For information about these courses, visit the Office of AcademicAffairs, Main Building, Room 908. Foundations of Contemporary CultureThe Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the MorseAcademic Plan is a series of fourcoordinated courses in the humanitiesand social sciences. Within each ofthe four offerings, students are free topursue their particular intereststhrough their choice of individualclasses. Overall, the structure of theFCC ensures that every student in theCollege gains a common core of skillsand experiences in the liberal arts. In addition to the information on the Foundations of ContemporaryCulture provided in this bulletin,detailed descriptions of each year'scourse offerings may be found in theMAP brochure, published annuallyas a supplement to this bulletin. CONVERSATIONS OF THE WEST Through exploration of contrasting and complementary works in thehumanities from different periods,Conversations of the West provides ahistorical, literary, and philosophicalcontext for education in the liberalarts. Students may choose from four tracks: Antiquity and the MiddleAges, Antiquity and theRenaissance, Antiquity and theEnlightenment, and Antiquity andthe 19th Century. In each case, theclasses begin with works from someof the ancient civilizations that haveshaped the development of culturesin the West. Typically, the classeshave the following readings in com-mon: the books of Genesis andExodus from the Hebrew Scriptures,the Gospel According to Luke andActs of the Apostles from theChristian New Testament, a Platonicdialogue and a Sophoclean orEuripidean tragedy, Vergil's Aeneid, and Augustine's Confessions. In the second half of the course, the themesand ideas emerging from these textsare followed as they are maintained,reinterpreted, or disputed by laterthinkers. Conversations of the West is not a survey, but rather, an examinationof how texts influence subsequentthinking, create traditions, andreflect societal ideals. Conversations of the West thus aims to provide aricher understanding of how culturesare constructed, modified, and repre-sented. WORLD CULTURES The World Cultures courses intro-duce students to the ways in whichcultural traditions are created and theways in which cultures define them-selves against internal and externalalternatives. These courses introducestudents to the methods and prob-lems of cultural studies. LikeConversations of the West, WorldCultures is not intended as a set ofhistorical surveys. Each course isdesigned to examine the challenges of\"translation\"\u2014of appreciating cultur-al traditions other than one's own; tointroduce students to the major texts,artifacts, and values of another cultur-al tradition; and to develop a sense ofthe diversity and similarity of theways in which people in different cul-tural traditions understand, experi-ence, and imagine their lives.26 MORSE ACADEMIC PLANSOCIETIES AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES Over the past several centuries, enor- mous social transformations havetaken place around the world. Tounderstand the complexity of thesephenomena, new methods have beendeveloped to study societal struc-tures and human behavior. Each ofthe courses under Societies and theSocial Sciences begins from a partic-ular disciplinary approach, socialconcern, or topic, in order to orientstudents to the characteristic meth-ods of these social sciences. Studentslearn how issues are objectified forstudy, how data are collected andanalyzed, and how new understand- ing is thereby achieved. Whetherthrough an interdisciplinaryapproach, consideration of their his-torical development, or reflection oncritical and positivistic debates, thecourses help students both to appre-ciate the unique insights afforded bythese methods and to recognize thelimits of such inquiry. In this way,students move beyond the particularfocus of the class to a broader under-standing of methods and problemsin the social sciences generally. EXPRESSIVE CULTURE In Expressive Culture studentsexplore the complexities of artisticexpression by focusing on one of fivemedia: sounds, images, words, per-formance, or film. Each course intro-duces requisite historical, formal,and critical vocabularies; examinesfundamental issues associated withinterpretation of the arts making useof these media; and investigates thecomplex relations between artisticexpression and other facets of socialorganization. The courses also makeuse, whenever possible, of the richcultural resources of New York City. Foundations of Scientific InquiryThe Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) component of theMorse Academic Plan is a series ofthree coordinated courses in quanti-tative reasoning and the natural sci-ences. Together, these courses ensurethat every student in the Collegegains a fundamental understandingof how mathematics and laboratoryexperimentation advance scientificinvestigation. While some studentsacquire this background throughcourse work offered in the sciencemajors, FSI courses are especiallydesigned to meet the need of non-science students. Within each of thethree offerings, students are free topursue their particular intereststhrough their choice of individualclasses. In addition to the information on the Foundations of Scientific Inquiryprovided in this bulletin, detaileddescriptions of each year's courseofferings may be found in the MAPbrochure, published annually as asupplement to this bulletin. QUANTITATIVE REASONING Students in Quantitative Reasoningengage mathematical concepts in avariety of contexts in the natural or social sciences. All courses include asubstantial amount of problem solv-ing that requires both conceptualand computational work. NATURAL SCIENCE I Scientific knowledge has its basis inour natural curiosity about the worldaround us and our place in it. Thesecourses approach the physical scienceswith the intent of asking and tryingto answer interesting questions, deal-ing with topics ranging from the ori-gin of our universe and planet to howhuman activity affects our environ-ment. Students consider the impor-tant roles played by laws of physicsand chemistry in biology, earth andenvironmental sciences, astrophysics,and cosmology and develop an under-standing of how the physical sciencesinform the natural sciences generally.Mathematics is introduced in eachcourse with frequent applications tothe subject matter. Predictions thatcan be made only with the use ofmathematics are clearly delineated,showing the powerful role it plays inour understanding of the universe.Wherever possible the courses relatescience to societal problems and develop a historical perspective. NATURAL SCIENCE II The complexity of the biologicalrealm continues to fascinate and chal-lenge modern scientists, who are cur-rently engaged in such diverse pur-suits as exploring the organizationand function of the brain, recon-structing the origin of the humanspecies, linking the multiplicity ofinteractions in ecosystems, and deci-phering the influence of heredity oncomplex traits. The courses inNatural Science II take a nontradi-tional approach to the life sciences,with an emphasis on approaching sci-ence as a dynamic process of investi-gation and discovery. Each courseselects a broad theme that is at theforefront of contemporary research,then uses specific questions andexamples to introduce students to themethodology of scientific inquiry, thecritical evaluation of results, and themathematical tools used to quantifyscientific information. AFRICANA STUDIES 27The Africana Studies Program offers a wide range of courses on the black experience in the modern world, emphasizing the interdisciplinary approach of cultural stud-ies. The program's two main areas are Pan-African history and thought and black urban studies. Pan-African history and thought includes the study of such literary and polit-ical movements as the Harlem Renaissance, the Negritude movement, black consciousness,black feminism, and black intellectual leaders such as W . E. B. Du Bois, Zora NealeHurston, C. L. R. James, Malcolm X, Angela Davis, Leopold Senghor, and KwameNkrumah. Black urban studies focuses on the cultural analysis of black people's relations toa wide range of social, cultural, and political institutions such as museums, public offices,music and sports industries, mass media, the police, and public schools. Black urban stud-ies also explores patterns of black migration, black cultural productions, and questions ofclass and gender dynamics within black communities. New York's position as an international crossroads allows the program to bring prestigious scholars and artists for visits of six weeks to one year. Students, faculty, andmembers of the surrounding community interact with such guests through courses, presen-tation of works in progress, and performances in order to capture the international dimen-sion of Pan-Africanism.PROGRAM IN Africana Studies (11) 269 MERCER STREET, SUITE 601, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687.

The adviser for the minor (inconsultation with faculty from the student's major department) is responsible for ensuring that each student's experience remains cohesive. Nonetheless, this minor adheresto the principle of flexibility and inclusiveness. Each student will build the sort of experi-ence that is most appropriate to his or her needs or desires. This means that the boundaries(temporal, spatial, conceptual) will remain permeable. Each student's course of study isdesigned on an individual basis, guided by the student, the student's adviser in his or herown major department, and the adviser from the ancient studies minor. A number of CAS departments and programs, as well as institutes and centers, are directly involved in this program: Anthropology, Classics, Comparative Literature, East AsianStudies, English, Fine Arts, Hebrew and Judaic Studies, History, Irish Studies, Linguistics,Middle Eastern Studies, and the Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies. The minor consists offive 4-point courses, normally to be selected from the appropriate offerings of the departmentslisted above. All five of the courses selected must be offered by departments other than the stu-dent's major department, and not more than two may be taken in any one department. Students are furthermore expected to examine at least three different civilizations or cultures in completing this minor. Language courses may not be used to fulfill therequirements of this minor. It is also required that students who choose this minor com-plete, as a capstone experience, an independent study course. The adviser for the ancientstudies minor may assist students in designing a project and in finding an appropriate fac-ulty member to direct this independent study. All programs must be approved by theancient studies adviser before the student begins to take courses that would fulfill the minorrequirements.PROGRAM IN Ancient Studies Minor 25 WAVERLY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6790.

ADVISER: Professor Peachin (Classics) 30 ANCIENT STUDIESANTHROPOLOGY 31The Department of Anthropology is one of the country's leading graduate and under- graduate centers for cultural anthropology, archaeology, linguistic anthropology, andphysical anthropology\u2014the four principal subfields of anthropology studied in the undergraduate curriculum. The department considers its greatest assets to be the various indi-vidual areas of faculty expertise: in archaeological specialties such as European, Near Eastern,and South Asian prehistory; physical anthropology areas such as molecular systematics, pri-matology, and paleoanthropology; linguistic anthropology foci such as discourse analysis andlanguage socialization; and cultural anthropology specialties such as the ethnography of NorthAmerica, Africa, India, the Near East, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, Australia, andthe South Pacific. Major theoretical emphasis is on the systems of thought and symbolic rep-resentation of the self and society; the relation between female and male domains of interac-tion; changing patterns of social organization and hierarchy within small-scale societies, urbansettings, and bureaucratic institutions; and the problem of ethnographic representation in filmand other media. Departmental resources include an extensive film and video collection, as well as teach- ing and research labs for archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and physical anthropology, whichcan be used for research by advanced undergraduates. A regular colloquium series and an under-graduate student association welcome undergraduate participation. Formal and informal coopera-tive arrangements with museums and other academic programs in the greater New York area placeat students' disposal a group of anthropological scholars, materials, and internship possibilitiesunparalleled in this country.DEPARTMENT OF Anthropology (14) 25 WAVERLY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6790. (212) 998-8550. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Myers DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Disotell FacultyCharles F. Noyes Professor of Urban Anthropology: GinsburgProfessors: FIELDS OF INQUIRY Cultural anthropology is the study of social organization and the systems ofthought and values that both reflectand inform social practice in differentcultures. Cultural anthropology isinterdisciplinary in orientation, ana- lyzing and synthesizing religious,artistic, economic, and political prac-tices through common mediumof culture. Traditionally culturalanthropology emphasized the studyof small-scale societies (often termed \"exotic,\" indigenous, and/or nonliter-ate peoples). Contemporary anthro-pology maintains such interests butincreasingly applies its insights andmethods to complex, urban, and Program32 ANTHROPOLOGYindustrialized societies. An empha- sis of the department is the ethno-graphic study of cultural, social, andpolitical processes that shape ourlives and those of other people,especially as we are drawn togetherand influence one another inincreasingly transnational and glob-al interactions. The department participates in the University's Hagop KevorkianCenter for Near Eastern Studies, theCenter for Latin American andCaribbean Studies, the Institute ofFrench Studies, the Program inMuseum Studies, the Program inCulture and Media, and the Rocke-feller Center for Media, Culture, andHistory. Linguistic anthropology focuses on how language is interpreted andused in cultural contexts. Languageuse is socially organized; it is a keyto understanding the ways in whichspeakers create and change socialrealities. Studied within historical aswell as cultural frameworks and inrelation to other social institutions(e.g., politics, education, law, medi-cine), variation in ways of speakinglanguage(s) adds to our understand-ing of how social categories such asethnicity, race, and gender are inter-actionally constituted across con-texts, cultures, and societies. Anthropological archaeology is the use of artifacts and other materi-al remains to understand humanculture. It attempts to breathe lifeinto a material record that at firstglance appears static and fragmen-tary. The research interests ofanthropological archaeologists rangefrom the earliest production ofdurable tools 2.5 million years agoto the refuse currently being gener-ated by modern cities. All aspects ofpast human existence, including art,technology, religion, gender, eco-nomic and social organization, andfood-getting strategies, areaddressed by researchers in anthro-pological archaeology. Physical anthropology encom- passes the study of human biologicaldiversity and includes the anatomy,genetics, behavior, ecology, and evo-lution of the human species andother primates. It is linked to theother subfields of anthropology byits commitment to the study ofhuman biology and evolution with-in the context of culture, society,and ecology. Close ties with theAmerican Museum of Natural His-tory, the New York UniversitySchool of Medicine, and the Wildlife Conservation Society InternationalPrograms at the Bronx Zoo facilitatethe department's diverse researchinterests in physical anthropology. DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES Anthropology courses contribute to undergraduate education in twoways. First, the scope of the disci-pline's interests effectively bridgesthe humanities, the social sciences,and the natural sciences. Anthropol-ogy asks basic questions concerningthe origins and development ofhumans and their cultures anddivergent systems of thought, belief,and social order. By systematicallyanalyzing various cultural tradi-tions\u2014contemporary as well as his-torically known\u2014anthropology rais-es critical questions concerning thebases of both world civilizations. Anunderstanding of the distinctive wayanthropology formulates andattempts to answer its basic ques-tions is a necessary component of acomprehensive liberal education. Second, the department offers concentrated programs of study forthe minor, major, or honors student.A minor usually emphasizes one ofthe four subdisciplines. For themajor, the department encouragesstudy in all of the subdisciplines,because each supplements and com-plements the others in presentinghumans as both biological and socialbeings. An honors program includesin-depth research in one aspect ofphysical, archaeological, linguistic,or cultural anthropology. The director of undergraduate studies works closely with minorsand majors students in designingprograms of study that integratesthe goals of individual studentswith the offerings and intellectualgoals of the department and com-plementary disciplines. The department prides itself on its graduate and undergraduate pro-grams' integrated nature, whichenables minors, majors, and honorsstudents to participate in a varietyof challenging graduate courses andseminars. There is an active Anthro-pology Undergraduate StudentAssociation (AUSA) that connectsstudents to one another throughevents and E-mail forum (listserv).MAJOR The major consists of 36 points,which include V14.0001,V14.0002, and V14.0003. Of theremaining 24 points, one coursemust be taken in linguistic anthro-pology. The other courses may beselected from any subfield of anthro-pology. Internships, however, maynot be applied toward the major,and a grade of at least C is requiredin every course to be countedtoward the major. Any course with agrade of C- or lower will not counttoward the major. Majors shouldconsult regularly with the directorof undergraduate studies in order totake full advantage of the seminarsand research opportunities open tothem. Joint Major with the Depart- ment of Classics: An interdepart- mental major including coursesfrom the Department of Anthropol-ogy and the Department of Classicsmay follow two basic tracks. Thefirst track focuses on archaeologyand includes 20 points in V14.0003,V14.0830, V14.0215, and one othercourse in anthropological archaeolo-gy) 20 points in classical civi-lization. The second track empha-sizes the interface of cultural anthro-pology and classical civilization andconsists of 20 points in anthropolo-gy (V14.0001, V14.0030 orV14.0016, and three other coursesin cultural anthropology) and 20points in classical civilization. Seeunder Classics (27) for additional information. A grade of at least C isrequired in every course to becounted toward the joint major.Other joint majors in anthropologywork with an advisory committee todetermine courses. Joint Major with the Depart- ment of Linguistics: The joint major in anthropology and linguis-tics emphasizes the complementari-ty of anthropological and sociolin-guistic approaches to language. Stu-dents are required to take 20 points(five courses) each from anthropolo-gy and linguistics. A grade of atleast C is required in every course tobe counted toward a joint major.Required courses in anthropology:Human Society and Culture,V14.0001; Anthropology of Lan-guage, V14.0017; Cultural Sym-bols, V14.0048; and cul-tural or linguistic anthropologycourses approved by anthropology'sANTHROPOLOGY 33director of undergraduate studies. Required courses in linguistics:Language, V61.0001; andSociety, V61.0015; and Liberation at Homein the Caribbean and Abroad,V61.0026. MINOR Any four courses in the department.The \"principles\" courses (HumanSociety and Culture, are recom-mended as overviews of the disci-pline and as prerequisites for more advanced courses. Minors consultwith the director of undergraduatestudies to design a program thatbest accommodates their interests.A grade of C- or lower will notcount toward the minor. HONORS PROGRAM A degree in anthropology is award-ed with honors to selected majorswho apply for admission to the pro-gram through the director of under-graduate studies during their sopho-more or junior year. Honors pro-gram candidates are expected tomaintain an overall grade average of3.5 with an average of 3.5 in themajor. Candidates for the honorsprogram complete 40 points ofanthropology course work, includ-ing the two research courses,V14.0950 and V14.0951. In addi- tion, students doing research in cul-tural or linguistic anthropology alsotake a Special Seminar in Anthro-pology I or II, V14.0800 orV14.0801, or a graduate course;students doing research in physicalanthropology or archaeology take agraduate course. All of these coursescount toward the major. The honorsstudent is expected to undertake aresearch project for at least twosemesters under the supervision of amember of the department and towrite an analysis of that material ina substantial honors paper approvedby the student's faculty adviser andanother faculty member.

The category of Asian/Pacific American includes people of East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands living in the United States aswell as in other parts of the Americas. This program takes a critical community studiesapproach, which uses field research as the central methodology to examine the relationshipbetween theory and practice and between structure and agency, in the study of A/P/A com-munities. Students gain important analytical skills that will help them negotiate today'smultiracial, multiethnic environment, as well as gain a level of cultural sensitivity that willbe useful to them in any field of study they choose to enter. The two main areas of concentration for this program are urban studies and dias- pora studies. Urban studies examines the formation of A/P/A communities in relation to thevarious cultural, social, and political institutions in urban settings, with special emphasison the New York metropolitan area. Diaspora studies investigates the processes that enableA/P/A communities in the United States to sustain ties with communities throughout theworld. To study these two areas of concentration, the program insists on an interdisciplinaryapproach that takes into consideration analyses of cultural production; social, political, andeconomical processes; as well as cross-cultural conflict and collaboration. In coordination with the program, the A/P/A Studies Institute brings renowned artists, scholars, writers, and activists to campus for discussion, performance, and reflectionwith students, faculty, and community members.PROGRAM IN Asian/Pacific/American Studies (15) Minor 269 MERCER STREET, SUITE 609, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687.

Over the past sev-eral years, biology has been revolu-tionized with the development ofpowerful techniques in molecular and cellular biology that are nowbeing applied to research across thespectrum of the science, from genet-ics and differentiation to biomedi-cine, field studies, and animalbehavior. The department's pro-grams of study and research reflectthis contemporary view of biology. The department offers students the opportunity to explore the vari-ous areas of current biology in anintegrated yet diverse program thatbuilds from a solid foundation of thebasic elements of molecular and cel-lular biology, genetics, evolution,Note: The Department of Biology administers the earth and environmental science courses and minor offered by the College. For more information, see Earth and Environmental Science (49).48 BIOLOGYorgan systems, and population stud- ies. Students are exposed to modernconcepts, state-of-the-art approaches,and current methods of experimenta-tion in molecular biology and bio-chemistry within introductory cours-es taken at the very outset of theirstudies. A variety of intermediatecourses then provides in-depth explo-ration of the major areas of biology,from molecular genetics to field biol-ogy. Advanced students may registerfor graduate-level courses, which aremost often given in the specializedareas of faculty research. Manyoptions are available to create indi-vidualized programs of study, includ-ing a track in environmental science.For more information, see Earth and Environmental Science (49) . Courses are reviewed and updated regularly toreflect the advances made in the bio-logical sciences. This program provides outstand- ing preparation for careers inresearch, academia, medicine, den-tistry, and related fields. Graduatesof the department have a remarkablerecord of success in acceptance intoprofessional schools and in establish-ing notable careers in the biomed-ical sciences. Other courses offered by the department are designed to acquaintnonscience majors with contempo-rary issues in biology. Such coursesare often topical, addressing prob-lems like environmental pollution,limits of the earth, human physiolo-gy, and sexually transmitted diseases. Outstanding and highly moti- vated students are offered specialopportunities for honors work, inde-pendent study, summer laboratoryresearch, internships, and otherenhancements. Exceptional fresh-men may be invited to participatein the department's tutorial pro-gram. In this program, each studentis paired with a faculty memberfrom the department, affiliated fac-ulty from NYU's medical and den-tal schools, or research faculty mem-bers located at other institutions inthe area, including the PublicHealth Research Institute and theAmerican Museum of Natural His-tory, to discuss recent developmentsin biology, readings from texts ororiginal literature, or other topics.The tutorial provides an early expo-sure to original scientific researchthrough analysis and interpretationof the primary literature. The pro-gram also permits interaction withsenior faculty in a student's area of career interest to aid in developingeducational goals. Upper-level students may become involved in research projectsin faculty laboratories through themany formal and informal opportu-nities afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important research accomplish-ment and contains several special-ized research and laboratory facili-ties that are integrated into the edu-cational programs. These includethe undergraduate Molecular Biolo-gy Laboratory, the Scanning andTransmission Electron Microscope Facility, and the Tissue CultureFacility. Field studies are carried outat many regional sites, includingBlack Rock Forest, a 3,700-acre pre-serve for research and education inecology and environmental science,located about one and a half hoursfrom New York City and operatedby the Black Rock Forest Consor-tium, of which New York Universi-ty is a member. The departmentoffers other field courses in biologyand environmental science thatinvolve travel to different regions ofthe United States and to foreigncountries. Students with questions about majoring or minoring in biologyshould visit the office of the Depart-ment of Biology. Those declaring amajor in biology are assigned a fac-ulty adviser from the department;students meet with that professor todesign a program of study, deter-mine course selections, and discusscareer goals. The faculty adviser isalso available to provide guidanceconcerning the many options andopportunities afforded by the depart-ment for curricular enhancement,including research experiences.

The Department of Chemistry has a long tradition at the University, dating back well before the founding of the American Chemical Society at New York University in1876. Professor John W . Draper, the first president of the society and chair of the department, was an early pioneer in photography, working with Samuel F. B. Morse. The department has recently undertaken a major development plan, strengthening its faculty, instructional laboratories, course offerings, and research facilities in the areas ofphysical, biophysical, bioorganic, and theoretical chemistrys. Research areas represented byfaculty include experimental biophysical and physical chemistry, inorganic chem-istry, photochemistry, and organic and bioorganic chemistry. Qualified undergraduates areencouraged to participate in research as early as their sophomore year of study. The depart-ment houses state-of-the-art laboratory facilities for its undergraduate first year and organ-ic chemistry courses. Majoring in chemistry at the College of Arts and Science provides strong prepara- tion for graduate work in chemistry; professional education in patent law, medicine, or den-tistry; and careers in industrial chemistry and biotechnology.DEPARTMENT OF Chemistry (25) MAIN BUILDING,100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 1001, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688.

CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Geacintov DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Adjunct Professor Cutler 56 CHEMISTRYFaculty Professors Emeriti: Boyd, Campbell, Davis, Delahay,Hellman, Underwood, Walters Professor: Cutler Clinical Assistant Professors: Callahan, Halpin Program DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES Chemistry is the central natural sci- ence interfacing physics and mathe-matics with the life sciences. Aknowledge of chemistry has alwaysbeen fundamental to the investigationof the physical world as well as to anin-depth understanding of living sys-tems. Subjects within chemistry range from chemical physics to molecularbiology and include the traditionaldivisions of analytical, organic, inor-ganic, and physical chemistry. In itsrecent development, the departmentis focusing its interest on physical,biophysical, and bioorganic chemistry,exploiting the active areas of materialsscience and biological chemistry. In addition, the department has a largeand active theoretical group in theareas of chemical physics and biomol-ecular modeling. Graduates of thedepartment have found rewardingcareers and achieved distinction in allphases of scientific life, from basicresearch to commercial product devel-CHEMISTRY 57opment. The late Gertrude Elion, a 1941 M.S. in chemistry graduatefrom New York University, shared the1988 Nobel Prize in medicine andphysiology for her research in phar-maceutical chemistry. The department offers the major in chemistry and in biochemistry. Aselection of elective advanced courses,undergraduate and graduate, can becombined to provide a broad, variedprogram of study in chemistry. Thedepartment also offers a number ofcourses for the nonscience studentand service courses for students in theother schools. The programs of studyin chemistry prepare students forgraduate work toward the master'sdegree or the doctorate for careers inresearch, development, or teaching orfor further study in areas such asmedicine, dentistry, basic medical sci-ences, or allied health careers. Inaddition, both majors leave studentswell prepared to pursue patent lawor, with a minor in economics, toenter the expanding field of technolo-gy investment as well as managementin the chemical industry. For highly motivated students or for students who anticipate majoringin chemistry, the department offersspecial honors courses that satisfy thefirst two years of chemistry requiredfor majors and for the prehealth cur-riculum in medicine, dentistry, andso forth. Students need permissionfrom the department to register forthese courses, which are limited tosmall classes. Permission is based onseveral factors, including backgroundin both mathematics and physics;performance in high school chem-istry courses; and, if offered, a place-ment examination. Students may bedeemed eligible to enter the secondyear honors course (organic) based onexceptional performance in the regu-lar General Chemistry course. MAJORS Students thinking of majoring inchemistry, or biochemistry, arestrongly urged to seek course advise-ment from the Department of Chem-istry as early in their academiccareers as possible. Chemistry is asequential subject with coursesbuilding on earlier courses. Delay intaking certain key science coursescan make it impossible to complete amajor in four years without summerattendance. A minimum average of 2.0 in chemistry and other courses requiredfor a chemistry major is needed for graduation in any major in thisdepartment. Students who do nothave an average of 2.0 in departmen-tally required courses by the timethey have completed 64 points in allcourses may be asked to change theirmajor. The major in chemistry builds on a core of required courses in chem-istry, physics, and mathematics. Therequired courses, two semesters ofcalculus and two semesters of generalphysics are required. For studentsinterested in pursuing chemistry onthe graduate level or with an interestin theoretical chemistry, additionalcourses in mathematics are recom-mended. These include Calculus III,V63.0123, and Linear Algebra,V63.0124. One year of intensive cal-culus, V63.0221 and V63.0222,may be substituted for calculusV63.0121 and V63.0122, plusV63.0123. This core provides a basicbackground in chemistry. Studentsnormally are encouraged to completethe courses in general chemistry,organic chemistry, physics, and cal-culus prior to entry into physicalchemistry in the third year. Alterna-tive programs are also possible. Undergraduate specialization in organic, biochemical, physical, ortheoretical chemistry may be accom-plished through combinations ofelective advanced undergraduate andgraduate courses open to undergrad-uates. These courses should be cho-sen in consultation with the Depart-ment of Chemistry. For students interested in prepa- ration for careers in the chemicalindustry, there are several alternativesavailable. The major in chemistrywith a minor in economics gives thestudent training in chemistry with abusiness background. Students interested in careers in medicine, dentistry, or basic medicalsciences may wish to consider themajor in biochemistry. Additionalcourses in biology may be desirablefor such students. The appropriatepreprofessional adviser should be consulted for details. The Department of Chemistry offers the following majors: 1. Major in chemistry: The min- imum requirements, in addition tothe core courses cited above, arecompletion of Experimental Meth-ods, V25.0661, and two advancedelective courses. 2. Major in biochemistry: The minimum requirements, in additionto the core courses cited above, areBiochemistry I and II, G25.1881,1882; Experimental Biochemistry,G25.1885; and Biophysical Chem-istry, G25.1814. Students in thismajor are reminded that these cours-es must be taken in the proper order.Careful course planning is requiredto ensure that this can be done with-in a normal four-year program. In addition to these majors, the department offers several programsand options that may be of interestto students: American Chemical Society Certification: Students majoring in either chemistry or biochemistry maybe certified by the American Chemi-cal Society on graduation. Interestedstudents should consult with thedirector of undergraduate studiesregarding the additional courserequirement for this certification. Program in Chemistry-Chemi- cal Engineering: The College of Arts and Science offers a jointB.S./B.E. program with StevensInstitute of Technology. For studentsinterested in chemistry, the programleads to the B.S. degree from NewYork University and the B.E. (chem- ical or environmental engineering)from Stevens. Further information isavailable Mr. Joseph Hemmesand Ms. Danielle Insalaco in the Col-lege Advising Center, Main Build-ing, 100 Washington Square East,Room 905; (212) 998-8130. Bachelor of Science Degree: Stu- dents who complete the requiredcore courses plus ExperimentalMethods, three advancedelectives in Chemistry, V25.0995,0996; and one course in computerscience approved by the Departmentof Chemistry may elect to graduatewith the degree of Bachelor of Sci-ence (B.S.) instead of the Bachelor ofArts (B.A.). Students should note58 CHEMISTRYthat the B.S. program is very diffi- cult to complete within a normalfour-year academic program and thatit confers no particular advantage tostudents in premedical or predentalprograms. MINOR Completion of any four 4-point cours-es numbered V25.0101 or higher con-stitutes a minor in chemistry. Onlythree of the four courses may also beused to satisfy another department'smajor. No grade less than C willcount, and an average of 2.0 or betterin all chemistry courses is required. GENERAL INFORMATION Laboratory courses in chemistry:Due to the potential hazard of allchemical experimentation, safetygoggles must be worn at all times inthe laboratories. Laboratory equip-ment, which is lent to the student forthe duration of the course, must bereplaced by the student if it is dam-aged or broken. Purchase cards mustbe acquired for this purpose and cost$25. Purchase cards may be obtainedfrom the stockroom during the firstweek of the term. Unused portions ofthe deposit are redeemable. Students who do not return borrowed labora-tory equipment at the end of a courseare charged an additional fee, andtheir grade may be recorded asincomplete and not released until\"checkout\" is completed. Advanced standing: Students who have taken college-level coursesin secondary schools and who haveachieved a grade of 4 or 5 on theCollege Entrance Examination BoardAdvanced Placement Test will begranted advanced placement. Fordetails, see the section on theAdvanced Placement Program underAdmission. However, unless priorlaboratory work is extensive, GeneralChemistry Laboratory II, V25.0104,or in exceptional cases, the FreshmanHonors Laboratory, V25.0112, mustbe taken before taking advancedchemistry courses such as OrganicChemistry I, V25.0243, and its labo-ratory. Advice about the appropriatecourse should be obtained from thedirector of undergraduate studies inthe department. Research: The department endeavors to make research opportu-nities available during the summerand the academic year to well-quali- fied students at all levels. In order toparticipate in research in the depart-ment, students must both meet theprerequisites for and register for theresearch courses Advanced IndividualStudy and Research, V25.0997,0998, or, if eligible, Senior Honors inChemistry, V25.0995, 0996. Ineither case, permission of the directorof undergraduate studies is requiredbefore registering in these courses. HONORS PROGRAM Candidates for a degree with honorsin chemistry must have an overallgrade point average of 3.5 and agrade point average of 3.5 inrequired courses in chemistry. Theymust take two semesters of SeniorHonors in Chemistry, V25.0995,0996. A senior thesis based on thiswork must be prepared and defendedbefore selected faculty.

GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES Courses in classics offered in the Graduate School of Arts and Scienceare open to all undergraduates whohave reached the required advancedlevel of Greek or Latin languageinstruction. Comparative literature is an innovative, interdisciplinary major that allows students to explore literature and literary questions unfettered by national borders and insti-tutional boundaries as well as to understand literature as a unique cultural form through investigating its relation to other cultural practices. In comparative literature, stu-dents develop a multifaceted critical approach that both emphasizes the integrity of litera-ture and expands on the understanding of textuality to include all cultural artifacts andmodes of thought that involve language and representation. The Department of Compara-tive Literature encourages students to pursue theoretical and philosophical modes of read-ing and to understand the importance of engaging texts in the original language by takingadvanced courses in a national literature and studying the practice of translation. To inter-rogate how literature is enmeshed in nonliterary contexts, comparative literature majorsdevelop expertise in relevant related disciplines such as art history, philosophy, history,anthropology, and cinema studies. Comparative literature departmental course offeringsinclude lecture classes in world literature and interdisciplinary studies that provide a tran-sition from MAP into the major and small seminars where students work intensively witha distinguished faculty composed of scholars in African, Caribbean, Slavic, and Latin Amer-ican areas as well as specialists in the European and Anglo-American traditions.DEPARTMENT OF Comparative Literature (29) 19 UNIVERSITY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4556.

ACTING CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Sieburth DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: and other appropriate fac- ulty OBJECTIVES The undergraduate major is designed to foster serious work inliterature at the advanced level,while giving students a strongbackground in critical and culturalanalysis and a keen ability to posequestions and write with lucidityand force. The major provides anideal intellectual site for students todraw connections across cultures, periods, genres, and disciplines in arigorous yet individually designedway. A comparative literature majorcould lead to the advanced study ofliterature at the graduate level butcould just as readily be a strongbasis for advanced degrees and/orcareers in international relations,international law, cultural studies,medicine, philosophy, education,public policy, publishing, journal-ism, film and entertainment indus- tries, and the World Wide Web ofthe Internet and computer software.

The value of a computer science degree in a liberal arts program is consistently growing due to demand for students havinggeneral knowledge and specialized skills. The department offers a computer science major, a computer science minor, and a minor in computer applications. The goal of the major is to train students in fundamentalprinciples of computer science as well as many practical aspects of software development.The goal of the minors is to train students to be proficient users of computers and com-puter software with less emphasis on mathematical tools. Courses combine practical pro-gramming experience with techniques for analyzing problems and designing computeralgorithms. Advanced undergraduate students can work on a variety of research projects with the faculty. Outstanding undergraduates may pursue a master's degree through an acceler-ated five-year program.DEPARTMENT OF Computer Science (22) 251 MERCER STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10012-1185. (212) 998-3010.

The focus of the program is primarily on language and literature and the wayin which these four civilizations have interacted with the Western world to recon- stitute received cultures into modern societies. By intensive study of Asian culture, the stu-dent is encouraged to reflect on the global interrelatedness of human society. At present,three language sequences are offered: a six-semester Chinese language sequence, a six-semes-ter Japanese language sequence, and a six-semester Korean language sequence. Fourth-year study is also offered in all three languages. In addition, various cours- es in Asian culture are offered in the Program in East Asian Studies, while courses in histo-ry, politics, and art are available in other departments. Starting with the summer session of2000, the program has arranged a series of courses at Nanjing University in China. The proximity of Chinatown to the College of Arts and Science gives students access to many cultural events, such as festivals and theatre, that highlight the social back-ground of Asian thought. In New York City, important collections and exhibitions of Asianart are always available to the interested student.PROGRAM IN East Asian Studies (33) 715 BROADWAY , 3RD FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6806.

Park (Sociol-ogy), Trede (Institute of Fine Arts),Vincent (Comparative Literature), L. (Com-parative Literature)Language Lecturers: Goto, He, Hino, Ikeda, Shao Visiting Associate Professor: Goswani Instructor: Wang Program DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES The program has two objectives: (1) to develop a high level of compe-tence in Chinese, Japanese, andKorean and (2) to introduce studentsto the authentic voices of Asian cul-tures through the study of translatedliterary and cultural documents (pri-marily literature, religion, and phi-losophy) created within those soci-eties. Moreover, ongoing study ofthose cultures is encouraged as ameans of acquiring a broad compara- tive perspective and an appreciationof the human problems common toall cultures. The courses are offeredthrough various departments, under-scoring the multidisciplinary natureof the program. MAJOR The program leads to an East Asianstudies humanities major in eitherof two ways: 1.Students may complete Chi-nese, Japanese, or Korean through the advanced level and fourapproved courses from among theCollege's offerings in the geographicarea. Elementary levels I and II ofthese three languages will not becounted toward fulfilling the majorrequirement. Substitutions for thelanguage courses may be made if astudent can demonstrate equivalentlanguage competence through aplacement test; credit is not givenfor placement test results.84 EAST ASIAN STUDIES2.Students who have already completed the CAS language require-ment (two years) with either Chinese,Japanese, or Korean, through a language placement test or accreditedcourse work, are required to completelanguage study through the thirdyear (advanced level II) and may takesix non-language courses related tothe geographic region as definedabove. Although the suggested major requirements of language combinedwith non-language instruction arestrongly recommended and enforced,in certain cases, a student's programcan be individually designed in consultation with the director ofundergraduate studies. For example,if a student prefers not to study a lan-guage in the program, he or she mayachieve a major by completing eightnon-language courses. Note: The recently established Program in Asian/Pacific/AmericanStudies offers several courses, someof which can be used on a limited basis toward the completion of anEast Asian Studies major or minor.These courses are cross-listed as\"8000-level\" courses under the pro-gram's offerings. These cross-listingsare determined on a semester-by-semester basis. MINOR Consists of four non-language cours-es. A language minor can beobtained by taking four courses inChinese, Japanese, or Korean. How-ever, elementary levels I and II ofthese three languages will not becounted toward fulfilling the minorrequirement. A student's minor pro-gram can be determined individual-ly in consultation with the directorof undergraduate studies.HONORS PROGRAM Eligibility: Students must spend at least two full years in residence atthe College of Arts and Science,completing at least 60 points ofgraded work in the College. Stu-dents must maintain a general gradepoint average of 3.5 and a majoraverage of 3.5. Requirements: 1.Completion of the major requirements. 2.An honors paper written as part of Independent Study,V33.0997, 0998, for 4 points,under supervision of a departmentalfaculty member, in addition to thecourse work required of all majors.The faculty supervisor and the sub-ject of the honors paper are chosenin consultation with the director ofthe program. The average length ofthe paper is between 25 and 30double-spaced, typed pages. Forgeneral requirements, please seeHonors and Awards.

A major or minor in eco-nomics is also useful as a background for careers in law, health, international affairs, business management, public administration, journalism, and politics. Despite the fact that the department is large, student-faculty rapport is excellent, with advanced students and honors students working individually with professors. The economics faculty is involved in active research, using the University's excel- lent computer facilities and libraries. Many faculty members are associated with researchinstitutes. The C. V . Starr Center for Applied Economics, directed by Professor WilliamBaumol, bridges the gap between academic research and decision making in business andgovernment. It analyzes issues with important economic and social consequence and dis-seminates the results of its research to the business community through a series of confer-ences, monographs, seminars, and research papers. The Institute for Economic Analysis,directed by Edward Wolff, is an institute that explores theoretical and empirical questionsusing input-output as a primary tool of analysis.DEPARTMENT OF Economics (31) 269 MERCER STREET, 7TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687. (212) 998-8900. WWW .ECON.NYU.EDU. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Gale DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Ramsey Faculty Professor Emeritus: Haines Paulette Goddard Professor of Political Economy: Benhabib Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Clinical Assistant Professor: Kitsikopoulos Program MAJOR In order to allow students to selectan approach to the study of econom-ics that is more suitable to theirpersonal aptitudes and interests, amajor in economics can be taken ineither of two concentrations asdescribed below. Transfer students should note that normally the only courses thatwill be accepted toward the majorin economics are courses that have been passed with a grade of C orbetter at universities with an inten-sive four-year program. A grade of C or better is required for a course to count toward themajor in economics. Note: if a stu- dent fails a course required for themajor, the course must be retaken inthe department; a course taken out-side the University will not normal-ly be allowed to substitute for a failed course. No course for themajor may be taken as \"Pass/Fail.\" Policy concentration. The concen- tration in policy is intended for thestudent who is primarily interestedin the application of economic prin-ciples to understanding currentevents, economic institutions, andthe formation of government policy.The introductory and intermediateECONOMICS 89theory courses provide the student with a solid foundation of the basicframework for economic analysiswith an emphasis on economicapplications. The elective coursesfocus on economic policy and insti-tutions. This concentration is par-ticularly well suited for studentsplanning careers in law, public poli-cy, business, or any other field inwhich a thorough understanding ofeconomic problems and the eco-nomic way of thinking would bebeneficial. At least 42 points (ten courses) are to be taken in the Departmentof Economics, including V31.0001,V31.0002, V31.0010, V31.0012,V31.0018 (6 courses. Of thesethree electives at least two must beat the 300 level and no more thanone may be at the 100 level. A typical sequence of courses is indicated by sophomore year:V31.0001, two electives. Students are strongly advised to pay close attention to the prerequi-sites for each course. Courses withhigher numbers generally requiremore prerequisites. While calculusis not a formal requirement for thepolicy concentration, studentsshould be aware that pre-calculus,or equivalent, is required and that itis inevitable that some mathematicswill be used throughout the pro-gram. Because of this students areurged to take Calculus I, V63.0121,in order to facilitate their trainingin economics. For further informa-tion on these matters, please see thedepartment's summary statement\"The Distinction Between the Con-centrations and the Role of Mathe-matics in the Study of Economics,\"which can be found on the depart-ment's Web site. Theory concentration. The con- centration in theory is intended forthe student who wishes to begin theformal study of economic reasoningwith an emphasis on mastering theanalytical tools. This concentrationrelies on a higher level of abstrac-tion and focuses on techniques ofeconomic analysis rather than on theunderstanding of specific economicproblems or institutions. It is par-ticularly well-suited for studentswho intend to pursue a Ph.D. degree in economics or those pursu-ing careers or higher degrees inquantitative fields such as finance. At least 40 points (10 courses) are to be taken in the Departmentof Economics that must includeV31.0005, V31.0006, V31.0020,V31.0011, V31.0013, V31.0266,and at least one, but no more thantwo, electives from the policy con-centration. In addition, the studentis required to take three electives, ofwhich at most one can be at the 100level and at least two must be at the300 level. Students are strongly advised to pay close attention to the prerequi-sites for each course. Courses withhigher numbers generally requiremore prerequisites. Some knowl-edge of calculus is required for entryto this concentration. V63.0121 is aminimum requirement and studentsare urged to talk to departmentadvisers concerning the additionalmathematics that would be useful.For further information on thesematters, please see the department'ssummary statement \"The Distinc-tion Between the Concentrationsand the Role of Mathematics in theStudy of Economics,\" which can befound on the department's Web site. A typical course sequence is sophomore year: V31.0005,V31.0006, V31.0020; junior year:V31.0011, V31.0013, con-centration; and senior year: threeelectives. Changing concentrations. Stu- dents with permission from thedirector of undergraduate studiesmay change from the policy concen-tration to the theory concentrationor vice versa; however, certain rulesapply. In either case no course maybe taken for which the student doesnot have the appropriate prerequi-sites; this includes the mathematicsprerequisites. A student movingfrom the policy concentration to thetheory concentration need notretake V31.0005 but must takeV31.0006. A student moving fromthe theory concentration to the poli-cy concentration need not takeeither principles course. Transferring between concentra- tions after students have completedany of the intermediate theorycourses is very difficult, more so ingoing from the policy to the theoryconcentration. Students who areunsure about which concentration to take should seek departmentaladvice before beginning their major. MINOR Students may minor in economics in either concentration. A minorenables a student to acquire a usefulunderstanding of economic conceptsand analysis without the samedegree of coverage as would beobtained in a major. A grade of C or better is required for a course to counttoward the minor in economics.Note: If a student fails a course required for the minor, the coursemust be retaken in the department;a course taken outside the Universi-ty will not normally be allowed tosubstitute for a failed course. Nocourse for the minor may be takenas \"Pass/Fail.\" Policy minor. At least 26 points (six courses) to be taken in theDepartment of Economics, includ-ing V31.0001, V31.0002,V31.0018, plus three additional 4-point courses. Students have twooptions after the first year. Theymay either take any three courses atthe 100 or 200 level; or they maytake either V31.0010 or V31.0012,followed by any two courses thatuse V31.0010 or V31.0012 as pre-requisites. Theory minor. At least 24 points (six courses) to be taken in thedepartment, including V31.0005,V31.0006, V31.0020, at least oneof V31.0011 or V31.0013, and anyother two courses that satisfy theprerequisites. JOINT MAJOR IN ECONOMICS AND MATHEMATICS A joint major is offered by the Departments of Economics (31) andMathematics (63). In the Depart-ment of Economics joint majorswith mathematics may only takethe theory sequence. The require-ments are nine 4-point including orequivalents, and five additionalcourses numbered above V31.0200,at least two of which must be num-bered above V31.0300; and (2) nine4-point from theDepartment of Economics. If the major takes one of the eco- nomics courses in the mathematicssequence, the total number of cours-es is reduced to 17. Interested students should see the directors of undergraduate stud-ies in both departments. JOINT MAJOR IN ECONOMICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE A joint major is offered by the Departments of Economics (31) andComputer Science (22). In theDepartment of Economics jointmajors with computer science mayonly take the theory sequence. The set of requirements for eco- nomics is nine 4-point courses atleast one of which must be num-bered above V31.0300. The com-puter science course V22.0444 canbe substituted for one economicselective, and the mathematics courseV63.0034 can be substituted for thestatistics course, V31.0020. The setof requirements for computer However, up to two of the400-level computer science electivesmay be replaced by the followingcourses: V31.0310, V31.0337,V31.0365, or V31.0375; orV63.0022, V63.0024. Interested students should see the directors of undergraduate stud-ies in both departments. Note: If a computer science joint major takes two of the allowedeconomics courses in place of twocomputer science electives and sub-stitutes V22.0444 for one econom-ics course, the total load is reducedto 16 courses, including therequired mathematical courses. HONORS PROGRAM Honors may be taken in either con-centration. Students interested ingoing to graduate school or profes-sional schools are strongly urged totake honors. Generally, a 3.5 overall grade point average and a 3.5 average ineconomics courses are required. Stu-dents are also required to write anhonors thesis under faculty supervi-sion. It is highly recommended thatstudents interested in taking honorsshould register for IndependentStudy in the fall semester of thesenior year as an extra elective course in order to prepare for the honorsthesis that is to be completed in thespring semester of that year. Stu-dents are strongly advised to beginthe process toward the end of the spring semester of the junior year. Itis advisable that the same instructorsupervise their activities in bothsemesters. Interested students should con- sult with the director of undergrad-uate studies. For general require-ments, see under Honors and Awards. INCOMPLETES The Department of Economics expects all students to completetheir courses on time. Incompletesare permitted only under exception-al, well-documented circumstances.To obtain an incomplete, a student must submit a form, obtainable inthe department from the Office ofUndergraduate Admissions, that hasto be signed by the professor andthe director of undergraduate stud-ies in economics; the student shoulddo this immediately. Incompletesmust be removed by the end of thesemester following the incompleteor they will revert automatically toa grade of F. All makeup finals are scheduled by the department in the firstmonth of the following semester. Afee is collected by the department topay for proctoring. Any studentwho fails to complete a course ontime will receive an F, not anincomplete, unless the procedure forincompletes outlined above is fol-lowed. A student may petition foran extension of time to remove theincomplete, but such requests willonly be granted under the mostunusual circumstances. Courses In the list of courses below are thedesignations \"P ,\" \"E,\" and \"T.\" \"P\"represents courses for \"T\" for the theoryconcentration .No designation indi- cates that a course can be taken foreither concentration. The designa-tion \"E\" indicates that it may begiven in either concentration inalternate semesters or in alternateyears. With permission of the direc-tor of undergraduate studies, stu-dents may take courses in the otherconcentration; the major constraintis that such students have therequired prerequisites to enter thecourse. For courses labeled \"E,\" stu- dents may not take the same coursein different concentrations. Economics course numbers fall into four major groups. Core coursesare numbered below 0100.

For description, see under \"Hon- ors Program.\"ENGINEERING 95The dual degree program in science and engineering offers highly qualified and moti- vated students who are technically oriented the opportunity to pursue both a liber-al arts program with a major in science and a traditional engineering program. The program is ideal for the student interested in science and engineering who is also eager fora liberal arts experience before entering an undergraduate engineering environment. Oncompletion of this five-year program, students receive the Bachelor of Science degree fromthe College of Arts and Science at New York University and the Bachelor of Engineeringdegree from Stevens Institute of Technology. Students with this combination of degrees arelikely to find excellent employment opportunities. The available dual degree combinations are as follows: B.S. in biology/B.E. in chemical in engineering;B.S. and B.S. in physics/B.E. inmechanical engineering. Detailed programs of study for each of the curricula are available from Mr. Joseph Hemmes and Ms. Danielle Insalaco, the advisers for all students in the various programs.They may be contacted at the College Advising Center, Main Building, 100 WashingtonSquare East, Room 905; (212) 998-8130.

DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM AT NEW YORKUNIVERSITY: Associate Professor Mincer DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM AT STEVENSINSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY: Associate Professor Manogue ASSISTANTS TO THE DEAN FOR ENGINEERINGSTUDENTS: Joseph Hemmes and Danielle Insalaco Program REQUIREMENTS The dual degree program is designed to meet the educationaland career interests of students withstrong qualifications, as evidencedby their grade point average in highschool and by their performance inmathematics and science. Studentswho rank near the top of their classand who have done well on stan-dardized tests, particularly in math- ematics, are especially well suited. Students should have completed a rigorous college preparation pro-gram, including mathematics(through trigonometry), chemistry,and physics, and exhibited substan-tial extracurricular activity andleadership. Students are usually admitted tothe program as freshmen and must be prepared to begin with CalculusI, V63.0121, in the first semester ofcollege. Students must also be pre-pared to take Introduction to Com-puter Science I, V22.0101; thiscourse requires a prerequisite, Intro-duction to Computers and Program-ming, V22.0002, which may bewaived by placement examination96 ENGINEERINGfor students with prior program- ming experience. Given the highlystructured curricula, transfer intothe program after the first year maybe difficult. Students must maintainsatisfactory performance in coursesappropriate to the high technicalrequirements in order to remain inthe program. Their records arereviewed yearly by a faculty com-mittee, and students are approvedby this committee for transfer toStevens at the end of the third year. THE PROGRAM Students accepted into the programspend their first three years of studyin the College of Arts and Science atNew York University. In the firstyear at the College, the differentcurricula call for many of the samecourses. This gives students time toconsult with faculty at both schoolsbefore committing themselves to aparticular science/engineeringmajor. A typical first-year programmight consist of the Writing V40.0001; V37.0111; coursefrom and General Chem-istry I, V25.0101, and GeneralChemistry Laboratory I, V25.0103,or Introduction to Computer Sci-ence I, V22.0101. Spring semester: Writing shop I,V85.0091; GeneralChemistry II, V25.0102, and Gen-eral Chemistry Laboratory II,V25.0104, or Introduction to Com-puter Science II, V22.0102. At the end of the first year, ifthey have not already done so, stu- dents select a major area for theirremaining two years of study atNew York University from the dis-ciplines of biology, chemistry, com-puter science, mathematics, andphysics. Seminars by Stevens departmen- tal faculty advisers and by profes-sional engineering leaders from pri-vate firms are included in the Soci-ety of Engineering Students' weeklymeetings to provide information tostudents about opportunities in thevarious engineering fields represent-ed. Students should choose theirdesired engineering major by theend of the second year. In the springof the third year, an orientation pro-gram helps students prepare for thetransition to Stevens in the fourthyear. In these first three years of theprogram, students also satisfy theirMAP requirements. In the first yearstudents are introduced to the engi-neering design experience withEngineering Design Laboratory Iand II. In the second and thirdyears, students are required to takeengineering courses, taught byStevens faculty at the WashingtonSquare campus. These courses arethe beginning of engineering studyand give students the opportunityto learn the technical feel of subjectsin the engineering area. The second-year courses are Mechanics of Solids,V37.5126 (mechanical engineering);and Graphics Design and Lab(CAD), V37.5211 (civil engineer-ing). The third engi-neering). These introductory coursesmust be completed prior to enteringthe fourth year at Stevens. These are difficult curricula, and some programs may require summercourses for some students. Stevenshas permitted students in the pro-gram tuition-free enrollment in afew summer courses offered only atStevens (but not at NYU) to assiststudents in maintaining curricularprogress. Students may elect towithdraw from the dual degree pro-gram in engineering and completeonly the College of Arts and Sciencegeneral and major requirements atNew York University. Financial aidand scholarships, housing, dining,and other services are provided byNew York University during thefirst three years. The final two years of study are in residence at Stevens Institute ofTechnology at Castle Point in Hoboken, New Jersey, directlyacross the Hudson River and a shortPATH train ride from New York University's Greenwich Villagecampus. At Stevens, students complete the remaining technical courses, themajority of the engineering courses,and the senior design project in thefifth year. Programs in engineeringavailable to students in the NYU-Stevens dual degree programinclude chemical engineering, civilengineering, computer engineering,electrical engineering, environmen-tal engineering, and mechanicalengineering. In the last two years of the pro- gram, financial aid, housing, din-ing, and other services are providedby Stevens at the Castle Point cam-pus. Separate transcripts are sup-plied by the two schools, and stu-dents may make use of the facilitiesof the career and placement officesof both institutions.

DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER: Professor Schain ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR: Professor Gross Faculty 1999-2000 Max Weber Chair for German and European Studies: Schissler Professors: Gross (Politics), Schain (Politics)Adjunct Professor: Greenberg (European Studies) Visiting Professor: Del Boca (Economics and EuropeanStudies)The following positions are filled every year by visiting faculty: Visiting Consortium Professor, Mar- shall Monnet Professor of EuropeanUnion Studies, and Marshall Mon-net Postdoctoral Fellow Program MAJOR With the help of the European stud- ies adviser, students prepare a prelim-inary program outline at the timethey declare their major. Althoughthere are no formal tracks, courses arenormally organized around the inter-ests of a student in one of two ways:an emphasis on contemporary Euro-pean societies\u2014their problems andpolicies; or an emphasis on contem-porary European cultures\u2014theirideas, values, and artistic and literarytrends. The program enables studentsto organize their courses around apractical or theoretical problem incontemporary European society orculture that is applicable to one orseveral countries. A typical problemmight include such subjects as thechanging impact of politics on cul-ture and social cleavages; changingpatterns of religious expression inEurope; literary expression andchanging society in Europe; the European approach to urban prob-lems; migration and ethnicity inEurope; equality and inequality inEurope; and democratic transition inEurope. The problem, for which thetools of several academic disciplinesshould be applicable, will be the basisfor the major research project. Majors in European studies must have or attain a working knowledgeof a major European language otherthan English (e.g., French, Spanish,Portuguese, Italian, German, Russ-ian). Nine courses that deal withEurope are required: two in history(beyond the introductory level); twoin literature (preferably in the lan-guage of specialization); two in thesocial sciences; two in philosophy,fine arts, or cinema studies; and onesenior honors seminar in Europeanstudies. The senior seminar is inter-disciplinary and includes the require-ment of a major research project (orthesis). A sequence of courses might begin with two advanced historycourses and two literature courses inthe sophomore and/or junior years,followed by two social science andtwo philosophy, fine arts, and/or cine-ma studies courses. The interdiscipli-nary seminar should be taken duringthe first semester of the senior year. Majors who entered the college in fall 2000 and thereafter are requiredto complete a semester abroad. Stu-dents may petition the director of thecenter for exemption from thisrequirement. Students who fulfill the require- ments of the major with an overallgrade point average of at least 3.5 andat least 3.5 in European studies willreceive the B.A. degree with \"honorsin European studies.\" The honors des-ignation recognizes the work beyondthe normal course work required ofstudents in the senior seminar and inthe major research project.108 EUROPEAN STUDIESMINOR All students minoring in West Euro- pean studies must demonstrate profi-ciency in at least one West Europeanlanguage above the intermediate level(French, German, Italian, Portuguese,or Spanish). They must also fulfill thefollowing course requirements: onecourse in modern European history;one course politics,anthropology, or economics(V53.0150, V14.0111, orV31.0224); and three additionalcourses in at follow-ing areas: history;politics; anthropology; sociology; studies;and Italian, French, German, or Span-ish civilization. No more than two ofthese courses may focus on any onespecific country. All course programsmust be designed in consultationwith the center's undergraduate pro-gram adviser. B.A./M.A. PROGRAM This new program offers qualifyingmajors in European studies theopportunity to earn both the B.A.and the M.A. degrees in a shorterperiod of time and at reduced tuitioncost. By taking some of their gradu-ate requirements while still under-graduates, students can complete theprogram in a maximum of five years.In the graduate portion of the pro-gram, students receive a fellowshipthat covers up to half of the tuitionfor the courses required for the M.A. European studies majors may apply for admission to the programafter they have completed at least 32points in the College and three coursestoward the major. Applications arereviewed by the Graduate AdmissionCommittee of the Center for EuropeanStudies, using the normal criteria forthe M.A. program, except that appli-cants are not required to take theGREs. The committee bases its deci-sion on students' undergraduaterecords and recommendations of NYUinstructors. A working knowledge at an advanced level of a European lan-guage (other than English) is requiredto complete the program, and knowl-edge of a second European languageis encouraged. Students must spendat least one semester in an approvedacademic program in Europe, nor-mally during their junior year. Stu-dents are also required to write asenior honors thesis and master's the-sis (see below) to earn the twodegrees. The program requires a total of 19 courses: nine undergraduate cours-es and 10 graduate courses. For thefirst four years, students focus theirwork on a \"problem area\" that willeventually become the subject of theirmaster's thesis. senior honor'sthesis is an integrative project withinthe \"problem area\" developed by thestudent and his or her adviser. It maybe an expansion of a research paperwritten for an undergraduate course. The graduate portion of the degreecomprises three tracks\u2014Politics andSociety, European Union Studies, andHumanities and Cultural Trends\u2014and students must choose one ofthese by the beginning of their fifthyear. Of the 10 graduate courses, twoare required (one a graduate introduc-tory history course, the other a gradu-ate research seminar in Europeanstudies), and two others must be cho-sen from the graduate program's\"core\" courses, depending on whichof the three tracks the student choos-es for specialization. Students are alsorequired to take five additional grad-uate courses in their chosen track. Aninternship, arranged and approved bythe center, is recommended as thefinal course. With prior approval, astudent may take a graduate seminarin lieu of an internship. Each student's program is orga- nized with his or her adviser at thetime that he she enters the program.The first draft of the thesis is devel-oped in the undergraduate Seminaron European Studies (V42.0300),taken in the fall semester of thefourth year. The master's thesis is arevision of this project and is furtherdeveloped in the graduate ResearchSeminar (G42.3000), taken in the fallsemester of the fifth year.

Students at the introductory level examine art objectsand learn the basic critical and historical vocabulary through which these objects may be understood and appreciated. At the advanced level, majors and nonmajors alike havethe opportunity to investigate aspects (e.g., style, iconography, patronage) of the arts in aparticular geographical area at a given historical time. This advanced work, in conjunctionwith appropriate language training, provides a solid foundation for those who plan to go tograduate school in preparation for a career in the arts (e.g., scholarship, teaching, museums,writing). The urban design and architecture studies program provides both a broad, human- istic perspective on the physical aspects of the city and preprofessional training for futurearchitects, city planners, public administrators, and writers on urban problems. An internationally renowned faculty and a diverse group of students share the Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, which includes lecture and seminar rooms, offices, a library,and ample space for the study of visual materials.DEPARTMENT OF Fine Arts (43) MAIN BUILDING, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 303, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688.

The four FCC courses intro- duce students to the modes of inquiry by which societies may be studied, social issues ana-lyzed, and artistic activity explored. Together they give undergraduates a broad method-ological background on which to draw when later engaged in the more focused work of theirmajor courses of study. As a result, students receive a richer education than any single majorcould provide. Through this core experience in humanistic and social-scientific inquiry and its focus on a number of similar readings across different course sections, the FCC frameworkallows students to enter into a dialogue with one another despite differences in their courseschedules, and in this way also encourages lifelong habits of intellectual curiosity andengagement. As they learn the sound employment of the academic approaches at the center of their FCC classes, students develop their abilities to read critically, think rigorously, andwrite effectively. By building these skills and an appreciation of the diversity of human expe-rience, the FCC seeks to prepare students for their continued learning in and beyond college,for active participation in their communities, and for lives in a rapidly changing world. All FCC courses are taught by regular faculty, including some of the University's most distinguished professors. In addition to two lectures a week, every FCC course includesrecitation sections led by graduate student preceptors, allowing for small-group discussionof the readings, close attention to students' written work, and personal concern for students'progress.Foundations of Contemporary Culture (55) 269 MERCER STREET, ROOM 806, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687.

World Cultures: Islamic Societies V55.0502 4 points. Examines the common base andregional variations of Islamic soci-eties. An \"Islamic society\" is hereunderstood as one that shares, eitheras operative present or as historicalpast, that common religious basecalled Islam. For Muslims, Islam isnot simply a set of beliefs or obser-vances but also includes a history;its study is thus by nature historical,topical, and regional. The emphasisin the premodern period is first onthe Quran and then on law, politicaltheory, theology, and mysticism.

Questions examinedin depth include: What variety ofsources do people in the MiddleEast draw on to define their sense ofwho they are\u2014as members of par-ticular households, regions, nations,or religious communities? How dowomen and men construct theirgender identity? In what ways arevillage, town, and city lives beingtransformed? Do people of the Mid-dle East experience their region'spolitics the way it is portrayed inthe West? What are some of thecauses of political repression, armedstruggle, or terror? How did Euro-pean colonialism reshape the lives ofpeople in the region, and how dothey encounter today the culturaland economic power of the UnitedStates and Europe? Readings aredrawn from history, anthropology,political economy, and the contem-porary literature of the region. World Cultures: China V55.0512 4 points.

By examiningproblems such as protective discrim-ination for lower castes and culturalnationalism, it shows how democra-cy involves difficult choices amongcompeting, often opposed, ancientand modern cultural values. World Cultures: Africa\u2014Histori- cal Roots of Contemporary CrisesV55.0517 4 points. Seeks to foster an awareness andunderstanding of vital issues facingcontemporary African culturesthrough an exploration of their gen-esis. Students critically examineeach theme and issue by utilizingthe tools of scholars in various disci-plines. For example, our human ori-gins are explored through the find-FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTURE 123ings of archaeologists, paleontolo- gists, and molecular biologists. Theproblems of governance in modernAfrica are viewed through the prismof political science. Conflictsbetween traditional and modernsociety are reflected in the writingsof African novelists and art histori-ans. Africa's rich musical heritageresonates through the voices of eth-nomusicologists. Slavery and theslave trade are viewed through theexperiences of its victims and perpe-trators. Students come to appreciatethe richness and diversity of Africansocieties and develop skills atexploring issues widely, deeply, andcritically. World Cultures: Native Peoples of North AmericaV55.0519 4 points. Since well before contact with Euro-peans, native peoples living in theUnited States and Canada have spo-ken many different languages, prac-ticed many varied lifeways, andorganized their societies distinctive-ly. To convey a sense of the rangeand diversity of contemporaryNative American life, and to under-stand the impact of colonial andpostcolonial histories on currentaffairs, this course draws uponanthropological, linguistic, socio-logical, historical, and literaryworks. Concepts and images devel-oped in a variety of academic disci-plines as well as in popular cultureare discussed and examined critical-ly. Studies of societies in three geo-graphic areas (the Northwest, theSouthwest, and the Northeast) areused to explore particular problemsconfronting analysts and native peo-ples alike. Some of these problemsare how we understand social andcultural diversity and complexity,differing systems of value and socialinequality, language use, uses ofdocumentary and oral histories, theimpact of urban and rural lifeways,museums, federal acknowledgmentor recognition of tribal status, andrepatriation (the return of bones andobjects of cultural importance tonative people). World Cultures: Muslim Europe V55.0520 4 points. From the early eighth century C.E. onward, Islamic civilization, whichembraced both sides of the Mediter-ranean, made far-reaching and criti-cal contributions to the course ofWestern development. This courseexplores the past and present of Muslims within the boundaries ofpresent-day Europe. It begins byexamining the foundation of theoldest Islamic societies of the West,with particular emphasis on the artand science of Al-Andalus (medievalSpain) and on the early modern gov-ernment and social structure of theOttoman Balkans. Through history,literature, and the visual arts, thesecond half of the course focuses onthe diversity of the modern Muslimexperience in Europe, from Russiato England. It also addresses thedilemmas of self-definition and sur-vival that confront citizen andimmigrant alike as minorities with-in predominantly Christian nation-states. World Cultures: Modern China V55.0522 4 points. As the most populous nation onearth, China plays a crucial role inthe world economy. An understand-ing of China's place in the worldmust begin with an understandingof its modern history\u2014from theQing Dynasty and the Westernencroachment to the recent econom-ic reforms of the People's Republicof China. This course introducessome of the major events, issues,and themes that have shaped mod-ern Chinese society. It is structurednot as a historical chronology, but asa sampling of approaches to Chinesesociety from various analytical per-spectives. The focus is the periodfrom the Opium War to the presentday. Through various social-scientif-ic lenses, we examine issues of war,political upheaval and crisis, socialmovements, the structure of com-munist society, and the period ofeconomic reform. World Cultures: Islam in Asia V55.0523 4 points. Two-thirds of the world's Muslims today live in Central, South, andSoutheast Asia. The course examinesthe ways in which Islamic traditionsspread from the Middle East, thenature of the ensuing dialoguebetween Muslims and adherents ofexisting traditions (Hinduism, Bud-dhism, Confucianism, Christianity,shamanism), and the politics ofIslam today, from Afghanistan east-ward to the Philippines. The objectof the course is to highlight thenature of dialogue and conflictbetween the adherents of Islam andthose of other religious traditions,to clarify the economic and social issues behind conflicts waged in thename of religion, and to depict thedifferent and constantly evolving\"Islams\" that thrive in Asia. World Cultures: New Guinea V55.0524 4 points. How has the outside world imag-ined, toured, colonized, and por-trayed the island of New Guinea?Conversely, how have NewGuineans responded to these eventsand interactions, both by internaliz-ing and contesting external depic-tions and domination? We studythe contrastive outsiders andNew Guineans have narrated theseoverlapping experiences and histo-ries. We approach the topic throughspecific dramas, events, and process-es, for example, first contact andcolonialism, missionization, the Sec-ond World War, and independence.Course materials include differentmedia and modes of representation.We view historical and contempo- rary films by and about NewGuineans, listen to recordings andradio programs, and read writingsby indigenous and non-NewGuinean authors. World Cultures: African, Amerindian, and Iberian Sourcesof Latin American Identities V55.0525 4 points. Coming from an interdisciplinaryperspective that draws on scholarlyworks as well as direct examples inmusic, dance, ritual, and massmedia, this course explores the ori-gin and nature of cultural synthesis,creolization, and hybridity in LatinAmerican and the Caribbean. Itfocuses on the contributions ofAfrican, European, and indigenouscultures in the new syntheses pro-duced through their intersectionunder colonial and postcolonial con-ditions. Students survey a wide vari-ety of such contemporary culturalforms, explore their Amerindian,African, and European sources, andevaluate their genesis under theconditions of colonialism. Througha series of case studies (ranging fromHaitian vodou and Brazilian can-domble and carnival to the MexicanDay of the Dead, and from Bolivianminers' pacts with the devil to thetango and samba), we compare thecreolized cultural formations thathave become central to contempo-rary nationalist or minority identityprojects.124 FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTUREWorld Cultures: The Middle East in the Modern WorldV55.0526 4 points. The histories, societies, and culturesof \"the Middle East\"\u2014a relativelyrecent name for a very diverseregion of western Asia and northernAfrica. Focusing on the period fromthe heyday of Ottoman power inEurope and the Middle East in the16th century until the present, weuse a range of materials, includingtranslated texts, novels and shortstories, films and videos, and pho-tographs, to explore changing formsof individual and collective identity,patterns of social life, and modes ofgovernment. We pay special atten-tion to how people in the regionexperienced and grappled with theprofound transformations their soci-eties underwent from the 18th cen-tury onward, especially the expan-sion of European economic, politi-cal, and cultural power; colonialrule; and the rise of new nation-states. We conclude by discussingthe Middle East today and some ofthe issues its peoples face. World Cultures: Muslim Spain V55.0527 4 points. Considers one of the two examples\u2014the other is the Balkans\u2014of thelong-term establishment of a Mus-lim polity in Europe. Traces thepolitical flow of events from theArab-Berber conquest of the penin-sula and their experiments in state-formation to the gradual emergenceof Christian rivals in the northernkingdoms and the reversal of thetide until the final submission of thesurviving Muslim enclave of Grana-da in 1492. Of chief concern are theconstruction of a remarkable socialand intellectual culture out of thevarious indigenous and importedelements available; how the threeindigestible ingredients called Islam,Christianity, and Judaism fared inthat melting pot, particularly whenone of the others was stirring; andthe problems posed by the notion of\"Muslim Spain\" for Spanish histori-ans and for Westerners generally. SOCIETIES AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES Note that the prerequisite for all Societies and the Social Sciencescourses is completion of V55.04XXand V55.05XX and completion ofor exemption from V40.0002 orV40.0009.Societies and the Social Sciences: Topics in Interdisciplinary PerspectiveV55.0600 4 points. An examination of social phenomenathat cross the boundaries among thevarious social-scientific disciplines.Topics vary each term and may include, for example, human migra-tion, religion, fascism, or colonial-ism. By considering the methodolo-gies appropriate to the study of thesetopics, students learn to appreciatethe characteristic approaches of thesocial sciences, their power to helpus understand such phenomena, andtheir limitations. Societies and the Social Sciences: Interdisciplinary Perspectives onGender and PowerV55.0607 4 points. How does gender structure oursocial worlds? How do gender sys-tems, as systems of power, shape thelives of women and men cross-cul-turally? How do different social the-ories and analytical frameworksallow us to think more clearly aboutthese questions? We analyze gendersystems in diverse societies (Africa;South, East, and Southeast Asia;Eastern and Western Europe; andthe Middle East) and consider theeffects that historical and contempo-rary interconnections among soci-eties have had on gender systemsand women's lives. Topics includetheories of women's status; forms ofanalysis; revolution(China, France, Iran); needs,and citizenship; the politics ofreproduction; women's work in theglobal economy. Societies and the Social Sciences: Interdisciplinary Perspectives onSociolinguisticsV55.0616 4 points. Considers contemporary issues inthe interaction of language and soci-ety, particularly work on speechvariation and social structure.Focuses on ways in which social fac-tors affect language. Topics mayinclude bilingualism; New YorkCity speech; regional and socialdialects; language as a social andpolitical issue; language and gender;pidgin and creole languages, therole of language in African Ameri-can, Asian American, Latino, NativeAmerican, and Deaf populations;the relationship of language to cul-ture, race, and ethnicity.Society and the Social Sciences: Anthropological PerspectivesV55.0640 4 points. Anthropology concerns the ways inwhich people live in society, espe-cially as mediated through culturalprocesses. Deeply concerned withnon-Western as well as Westernways of life and the relationsbetween them, anthropologyaddresses the problem of differencesand similarities within and betweenhuman populations, including theuse of differences to establish orresist power within social forma-tions. Anthropology views such dif-ferences not simply as situations ofthe past but as constantly beingproduced in new global formationsof power and commerce. Studentsexplore how anthropologists usedata to develop basic premises aboutthe nature of human societies andthe foundations of distinctiveregimes of sociality, and they exam-ine theories of social life in theterms of a commitment to graspingthe perspectives, knowledge, andlived experience of social actorsthrough the methodology of ethno-graphic fieldwork. Societies and the Social Sciences: Economic PerspectivesV55.0650 4 points. Economics explores the ways thatindividuals in society assign value,act to optimize the gain of whatthey consider valuable, and seek tolimit the risk of losing those valu-ables. To understand how peoplemake these decisions, economistsmodel the ways that individualstake account of uncertain circum-stances, the limits of their ownknowledge, and the inefficiency ofsocial institutions in which theyparticipate. Topics may includedecision theory, markets, and thehistorical development of economicanalysis. With this perspective, stu-dents go on to consider social issuessuch as voting behavior or fiscal andtrade policy. Consideration is alsogiven to critiques of economics'methods and to discussion of othersocial-scientific approaches. Societies and the Social Sciences: Linguistic PerspectivesV55.0660 4 points. Considers what is known abouthuman language, including itsstructure, universality, and diversity.Explores the notion of \"structure\" inFOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTURE 125language with particular reference to the phonology (sound system)and syntax of languages. Whileother languages are sometimes usedas well, relevant concepts are illus-trated primarily with examplesdrawn from English; nevertheless,the focus of the course is not on anyspecific language or languages buton properties common to all lan-guages and on ways in which lan-guages may differ. Societies and the Social Sciences: Political PerspectivesV55.0670 4 points. The study of politics uses social sci-ence methods to understand theinstitutions that societies constructto address their problems and needs.Topics may include interstate war, ethnic conflict, environmentaldegradation, democratic transition,poverty, globalization, or govern-ment gridlock. Students analyze theinstitutional strategies that havebeen devised to deal with theseissues and examine related theoreti-cal concerns with concrete implica-tions for reform. For instance: Whatis the best way to foster internation-al cooperation in an area where littleor none exists? How can formerlynondemocratic states successfullymake a transition to democracy?How important is an independentjudiciary, and how can it be estab-lished? What, if anything, can bedone to ensure genuine competitionbetween political parties, and onwhat does it depend? Importantquestions of social science methodare also considered, such as the roleof theoretical models in explanation,the status of inferences made fromsmall samples, and the widespreadproblem of selection bias in nonex-perimental data. Societies and the Social Sciences: Psychological PerspectivesV55.0680 4 points. Why do people do what they do,think what they think, feel whatthey feel? Psychology is the scientif-ic study of the mind and individu-als' behavior. It assumes that mentaland behavioral events\u2014normal andabnormal\u2014have biological, psycho-logical, and social or cultural causes.Studying these causes, how theyoperate, and what their conse-quences are yields greater under-standing of oneself, other people,and our society; it may also haveimplications for social policy and for how we lead our lives. Analyzingdata from observations, surveys, andexperiments, students consider thecurrent state of psychologicalknowledge, how it is obtained, andits limitations. Societies and the Social Sciences: Sociological PerspectivesV55.0690 4 points . How can we understand the unique-ly social or collective aspects ofhuman lives? Sociology begins withthe recognition that the lives ofindividuals are profoundly shapedby social groups and institutions. Itmaintains that these groups andinstitutions have a reality of theirown, which cannot be understoodsimply as the product of individualactions, beliefs, and desires; andthat they shape individuals as muchas, or even more than, individualsshape society. Students consider therelationship between individuals,groups, and institutions in particu-lar contexts, examining topics suchas social protest, law and criminali-ty, social policy, the economic orga-nization of society, the arts, andcontemporary conflicts over reli-gion, race, class, and gender. Theyexplore how various social-scientifictheories and methods illuminatesuch issues, and how these insightsmay help us to address importantsocial problems. EXPRESSIVE CULTURE Note that the prerequisite for allExpressive Culture courses is com-pletion of V55.04XX andV55.05XX, and Words V55.0710 points.What is literature or the literary? Isthere a literary language that worksdifferently from ordinary language?What is literary style and form?What is the position of the writeror artist in relation to society, andwhat is the function of the reader?Is literature a mirror of the worldthat it describes, an attempt toinfluence a reader's ideas or opin-ions, an expression of the identity ofthe writer, or none of these? Thiscourse attempts to answer ofthese questions.Expressive Culture: Images V55.0720 Formerly V55.0702. 4 points.What place of art in animage-saturated world? The coursebegins with a consideration of thepower and taboo of images and theways in which individuals and insti-tutions that constitute \"the artworld\" classify some of these imagesas works of art. The bulk of thecourse is an exploration of the visualand conceptual challenges presentedby major works of sculpture, archi-tecture, and painting. It concludeswith a selection of problems raisedby art today. The course is designedto equip students with the vocabu-lary to both appreciate and questionthe artistic \"gestures\" of society invarious places and times. Expressive Culture: Images\u2014 Painting and Sculpture in NewYork Field Study V55.0721 4 points. New York's public art collectionscontain important examples ofpainting and sculpture from almostevery phase of the past, as well assome of the world's foremost worksof contemporary art. Meeting once aweek for an extended period, thecourse combines on-campus lectureswith group excursions to the muse-ums or other locations where theseworks are exhibited. Expressive Culture: Images\u2014 Architecture in New York FieldStudyV55.0722 4 points. New York's rich architectural her-itage offers a unique opportunity forfirsthand consideration of the con-cepts and styles of modern urbanarchitecture, as well as its social,financial, and cultural contexts.Meeting once a week for an extend-ed period, the course combines on-campus lectures with group excur-sions to prominent buildings. Con-sideration is given both to individ-ual buildings as examples of 19th-and 20th-century architecture, aswell as to phenomena such as thedevelopment of the skyscraper andthe adaptation of older buildings tonew uses.126 FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY Culture: Sounds 4 points.Our lives pulsate with patterns ofsounds that we call music. Weencounter these sounds in ourhomes, cars, stores, and exercisesalons. They accompany us to thegrocery store, the dentist's office,and the movies, yet we rarely thinkconsciously about what they mean.This course investigates the functionand significance of music and themusician in human life. A series ofspecific case studies raises basicquestions about how music has beencreated, produced, perceived, andevaluated at diverse historicalmoments, in a variety of geographi-cal locations, and among differentcultural groups. Through auralexplorations and discussion of howthese vivid worlds \"sound\" in timeand space, students and faculty together reassess the value of music in human experience. Expressive Culture: Performance V55.0740 Formerly V55.0704. 4 points.This course examines \"performance\"both as a practice and as a theoreti-cal tool with which to understandtoday's world. The broad spectrumof live performance is explored bymeans of lectures, discussions, andfield trips. Students look at theatreand dance, performance in everydaylife, rituals, popular entertainments,and intercultural such asNative American powwow, IndianHindu ritual drama, off-Broadwaytheatre and dance, African-Ameri-can street trials.Expressive Culture: Film V55.0750 Formerly V55.0707. 4 points.Film is a medium that combines anumber of arts. It lies at the inter-section of art and technology and ofart and mass culture, and at theboundaries of the national and theglobal. Film is also a medium thatcoincides with and contributes tothe invention of modern life. Thiscourse explores the expressive andrepresentational achievements ofcinema in the context of modernityand mass culture, providing stu-dents with the concepts to grasp thedifferent ways in which films createmeaning, achieve their emotionalimpact, and respond in complexways to the historical contexts inwhich they are made. FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY 127Science and technology play such a central role in the modern world that even individ- uals not directly engaged in scientific or technical pursuits need to have solid skills inquantitative and analytical reasoning and a clear understanding of scientific investiga- tion. Even more than their forebears, citizens of the 21st century will need competence andconfidence in dealing with the approaches and findings of science if they are to makeinformed decisions on vital political, economic, and social issues. Rather than striving for encyclopedic coverage of facts, Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) courses stress the process of scientific reasoning and seek to illustrate the role ofscience and mathematics in our understanding of the natural world. The objectives of the FSIsequence are to give students who will not be science majors a positive experience in scientificinquiry and to encourage learning about how science is done. The quantitative component ofthese courses emphasizes the critical role of mathematics in the analysis of natural phenome-na. The courses within the FSI are collected into three groups\u2014Quantitative Reasoning,Natural Science I, and Natural Science II. All lectures are taught by regular faculty, includ-ing some of the University's most distinguished professors, and each course includes work-shops or related laboratory sections led by graduate student preceptors.Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (55) 269 MERCER STREET, ROOM 806, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687.

Quantitative Reasoning: Mathe- matical Patterns in NatureV55.0101 4 points. Examines the role of mathematics asthe language of science through casestudies selected from the natural sci-ences and economics. Topics includethe scale of things in the naturalworld; the art of making estimates;cross-cultural views of knowledgeabout the natural world; growthlaws, including the growth of moneyand the concept of \"constant dollars\";radioactivity and its role in unravel-ing the history of the earth and solarsystem; the notion of randomnessand basic ideas from statistics; scal-ing laws\u2014why are things the sizethey are?; the cosmic distance ladder;the meaning of \"infinity.\" This calcu-lator-based course is designed to helpyou use mathematics with some con-fidence in applications. Quantitative Reasoning: Mathe- matics and the ComputerV55.0102 4 points. The mathematics and physics thatmake the digital world a reality arethe subject of this class. Studentsinvestigate the mathematical ideasbehind how computers operate andconstruct decision-making machinesthat obey the principles of mathemat-ical logic. The course includes a basicintroduction to electricity and cir-cuits, allowing students to makephysical realizations of abstract math- ematical ideas, such as number bases,in order to see their importance to thedesign of computational machines.The transistor, the basic element ofthe central processing unit of thecomputer, is considered in theory andis the subject of a laboratory explo-ration. Students design and constructcircuits that perform arithmeticaloperations, such as addition, as well asmore complex circuits, such as theencoder, decoder, multiplexer andarithmetic logic unit, that are criticalto the functioning of the computer. Quantitative Reasoning: Mathe- matical Patterns in SocietyV55.0103 4 points. Examines the role of mathematics ina variety of contexts in the naturaland social sciences, but with specialemphasis on problems in economics.The course develops tools that spanboth the natural and the social sci-ences, including sampling, growthand decay, present value, and proba-bility and statistics. These topics areused as a foundation to explore theapplication of mathematicalapproaches to economics, especiallythe use of game theory and its relat-ed techniques. NATURAL SCIENCE I Note that the prerequisite for allNatural Science I courses is comple-tion of or exemption fromV55.01XX. Natural Science I: The Cosmos and the EarthV55.0202 4 points. Focuses on the modern scientificfindings relating to major questionsabout the universe and our place init. What is the origin of the uni-verse? How did the elements form?Where do stars and planets comefrom? How did life on Earth origi-nate? How did intelligence developand human beings come to exist?And, are we alone in the cosmos?Evidence for the big bang theory ofthe creation of the universe and theformation of elements during stellarevolution is presented, along with how that evidence is extracted fromthe analysis of light coming from thestars. The constituents of the uni-verse, from the large-scale realm ofthe galaxies to exotic objects such asneutron stars and black holes, arediscussed. The course then focuses onthe earth and other earthlike planets,outlines the evolution of life andintelligence in the context of thesometimes catastrophic geologic his-tory of our planet, and ends with adiscussion of the possibilities forintelligent life in the cosmos. Labo-ratory projects include studies of thenature of light and the observedspectra of starlight, the evidence foran expanding universe, experimentalstudies of impact cratering on plane-tary surfaces and the current impacthazard, the geologic evidence forcontinental drift, and the catastroph-ic causes of mass extinctions of life. Natural Science I: Energy and the Environment V55.0203 4 points. Uses the principles of chemistry toanalyze the environmental implica-tions of energy usage and policydecisions concerning energy and theenvironment. Topics include theatmosphere, ozone and its depletion,greenhouse gases, and acid rain.Case studies from the New YorkCity environment, such as the Hud-son River, are used to focus discus-sions. Finally, the basis of our needfor energy, fossil fuels and their sup-plies, and the available alternativesare discussed. Natural Science I: Einstein's UniverseV55.0204 4 points. Addresses the science and life ofEinstein in the context of 20th-cen-tury physics, beginning with 19th-century ideas about light, space, andtime in order to understand whyEinstein's work was so innovative.Einstein's most influential ideas arecontained in his theories of specialrelativity, which reformulated con-ceptions of space and time, and gen-lowing sequences: College Chem-istry I (V25.0101) and lab(V25.0103); I (V25.0109) and lab(V25.0111); General Physics I(V85.0011); and Physics I (V85.0091) and lab (V85.0092). NATURAL SCIENCE II (V55.03XX) Completion of Principles of Biology I (V23.0011).FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY 129eral relativity, which extended these ideas to gravitation. Both these the-ories are quantitatively explored,together with wide-ranging applica-tions of these ideas, from thenuclear energy that powers the sunto black holes and the big bang the-ory of the birth of the universe. Natural Science I: Exploration of Light and ColorV55.0205 4 points. Color science is an interdisciplinaryendeavor that incorporates both thephysics and perception of light andcolor. This course is an introductionto color and the related topics oflight and optics, including theirapplications to photography, art, natural phenomena, and technology.Science has provided a rich under-standing of visual effects that hasdramatically enriched our apprecia-tion of what we see. Topics includehow color is described and measured(colorimetry), how light is produced,how atoms and molecules affectlight, how the human retina detectslight, and how lenses are used incameras, telescopes, and microscopes.Our investigation necessarily toucheson aspects such as the anatomy of theeye and aspects of human vision thatinfluence how we see color. Laboratoryprojects include additive and subtrac-tive color mixing, pinhole photogra-phy, cow eye dissection, colorimetricmeasurements, and color classificationschemes. NATURAL SCIENCE II Note that the prerequisite for allNatural Science II courses is com-pletion of or exemption fromV55.01XX and V55.02XX. Natural Science II: Human GeneticsV55.0302 4 points. We are currently witnessing a revolu- tion in human genetics, where theability to scrutinize and manipulateDNA has allowed scientists to gainunprecedented insights into the roleof heredity. This course explores thefoundations and frontiers of modernhuman genetics, with an emphasis onunderstanding and critically evaluat-ing new discoveries in this rapidlyevolving field of research. The syl-labus begins with an overview of theprinciples of inheritance, where sim-ple Mendelian genetics is contrastedwith the interactions of genes andenvironment that influence complexphysical or behavioral traits. In this context, we develop the statisticaltechniques used to quantify geneticinheritance or establish a linkagebetween genes and characteristics.Descending to the molecular level,the course investigates how geneticinformation is encoded in DNA andexamines the science and socialimpact of genetic technology, includ-ing topics such as cloning, genetictesting, and the human genome pro-ject. The course concludes by study-ing how genes vary in populationsand how geneticists are contributingto our understanding of human evo-lution and diversity. The laboratoryprojects throughout the semesterintroduce students to the methodolo-gy of genetic research, ranging fromdiagnosing inherited traits in familiesto hands-on explorations of the tech-niques of genetic engineering. Natural Science II: Human OriginsV55.0305 4 points. The study of \"human origins\" is aninterdisciplinary endeavor thatinvolves a synthesis of research froma number of different areas of sci-ence. The aim of this course is tointroduce students to the variousapproaches and methods used by sci-entists to investigate the origins andevolutionary history of our ownspecies. Topics include reconstruct-ing evolutionary relationships usingmolecular and morphological data,the mitochondrial Eve hypothesis,ancient DNA, human variation andnatural selection, the use of stableisotopes to reconstruct dietary behav-ior in prehistoric humans, solving a2,000-year-old murder mystery, theimportance of studies of chimpanzeesfor understanding human behavior,and the four-million-year-old fossilevidence for human evolution. Natural Science II: Brain and BehaviorV55.0306 4 points. This course covers current andimportant topics in neuroscience.Why do so many people drink alco-hol and take drugs? What doesProzac do to the brain? Is the braincloser to a computer or a plant? Stu-dents gain an understanding of therole of the brain and the nervoussystem in such areas as learning,perception, drug addiction, depres-sion, stress, and Alzheimer's andParkinson's diseases. Laboratory top-ics explore brain anatomy, basicneural processes, sensory systems, receptor function, and behaviorthrough hands-on experiments andcomputer demonstrations. Handlingof animals and animal brain tissue isrequired in some labs. Natural Science II: Microbes\u2014 Friends and FoesV55.0307 4 points. Without microorganisms, life on Earth would not exist. Somemicrobes are pathogens that cause avariety of diseases of plants and ani-mals and some cause spoilage anddecay of our foods, materials, etc.,while others enhance our quality oflife (e.g., cheeses, soy sauce, mush-rooms, alcohol and other solvents,antibiotics, biological control ofpests, and formation of fuels andmetal deposits). Most are innocuous;however, the major importance ofmicrobes is their ability to decom-pose organic material and to recycleessential nutrients on which all life isdependent (e.g., biogeochemicalcycles). Microbes have shaped history(e.g., the dispersion of human beingsover the surface of the earth), andthey are models and tools for basic,as well as applied, studies of allaspects of biology (e.g., medicine,environment, crop production). Thiscourse examines the importance ofmicroorganisms to life on Earth (andperhaps even on other planetary bod-ies) and how their physiology, bio-chemistry, genetics (including genet-ic engineering), and ecology, as wellas the physiochemical characteristicsof their environments, influence thisimportance. The laboratory portionof the course provides a hands-onexperience that illustrates how scien-tists study microbes. Natural Science II: The Body\u2014 How It WorksV55.0309 4 points. The human body is a complex sys-tem of mutually interdependentcells, tissues, organs, and organ sys-tems. This course examines themethods by which the body pre-serves the stability of its internalconditions as it deals with changes inthe environment, with the balance offood and water for maintenance, andwith the uptake of oxygen and itstransport by the blood throughoutthe body. The laboratory work isdesigned to give hands-on experiencein measuring many of these parame-ters and interpreting their meaning.130 FRENCHWith a staff of internationally known scholars and teachers, the Department of French offers an unusually broad range of courses in French and Francophonestudies, language, literature, and civilization.

FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARS 139The Freshman Honors Seminars program offers select freshmen the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually stimulating class taught by a distinguished faculty mem-ber or eminent visitor. These seminars aim to introduce students, at the beginning of their college careers, to demanding and challenging standards of analysis and argumentation, oral as well as writ-ten. They do so by means of intensive discussion, papers on focused topics, and reading thatemphasizes critical interpretation rather than absorption of information. Except wherenoted, the seminars do not assume any specific course or background on the student's part.Enrollment is usually limited to 16 students. As a rule, the seminars are given only in the fall semester. The array of seminars changes from year to year. A brochure describing all the fall offerings and their instructorsappears in late spring. Below is a sampling of Freshman Honors Seminars that have beentaught more than once in recent yearsPROGRAM IN Freshman Honors Seminars (50) 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 908, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. (212) 998-8110. Courses The Serotonin System: The Master Regulator of the BrainV50.0201 Azmitia. 4 points. The human brain, one of the mostfascinating and challenging frontiersin modern science, contains hundredsof individual chemical systems thatform interacting networks adaptedfor the survival of the organism andthe species. This course focuses onthe cells that release a small amino-acid derivative called serotonin. Sero-tonin has been implicated in a vastarray of functions, ranging fromaggression, sexual behavior, sleeping,and learning to regulation of hor-mone release, eating, and neu-rotrophic factor secretion. Manymind-altering drugs (LSD, psilocybin,MDMA, cocaine, alcohol, etc.) act onserotonin neurons. In humans, sero-tonin dysfunction is associated withsuch mental disorders as bulimia,depression, autism, Down's syn-drome, and Thecourse traditional biology, chemistry, psychiatry. Readingsand discussions are complemented bylaboratory visits, demonstrations,and films. Exploring Reader Theory V50.0204 Maynard. 4 points. This seminar seeks to develop stu-dents' awareness of the range of criti-cal theories and critical approachesthat pay special attention to the roleof the reader, a universal critical issuemost recently given the label of read-er response theory and criticism witha cognate development in receptiontheory. The seminar seeks not toinculcate one discourse of reader-ori-ented criticism or one practicalapproach to assessing the role of thereader in interpretation. Rather, thestudent is encouraged to read widelyin the theoretical literature andapplied criticism in order to deter-mine to what extent this range ofcritical focus can be useful in devel-oping his or her critical stance. Topicsconsidered include the following:Where is meaning? In the text? Inthe reader? In both together? What do we mean author's intention andhow does it/would it work? What arethe (many) ways in which we canrespond to the text? How is receptionof texts reshaped by changing readersand cultural history? Students areencouraged to experiment with appli-cations of theoretical ideas to theirown interpretations of works of liter-ature and to reflect critically on whatthey have done. No prior work intheory is required or expected. New York City Baseball in the 20th CenturyV50.0206 Prince. 4 points. Baseball is neither a metaphor forlife nor a perfect explanation for theuniqueness of American culture orAmerican character. But sport\u2014and, for some cogent reasons, base-ball in particular\u2014does provide away into an examination of majorcontemporary historical questions inthe areas of race, gender, and class.The Brooklyn Dodgers' pioneeringrole in American racial integrationin the years after World War II, for140 FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARSexample, and the Yankees' early fail- ure to follow suit provide useful lab-oratories for a study of race. Thestrongly macho character of baseballreveals basic gender aspirations andprejudices more subtly evoked inother areas of American life. To theextent that baseball is indeed aworking-class game, fan involve-ment reveals much about the natureof urban class values and tensions inthe 20th century. A full-lengthbaseball-related research paper isrequired. Computer Simulation V50.0207 Peskin. 4 points. This is a hands-on course in whichstudents learn how to program com-puters to simulate physical and bio-logical processes. The course meetsalternately in a classroom and in acomputer laboratory setting. Thetechniques needed to perform suchsimulations are taught in class andthen applied in the laboratory bythe students themselves, who workindividually or in teams on comput-ing projects and report on these projects to the group as a whole.Students learn how to make thecomputer generate graphics, movies,and sounds, as needed for presenta-tion of the results of the differentsimulations. Examples to be empha-sized in class include the orbits ofplanets, moons, comets, and space-craft; the spread of diseases in apopulation; the production of soundby musical instruments; and theelectrical activity of nerves. Studentsmay draw their projects from thislist or choose other projects accord-ing to individual interests. Language and Reality in 20th- Century Science and LiteratureV50.0210 Ulfers. 4 points. The course explores the possibilitythat a common ground existsbetween the so-called two culturesof science and the humanities. Itposits the hypothesis of a correlationbetween postclassical science (e.g.,quantum theory) and \"postmodern\"literature and examined areHeisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\"and the \"undecidability\" of decon-structive theory. The discussion ofthese notions, and their implicationsin literary works, revolves aroundtheir effect on classical logic, thereferential function of language, andthe traditional goal of a completeexplanation/description of reality.Readings include selections from the works of Borges, Kundera, Pirsig,and Pynchon and from nontechnicaltexts on quantum and chaos theories. The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion andState in AmericaV50.0218 Sexton. 4 points. Should members of the NativeAmerican Church be allowed tosmoke peyote at religious cere-monies? Can a public high schoolinvite a rabbi to give a benedictionand convocation at graduation?Should a state legislator rely on hisor her religious convictions in form-ing a view about the legality of cap-ital punishment or abortion? Thecourse divides these questions intothree subject areas: religious liberty;separation of church and state; andthe role of religion in public andpolitical life. It focuses on how theSupreme Court has dealt with theseareas and, more important, invitesstudents to construct a new vision of the proper relationship amongreligion, state, and society in a20th-century liberal constitutionaldemocracy. East and West: Intercultural Readings in Philosophy and LiteratureV50.0228 Roberts. 4 points. This seminar concentrates on fiveAsian classics ( The Analects of Con- fucius, The Tao Te Ching of Lao-tzu, Tale of Kieu, Dream of the Red Cham- ber,and Tale of Genji ) and five West- ern classics (the Book of Job, Oedi- pus, Oedipus at Colonus, Antigone, and King Lear ). Students are encouraged to explore the analogies of themeand character to be found in theworks and to consider how differ-ences of historical and cultural con-text affect the interpretation of theindividual texts. The first set ofreadings concerns men of age and/orwisdom; the second set concernsyoung heroines of courage and intel-ligence. A few of the readings con-tain figures of both types. First Amendment Freedom of ExpressionV50.0235 Solomon. 4 points. Conflicts over freedom of speecherupt into public debate almostevery week. Congress passes a law topurge indecency from online com-munications. A tobacco companysues a major television network forlibel. Press disclosures threaten thefair-trial rights of defendants in the Oklahoma City bombing trial.Although the First Amendmentappears on its face to prohibit anygovernmental restrictions on speech,the Supreme Court in fact balancesfree and open expression againstother vital interests of society. Thiscourse begins by examining thestruggle against seditious libel (thecrime of criticizing government orits officials) that was not won in thiscountry until the landmark decisionin New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. Students examine freedom ofspeech through the prism of a richvariety of contemporary conflicts,including political dissent thatadvocates overthrow of the govern-ment; prior restraints against publi-cation; obscenity and pornography;flag burning; the new law that bansindecency from online services; hatespeech; and inflictions of emotionaldistress. Students read and analyzeimportant decisions of the U.S.Supreme Court. The Special Theory of Relativity V50.0241 Sokal. 4 points. In 1905 a 26-year-old clerk in theSwiss patent office published anarticle entitled \"On the Electrody-namics of Moving Bodies,\" whichproposed revolutionary new ideasabout space and time. Or did it?Was Einstein's special theory of rela- tivity really a radical break with thepast? Or was it an essentially con-servative updating of ideas goingback to Galileo? This course beginsby analyzing the concepts of space,time, and motion proposed by Aris-totle, Galileo, and Newton, as wellas the challenge to Newtonian ideasposed by Maxwell's electrodynamics.The heart of the course worksthrough, step by step, the thought-experiments that led Einstein to hisspecial theory of relativity. Finally,it works through a case study inwhich special relativity is applied:five original articles from the earlyera of elementary-particle physics(1947-1956), which trace the phe-nomenon of \"V-particles\" itsfirst through its subse-quent experimental elucidation to apartial theoretical understanding(still incomplete today). Realism and How to Get Rid of It V50.0244 Bishop. 4 points. Realism relates both to a permanentconcern of literature and art and to a\"school\" that became the dominantFRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARS 141 mode of 19th-century artistic expression. In the large sense, real-ism is accuracy in the portrayal oflife or reality; referring to the 19th-century literary movement, realismreflects the ordinary life of the aver-age person. The realistic novel andtheatre focused on the conflicts andcharacters familiar to readers andspectators by means of artistic con-ventions relating to the credibilityof plot and characters, the role ofnarration, and the function of thereader/spectator. The 20th centuryturned its back on realism througha series of powerful modernist andavant-garde movements that reactedagainst linear narrative and a literaldepiction of reality. Following anexamination of 19th-century realismin the Brechtianepic theatre, theatre of the absurd,first-person singular narrative, andpostmodern fiction. Attention isconcentrated on form and language,on conventions, and on the relation-ship of the work to the reader orspectator. Film viewings concentrateon nonnarrative cinema (Renais,Antonioni). The work of realist andnonrealist painters is also discussed. The Search for the Origin of Life V50.0251 Shapiro. 4 points. The differences between livingthings and the remainder of theuniverse appear so striking that thequestion of life's origin has been acentral concern of every human cul-ture. Answers were usually present-ed as myths, but a number of scien-tists, some very famous, have alsoattempted to find a solution. Theapproach of science usually differsfrom that of mythology, but in the origin-of-life field this distinctionhas become blurred, as prematureand fervently advocated theorieshave taken on the quality of myth.Despite the intense interest in thisarea, an authentic scientific solutionstill escapes us. In this seminar weconsider many accounts of the ori-gin of life--including conventionalones that involve the prebiotic soupand RNA and some noteworthyalternatives. The latter groupincludes an extraterrestrial origin,life from clay minerals, an origin inundersea hot springs, the onceaccepted doctrine of spontaneousgeneration, and \"creation science.\"Using the methods of science andthe viewpoint of a skeptic, weweigh the virtues and drawbacks ofeach idea. Finally, we consider howplanetary exploration of Mars,Europa, and Titan may bring uscloser to a solution.142 GERMANThe department's undergraduate program offers a broad range of courses in the lan- guage, cultures, and literatures of German-speaking countries. Students may chooseamong three majors: German language and literature; German studies; and German and linguistics. Minor programs are available in German language and in German litera-ture in translation. Along with its German language programs, the department offers interdisciplinary courses taught in English, which address issues of German culture, history, philosophy, sci-ence, art, and literature for students who do not have German language skills. An extensiveprogram of individualized study, with flexible credit and meeting options, allows studentsto work one-on-one with faculty members to pursue topics of individual interest. The department sponsors the activities of the German Club and of the Tau Chap- ter of Delta Phi Alpha, the national German honor society, as well as a series of annualawards in recognition of outstanding achievement by undergraduate students in the studyof German language and literature. Deutsches Haus, the German cultural center at NYU,provides a varied program of films, concerts, lectures, and exhibitions. The Department of German places high priority on fostering personal contact between faculty and students, maintains relatively small class sizes (15 or fewer students onaverage), and offers comfortable spaces for socializing, studying, and holding informal meet-ings. Advanced courses and some basic language courses are taught by full-time facultymembers, all of whom are also involved in student advising.DEPARTMENT OF German (51) 19 UNIVERSITY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4556.

HELLENIC STUDIES 155Courses156 HISTORYHistory is the study of human experience of all kinds, considered in relation to par- ticular times and places. It is also a method of thinking characterized by its atten-tion to the contexts in which people have lived and worked. By mastering this method of thinking, students of history gain invaluable skills and techniques. They learn toanalyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence\u2014cultural, social, economic, andpolitical\u2014to organize it into a coherent whole and present it clearly with style in writtenor oral form. In doing so, students also learn to justify and to question their own and oth-ers' conclusions, for history is always an argument about what actually happened. Indeed,rethinking and revising accepted historical conclusions is one of the most important\u2014andmost interesting\u2014tasks of the historian. Notable among the department's areas of scholarly strength are American urban, social, labor, and ethnic history; medieval, early modern, and modern European history; andAmerican and European women's history. The sub-Saharan African, Latin American, andAsian areas are also strong and tend to be multidisciplinary. Through independent studyand the Honors Program, students find challenging opportunities for special concentrationand individual research. The internship program enables students to engage in special kindsof supervised historical projects for credit. Many of the projects are at cultural institutionsin New York and at the United Nations. The University's Elmer Holmes Bobst Library is rich in works of history, and stu- dents also may also use the collections of the New York Public Library, the historical soci-eties and museums in New York City, and neighboring universities.DEPARTMENT OF History (57) 53 WASHINGTON SQUARE SOUTH, 7TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10012-1098.

One course mustbe in a period before 1800. Transferstudents must take at least five his-tory courses (20 points) in thisdepartment. Eight points may betaken in designated related coursesoffered in other departments, withpermission of the director of under-graduate studies. MINOR At least 16 points in history, ofwhich 12 points must be taken inthis department. Four points may betaken in the designated relatedcourses offered in other departments. Note: Students should consult the director of undergraduate stud-ies for possible minor programs,course offerings, and course descrip- tions. A complete listing of historycourses currently offered may befound in the current class scheduleavailable in the department. HONORS PROGRAM Students with strong academicrecords (a GPA of 3.5 in both histo-ry and in the College) may apply tothe director of undergraduate stud-ies for admission to the HistoryHonors Program. If students suc-cessfully complete the program,they will be awarded Honors inHistory, which designation willappear on their diploma. This 8-point program affords qualified stu-dents the opportunity to workclosely with faculty members and toconduct extensive research on atopic of their choice. The programconsists of a small Honors Seminar(V57.0994), followed by an individ-ualized Honors Tutorial(V57.0996). Normally, the seminar(which counts as an advanced semi-nar for the major) is taken in thefirst semester of the senior year,after completion of the workshop.In the seminar students define athesis topic of their choice, developa bibliography, read broadly in background works, and begin theirresearch. A substantial part of theresearch, usually including a roughdraft of the thesis, should be com-pleted by the semester's end. Thetutorial, in which students work ona one-to-one basis with a facultydirector, follows in the secondsemester. Theses vary in lengthbetween 30 and 70 pages, depend-ing on the nature and scope of thesubject. The completed thesis,approved for defense by the director,is defended before a committee ofthe director and at least one addi-tional faculty member. A grade of atleast A- is required for the award ofHonors in History. Otherwise, stu-dents will simply be awarded 8points toward the major. STUDY ABROAD Some courses offered by NYUStudy Abroad and other approvedprograms outside NYU may be eli-gible for inclusion in the historymajor.

It seeks to determine that which is nec- essary in human language, that which is possible, and that which is impossible.While linguists work to determine the unique qualities of individual languages, they are constantly searching for linguistic universals, for properties whose explanatory powerreaches across languages. The discipline of linguistics is organized around syntax (the prin-ciples by which sentences are organized), morphology (the principles by which words areconstructed), semantics (the study of meaning), phonetics (the study of speech sounds),phonology (the sound patterns of language), historical linguistics (the ways in which lan-guages change over time), and sociolinguistics (the interaction of language with society).Current research by faculty members extends across the field: it includes topics in the inter-action of syntax and semantics, languages in contact, pidgin and creole languages, comput-er analogies of syntactic processes, and speech synthesis. Current research among the faculty members includes syntax and semantics, urban sociolinguistics, computer analogies of syntactic processes, cognitive science, contact lin-guistics, pidgin and creole languages, African American Vernacular English, languageacquisition, linguistic reconstruction methodology, and phonology and phonetics.

Numerical Methods G63.2010, 2020 G63.2911, 2912MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIES 199The Program in Medieval and Renaissance Studies (MARS) focuses on the history, institutions, languages, literatures, thought, faith, art, and music of Europe and theMediterranean world from the collapse of Roman authority to about a.d. 1600. It is during this important period\u2014which shaped and transmitted the classical heritage\u2014thatthe social, artistic, intellectual, and scientific culture of present-day Europe and the MiddleEast was formed. One of the largest undergraduate programs in medieval and Renaissance studies in the United States, MARS offers students unique opportunities through the numerous cours-es it sponsors and cross-lists, its Distinguished Lecture Series, and its personal studentadvisement. The MARS curriculum links undergraduates with NYU's outstanding human-ities faculty, with the superb libraries, museums and collections in the New York area, andwith musical and theatrical performances of works from this period that are given regular-ly in the city. MARS also enriches students' intellectual and artistic experience in CAS studyabroad programs. MARS students design their own programs in consultation with the pro-gram director and faculty: they thus experience the intimate guidance of a center of excel-lence within the parameters of a great university.PROGRAM IN Medieval and Renaissance Studies (65) 19 UNIVERSITY PLACE, ROOM 320, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4556. (212) 998-8698. DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Professor Judaic Javitch (Comparative (History), Krinsky (FineArts), and Portuguese), McChes-ney (Middle Eastern Studies), Mitsis(Classics), Oliva (History), Peters (Middle Eastern Studies), Raymo(English), Regalado (French), Reiss(Comparative Literature), Roesner(Music), Rubenstein Schiffman (Hebrew JudaicStudies), Sifakis (Classics), Sullivan(Fine Arts), Turner (Fine Arts), Vitz(French), Walton (Fine Arts), Wolfson (Religious Studies) Associate Professors: Crabtree (Anthropology), Deakins(English), Erspamer Eastern (History), Husain (MiddleEastern Studies), Kennedy (MiddleEastern Studies), Smith (Fine Arts) Senior Language Lecturer: Campbell (French) Adjunct Professors: Fletcher (New York Public Library),Kardon RENAISSANCE STUDIESProgram OBJECTIVES The program offers an interdiscipli- nary approach to the civilizationand culture of the Middle Ages andthe Renaissance. It is specificallydesigned for students wishing towork in more than one field of spe-cialization and to develop majorsaround their own interests ratherthan those of a departmental major.Individual advisement enables stu-dents to develop a coherent courseof study that suits their needs andinterests. The fields of specializationfrom which students may draw todevelop their programs currentlyinclude (1) language and literature:classics, comparative literature,English, French, German, Italian,Middle (Arabic), (5) his-tory of science; and (6) philosophyand religion. In addition to its large and var- ied offering of undergraduate cours-es, the program schedules a Distin-guished Lecture Series each semesterin association with the Center forResearch in the Middle Ages andthe Renaissance (CRMAR), as wellas colloquia and special seminars.The New York area offers uniqueresearch opportunities in medievaland Renaissance studies throughsome of its most distinguished insti-tutions: the Pierpont MorganLibrary, the Cloisters (the medievalbranch of the Metropolitan Museumof Art), the Jewish Theological Sem-inary, and the Index of ChristianArt. MARS students are regularlyinvited to receptions, concerts, andexhibits throughout New York City.Available to majors and minors is the Marco Polo Travel Award, whichis granted to an outstanding studenteach year to allow her or him totravel abroad for research.Majors in this program have gone on to graduate work inmedieval studies, Celtic studies,archival studies, religious studies,history, art history, and English, aswell as to professional schools.Other majors have gone on tocareers in business and in education. MAJOR Ten courses in medieval and Renais- sance studies, of which at least fivemust be in a single field of concen-tration; four or, preferably, threecourses in one or more other fieldsof concentration; and one or, prefer-ably, two courses in an interdiscipli-nary seminar. In addition, studentsare expected to show proficiencythrough course work or examinationin Latin (or another language cen-tral to their area, such as ancientGreek, Arabic, or Hebrew) and inone other language appropriate tothe field of concentration. MINOR Five courses, of which at least twomust be in a single field of concen-tration, one in each of two otherfields of concentration, and an inter-disciplinary seminar. PROGRAM APPROVAL AND ADVISEMENT The director is happy to discuss with students their general educa-tional and career aims as well as thespecific opportunities provided bythe Program in Medieval andRenaissance Studies. All major andminor programs require the approvalof the director of the program. HONORS PROGRAM The general requirements fordepartmental honors are outlined inthe Honors and Awards section of this bulletin. In addition, studentswishing to receive their degree with honors in medieval and Renaissancestudies are required to complete asatisfactory thesis on a topic of theirchoice demonstrating their abilityto control the relevant sources, bib-liography, and methodology. Students who meet the general College requirements must seekwritten approval of the director ofthe program before beginning thesenior thesis\u2014an essay of 30 to 60pages on a research topic\u2014at whichtime a thesis director will be cho-sen. Once the topic has beendefined, the student will meet withthe thesis director to discuss bibli-ography and research plans. Stu-dents will normally take one inde-pendent study during the course ofthe research and writing of the the-sis. The independent study coursewill be supervised by the thesisdirector and may not replace any ofthe primary or secondary concentra-tion requirements for the major.Deadlines for completing the honorsthesis are the following: the thesisoutline and bibliography are dueone month after the opening date ofthe term; the completed first draftis due two months after the openingof the term; the completed finaldraft is due three weeks before theend of the term. This scheduleenables students to compete forawards, honors, and fellowships. STUDY ABROAD MARS prepares and encourages itsstudents to complement their workin medieval and Renaissance studiesat one of NYU's study abroad pro-grams in France, Italy, Spain, theCzech Republic, England (summerstudy only), and Ireland (summerstudy only) or at one of the WesternEuropean exchange universities.

Using New York City as their laboratory, students work to better understand the relationship between people and the built environment. In their course work, studentsdevelop a critical understanding of how metropolitan areas evolve while they examine thoseareas' core problems. The program exploits one of NYU's major assets\u2014its New York City location\u2014in a variety of ways. In many courses, students learn through assignments involving indepen-dent fieldwork, observation, and analysis in both Manhattan and the greater metropolitanarea. All majors participate in an 8-point internship program enabling them to work in gov-ernment or nonprofit agencies while participating in a seminar in order to link this practi-cal experience with theoretical and historical issues. The internship allows students to getinvolved in the community, gain experience in a professional setting, and explore careeroptions. There is an honors program for qualified students that culminates in a senior the-sis written under supervision of a faculty member. The program draws on faculty active in the city's government, community, and nonprofit agencies. The major provides excellent training for students who wish to pursuefurther professional or graduate studies as well as for those seeking careers in the public,nonprofit, or private sectors. It provides particularly valuable preparation for students inter-ested in law, the health professions, teaching, journalism, social work, architecture, city andregional planning, public policy, public administration, nonprofit administration, and com-munity organization. An accelerated B.A./M.P .A. arrangement exists with New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.

DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Professor W TchenT206 METROPOLITAN STUDIESProgram MAJOR Students majoring in metropolitan studies take two introductorysequence courses, four elective areacourses, and four research corecourses, including the internship.The major is structured sequential-ly. With the introductory sequence,the student begins a general, com-parative, and historical overview ofcities and how they change, com-prehensively addressing cultural,political, and economic issues. Thestudent then takes four electivesthat explore particular urban topicsor issues. Thereafter the studentdevelops his or her interests throughan internship in a related area.Finally, two research seminarsenable the student to develop skillsin primary research and writtencommunication, as well as data andpolicy analysis. The introductory sequence con- sists of Introduction to Metropoli-tan Studies, V99.0101, and Crisis ofthe Modern City: New York City inComparative and Historical Per-spective, V99.0103. Additionally,there is a required research core offour courses: Fieldwork, V99.0401; Internship Seminar,V99.0402; Research Methods inMetropolitan Studies, V99.0501;and Senior Research Seminar inMetropolitan Studies, V99.0502.Students must complete one intro-ductory sequence course before tak-ing Research Methods in Metropoli-tan Studies and three introductorysequence courses plus ResearchMethods before taking SeniorResearch Seminar. Finally, studentschoose four courses in three electiveareas of concentration\u2014social wel-fare and public policy, urban cultureand identity, and the material city. MINOR The minor consists of four courses.Introduction to Metropolitan Stud-ies is required. INTERNSHIP PROGRAM The internship complements andenhances the formal course work ofthe metropolitan studies program.Students intern at agencies dealingwith a range of urban issues andtake a corequisite seminar that enables them to focus the workexperience in meaningful academicterms. Students majoring in metro-politan studies are required to takean internship, although many non-majors also enroll. The goals of theinternship are threefold: (1) to allowstudents to apply the theory theyhave gained through course work,(2) to provide students with theanalytical tools to improve urbanlife, and (3) to assist students inexploring professional career paths. HONORS PROGRAM Honors work consists of a yearlong,12-credit individualized researchproject to be completed during thesenior year and conducted through asequence of independent studycourses in consultation with a facul-ty member. Honors students presentand defend their completed researchbefore a committee of metropolitanstudies faculty. For general require-ments, please see under Honors and Awards. Courses INTRODUCTORY CORE COURSES Introduction to Metropolitan StudiesV99.0101 Identical to V55.0625. 4 points. A broad and interdisciplinary intro-duction to the field of urban stud-ies. Surveying the major approachesthat have been deployed to investi-gate the urban experience in thecontested social space of the moderncity, this course explores the histori-cal geography of capitalist urbaniza-tion with particular attention toNorth American and Europeancities, to colonial and postcolonialcities, and to the global contexts ofurban development. Major topicsinclude urban politics and gover-nance; suburban and regional devel-opment socialmovements; urban the gendering ofurban and racism, racial seg-regation, and the politics of urbanspace. Crisis of the Modern City: New York City in Comparative and Historical PerspectiveV99.0103 4 points. Places the public sense of crisis thathas been associated with moderncities such as New York in historicaland comparative perspective. Liberalurban policy in late Victorian Lon-don identified the city as both thecenter and crisis point for an urban-based capitalist world economy.Compares and contrasts the distinctpatterns of urban development andpublic policy from that era withthose in the relatively new Sunbeltand older industrial Snowbelt citiesof Los Angeles and Chicago, respec-tively, and with those patterns in a\"Third-World\" city such as BuenosAires. The second half of the coursethen uses these cities as a contextfor understanding New York City'surban \"crisis\" in the 20th century. ELECTIVE COURSES Teen Culture in Urban America: Dreams, Schemes, and Scenes V99.0212 Prerequisite: permission of the department. 4 points.Focuses on a little understood, high-ly understudied, yet paradoxicallyinfluential force in American cul-ture\u2014the teenager. From unwedteenage welfare mothers to the newlymade \"hip-hop millionaires,\" teensare in the news and on our minds.Who are these people caught in thatinevitable stage between childhoodand adulthood, and how are they dif-ferent from the rest of urban Ameri-ca and from teenagers who have gonebefore them? The course studies thislife stage from many perspectives.Class lectures, readings, and discus-sions focus on themes that exploreboth the historical and the contem-porary political and cultural contextof teen culture. This interdisciplinaryapproach is expanded to include anethnographic experience gained froma service learning internship compo-nent of five hours a week. METROPOLITAN STUDIES 207Urban Housing: Critical Issues V99.0221 4 points. Analysis of the current housing cri-sis in large U.S. cities, with particu-lar attention to New York City.Considers the affordability crisis,institutional barriers to a decenthome in a suitable living environ-ment, why some neighborhoodsdeteriorate and others become \"gen-trified,\" why owners abandon prop-erty, and how housing is built andunder what fiscal and political con-straints. Fieldwork focuses on a localneighborhood as a case study. Law and Urban Problems V99.0232 4 points. Interdisciplinary introduction to thelaw as it interacts with society.Analysis focuses on problems inareas such as housing, zoning, wel-fare, and consumer affairs, empha-sizing the underlying social, eco-nomic, and political causes of theproblems and the responses made bylawmakers and courts. Readings aredrawn from the law and social sci-ence. No specific knowledge of lawis required. Urban Schools in Crisis: Policy Issues and PerspectivesV99.0238 4 points. Examines the changing politicalpurposes of public education. Thepressures placed on school systemsand how they adapt to the demandsof political clients and constituentsare studied in the context of politicaland fiscal pressures exerted by com-peting priorities at different levels ofgovernment. The intergovernmentalcontext of urban schools is alsoexplored, with emphasis on repeatedcriticisms of the adequacy of theAmerican public school system totrain future generations to think andperform well in the workplace. Work and Wealth in the City: The Economics of Urban GrowthV99.0243 4 points. The financing of complex Americancities raises related issues about thechanging character of work in thecity and the organization of wealthand city finances in contemporaryurban America. Examines a diverseset of questions about the forms ofcapital needed to maintain a city,the economics of regional develop-ment, the role of taxes in support-ing services and urban development,the job structure of a metropolitanarea, and the types of incentives necessary to maintain a diverse laborforce. Community Empowerment V99.0244 4 points. Empowerment is defined as thoseprocesses, mechanisms, strategies,and tactics through which people, aswell as organizations and communi-ties, gain mastery over their lives. Itis personal as well as institutionaland organizational. This courseaddresses these issues in a wide vari-ety of community settings. It isdesigned to be challenging andrewarding to those students inter-ested in helping people worktogether to improve their lives. Sexual Identity and Urban CommunityV99.0245 4 points. Through necessity and desire, peo-ple build communities, and forgealliances, in order to work, play,live, and survive. This course asksquestions such as how do peoplebuild \"communities\" in the urbanenvironment based on their articula-tions of gender, sexuality, or sexualorientation? Are gender and sexuali-ty defining features of the urbanexperience? Or are they only com-ponents of a much larger and morecomplex set of urban identities?Students read and respond to manydifferent historical, sociological, andtheoretical writings about a widevariety of issues related to gender,sexuality, and community. Culture of the City V99.0247 4 points. Urban culture is complex, fantastic,frightening, and a part of daily life,encompassing everything fromvaudeville, the circus, the publiclibrary, opera, and dance to the localbar, social club, and graffiti. By con-sidering cities to be sources of cul-tural invention, it explores, throughliterature, history, social science,and student experience, the evolu-tion of high and popular culture,both modernist and postmodernist.Emphasis is on how cultures createbonds between specific interestgroups and on how culture becomesthe arena for acting out or resolvinggroup conflict.Social Welfare: The State and the CityV99.0264 4 points.

Experimental approaches in neural science vary from analyses of mole-cular and cellular mechanisms in nerve cells and groups of nerve cells to behav- ioral and psychological studies of whole organisms. Theoretical tools include mathematicaland computational modeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas of science.Experimental questions include issues related to biophysical and neurochemical mecha-nisms within single nerve cells, functional neural circuits consisting of small numbers ofneurons, the behavior of large systems of neurons, and the relationship between the activi-ty of elements of the nervous system and the behavior of organisms. The Center for NeuralScience offers a B.S. degree in neural science. The requirements for the major include V80.0100, V80.0201 lab), course in neural science and one in either psychology or biology arealso required.

The four main branches are metaphysics (What is the ultimate nature ofreality? What really exists and what is mere appearance?); epistemology (What, if anything, can be known and how?); logic (What are the principles of correct reasoning?);and ethics (What is moral value? And what moral values should we adopt?). Other, morespecific, branches of philosophy address questions concerning the nature of art, law, medi-cine, politics, religion, and the sciences. Everyone tends to have or assume answers to these questions. The aim of the department is to enable students to identify, clarify, and assess these answers, both ancientand modern. Philosophy prepares students for a more reflective life, for advanced studies inthe subject, as well as for professions that emphasize analytic thinking and argumentation,such as law, business, and programming.DEPARTMENT OF Philosophy (83) MAIN BUILDING, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 503, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688.

In addition, the depart- ment provides instruction in political economy and research methodology. Many graduates of the program enter law school. However, the orientation of the department is not strictly preprofessional, and its students are well prepared to enter a num-ber of fields: teaching, business, journalism, government (including the foreign service),social work, urban affairs, and practical politics. The department has an internship program that has helped to place advanced stu- dents with New York State and City government, congressional staffs, public policy inter-est groups, and international organizations with offices in New York. The department alsosponsors a Washington Semester Program for which a limited number of students areaccepted each semester. For details of this program, see course descriptions (V53.0301 andV53.0302), and consult the director of undergraduate studies. The honors program provides an opportunity for outstanding students to under- take specialized advanced work and independent research during their junior and senioryears. For details on this program, see below.DEPARTMENT OF Politics (53) 715 BROADWAY , 4TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6806. (212) 998-8500. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Downs DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Harvey Faculty Professors Emeriti: Wood Visiting Casta ~neda Program MAJOR The major requires eight 4-point courses (32 points) in the departmentchosen in consultation with a depart-mental adviser and completed with agrade of C or better. At least two ofthese should be designated introduc-tory courses (V53.0100, V53.0300,V53.0500, and V53.0700) andshould be taken before completion ofthe sophomore year. At least onecourse must be taken in three of the four fields. Exceptions are made onlywith the approval of the director ofundergraduate studies. A politicsseminar and a foreign language orstatistics course are recommended,especially for students who plan to goon to graduate school. A course fromanother discipline cannot be substi-tuted for a politics course in fulfill-ment of the major requirements. A major may emphasize one ofthe four subfields in political science (political theory, American politics,comparative politics, and internation-al politics); a combination of sub-fields; or a special program approvedby the student's adviser, such asprelaw. However, the followinginternship and reading and researchcourses do politics: V53.0970,V53.0971, V53.0847, V53.0848,and V53.0990.POLITICS 233HONORS PROGRAM to and completion of the department's honors program,students must have and sustain aGPA of 3.5 overall and in themajor. Application to the honorsprogram takes place during thespring of the sophomore year;admission to the honors programpermits students to register for theJunior Honors seminar (V53.0912),held in the fall of the junior year. In addition to other program requirements, honors students writea senior thesis in the fall or springof their senior year. The thesis isreviewed by a committee of at leasttwo faculty members during an oralexamination. Successful completionof all honors requirements permitsstudents to graduate \"with honorsin Politics.\" Detailed informationabout the program may be obtainedat the department. MINOR The minor requires four 4-pointcourses (16 points) in the depart-ment chosen in consultation withpolitics departmental advisers andcompleted with a grade of C or bet-ter. A minor program may reflect aspecial emphasis in one of politicalscience's four fields or subfields such as prelaw. A course from anotherdiscipline cannot be substituted fora politics course in fulfillment ofthe minor requirements. SUGGESTED PROGRAMS The department has several modelprograms of courses in politics andin related departments for majorsand minors with special career orvocational interests. These programsare designed particularly for stu-dents interested in law, graduateand professional work in politicalscience, public administration, andurban affairs, as well as work in theforeign service, the federal civil ser-vice, and in state and local govern-ment. Copies of the model pro-grams may be obtained from thedepartment. THE WASHINGTON SEMESTER PROGRAM This program is sponsored by the Department of Politics in conjunc-tion with American University.Seminars are taught by the faculty ofAmerican University in Washing-ton, DC. The full WashingtonSemester Program, totaling 16points, consists of one WashingtonSemester seminar (either V53.0301 or V53.0302) for 8 points, oneinternship (V53.0970 or V53.0971)for 4 points, and one research project(V53.0990) for 4 points. Only theseminar (8 points) can be applied tothe requirements for a major in poli-tics. Applications may be submittedin October and March of each yearfor the following semester. PRELAW Although law schools do not requireany particular major or course ofstudy, political science is an especial-ly useful field for students planninglegal study and a later career in law.For this reason, it is not surprisingthat, over the years, more law stu-dents have majored in this field thanin any other. The Association ofAmerican Law Schools has suggestedthat among the areas of importancein prelegal education are the studyof the political organization of soci-eties; the democratic processes ofWestern societies; the freedom of individuals; and the art of peaceful,orderly adaptation to change. Theassociation also suggests that stu-dents develop the power to thinkcreatively and analytically. Courses Undergraduate Field SeminarsUndergraduate field seminars areoffered in each field each year. Theyare advanced seminars for juniorsand seniors who are politics majors.Students must have completed fourcourses in politics, with two ormore in the field in which the semi-nar is taken.

The department offers several tracks of study designed for preprofessional students as wellas aspiring physicists. A detailed curriculum is worked out for each student, with individual attention to progress and career plans. The physics major may participate in internationally recognized research activities carried out by the faculty. Some major areas of specialization include astrophysics, atomicphysics, condensed matter physics, and elementary particle physics. In addition to technical physics courses, the department offers general interest courses intended to broaden the scientific background of nonscience majors.DEPARTMENT OF Physics (85) ANDRE AND BELLA MEYER HALL OF PHYSICS, 4 WASHINGTON PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6621. (212) 998-7700. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Farrar DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE Kent Program DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES The Department of Physics offers several programs for majors inphysics, leading to either the Bache-lor of Arts or the Bachelor of Sciencedegree. A minor in physics and aminor in astronomy are also offered.The B.A. major is particularly wellsuited for preprofessional and otherstudents who, while not planningcareers in physics, would like tohave the benefits and background ofan undergraduate major in physics.The B.A. intensive major is for stu-dents who plan to continue theirstudy of physics in graduate schoolor who intend to work in physics orrelated fields. The B.S. degree pro-vides some breadth in other sciences. In a joint program between New York University and Stevens Insti- tute of Technology, a physics majorat NYU can be combined with anengineering major at Stevens. The five-year program leads to a B.S.degree in physics and a B.E. degreein either civil engineering, electricalengineering, or mechanical engi-neering. For further information,contact Mr. Joseph Hemmes, coor-dinator of the B.S./B.E. program, atthe College Advising Center, MainBuilding, 100 Washington SquareEast, Room 905; (212) 998-8130. For students not majoring in physics, the following courses aresuitable for single electives, have noprerequisites, and assume no mathe-matical background beyond the highschool level. Of special interest to thenonscience major are the following:Introduction to Physics, V85.0001;The Evolution of Scientific Thought,V85.0005; Light and Color inNature and Art, V85.0009; Soundand Music, V85.0010; 20th-CenturyConcepts of and Matter,V85.0020; The Universe: Its Natureand History, V85.0007; and Origins of Astronomy, V85.0008. Also ofinterest is Observational Astronomy,V85.0013, for which a prerequisite isrecommended. Physics is the most highly devel- oped of the natural sciences. For thisreason, it is frequently taken as theexemplar of the scientific method,the model for other quantitative sci-ences. Those trained in physics arefound in many occupations. A higherdegree opens the possibility of cre-ative research in industry, or teachingand research in colleges and universi-ties. Men and women with degrees inphysics often are employed in variousfields of engineering. Undergraduatetraining in physics is valuable prepa-ration for careers in medicine anddentistry, computer technology, envi-ronmental and earth sciences, com-munications, and science writing. Itis fairly common for those planningresearch careers in molecular biology,228 PHYSICSCourseschemical physics, or astronomy to major in physics while undergradu-ates. Because of their physical intu-ition, ability to develop abstractmodels, and expertise in quantitativereasoning, physicists are frequentlymembers of interdisciplinary groupsengaged in studying problems notdirectly related to physics. SUGGESTED PROGRAMS FOR MAJORS IN PHYSICS The calculus requirement may be satisfied by taking Intensive CalculusI, II, V63.0221, 0222, or Calculus I,II, Stu-dents who take the Intensive Calculussequence begin it in the fall semesterof their freshman year. Students whocomplete Intensive Calculus I, II areencouraged to take Linear Algebra,V63.0024, in the fall term of thesecond year. Variations of the follow-ing programs may be constructedwith the approval of the director ofundergraduate studies. B.A. PROGRAMS 1.

Decisions by state, local, feder- al, and international organizations influence the quality of the environment, access tohealth care, international development, and the emergence of a global media indus- try. The minor in public policy, jointly developed and administered by the College of Artsand Science and the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, is designed forundergraduates interested in understanding such key issues and problems of the modernworld and in approaches to dealing with them. This interdisciplinary, interschool minor offers students a meaningful cluster of courses in a professional area where the liberal arts disciplines can provide important per-spectives. It also furthers several related goals: it links the classroom to the city, encouragesstudents to apply their theoretical learning, and provides a minor that is coherent and sub-stantial, in that it entails five courses, one of which is a capstone experience whereby stu-dents gain a deeper understanding of how public policies are made and carried out. An executive committee of College of Arts and Science and Wagner School of Pub- lic Service faculty oversees the public policy minor. For each track, a faculty member servesas the adviser to students. For communications and the media, it is Professor Michael Ludlum,Department of Journalism and Mass Communication, 10 Washington Place, Room 605B,(212) 998-7972. For health, it is Professor Gerard Fergerson, Program in Health Policy andManagement, Wagner School (also Department of History, FAS), 4 Washington SquareNorth, Room 541, (212) 998-7471. For international development, it is Professor RomanFrydman, Department of Economics, 269 Mercer Street, Room 830, (212) 998-8967. Alsoavailable to advise students in this minor is Ms. Anne Blatz, a staff adviser in the CollegeAdvising Center, Room 905, Main Building, (212) 998-8130.PROGRAM IN Public Policy Minor MAIN BUILDING, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 905, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. (212) 998-8130. Program The minor currently features three different tracks: (1) communicationsand the media, (2) health, and (3)international development. Itrequires four courses, plus a cap-stone course. The capstone course,taught by Wagner faculty, takes arigorous look at the whole publicpolicy process and builds on the dif- ferent tracks but does not necessari-ly restrict its discussions to them.The other four courses are to beselected from the list of courses forthe chosen track; one of the fourmay be from the list of \"GeneralCourses.\" These four courses mustcome from at least two different departments, and typically, no morethan two from any one department.

It should be stressed that the program is oriented toward the academic analysis ofreligious phenomena and is not intended to promote or endorse either religious belief itselfor the views of any particular religious tradition. The program makes use of resources from several areas of study in the College. Courses may be taught by scholars of anthropology, classics, English, fine arts, French,Hebrew and Judaic studies, history, Middle Eastern studies, performance studies, Spanishand Portuguese languages and literatures, and others. Both majors and others enrolled inreligion courses should consult the director of undergraduate studies for specific informa-tion about required courses and to design a schedule of study tailored to individual inter-ests. Students may also want to refer to the religious studies web site for the most currentinformation on the program.

We seek to understand the full range of social institutions and practices, from couples andsmall groups to organizations such as businesses and government agencies, to the functioning of communities, cities, and nations. Our methods of research are diverse, rang-ing from the quantitative analysis of large surveys to qualitative approaches such as in-depthinterviewing, participant observation, and historical investigation. Whether the goal is to become an informed citizen, an expert in some special field, or a socially active trailblazer, we offer the tools and knowledge to help students make senseof the world around them. Students preparing for careers in law, social service, health, pub-lic administration, and other professional areas will find sociology an excellent major andcan choose from many relevant substantive courses. Those interested in social research andpolicy making will benefit especially from courses that teach practical skills of data gather-ing and analysis. In all of these courses, we encourage students to study issues from a vari-ety of perspectives, to develop a critical awareness of social life, and to use a \"sociologicalimagination\" to analyze social problems and act effectively. NYU's Department of Sociology reflects the scope of our discipline. The faculty includes experts in a variety of fields, including gender studies and the family; crime, law,and deviance; political sociology, including social and economy; education; inequality; community; social theory; and culture.

Women's studies assumes that sexual asym-metry (the belief that men are \"better\" than women) is a human construct requiring analysis. The excitement of women's studies is the challenge it poses to a tradi-tional academic curriculum. The world looks quite different when women are at the centerrather than marginalized. New York University's Program in Women's Studies offers students an opportu- nity and two questions. The opportunity: to study the lives and works of women through-out history and across cultures and to examine assumptions about gender from a varietyof critical perspectives. The questions: Are all our beliefs about women and men, eventhose we're sure are \"natural,\" really social constructions? Do \"women\" and \"men\" reallyexist at all?PROGRAM IN Women's Studies (97) CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF GENDER AND SEXUALITY , 285 MERCER STREET, 3RD FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6653. (212) 992-9541.

The women's studies major typi- cally requires 48 points (12 courses).Some students, however, may com-plete their B.A. requirements withonly 40 points (10 courses). Themajor requires 32 points in women'sstudies (across at least three disci-plines that are not the discipline ofthe student's departmental concen- tration) and 16 points in the stu-dent's departmental concentration.Because 8 of these points may over-lap (V97.0021, for instance, maycount toward both the women'sstudies major and a concentration insociology), some students will com-plete the major with 40 points. All majors must complete Intro- duction to Women's Studies,V97.0010, and Senior Seminar:Feminist Theory, V97.0999.Because of the interdisciplinarynature of feminist scholarship, remaining women's studies electivesmust be drawn from at least threedifferent departments.

ARREARS POLICY The University reserves the right todeny registration and withhold allinformation regarding the record ofany student who is in arrears in thepayment of tuition, fees, loans, orother charges (including charges forhousing, dining, or other activitiesor services) for as long as any arrearsremain. The unpaid balance of a stu- dent's account is subject to an inter-est charge of 12 percent per annumfrom the first day of class until pay-ment is received. GRADUATION POLICY No candidate may be recommendedfor a degree until all outstandingbills have been paid. The Universitycannot be responsible for the inclu-sion in the current official gradua-tion list of any candidate who paysfees after the first day of May, Sep-tember, or January for degrees inMay, September, or January, respec-tively. Following the payment of allrequired fees and on approval of thefaculty, the candidate will be recom-mended for the degree as of the dateof the next regular meeting of theUniversity Board of Trustees atwhich the awarding of degrees is apart of the order of business. WITHDRAWAL AND REFUND OF TUITION A student who for any reason finds it impossible to complete a coursefor which he or she has registeredshould consult with an academicadviser in the College AdvisingCenter, Main Building, Room 905,and file a completed Change of Pro-gram form with the Bursar's Office.(Note: An official withdrawal mustbe filed if a course has been can-celed, and, in this case, the studentis entitled to a refund of tuition andfees paid.) Withdrawal does not nec-essarily entitle the student to arefund of tuition paid or a cancella-tion of tuition still due. A refund oftuition will be made provided suchwithdrawal is filed within thescheduled refund period for theterm (see schedule below). Merely ceasing to attend a class does not constitute official with-drawal, nor does notification to theinstructor. A stop payment of acheck presented for tuition does not constitute withdrawal, nor does itreduce the indebtedness to the Uni-versity. The nonreturnable registra-tion fee and a penalty fee of $10.00for a stopped payment must becharged in addition to any tuitionnot canceled. The date on which the Change of Program form is filed, not thelast date of attendance in class, isconsidered the official date of thestudent's withdrawal. It is this datethat serves as the basis for comput-ing any refund granted the student. The refund period (see schedule below) is defined as the first fourcalendar weeks of the term forwhich application for withdrawal isfiled. The processing of refundstakes approximately four weeks. REFUND PERIOD SCHEDULE (FALL AND SPRING TERMS ONLY) This schedule is based on the totalapplicable charge for tuition,excluding nonreturnable fees anddeposits. Withdrawal before the official opening date of the term: 100% Withdrawal within the first calendar week from theopening date of the term: 100% The first calendar week consists of the first seven (7) calendar days beginningwith the official opening date of theterm. (Note: not the first day of the class meeting.) Withdrawal within the second calendar week from theopening date of the term: 70% Withdrawal within the third calendar week from theopening date of the term: 55% Withdrawal within the fourth calendar week from theopening date of the term: 25% Withdrawal after completion of the fourth calendar weekof the term: NONE The above refund schedule is not applicable to students whose regis-tration remains within the flat-fee range. 1Students automatically enrolled in the Basic Plan or the Comprehensive Plan can changebetween plans, waive the plan entirely (andshow proof of other acceptable health insur-ance), or select the UHC Only plan.282 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AIDNote: A student may not with- draw from a class after the ninthweek of the fall or spring semesteror the last two weeks of each sum-mer session. It should be noted that the registration and services fee is in no case returnable. Refunds granted for credit card charges will be credited to thoseaccounts. Exceptions to the published refund schedule may be appealed inwriting to the refund committee inthe College Advising Center, MainBuilding, Room 905, and should besupported by appropriate documen-tation regarding the circumstances that warrant consideration of anexception. Federal regulations require adjustments reducing financial aid ifa student withdraws even after theNYU refund period. Financial aidamounts will be adjusted for stu-dents who withdraw through theninth week of the semester and havereceived any federal grants or loans.This adjustment may result in thestudent's bill not being fully paid.NYU will bill the student for thisdifference. The student will beresponsible for payment of this billbefore returning to NYU and will remain responsible for payment evenif he or she does not return to NYU. For any semester a student receives any aid, that semester will becounted in the satisfactory academicprogress standard. This may requirethe student to make up credits beforereceiving any further aid. Pleasereview the \"satisfactory academicprogress\" standard for your school soyou do not jeopardize future semes-ters of aid. Students who withdrawshould review the \"Refund\" page on the NYU Office of the Bu rsar Web site (www.nyu.edu/bursar). Financial Aid New York University believes thatstudents should be able to choosethe college that offers them the bestrange of educational opportunities.In order to make that choice possi-ble, New York University attemptsto aid students who are in need offinancial assistance. Financial aid is awarded in an effort to help students meet the dif-ference between their own resourcesand the cost of education. Allawards are subject to availability offunds and the student's demonstrat-ed need. Renewal of assistancedepends on annual reevaluation of astudent's need, the availability offunds, the successful completion ofthe previous year, and satisfactoryprogress toward completion ofdegree requirements. In addition,students must meet the publishedfiling deadlines. Detailed informa-tion on financial aid is forwardedwith the admission application (andsee also the Office of Financial Aidat www.nyu.edu/financial.aid ). Many awards are granted purely on the basis of scholastic merit.Others are based on financial need.However, it is frequently possible toreceive a combination of awardsbased on both. Thus Universityscholarships or fellowships may begranted by themselves or in con-junction with student loans or Fed-eral Work-Study employment. Toensure that maximum sources ofavailable support will be investigat-ed, students must apply for financialaid by the appropriate deadline. Student responsibilities. It is the student's responsibility to sup-ply true, accurate, and completeinformation and to inform theOffice of Financial Aid immediatelyof any change in his or her financial situation, including the offer of jobsor outside grants, once applicationhas been made. A student who has received a financial aid award must inform his or her department and the Office ofFinancial Aid if he or she subse-quently decides to decline all or partof that award. To neglect to do soprevents use of the award by anotherstudent. If a student has not claimedhis or her award by the close of reg-ular (not late) registration and hasnot obtained written permissionfrom his or her department and theOffice of Financial Aid for an exten-sion, the award may be canceled,and the student may become ineli-gible to receive scholarship or fel-lowship aid in future years. Determination of financial need is also based on the number ofcourses for which the student indi-cates he or she intends to register. A change in registration thereforemay necessitate an adjustment infinancial aid. HOW TO APPLY Students must submit the FreeApplication for Federal Student Aid(FAFSA), and later, New York Stateresidents must also complete thepreprinted New York State TuitionAssistance Program (TAP) applica-tion, which is mailed automaticallyto the student by the New YorkState Higher Education ServicesCorporation (HESC) after the FAFSAis processed. The FAFSA is the basicform for all student aid programs; besure to complete all sections. Stu-dents should give permission on theFAFSA for application data to besent to New York University (the NYU federal code number is002785). Note: There is no separate application for NYU scholarships.All students are automatically con-sidered for academic (merit-based)and financial need-based scholarshipsafter applying for admission andfinancial aid. The FAFSA and theadmissions application contain allthe information needed for scholar-ship determination. Students are encouraged to apply for financial aid electronically\u2014thefastest and most accurate method.Information is transmitted directly tothe U.S. Department of Education andeliminates the additional processingtime and potential error associatedwith a traditional paper FAFSA. Theprocess is quicker and better for boththe student and New York Universi-ty. See www.nyu.edu/financial.aid. The FAFSA is also available from the student's current high school orinstitution or from the Office ofFinancial Aid, New York Universi-ty, 25 West Fourth Street, NewYork, NY 10012-1119. Entering freshmen should submit the applica-tion by February 15 for the fall termor by November 1 for the springterm. Continuing undergraduatestudents should consult the Finan-cial Aid Web site for information.For returning undergraduates, thedeadline for the government toreceive the \"Renewal FAFSA on theWeb\" is March 1. Students requiring summer financial aid must submit a summeraid application in addition to theFAFSA and TAP application. The application becomes available inFebruary and can be obtained fromthe Financial Aid Web site or theTUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID 283Office of Financial Aid. Complete all applications at least 12 weeksbefore the beginning of the term inwhich funds are needed. ELIGIBILITY To be considered for financial aid, students must be officially admittedto NYU or matriculated in a degreeprogram and making satisfactoryacademic progress toward degreerequirements.

Therefore, students areencouraged to pursue a major ofheartfelt interest, to participate inextracurricular activities of theirchoosing, and to develop intellectu-al pursuits and hobbies outsidetheir schoolwork. Additionally, allprehealth students are very stronglyencouraged to get either paid orvolunteer work experience in thearea they would like to follow. The reason for this experience is twofold: students will be able tomake an intelligent decision aboutwhether or not they should pursuethis profession, and admissionscommittees can see that an appli-cant is dedicated enough to find outabout a particular profession andthat he or she has made an attemptto become aware of both its positiveand its negative aspects. The College's Preprofessional Advisement Office, Main Building,Room 901, telephone: (212) 998-8160, has an extensive evaluationprocess that enables the chair of theCommittee on Recommendations toSchools of the Health Professions towrite a letter of recommendationusing information from as manysources as possible. Students fill outevaluation forms each semester.Additionally, students preparing for the admissions tests and subsequentapplication undergo an extensiveinterview process during the springsemester before application. Stu-dents are encouraged to keep intouch with the PreprofessionalAdvisement Office so that they areinformed about deadlines for theevaluation procedures. Any student even remotely con- sidering a career in one of thehealth professions is strongly urgedto see an adviser in the Preprofes-sional Advisement Office as early aspossible. Being \"premed\" is not amajor, does not affect earning one'sdegree, and is not an irrevocablecommitment should the studentchange his or her mind. The Pre-professional Advisement Office willalso help students from other NYUdivisions who wish to follow a pre-health curriculum. Much moredetailed information about theundergraduate experience as a prehealth student, about health professional schools, and about theapplication process is available inthe Preprofessional AdvisementOffice. Advisers there can help students at every stage of their pre-health careers.PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS 311Accelerated and Joint ProgramsB.A./M.D. PROGRAM The B.A./M.D. program is an eight- year joint program between the Col-lege of Arts and Science and theSchool of Medicine at New YorkUniversity.

A full-time schedulenormally consists of 16 points perterm, or 32 points per year, whichenables a student to complete theentire program of 128 points in fouryears. Minimal full-time statusentails completing at least 12 pointsper term or 24 points per year. Stu-dents who wish to attend part timeshould obtain permission from theOffice of the Associate Dean for Stu-dents. Such status will be grantedonly when there is good and suffi-cient reason for part-time study. Fail-ure to complete a minimum of 24points per year jeopardizes a student'sfull-time status and his or her eligi-bility to receive financial aid. A student who has not yet attained senior standing may notregister for more than 18 points perterm without the approval of anadviser in the College AdvisingCenter. Change of program. To make any changes in their program,including dropping or adding cours-es given in other divisions of theUniversity, students must accessAlbert at www.albert.nyu.edu or callTorchTone at (212) 995-4747 or file a Change of Program form in theStudent Services Center, 25 WestFourth Street.Adding courses. The deadline for the adding of a course or a sec-tion is the end of the second week ofthe semester. The deadline applies toany course added by a College ofArts and Science student and to anyCollege of Arts and Science courseadded by students from other divi-sions. The adding of any course orsection after the end of the secondweek is generally allowed only whenthe student is changing levels with-in a discipline\u2014for example, from aFrench or mathematics course to ahigher- or lower-level course in thesame discipline. The addition is per-mitted only with the writtenapproval of both the instructor andan adviser in the College AdvisingCenter. Withdrawing from courses. Students are expected to maintain afull-time program as describedabove. Occasionally, they may with-draw from a course if, because ofreasons beyond their control, they cannot continue. Courses droppedduring the first three weeks of theterm will not appear on the transcript. Those dropped from thebeginning of the fourth weekthrough the ninth week of the termwill be recorded with a grade of W .After the ninth week, no one maywithdraw from a course. Studentswho are ill or have a serious personalproblem should see, call, or write toan adviser in the College AdvisingCenter, College of Arts and Science, New York University, Main Build-ing, 100 Washington Square East,Room 905, New York, NY 10003-6688; (212) 998-8130. Complete withdrawals. Stu- dents who wish to withdraw fromall their courses must make anappointment for an interview withan adviser in the College AdvisingCenter. A student who withdraws offi- cially from all courses in a termmay register for the following term.If the student is unable to attendthe College during the term follow-ing the withdrawal, he or sheshould request a leave of absencefrom an adviser in the CollegeAdvising Center. For more informa-tion, see \"Attendance,\" below. Auditing. Matriculated stu- dents in the College may audit (i.e.,attend lectures without intendingto receive credit) any course in theCollege with the consent of, andunder the conditions established by,the instructor and the department.Auditors may not preempt spacerequired for registered students. A student cannot register as an auditor, and audited courses willnot appear on the student's officialtranscript. Special (nondegree) stu-dents may not audit courses. AttendanceAlthough the administration of theCollege does not supervise atten-dance of classes, it supports thestandards imposed by instructors. Students who, in the judgment of the instructor, have not substan-tially met the requirements of thecourse or who have been excessivelyabsent may be considered to havewithdrawn unofficially and may begiven the final grade of F. See\"Withdrawing from courses,\" above.RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS AND ATTENDANCE New York University, as a nonsec- tarian institution, adheres to thegeneral policy of including in itsofficial calendar only certain legalholidays. However, it has also longbeen University policy that mem-bers of any religious group may,without penalty, absent themselvesfrom classes when compliance withtheir religious obligations requiresit. In 1988, the University Senateaffirmed this policy and passed a resolution that elaborated on it asfollows: 1.Students who anticipate being absent because of any religiousobservance should, whenever possi-ble, notify faculty in advance ofsuch anticipated absence. 2.Whenever feasible, examina- tions and assignment deadlinesshould not be scheduled on reli-gious holidays. Any student absentfrom class because of religiousACADEMIC POLICIES 323Credit CREDIT FOR ADVANCED PLACEMENT EXAMINATIONS The College participates in the Advanced Placement Program of theCollege Entrance ExaminationBoard. Students who have takenAdvanced Placement exams while inhigh school should have the Educa-tional Testing Service in Princetonforward their official scores to theOffice of Undergraduate Admissions,22 Washington Square North; (212)998-4500. In most subjects, if thescore received is four or five, creditwill be granted. If such credit isgranted, students should not retakethat course for credit in the College.If they choose to do so, they willautomatically lose the AdvancedPlacement credit. For more informa-tion, see the \"Advanced PlacementEquivalencies\" chart in the Admission section of this bulletin. CREDIT FOR COURSES AT THE COLLEGE To receive credit for a course, the student must register before attend-ing, meet the requirements forattendance, and satisfactorily com-plete all examinations and assign-ments prescribed by the instructor.For exceptional students, mostdepartments also offer independentstudy. The College does not permitstudents to register as auditors. RESTRICTIONS ON RECEIVING CREDIT No credit is granted for the success- ful completion of only the first termof a full-year course, except by thepermission of the director of under-graduate studies of the departmentin which the course is taken. Full-year courses are denoted by a hyphenbetween numbers, such as inV27.0003-0004. A student who has earned credit for a course may repeat it once (a\"W\" obtained on first registrationfor a course does not count in thesecalculations). Students may not repeat courses in a designatedsequence after taking more advancedcourses; however, the sequencing ofcourses is determined by the depart-ments. Students with questionsregarding the repetition of courses orcourse sequences must consult withthe particular department offeringthe course. When a student repeats acourse, no additional credit will beawarded. Both grades will be record-ed, but only the latter will be com-puted in the grade point average andhave credit awarded. Studentsshould be aware that certain graduateschools, including dental, medical,and law schools, will count bothgrades for a repeated course in theaverage. A limited number of credits may be earned by those in the militaryservices who take correspondencecourses in colleges approved by theUnited States Armed Forces Insti-tute. Students may not be registeredat another university at the sametime that they are registered in theCollege of Arts and Science. CREDIT FOR COURSES AT OTHER SCHOOLS AND DIVISIONS OF NEW YORKUNIVERSITY Courses may be taken in the New York University Graduate School of Arts and Science; 1000-level gradu-ate courses may be taken as describedin the departmental sections of thisbulletin, and 2000-level graduatecourses may be taken with writtenapproval of the instructor. If graduatecourses are applied toward the com-pletion of requirements for the bac-calaureate degree, no advanced creditis allowed for them in the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science. It is also possible for students to take courses in other undergraduatedivisions of New York Universityand to have credits for these coursesapplied to the degree in the College. Students may take a total of 16 points in other divisions. Transferstudents should note that credits for nonliberal arts courses (e.g., business,applied art, speech) taken at anotherinstitution count as part of the 16 points. The following exceptionapplies: Students are permitted totake up to 24 points in other divisionsto complete their program, as pre-scribed, if they are formally matricu-lated in one of the com-bined program; orthe accelerated B.A./M.P .A. orB.S./B.E. program. Please note that restrictions apply. Courses in other divisionsthat duplicate the contents of a Col-lege of Arts and Science course donot count toward the Collegedegree. For details, students mustcheck with an adviser in the CollegeAdvising Center before registeringfor any courses in other divisions. Ifa course is not approved, studentswill not receive credit for it. Inde-pendent study or internship coursestaken in other divisions of the Uni-versity do not count toward theCollege degree. Also excluded from credit toward the degree are any coursestaken in the School of Continuingand Professional Studies once a stu-dent is registered in the College. SUMMER SESSION Once admitted to the College, stu-dents take all courses here, includ-ing those they need or wish to takeduring the summer. Exceptions aregranted only rarely and only forgood academic reasons. Requestsshould be made to an adviser in theCollege Advising Center, MainBuilding, Room 905. Information about summer course offerings is available duringthe preceding fall and spring terms,as is information about dormitoryfacilities available to students whousually commute.beliefs shall not be penalized for anyclass, examination, or assignmentdeadline missed on that day or days. 3.If examinations or assignment deadlines are scheduled, any studentwho is unable to attend class because of religious beliefs shall begiven the opportunity to make upthat day or days.4.No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any studentwho avails him/herself of the aboveprovisions.324 ACADEMIC POLICIESExaminations and GradesFINAL EXAMINATIONS When final examinations are missed because of illness, a doctor's notemust be presented to the instructor,who may give a grade of Incomplete.See below for an outline of proceduresfor taking makeup examinations. MAKEUP EXAMINATIONS As noted under \"Grades,\" below, astudent who cannot take the finalexamination in a course at the regu-larly scheduled time may be giventhe grade of Incomplete. The studentmust discuss the reasons for missingthe examination with the instructorand, in the case of illness, must sub-mit a doctor's note to the instructor.The student must ask the instructorto give a grade of Incomplete.Incompletes are not awarded auto-matically. The time and place of anymakeup examinations are set by theinstructor or the department.(Regarding the removal of Incom-pletes received for missed work otherthan final examinations, see under\"Grades\" and \"Incompletes,\" below.) Incomplete grades received because of a missed final examinationmust be removed within the semes-ter following the one in which theIncomplete was received. In the caseof students who are out of atten-dance, such grades must be removedwithin one year after the end of thecourse concerned. A grade of Incom-plete that is not removed within thistime limit becomes an F and is com-puted in the average. GRADES Students may obtain their finalgrades for each semester over thetelephone or on the World WideWeb by means of a personal identifi- cation number. The parents orguardian of a student who is a minor(under 18 years of age) may, on awritten request to the Office of theUniversity Registrar, obtain the stu-dent's grades at any time. The following symbols indicating terminal grades are used: A, B, C, D,P, F, and W . The following symbol indicates incomplete work: I. Onlygrades of A, B, C, D, or F earnedwhile matriculated in the College, orearned in any of the College's courses(A/V prefixed courses) while matricu-lated in another division of NewYork University, are computed in the average. The following grades may beawarded: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, F. In general, A indicatesexcellent work, B indicates goodwork, C indicates satisfactory work,and D indicates passable work and isthe lowest passing grade. F indicatesfailure. The weights assigned in com-puting the grade point average are asfollows: A = 4.0, A- = 3.7, B+ = 3.3,B = 3.0, B- = 2.7, C+ = 2.3, C = 2.0,C- = 1.7, D+ = 1.3, D = 1.0, and F = 0.0. Computing the grade point average: The grade point average can be obtained by determining the totalof all grade points earned (qualitypoints) and dividing that figure bythe total number of credit hours completed (quality hours). For example: A student who has completed 8 points of A (4.0), 4 points of B (3.0), and 4 points of C(2.0) has a grade point average of3.25. This is obtained by adding 8(points of A) x 4 (point value of A),4 (points of B) x 3 (point value of B),and 4 (points of C) x 2 (point valueof C), which totals 52 (the total of allgrade points earned), and then bydividing 52 by 16 (the total numberof credit hours completed). Thisgives the grade point average of 3.25. Once a final grade has been sub- mitted by the instructor and recordedon the transcript, the final grade can-not be changed by turning in addi-tional course work. In the case of a course that has been repeated, only the second grade,whether higher or lower, is computedinto the average. The initial grade,however, remains on the transcript. The grades for courses taken abroad in one of New York University's programs or at one ofthe exchange sites are recorded onthe transcript and are also includedin the grade point average. Thegrades for graduate and professionalcourses taken at other divisions inthe University are included in thegrade point average, provided thatpermission to enroll is obtained priorto registration for the courses. Not included in the undergradu- ate grade point average are gradesfor the first year of professionalcourses taken by those students inthe three-year accelerated dental,law, or medical programs; grades forwork done at institutions other thanNew York University (except forexchange sites abroad); and gradesfor work done in courses that are notprefixed with an A or a V (non-A/V courses) while enrolled in anotherdivision of New York University. P:The grade of P (Pass) indicates a passing grade (A, B, C, or D) in acourse taken under the pass/failoption. It is also used to indicatenongraded courses. The grade of P isnot computed in the average. Thegrade of F under the pass/fail optionis computed in the average. For more information and dures to obtain the pass/fail option,see under \"Pass/Fail Option,\" below. W:The grade of W indicates an official withdrawal of the studentfrom a course. Please see \"Change ofprogram\" and \"Withdrawing fromcourses,\" above, for information onthe regulations and procedures forwithdrawing officially from courses. I:The grade of I (Incomplete) is a temporary grade that indicates thatthe student has, for good reason, notcompleted all of the course work butthat there is the possibility that thestudent will eventually pass thecourse when all of the requirementshave been completed. A studentmust ask the instructor for a grade ofIncomplete, present documented evi-dence of illness or the equivalent,and clarify the remaining courserequirements with the instructor.The Incomplete grade is not awardedautomatically. It is not used whenthere is no possibility that the stu-dent will eventually pass the course.If the course work is not completedafter the statutory time for makingup incompletes has elapsed, the tem-porary grade of I shall become an Fand will be computed in the stu-dent's grade point average. INCOMPLETES All work missed in the fall termmust be made up by the end of thefollowing spring term. All workmissed in the spring term or in asummer session must be made up bythe end of the following fall term.Students who are out of attendancein the semester following the one inwhich the course was taken have oneyear to complete the work. Studentsshould contact the College AdvisingCenter for an Extension of Incom-plete Form, which must be approvedby the instructor. Extensions of thesetime limits are rarely granted.ACADEMIC POLICIES 325INDEPENDENT STUDY Most departments offer independent study courses for students withexceptional qualifications. In thesecourses, the work is planned specifi-cally for each student. Independent study courses allow the student to work independentlywith faculty supervision and counsel.The courses are generally numberedV**.0997, 0998 and typically carryvariable credit of 2 or 4 points eachterm. They are normally limited toupper-class majors but may be opento other well-qualified students. Toregister for independent study, a stu-dent must have written approval ofthe director of undergraduate studiesof the department in which thecourse is offered. The result of theindependent study course should be apaper or objective tangible evidenceof completion of the work. The indi-vidual departments may grant creditfor not more than 8 points of inde-pendent study (V**.0997, 0998) forwork approved in advance. In gener-al, students are not permitted to takemore than 12 points of independentstudy and/or internship, and no morethan 8 points may be taken in anyone department. More specific information can be found under the individual depart-mental descriptions. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Students who wish to be out ofattendance from the College for onesemester or an academic year may begranted an official leave of absence.The student should submit a request to the College Advising Cen-ter, Main Building, Room 905, andhave an interview with an adviserbefore the beginning of the term.Leaves are not granted after the thirdweek of the term unless there arecompelling personal or medical reasons. A student granted a leave does not have to make a formal applica-tion for readmission as long as he orshe returns to the College within theagreed-upon time (a maximum oftwo semesters). The student on leaveis responsible for financial aid deadlines. If students are on probationwhen the leave is granted, they willreturn on probation. If they haveattended another college during theleave, they must submit an officialtranscript to the College AdvisingCenter, College of Arts and Science,New York University, Main Building,100 Washington Square East, Room905, New York, NY 10003-6688. Students out of attendance who did not apply for a leave and whowish to return to the College mayapply for readmission. See underAdmission. PASS/FAIL OPTION Students may elect one pass/fail option each term, including thesummer sessions, for a total of notmore than 32 points during theircollege career. The pass/fail option isnot acceptable for courses completedat other institutions. The choice must be made before the completion of the fifth week ofthe term (second week of a six-week summer session); after that time thedecision cannot be initiated orchanged. No grade other than P or Fwill be recorded for those studentschoosing this option. P includes thegrades of A, B, C, and D and is notcounted in the average. F is countedin the average. The pass/fail option is not accept- able in the major, the minor, or anyof the courses taken in fulfillment ofthe Morse Academic Plan require-ments. Students considering thepass/fail option in their area of studyor in required preprofessional coursesshould consult with their advisersabout the effect of such grades onadmission to graduate and profes-sional schools. Students who changetheir majors may not be able to usecourses taken under the pass/failoption to satisfy the requirements oftheir new majors. The form fordeclaring the pass/fail option may beobtained in the College AdvisingCenter, Main Building, Room 905. PETITIONS The Faculty Committee on Under-graduate Academic Standards willconsider petitions of students towaive requirements or modify poli-cies and regulations of the College.Students should be aware that onlyvery exceptional cases, supported byvalid and documented reasons, willbe considered.

Placement Examinations, Analysis of Academic Progress, and TranscriptsPLACEMENT EXAMINATIONS I. Foreign Languages. A. Testing and Placement. Most entering students take a profi-ciency/placement test prior to theirfirst registration in the College. SATII-type reading tests are used as pro-ficiency (exemption) and placementinstruments in classical Greek,French, Italian, Latin, and Spanish.Students who took a foreign languageSAT II test while in high school areencouraged to present the scoreinstead of or in addition to takingthe College's test. Written examina-tions are also given in Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Korean, modernGreek, modern Hebrew, Persian,Portuguese, and Russian. Testing inArabic, Turkish, and Hindi/Urdu can be arranged through the Departmentof Middle Eastern Studies. Becausethese are reading examinations, stu-dents should choose to be tested inthe language in which they havegood reading skills. Tests can result either in an exemption from the foreign-languagerequirement (see \"Foreign Language\"under Morse Academic Plan ) or in placement into the appropriate-levelcourse. Placement into a lower-levelcourse means that the student mustcontinue his or her studies of thatlanguage (or begin a new language)until completion of the intermediatelevel of that language. In some cases,adjustments in placement may bemade during the first weeks of class.Information on placement testing can be obtained from Crystal Parsonsat the Office of Academic Affairs,Main Building, Room 908. Studentswho place at a level below thatwhich they have completed at anoth-er college will lose transfer credit ifthey repeat course work at the Col-lege of Arts and Science. B. Testing Exemptions. The proficiency/placement test isrequired of all entering studentswith the following exceptions: stu-dents who will begin a languagethey have not previously studied;students whose entire secondaryschooling was in a language otherthan English and other than thoselanguages taught in the College;and foreign students who complete326 ACADEMIC POLICIESthe sequence of required English courses for international students.Students in these categories shouldcontact the College Advising Centerto verify that they have satisfied theforeign-language requirement. II. Examinations in Mathematics. All entering students must take a placement examinationprior to registration. See \"PlacementTests\" under Mathematics (63). III. Chemistry. A chemistry assessment examination is given toall freshmen who intend to takechemistry. IV . Biology.

Once a final examination period has begun, no transcript will be for-warded for any student who is cur-rently enrolled in courses until all thestudent's final grades have beenreceived and recorded. Please notifythe Office of the University Registrarimmediately of any change of address. Students are able to access their grades at the end of each semester viaTorchTone using a Touch-Tone tele- phone and a personal identificationnumber (PIN). Instructions on howto use TorchTone are available in theOffice of the University Registrar.Students may also access grades atone of the NYU View kiosks placedthroughout the campus or via theWeb at www.albert.nyu.edu. ARREARS POLICY The University reserves the right to deny registration and withhold allinformation regarding the record ofany student who is in arrears in thepayment of tuition, fees, loans, orother charges (including charges forhousing, dining, or other activitiesor services) for as long as any arrearsremain. Academic Standards and DisciplineACADEMIC STANDARDS The Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards reviews studentrecords throughout the academic year.All of its actions are based on thegrades to date at the end of the term. Academic alert. Students with cumulative grade point averages of2.0 to 2.25 will receive an academicalert letter reflecting the commit-tee's specific recommendations forachieving an appropriate standardfor academic performance. Academic probation. Any stu- dent whose record is deemed unsat-isfactory will be placed on academicprobation and will be so informedby letter. A record will be deemedunsatisfactory if, in any semester, thecumulative or semester grade pointaverage falls below 2.0 or if it failsto show steady and substantialprogress toward the degree. Steadyand substantial progress toward thedegree entails the completion, withsatisfactory grades, of more than halfof the courses (and points) for whicha student registers in any semester.In addition, it entails satisfactory progress in the student's major. Failure to satisfy the conditions of probation will result in furtheracademic sanctions and possibly dismissal from the College. The conditions usually require that thestudent (a) achieve a grade pointaverage of at least 2.0 during theterm he or she is on probation, (b)not receive any grade below a C orany grade of I, and (c) not withdrawfrom any course without securingthe permission of the Committee onUndergraduate Academic Standardsprior to the withdrawal. Students onacademic probation are also requiredto have a special probation interviewwith an adviser in the College Advis-ingCenter in order to receive regis- tration clearance for the next semester.More specific requirements may beimposed. The Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards may summonstudents with unsatisfactory recordsto discuss their problems and todetermine whether and under whatconditions they may continue in theCollege. In special circumstances, the committee may recommend to thedean that students may be granted orplaced on leave for a period not toexceed two semesters. Students on academic probation may not engage in any extracurricularactivities (except for departmentalclubs) and may not hold office inthese clubs without the approval ofthe Committee on UndergraduateAcademic Standards. Students on academic probation should be aware that they are usuallyineligible for financial aid. Academic dismissal. Students who are dismissed from the Collegefor poor academic performance areinformed in writing by registeredmail. Students who have paidtuition for the next term at the timeof dismissal will receive a full refundof tuition and fees. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY Community of the MindThe College is a \"community of themind.\" Its students, faculty, and staffACADEMIC POLICIES 327all share the goal of pursuing truth through free and open inquiry, andwe support one another's endeavorsin this regard. As in any community,membership comes with certain rightsand responsibilities. Foremost amongthese is academic integrity. Cheatingon an exam, falsifying data, or havingsomeone else write a paper underminesothers who are \"doing it on theirown\"; it makes it difficult or impos-sible to assess fairly a student's inter-est, aptitude, and achievement; andit diminishes the cheater, deprivinghim or her of an education. Mostimportant, academic dishonesty is aviolation of the very principles uponwhich the academy is founded. Thus,when students enter the College, oneof the first things that they are askedto do is to sign a community com-pact, recognizing these principles ofacademic integrity. For this reasonalso, violations of these principles aretreated with the utmost seriousness. Procedures and Sanctions The penalty for academic dishonestyis severe. The following are the pro-cedures as approved by the Facultyof Arts and Science. 1.If a student cheats on an examination or in laboratory workor engages in plagiarism, appropri-ate disciplinary action should betaken. The department can take thefollowing actions: a)The faculty member, with the approval of the director of under-graduate studies (director), mayreduce the student's grade or givethe student an F in the course. b) If after lowering the grade or assigning an F the departmentbelieves a more severe penalty (i.e.,probation, suspension, expulsion) iswarranted, it can refer the case tothe dean or his or her representative(associate dean for students) for fur-ther action. 2.In all cases of either (a) or (b), the director shall inform the depart-ment chair of any action in writingand send copies of this letter to thedean and to the student. The lettershall include the nature of the offense,the penalty, and the right of the stu-dent to appeal such penalty. A copy ofthe letter shall be kept in a confiden-tial chairman's file and not in the stu-dent's departmental file. The dean'soffice copy shall also be kept in a con-fidential file. (The professor and/or thedirector is encouraged to meet withthe student and discuss the nature ofthe offense and the action taken.)3.For cases involving a first offense at New York University, thedean shall send the student by regis-tered mail a notice that a secondoffense will result in a one-semestersuspension or a more severe penalty.(The student is also called in to dis-cuss the offense and review the con-sequences of the disciplinary action.) 4.For cases involving a second offense, the dean shall proceed as follows: a)Upon receiving a second director's letter concerning a given student, the dean shall convene athree-member ad hoc committee, with no member being from thedepartment involved, to examinethe evidence. This ad hoc committee shall consider if there are reasonablegrounds to believe that cheating/plagiarism has occurred and if so,shall affirm the suspension penalty.It shall report its conclusion to thedean within three business days. b)If the committee affirms the suspension, the dean shall send thestudent by registered mail the suspen-sion letter within two business days ofreceiving the report. The letter shalladvise the student of his or her rightto appeal. The student shall have twobusiness days from the letter's deliveryto request an appeal of the suspensionas provided in Section 5 (below). Thesuspension shall ordinarily be stayedduring the pendency of appeal. c)If the committee does not affirm the suspension, the report shallbe kept on file for a one-year period. 5.The student in all cases has the right to appeal to the dean. Inthe event of an appeal, the deanshall elicit a written complaint fromthe faculty member and proceed asdescribed above. DISCIPLINE Students are expected to familiarizethemselves and to comply with therules of conduct, regulations, andestablished practices of the Universi-ty and the College of Arts and Science, as stated in the Student Disci- pline Rules and Procedures of the Collegeof Arts and Science and as outlined in the chapter \"University and StudentGovernance, Policies, and Proce-dures\" in the Students' Guide to NYU. If pursuant to such rules, regulations,or practices, the withdrawal of a stu-dent is required before the end of theterm for which tuition has been paid,a refund will be made according tothe standard schedule for refunds.Below is a summary of the offens- es for which students may be subjectto disciplinary charges by the Com-mittee on Student Discipline: 1.False representation or forgery of academic documents 2.Deliberate destruction, theft, or unauthorized use of laboratorydata, research materials, computerresources, or university property 3.Disruption of an academic event 4.Actual or threatened violence or harassment Depending on the seriousness of the offense, the following penaltiesmay be imposed after a hearing by theCommittee on Student Discipline: Censure. Written reprimand for violation of specified regulation,including the possibility of moresevere disciplinary sanction in theevent of a subsequent violation ofany University regulation within aperiod of time stated in the letter ofreprimand. Disciplinary probation. Sus- pension of privileges or exclusionfrom participating in extracurricularUniversity activities as set forth bythe Committee on Student Disci-pline for a specified period of time. Suspension.
