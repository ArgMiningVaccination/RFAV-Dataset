PSY-FMD participants received 20 individual sessions of Functional Psychotherapy. Each session attended twice a week for the first 8 weeks and once a week for the remaining 4. Furthermore, they received a nutritional consultation and prescription of a Fasting Mimicking Diet. PSY group received just the psychotherapy protocol and the nutritionist prescribed to keep a food diary without changing their habitual diet style. All patients were retested at the end of the treatment (3 months later) and at follow-up 3 months after the last session.| |Masking:||Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)| |Masking Description:|| | Patients were advised that they would have received a psychological treatment and a nutritional consultation in order to evaluate the possibility of the prescription of a diet, investigating on their diet habits The investigator wasn't informed about the randomization procedures of the two groups. A clinical psychologist administered the psychological tests separately in the same treatment centre were the patients received the protocol and he wasn't aware about the randomization arm. |Primary Purpose:||Treatment| |Official Title:||A Randomized-controlled Pilot Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of a Fasting Mimicking Diet Added to Functional Therapy for Depression| |Actual Study Start Date :||September 12, 2018| |Actual Primary Date :||May in the PSY-FMD group carried out the Functional Therapy protocol over 20 individual sessions, which were scheduled twice a week for the first two months and once a week for the last month (three months total). The treatment program was specifically manualized for treating depression with the aim to increase mood, self-esteem and quality of life. Furthermore, patients followed a Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) protocol consisting of 3 cycles of 5 days a month each: the first day of the diet provided 1090 kcal (10% protein, 56% fat, 34% carbohydrate), the days 2-5 were identical in the formulation and provided 725 kcal (9-10% protein, 44-56% fat, 34-47% carbohydrate). Between cycles of FMD the subjects stuck to a free diet. At the end of the treatment all patients were re-tested through the same assessment protocol and the same things was realized at the follow-up (three months later the end of the treatment). | Dietary Supplement: Fasting Mimicking Diet | The Fasting Mimicking Diet is a low-calorie, five-day eating program meant to promote weight loss and provide the same benefits as more traditional fasting methods. | No Intervention: PSY | Subjects randomized into the control group (PSY) completed the same Functional Therapy program without practicing any diet. Specifically, at the end of the nutritional consultation the nutritionist suggested them to keep a food diary without changing their habitual diet style. - severity of depressive symptoms measured by the second version of the Beck-Depression-Inventory (BDI-II) [ Time Frame: end of the treatment (three months) and three months later (follow-up) ]change of depression symptoms (measured through Beck Depression Inventory -II). Total score from 0 to 63. Higher values represent worst depression symptoms - self-esteem measured by the Basic Self-Esteem Scale [ Time Frame: end of the treatment (three months) and three months later (follow-up) ]change of self-esteem (measured through Basic Self-Esteem Scale). Percentiles scores were used (from 0 to 100).
