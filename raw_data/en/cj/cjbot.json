To revive dry, irritated skin this winter, make these fruit favorites part of your daily beauty diet. Sea Buckthorn: Rich in vitamin E, A and Beta Cerotene, this fruit is touted for its soothing and healing capabilities, preventing UV and free radical damage. [Weleda Sea Buckthorn Creamy Body Wash](http://usa.weleda.com/our-products/shop/sea-buckthorn-creamy-body-wash.aspx) ($12) provides a thorough cleanse without the stripping. The formula's biodynamic sea buckthorn oil helps to create a pH balance, build moisture levels and prevent inflammation. Goji: When skin is left dryer than normal, wrinkles become even more apparent. Although it's been part of Chinese medicine for centuries, the berry has just recently become an anti-aging favorite in the U.S. Aside from containing fatty and amino acids, the fruit is rich in carotenoids that reap powerful anti-aging benefits. [L'Dara Advanced Anti-Aging Serum](https://ldara.com/?pl=1) ($120) uses the goji berry as the base for its formula that's been found to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and add moisture back in. Grapefruit: Rich in vitamin A and C, antioxidants and amino acids, the fruit is a favorite in DIY masks because it renews damaged skin over time as well firms and softens instantly. [Cosmedix Rescue+ Intense Balm & Mask](http://www.cosmedix.com/products/Rescue-Plus) ($59) calms skin irritation (most commonly from the dry air) and boosts hydration with a blend of Shea butter and argan oil.
