Naturopathic medicine is distinguished by the principles upon which its practice is based. These principles are continually reexamined in the light of scientific advances. The techniques of naturopathic remedies include modern and traditional, scientific and empirical methods. The following principles are the foundation of naturopathic medical practice: The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae): Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in the person which is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. Identify and Treat the Causes (ToIle Causam): The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere): Naturopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming the patient: - Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; - Avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms; - Acknowledge, respect and work with the individual's self-healing process. Doctor as Teacher (Docere): Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health as part of naturopathy treatments. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person: Naturopathic physicians treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Naturopathic practice includes the following diagnostic and therapeutic modalities: nutritional medicine, botanical medicine, naturopathic physical medicine including naturopathic manipulative therapy, public health measures and hygiene, counseling, minor surgery, homeopathy, acupuncture, prescription medication, intravenous and injection therapy, naturopathic obstetrics (natural childbirth), and appropriate methods of laboratory and clinical diagnosis. Naturopathic medicine accomplishes health care using holistic diagnosis in conjunction with the following therapies - clinical nutrition - botanical medicine - lifestyle counseling - homeopathic medicine - physical medicine - pharmaceutical medicine - minor surgery How are naturopathic physicians trained? All modern licensed naturopathic physicians have Doctorate of Naturopathic Medicine degrees from federally recognized medical schools. Their education includes: - the same premedical undergraduate coursework required by other schools of medicine; - a competitive application and admission process; - graduation from a four-year, federally recognized, naturopathic medical school - two full years of supervised clinical internship; - optional residency programs. Naturopathic medical students study the same basic and clinical sciences as do other medical students, and in addition, a full spectrum of natural medicines and therapies. How do naturopathic physicians diagnose and treat people? These are examples of naturopathic medicine and services we offer as primary care providers.
