It encourages its faculty members to [publish research papers](pdf/research/SIU-Research_Publications-2022.pdf) in high quality journals that are indexed in Scopus, Web of Science, ABDC and ABS listed journals. Faculty areincentivised for publishing in these journals. As per UGC notification, the University has recently prepared a White List of Journals listed in Scopus, SCI, SSCI, AHCI, ABDC, ABS, FT50 and ICI. Regular FDPs are conducted for SIU faculty to enhance their research skills through [STLRC](http://siu.edu.in/siu-study-faculties.php#teach). Constituent institutes of the University regularly hold [research conferences](pdf/research/National-and-International-Conferences-organised-by-SIU.pdf) for bringing academics, researchers, and professionals of respective disciplines together for scholarly interactions. SIU also provides domestic and foreign travel support to Faculty members for presenting [research papers in reputed conferences](pdf/research/Funding-support-to-the-Faculty-Members-for-presenting-papers.pdf). Organizing conferences and providing financial support for participating in research conferences help SIU's research community in learning about the state-of-the-art research happening in their respective disciplines, and hence, maintaining the currency of the in-house knowledge base of the University Faculty. SIU's research community acknowledges that in this era of half-life of knowledge, it is essential to not only remain connected with the researchers of the discipline working outside the University, but also to share resources and collaborate with them for achieving quality and speed in research. Various SIU institutes have collaborated with other researchers on common research agenda that benefitted their fields. In addition, SIU collaborates with 55 [Centres for Research Collaboration (CRC)](pdf/research/Centres-for-Research-Collaboration.pdf) with whom they conduct joint research. In its continuous pursuit of giving back to Society through academics and research, the University has established [Symbiosis Centre for Advance and Legal Studies (SCALSAR)](https://scalsar.edu.in/), [Symbiosis Centre for Waste Resource Management (SCWRM)](http://www.scwrm.edu.in/) and [Symbiosis Centre for Stem Cell Research (SCSCR)](https://scscr.edu.in/), [Symbiosis Centre for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (SCNN)](http://www.scnn.edu.in/) AND [Symbiosis Center for Medical Image Analysis (SCMIA)](http://scmia.edu.in/) and [Symbiosis Centre for Behavioural Studies (SCBS)](http://www.scbs.org.in/) and [Symbiosis Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence (SCAAI)](http://www.scaai.edu.in/) and Symbiosis Centre for Research on International Higher Education (SCRIHE), [Symbiosis Centre for Climate Change and Sustainability (SCCCS)](https://scccs.siu.edu.in/) and Symbiosis Centre for Urban Studies (SCUS) in past few years. These Centres are led by the researchers of repute in respective disciplines and are being developed as the Centres of Excellence of the future. All kind of research with human subjects are guided by the principles enshrined in the 'Declaration of Helsinki'. This is also the basis of 'Good Clinical Practices (GCP)' adopted by the International Council on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The Indian Council of Medical Research has also issued ethical guidelines for research on human subjects in 2000, and subsequently, in 2017. They also form part of the GCP guidelines issued by the Central Drug Standards Control Organization of the Ministry of Health (& Family Welfare) Government of India. At SIU, these principles are put into practice through the formation and operation of Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC). This committee focuses on rights, safety and wellbeing of the research participants if research involves human subjects or if there is a possibility of involvement of ethical issues. IEC is expected to review and approve such research proposals. As per the New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019 by Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, there are two IECs that functional at SIU currently: 1) IEC for Biomedical and Health Research (BHR) studies and 2) IEC for Clinical Trials (CT),Bioavailability (BA) and Bioequivalence (BE) Studies. The composition of both IECs can be found as per the hyperlink given below: The two committees work independently as per the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). No violation of SOPs is entertained. The researchers who are willing to seek ethical approval from the IECs should go through the SOPs which are attached with the hyperlink below: To submit a research proposal for review of Ethics Committee, the Principal Investigator should submit the duly filled application form (Annexure IV) to the Secretariat office of the Ethics Committees (iec@siu.edu.in). The application form should be accompanied with necessary relevant documents such as Research proposal, Informed Consent Form, Participant Information Sheet, Case Record Form (Questionnaire), Investigator's Brochure, Details of funding agency/sponsor, Curriculum Vitae of Investigators, Regulatory permissions, Relevant administrative approvals/agreements, etc. For details, please refer to the latest guidelines (2017) published by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for Biomedical and Health Research involving human participants.
