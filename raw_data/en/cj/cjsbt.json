Suicide in Washington State and the NationIn the United States and throughout the world, suicide is a major public health concern. In 2015, 44,000 Americans died from suicide, making it the tenth leading cause of death overall. And suicide is not limited to any gender, age, socioeconomic, or ethnic group. Among children (age 10 to 14), suicide is the third leading cause of death, while among older teenagers and young adults (age 15 to 34), suicide is the second leading cause of death. Remarkably, in 2015 there were many more suicides (44,193) in the United States than homicides (17,793) (CDC, 2017). Suicide Rates in the United States (by state; per 100,000; average 2004-2010) Suicide rates vary from state to state. Washington State, as well as other Western states (excluding California), have some of the highest rates of suicide in the country. Source: CDC. A web of biological, psychological, social, environmental, and situational concerns influence suicidal ideation and behaviors. Risk factors, including childhood trauma, substance abuse, poverty, and untreated mental health problems, are common. Unfortunately, many people cannot get help because of provider shortages, stigma associated with mental illness, and the cost of care (WSDOH, 2016). Although men have a higher rate of completed suicides, suicide attempts are two- to three-fold more frequent among women. Methods are also different: men often use lethal methods such as firearms, hanging, or suffocation, while women attempt suicide b y poisoning, wrist cutting, or falling from heights (Mendez-Bustos et al., 2013).Prevalence of Suicide Attempts Among U.S. Adults (2015) Defining Terms Suicide is defined as death caused by self-directed injurious behavior with intent to die as a result of the behavior. A suicide attempt is a non-fatal, self-directed, potentially injurious behavior with intent to die as a result of the behavior. A suicide attempt might not result in injury. A suicidal ideation refers to thinking about, considering, or planning suicide. Source: CDC, 2016. In Washington State the suicide rate is 11% higher than the national average; from 2010 to 2014, over 5,000 people died as a result of suicide. Three Washingtonians die by suicide every day and in an average week there are 65 hospitalizations from self-inflicted injury. More than 4% of adults and 20% of 10th graders in Washington seriously considered suicide in the past year (WSDOH, 2016). Suicide rates vary in different parts of Washington. But because of the way rates are compared, a small difference may be statistically significant while a larger one is not. Statistical significance means the difference is very unlikely to be due to chance. From 2010 to 2014, suicide rates were higher than the state rate in six counties: Clallam1.Seven counties in W ashington ha ve small populations and had too few suicides to calculate a suicide r ate. This does not mean that there are not suicides in these counties; count y- level data do not alw ays accur ately reflect suicide losses in communities. F or example, in 2013 both the Spokane T ribe of Indians and the Colville Confeder ated T ribes declared a suicide state of emergency because of high numbers of suicide deaths. Clark Count y's Battle Ground School District , located in a town of fewer than 18,000 residents, lost sev en students to suicide between 2011 and 2013. Neither pattern of loss w as clear from a glance at count y data. In W ashington and nationally , suicide r ates are higher outside urban areas and highest in small-town rur al areas (WSDOH, 2016). The suicide r ate in King Count y is lower than the state r ate, but it has the largest population and the highest number of suicides in the state (WSDOH, 2016). Okanogan,3. Pierce4. Skamania5.

Key Points about Suicide Suicide is a prev entable public health problem, not a personal weakness or family failure. Everyone in W ashington has a role in suicide prev ention; suicide prev ention is not the responsibilit y of the health system alone. Many people a void discussing suicide; silence and stigma harm individuals, families, and communities. To prev ent suicide in W ashington, we must change the factors that contribute to suicide risk, such as childhood tr auma, isolation in our communities, access to lethal means, and lack of access to appropriate beha vioral healthcare. Suicide does not affect all communities equally or in the same w ay; suicide prev ention progr ams should be based on the best available research and pr actices, while reflecting communit y needs and local cultures. People experiencing mental illness, substance use disorders (SUDs), tr auma, loss, and suicidal thinking and beha vior deserv e dignit y, respect, and the right to mak e decisions about their care. Source: Washington State Department of Health, 2016. Suicide, Race, and Ethnicity Suicide r ates in W ashington are highest among American Indian, Alaska Nativ e, and white populations, consistent with national r ates. But these broad demogr aphic groups are diverse with regard to national origin and ethnicit y, which can mask the impact of suicide in different subgroups. F or example, the broad Asian population' s overall low suicide r ate ma y hide the high impact of suicide in some Asian ethnic groups. American Indians and Alaska Nativ es face sev ere historical tr auma, high r ates of po verty and isolation, cultur al taboos around death and suicide, and lack of access to mental healthcare. Among American Indian and Alaska Nativ e youth aged 15 to 24 y ears, the suicide r ate is 3 to 4 times higher than other American y outh and is the second leading cause of death for American Indian and Alaska Nativ es in this age group (WSDOH, 2016). The risk for co-occurrence of substance abuse, depression, and diabetes is o ver 12 times higher for AI/ANs than for whites (Cwik et al. , 2016). The suicide r ate for American Indian juveniles is more than double the white non-Hispanic r ate and more than triple the r ates for the other r acial/ethnic groups (CS AT, 2015).Very little research focuses on wh y suicide r ates are high among white populations. Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention (CDC) data from 16 states show the most common circumstances around suicide for white men include mental and ph ysical health problems, trouble in intimate relationships, alcohol dependence, and problems at work. Cultur al taboos about seeking help and appearing vulner able can isolate white men from both support systems and resources that could help (WSDOH, 2016). Hispanics/Latinos ha ve fairly similar r ates of suicidal thoughts and beha viors compared with white, non-Hispanic individuals. Among y outh and y oung adults, the prev alence of suicidal thoughts and beha vior increases among Hispanics/Latinos who are more accultur ated to mainstream American culture, particularly among females (CS AT, 2015). The suicide r ate for African Americans is 70% lower than that of the non-Hispanic white population. Howev er, in 2014 the suicide death r ate for African Americans men w as more than four times greater than for African American women (OMH, 2017). Among African American y outh, suicide risk peaks in early twenties for males and late twenties for females. These patterns are v ery different from the age patterns of the white population and the whole population. In a study looking at suicide r ates from 1983 to 2012 for African Americans, the risk of suicide in both genders showed a similar trend: the risk in males increased with age peaking at ages 20 to 24 y ears and then declined ex cept for slight increases at older ages (60-74 y ears). F or females, the risk increased with age until peaking at ages 25 to 29 y ears and then declined ex cept for slight increases at middle ages (35-44 y ears) (W ang et al. , 2016). Among Asian American the six largest subgroups in the United States are Asian Indians, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, K oreans, and Vietnamese; these subgroups account for 84% of all Asian Americans in the United States. Among these Asian subgroups, K orean males had more than twice the frequency of death due to suicide (5%) compared to non-Hispanic Whites (2%), and suicide w as ranked as the fifth leading cause of death, higher than ev ery other Asian subgroup and non-Hispanic whites. Mortalit y rates for suicide among K orean males were twice that of an y other Asian subgroup (Hastings et al. , 2015). Suicide Rates by Race/Ethnicity in the United States (2014) Suicide vs. Homicide For white y outh and y oung adults between the ages of 12 and 24, between 1990 and 2015 suicide w as much more common than murder . This w as in sharp contr ast to patterns for Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks. F or white y outh between the ages of 7 and 17, for every 10 homicide victims there were 29 suicide victims. F or black y outh, for ev ery 10 homicide victims there were to 2 suicide victims. F or Hispanic y outh, for ev ery 10 homicide victims, there were 5 suicide victims (OJJDP , 2017). Whites: Number of Suicide and Homicide Victims by Age, 1990-2015 Source: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, 2017.Blacks: Number of Suicide and Homicide Victims by Age, 1990-2015 Source: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, 2017. Hispanics: Number of Suicide and Homicide Victims by Age, 1990-2015 Source: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, 2017. In contrast, the suicide rate for American Indian juveniles (69.8) was more than double the white non-Hispanic rate and more than triple the rates for the other racial/ethnic groups. Hispanics/Latinos have fairly similar rates of suicidal thoughts and behavior compared with white, non-Hispanic individuals. Among youth and young adults, the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behavior increases among Hispanics/Latinos who are more acculturated to mainstream American culture, particularly among females (CSAT, 2015).Gender and Age Differences Suicides of y oung people receiv e a lot of media and communit y attention, though Washington' s suicide r ates for adults are higher . Men are more lik ely to die b y suicide than women, but women are more lik ely to attempt suicide. Men are more lik ely to use deadlier methods, such as firearms or suffocation. W omen are more lik ely than men to attempt suicide b y poisoning (WSDOH, 2016). During 2012-2014, 77% of suicide deaths in W ashington were males. Men 75 and older had the highest rate, while men 45 to 64 had the highest total number of suicides. National data link ed the recent economic recession to increases in middle- aged adult suicides, showing that external economic factors were in volved in 37% of suicides. F or elderly men, contributing factors include economic insecurit y, loss of significant relationships, loneliness, fear of being a burden, and the ph ysical and mental stresses of aging (WSDOH, 2016). In men, signs of suicidal ideation include social withdr awal, anger , and reduced problem solving capacit y. Signs of suicide attempt include statements of suicidal intent, calmness, anger , apath y, hopelessness, risk -taking, and appearing \"at peace. \" Signs preceding death by suicide include desper ation and frustr ation in the face of unsolv able problems, helplessness, worthlessness, statements of suicidal intent, and emergence of a positiv e mood state (Hunt et al. , 2017). Among women in the United States, suicide is concentr ated in the 35 to 64 y ears age group (64.8%), peaking among women aged 45 to 54 y ears. From 50 y ears of age, the suicide r ates among women tend to diminish progressiv ely, until old age, when r ates start increasing again (Mendez -Bustos et al. , 2013). Suicide Rates by Age in the United States (2014) Case A 69- year-old Caucasian man\u2014 a retired builder with a medical history of chronic depression\u2014 was brought to hospital after a failed suicide attempt. The attempt consisted of self -asphyxiation with car exhaust fumes and shooting himself three times with a three- inch nail gun. The initial shot w as directed upw ard through the submental triangle behind the chin. It pierced his tongue, upper denture plate, and hard palate, effectiv ely pinning his mouth shut. The subsequent two shots were fired into the fourth intercostal space immediately left of the sternum. On admission to the emergency department the patient w as distressed but hemodynamically stable. An examination rev ealed nail gun entry wounds on his left anterior chest w all over the precordial area, and at the submandibular area under his chin, pinning his mouth closed. The nails within the thor ax could not be confidently located on chest X -ray; howev er, transthor acic echocardiogr aphy suggested a possibly penetr ated into the right v entricle. There w as no associated pericardial effusion. In light of the potential for r apid deterior ation, the patient w as immediately tr ansferred to the operating room where prepar ations atory midline sternotom y and potential for r urgent surgical explor uncertaint y in the location of the intrathor acic nails meant the exact nature of the surgical repair w as not defined and provision for lung separ ation needed to be planned for . In this case, the chest x -ray failed to allow an adequate view of the nail within the thor ax. Although tr ansthor acic echocardiogr aphy suggested the nail had penetr ated the right v entricle, the exact location of the nail w as not clear . Cardiopulmonary b ypass w as initiated to facilitate surgical exposure. During cardiopulmonary b ypass the endobronchial balloon w as deflated, as lung isolation w as not required, and cardiac repair w as completed unev entfully . Removal of the nail from his mouth required a small incision into the hard palate and extr action using surgical pliers, removing the nail from his hard palate, upper denture, and tongue. The patient made an excellent reco very and w as discharged fiv e days later to a psy chiatric communit y hospital for ongoing psy chological rehabilitation. Source: et al., and Assessm entIn the United States, about 33% of people who tak e their life ha ve been in contact with mental health services the y ear before death and nearly half of people who took their life were seen in primary care the month before death (McCabe et al. , 2017). Despite the seriousness and univ ersalit y of this problem, instruments that ev aluate and predict suicide ideation and beha vior are lacking (Harris et al. , 2015). Determining who is at risk for suicide, using either tests or clinical judgment, is extremely difficult, primarily because suicide is a relativ ely rare ev ent. Nev ertheless, suicide risk screening and assessment are v aluable clinical tools because they can ensure that those requiring more services get the help that they need. In other words, it is not necessary to have a crystal ball if the assessment information shows that a client fits the profile of an individual at significant risk (CS AT, 2015). Suicide risk measures t ypically ha ve two goals: (1) to assess current suicide ideation and (2) to assess the potential for future suicidal beha viors (Harris et al. , 2015). A good clinical assessment can in itself be the start of suicide prev ention efforts. Howev er, several recent reviews ha ve examined the predictiv e validity of suicide assessment instruments, demonstr ating poor performance in the prediction of subsequent suicide attempt and suicide. Nev ertheless, guidelines ha ve been dev eloped to aid clinicians in this challenging endea vor, and assessment instruments can supplement the clinical ev aluation (R uneson et al., 2017). Although the U .S. Prev entive Services T ask Force concluded in 2013 that current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of screening the gener al population for suicide risk in a primary care setting, it concluded that screening is appropriate for high- risk individuals with known mental illnesses or substance use disorders (DV A/DOD , 2013). Within military organizations, screening for suicide risk is reportedly contro versial and has receiv ed mix ed support. There is no evidence that univ ersal screening in gener al military populations is beneficial, but it can be useful when combined with screening for substance use, depression, or PT SD. Therefore, to screen for suicide-related beha vior, it is essential that all v eterans receiv e screening for substance use, depression, and PT SD, because this will giv e \"red flags\" that these v eterans need future followup (NREPP , 2015). Structuring the Interview Any healthcare pro vider in an y setting ma y be called upon to ask a patient about suicidal ideation and beha vior. Because this is not easy , providers are encour aged to pr actice their interview skills at home b y dev eloping and pr acticing questions until they are comfortable leading a patient through an assessment. Understanding when a referr al is needed is a critical part of the assessment; an yone thought to be at risk for suicide should be referred.Assessing risk in clinical pr actice depends on the skills and philosophical approach of the individual clinician. There are guidelines on what to assess\u2014life history , previous suicide attempts, and mental state\u2014 along with fr ameworks for how to assess risk. There is less guidance on how to interview patients about suicidal ideation (ie, thinking about, considering, or planning suicide). This is important because the w ay questions are ask ed\u2014 the words and phr asing used b y a clinician\u2014influences the patient 's response (McCabe et al., 2017). Asking About Safety Begin y our interview b y asking about y our patient 's safet y. This should start with a gener al, open-ended question. An example of a gener al question might be \"Has something happened recently that has affected y our well-being?\" A person might respond b y saying, for example, \"My dog just died\u2014she w as my whole life. \" If there is no answer or a pause, ask a more direct question. F or example, y ou might ask \"Now that y our dog has died, what else in y our life will bring y ou joy?\" This might be followed b y a question of concern such as: \"I wonder \u2014has the thought of hurting y ourself entered y our mind?\" If someone is depressed, they ma y have trouble organizing their thoughts, causing a delayed response. Be patient and giv e time for an answer . Note the amount of time needed to respond. Dev elop a series of questions y ou are comfortable with in order to mak e a determination about the lev el of care needed for patient safet y to be preserv ed. Healthcare pro viders must tak e responsibilit y for asking uncomfortable questions. If y ou don't practice and are not fluent with questions about suicide ideation and beha viors, things can get a wkward. Asking a difficult question does not plant the idea of suicide. Although y es/no questions are prev alent in medical inter actions, they can communicate an expectation in fa vor of either a y es or no response. F or example, \" Are y ou feeling low?\" invites agreement to \"feeling low .\" Con versely , \"Not feeling low?\" in vites agreement to \"not feeling low .\" Specific words with positiv e or negativ e polarit y further reinforce bias. ords \"an \"ever,\" or Any negativ e thoughts?\") while words such as \"some\" reinforce positiv e bias (eg, \"Do y ou ha ve some pain here?\") (McCabe et al. , 2017). Three Components of Safety Safety can be thought of as ha ving three components: connection, protection, and control. When considering a suicidal patient 's experience, safet y is related to more than the absence of suicide risk and the need for ph ysical protection. T o be safe, patients must feel a connection with healthcare professionals, be protected against their own suicidal impulses, and ha ve a sense of control o ver their liv es. Source: Berg et al., 2017. If a patient 's response indicates an intention to harm the self , a healthcare pro vider's next act is to refer the patient to someone who is licensed to decide about an in voluntary hold. In larger healthcare organizations, psy chiatric services are directly a vailable. P atients who agree to be hospitaliz ed must be placed in the least restrictiv e environment. Depending on the lev el of risk, patients can be held against their wishes. Determining whether a patient is safe (and whether they can be held against their will) is left to pro viders who are legally licensed to mak e that determination. Asking About Safety: Margo Background Margo is a 27- year-old woman who presented in y our office for treatment following a suicide attempt. She had slit her wrists 2 weeks before and w as recently discharged from the hospital psy ch ward. Assessment When Margo is ask ed if she ev er tried to harm herself in the past \u2014how man y times and in what w ays\u2014she replied: \"The first time I thought about suicide, I took a bottle of aspirin. The second time I w as 17 and I slit m y wrists but I screamed when I sa w the blood. T wo weeks ago , I was upset when m y boyfriend brok e up with me and I slit m y wrists in a w arm bathtub .\" When assessing a person for suicidal ideation and beha viors, start b y asking broad questions and get more specific as the interview proceeds. A void yes/no questions, which can communicate an expectation in fa vor of either a y es or no response. Discussion At this point in y our assessment, it ma y be unclear whether Margo has a clear intention of taking her life or if she requires higher lev els of protection than someone with less inclination tow ard dying. An instrument such as the Beck Suicide Intention Scale ma y be helpful in assessing Margo' s intent. The k ey point about Margo is that her attempts ha ve acceler ated and become more sophisticated. K eep in mind that the more times a person attempts suicide, the more likely they are to complete the ev ent. In Margo' s case, this should increase y our concerns about future risk. Understanding the lev el of risk will guide y our decision about safety, which is the first priorit y. What Actions Should You Take? Margo has just been released from protectiv e custody . What do y ou think is the most effectiv e care she should receiv e? A followup phone call ev ery month from her doctor . a. Monitoring, outreach, ther apy, and case management. b. Threatening her with protectiv e custody if she is unable to handle the stresses in her life.c.Correct answer: b Bottom Line Because suicide attempts are known to be a strong predictor of future attempts and deaths by suicide, continuity of care is critical. For Margo, who has survived a suicide attempt, effective clinical care should focus on community and family support, therapy, and lethal means restriction. Understanding the level of risk for suicide guides your decision about safety, which is the first priority. Patients who have a clear intention of taking their life require higher levels of protection than those with less inclination toward dying. High-risk patients may require inpatient care, which offers an increased level of supervision and higher intensity of care. Those at intermediate and low acute risk may be referred to an outpatient care setting. With appropriate support and safety plans, lower risk patients may be able to be followed up in the community (DVA/DOD, 2013). Assessment of Lethality Once safety has been discussed, ask about lethality, which focuses on the method used, the circumstances surrounding the attempt, and the chance of rescue. Lethalit y is related to the severity of physical consequences as well as the amount of medical intervention needed following an attempt (Kar et al., 2014). When assessing lethality, try to determine how well thought out the plan is and whether the person has access to the means to complete the plan. Note an y additional circumstances and try to evaluate the \"risk tipping point.\" Determine if it is necessary to take an action that deprives a patient of his or her rights vs. not taking an action that might result in suicide. The lethality of suicidal behavior can be considered to have five levels: subliminal, low, moderate, high, and extremely high (Kar et al., 2014).Encouraging her to move back home with her parents so they can closely monitor her behavior.d.Five Levels of Lethality There is often a mismatch between the intent of the suicidal act and the lethalit y of the method chosen. Clients who genuinely want to die (and expect to die) may survive because their method was not foolproof or because they were interrupted or rescued. However potentially lethal the chosen method is, remember that a prior suicide attempt is a highly potent risk factor for eventually dying by suicide. Also remember that any suicide attempt must be taken seriously, including those that involve little risk of death, and any suicidal thoughts must be carefully considered in relation to the client 's history and current presentation (CSAT, 2015). Understanding Warning Signs Warning signs are indications of suicidal ideation and behavior that are observed by or reported to another, and indicate risk for suicide within minutes, hours, or days. About 80% of people who attempt suicide show some sort of warning sign. Knowing and recognizing these signs can help family and friends take action before suicidal thinking turns into action (WSDOH, 2016). Warning signs can be acute and urgent or simply red flags for concern. Widely accepted general suicide signs include: Anxiety, agitation, sleeplessness, or mood swings Feeling that there is no reason to live; purposelessness Rage, anger, or aggression Recklessness, engaging in risky activities without thinking Increasing alcohol or drug abuse Withdrawing from family and friendsSubliminal \u2014the lowest level. Death is impossible to highly improbable. 1. Low. Death is improbable and is not the usual outcome, but may be possible as a secondary complication of factors other than the suicidal behavior.2. Moderate . Probability of death is in the middle order. 3. High. Chance of death is high and is the usual or likely outcome of the suicidal act.4. Extremely high. Chance of survival is minimal and death is considered almost certain. (Kar et al., 2014)5.Hopelessness Feeling trapped (USDVA, 2016a) Recognizing warning signs, knowing how and where to get help, and making timely referrals can save a life. In one study, researchers tested the ability of common signs of suicide to differentiate between suicidal ideation, non-ideation, and suicide attempts. Although all signs of suicide differentiated suicidal ideation and non-ideation, only anger/aggression was predictive of suicide attempts (Hunt et al., 2017). Kathleen In the two-and-a-half years since my son's death I have learned that his story is, sadly, not uncommon. I have become oddly close with other mystified parents of seemingly successful, engaged, social young men and women who took their lives. They are my partners in grief, and in understanding why suicide is the number two killer of youth in Washington State, just behind accidents. My son retrieved a gun that was unlocked because it had not been fired in many years and we didn't think there was any ammunition in the house. Although we have learned that he was showing some warning signs, I will never know what he was thinking, because that gun left him with no chance of survival. My son was a trained marksman who had attended gun camp every summer. He had also taken the hunter safety class, and was, as his hunting mentor said, \"safer with a gun than any adult I know.\" I have great respect for the people who trained my son, but not once did any of the safety materials include warnings for parents of youth that 79% of firearm deaths in Washington State are suicides. I had not dreamed that my son was suicidal, much less that he would consider using a gun to take his life. I sincerely hope that other parents safely store firearms and ammunition out of the reach of children. Kathleen Gilligan, whose son Palmerston Burk died from suicide by firearm in King County in 2012 Source: WSDOH, 2016. Recognition of warning signs is the key to creating an opportunity for early assessment and intervention. Three warning signs require immediate attention. Presence of one or more of these behaviors is a strong indication that further assessment is needed: Communicating suicidal thought verbally or in writing, especially if this is unusual or related to a personal crisis or loss Seeking access to lethal means such as firearms or medicationsDemonstrating preparatory behaviors such as putting affairs in order (USDVA, 2016a) Substance Abuse and Suicide Risk Suicide is a leading cause of death among people who abuse alcohol and drugs. Compared with the general population, individuals treated for alcohol abuse or dependence are at about 10 times greater risk for suicide; people who inject drugs are at about 14 times greater risk for suicide. Depression\u2014a common co-occurring diagnosis among people who abuse substances\u2014also confers risk for suicidal behavior. People with substance use disorders often seek treatment at times when their substance use difficulties are at their peak\u2014a vulnerable period that may be accompanied by suicidal thoughts and behaviors (CSAT, 2015). According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), from 2005 to 2011, drug-related emergency department visits involving suicide attempts: Increased 51% in among individuals aged 12 or older Increased 58% among patients aged 18 to 29 More than doubled for patients aged 45 to 64 doubled (104% increase)Substance Use Disorders The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition (DSM-5), no longer uses the terms substance abuse and substance dependence, rather it refers to substance use disorders, which are defined as mild, moderate, or severe to indicate the level of severity, which is determined by the number of diagnostic criteria met by an individual. Substance use disorders occur when the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs causes clinically and functionally significant impairment, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. According to the DSM-5, a diagnosis of substance use disorder is based on evidence of impaired control, social impairment, risky use, and pharmacologic criteria. The most common substance use disorders in the United States include:Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) Tobacco Use Disorder Cannabis Use Disorder Stimulant Use Disorder Hallucinogen Use Disorder Opioid Use Disorder Source: SAMSHA, 2015. Even when someone with a substance use disorder is in treatment, the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts remains high. There is also a significant prev alence of suicide among those who have at one time been in substance abuse treatment. Because of this, substance abuse treatment providers must routinely assess and refer clients at risk for suicidal behavior. Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are also a significant indicator of other co-occurring disorders (eg, major depression, bipolar disorder , PTSD, schizophrenia, and some personality disorders) that must be explored, diagnosed, and addressed (CSAT, 2015). Clients in substance abuse treatment should be screened for suicidal thoughts and behaviors routinely during intake and at specific points during the course of treatment. For this approach to be effective, providers must: Implement a treatment plan and coordinate the plan with other pro viders Check that referral appointments are keptMonitor clients b y coordinating with mental health pro viders, other pr actitioners, and family members Understand suicide w arning signs, risk factors, and protectiv e factors. Be empathic and nonjudgmental Understand how their own attitudes and experiences impact their clients Understand ethical and legal principles as well as potential areas of conflict (CS AT, 2015) Abstinence should be a primary goal of an y client with a substance use disorder and suicidal thoughts or beha viors. F or most clients abstinence reduces risk, although some individuals remain at risk ev en after achieving this goal. These can include: Clients with independent depression (does not resolv e with abstinence or is not substance induced) Clients with unresolv ed difficulties that promote suicidal thoughts Clients who ha ve a mark ed personalit y disturbance such as borderline personalit y disorder Those with tr auma histories such as sexual abuse history Individuals with a major psy chiatric illness (CS AT, 2015) Suicid e Risk F actors Although it is difficult to predict who will attempt suicide, increased risk is associated with suicidal ideation or plans, non-suicidal self -injurious beha viors, and suicide attempts (F osse et al., 2017). T wo of the strongest predictors of suicide risk are mental illness and substance abuse (WSDOH, 2016). Increased risk is also associated with gender , lack of support systems, genetic liabilit y, childhood experiences, and the a vailabilit y of lethal means. Individuals at a greater risk for completed suicide ha ve been found to be male, older , and impulsiv e, have multiple ph ysical ailments, a history of prior suicide attempts, psy chiatric illness, violence, or a family history of suicide (Hassamal et al. , 2015). Attempts to explain, predict, and prev ent suicide are limited due to its statistical r arity\u2014 suicide is ex ceedingly r are in comparison to associated risk factors. There are a great man y people who abuse alcohol, the majorit y of whom do not commit suicide; hence the positiv e predictiv e value of these risk factors is low . Nev ertheless, certain groups ha ve higher suicide attempt or completion r ates than the gener al population:Men o ver 45 y ears old for suicide death Women and girls for self -inflicted injury American Indians and Alaska Nativ es People from areas with higher po verty and lower education lev els People who are institutionaliz ed People who ha ve been victims of violence, or are homeless Veterans, members of the armed forces, and their families People living in small, rur al communities People who ha ve had contact with criminal justice and child welfare systems People with mental illness and substance abuse disorders People who ha ve previously attempted suicide Members of certain r acial and ethnic minorit y groups, for example, Latina y Lesbian, ga y, bisexual, tr ansgender , queer , and questioning populations, particularly youth who ha ve been rejected b y their families (WSDOH, 2016) Although a large proportion of suicides could be a voided with effectiv e treatment of mental disorders, 50% to 75% of those in need receiv e inadequate treatment. The under - recognition of mental conditions seriously limits the potential to identif y and appropriately treat individuals at risk for suicide (DV A/DOD , 2013). Source: WSD OH, 2016.Risk Factors for Suicide Individual Relationship Community Societal Previous attempt(s) History of mental disorders, esp. clinical depression History of alcohol and substance abuse Feelings of hopelessness Impulsive or aggressive tendencies Losses Illness and disabilityFamily history of suicide Family history of child maltreatment Isolation or feelings of isolationLocal epidemics of suicide Barriers to accessing mental health servicesEasy access to lethal means Cultural and religious beliefs Unwillingness to seek help because of stigma Mental Illness and Suicide Risk Suicide is o verrepresented in people with mental illness (F osse et al. , 2017); o ver 90% of suicide victims ha ve a diagnosable mental health and/or substance use disorder (DVA/DOD , 2013). The odds for suicide in sev ere depression, schiz ophrenia, and bipolar disorder are appro ximately 3 to 10 times that of the gener al population, with a higher increased risk in males than females. Despite this, mental illness is a poor predictor of suicidal ideation and beha vior since suicide does not occur in 95% to 97% of all cases (Fosse et al. , 2017). In psy chiatric inpatients, an arr ay of risk factors for suicide has been identified. A person admitted for inpatient treatment in a specializ ed mental health facilit y has a 50- to 200- times increased suicide risk compared to the population at large. In two meta- analyses that included 42 studies and close to 3,500 suicide completers, centr al suicide risk factors were: Prior suicide attempts and deliber ate self -harm Family history of suicide Suicidal ideation Depression, hopelessness AgitationSocial or relationship problems (F osse et al. , 2017) In addition to the risk associated with alcohol and substance abuse, a poor social network and social withdr awal, command hallucinations, delusions, diagnosis of mental disorders other than depression are thought to increase risk. This can include bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, coexisting significant ph ysical illness, family history of mental illness, multiple admissions to inpatient treatment, unplanned discharge, and prescription of antidepressants (F osse et al. , 2017). Impulsivit y and disinhibition are o verarching issues related to suicidal ideation and behaviors. In fact, angry impulsivit y has been repeatedly identified as a risk factor for suicidal beha vior. Although impulsivit y is found in a wide r ange of diagnoses, it is highly associated with bipolar disorder , substance abuse, and certain personalit y disorders as well as a history of early child abuse (F awcett, 2012). Preventing Suicide in All the Wrong Ways Despite the increased risk of suicidal ideation and beha viors in people with mental health disorders, mental health adv ocates regularly o verstate the prev alence of suicide and suicide attempts among persons with mental illness. A t the high end, the National Alliance on Mental Illness claims, \"More than 90% of y outh suicide victims ha ve at least one major psychiatric disorder .\" Mental Health America , a trade association for pro viders of mental \"health\" services, estimates \"30% to 70% of suicide victims suffer from major depression or bipolar (manic -depressiv e) disorder .\" Suicide is not alw ays the irr ational act of a sick mind. Mental illness in people who commit suicide is often diagnosed after the fact. After someone tak es his or her own life, we look for a cause. If they tak e their life after losing their spouse or job , receiv ed a bad grade in school, or receiv ed a new medical diagnosis, we chalk it up to depression and put the suicide in the mental illness column. In spite of being o verstated, it is clear that suicide does disproportionately affect people with mental illness. Studies looking at the prev alence of suicide among the seriously mentally ill, as well as studies of the prev alence of serious mental illness among those who attempt suicide, found about 5,000 of the 38,000 suicides (about 14%) were in people with serious mental illness. This is three times as high as the gener al population. Source: DJ Jaffe, Preventing Suicide in All the Wrong Ways, 2014. Medical Issues and Suicide RiskIllness, stressful life ev ents, and certain medical conditions increase vulner ability and are associated with an increased risk for suicidal ideation and beha vior. This can include chronic pain, cognitiv e changes that mak e it difficult to mak e decisions and solv e problems, and the challenge related to long-term conditions and limitations (HHS , 2012). Trauma can also be a risk factor for suicide. Although some individuals who experience trauma mo ve on with few symptoms, man y\u2014especially those who experience repeated or multiple tr aumas\u2014suffer a v ariety of negativ e physical and psy chological effects. T rauma exposure has been link ed to later substance abuse, mental illness, increased risk of suicide, obesit y, heart disease, and early death (S AMHS A, 2011). Co-morbid conditions ma y increase the lik elihood that a suicide attempt becomes a completed suicide. F or example if a person with a chronic condition such as hepatitis C swallows a bottle of acetaminophen, they are lik ely to suffer sev ere liv er damage. By the same tok en, a person with sev ere anemia ma y not surviv e a suicide attempt in volving a significant loss of blood. Immigrants and Suicide Risk Immigr ants might ha ve higher r ates of psy chopathology and suicidal beha vior than the host populations, due to exposure to the stress of the migr ating to an unfamiliar country . Severing links with their country of origin, the loss of status and social network, a sense of inadequacy because of language barriers, unemplo yment, financial problems, a sense of not belonging, and feelings of ex clusion can affect a person' s desire to enter into a relationships with others, and cause a v ariety of psy chiatric disorders such as depression, anxiet y, post -traumatic stress disorder , addiction to alcohol and drugs, and lead to loneliness and hopelessness, and suicidal beha viors (R atkowska & De Leo , 2013). Social isolation can cause a person to liv e a condition similar to berea vement, caused b y the loss of their previous social structure and culture. The most missed aspects are the language (especially colloquial language and dialect), attitudes, v alues and social support networks. The pain for these losses is a natur al consequence of emigr ation. Howev er, if the suffering causes significant distress or impairment and lasts for a long period of time, professional support ma y be necessary (R atkowska & De Leo , 2013). Migration poses a risk not only for immigr ants but also for the families who remain in the country of origin. F or example, it has been observ ed that the next of kin of Mexican immigr ants in the United States were at greater risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts than Mexicans without a family history of emigr ation. Emigr ation can weak en family ties, lead to feelings of loneliness and insecurit y, and increase the risk of suicide among family members who remain at home (R atkowska & De Leo , 2013).Immigr ants from predominantly collectivist societies ma y face serious problems of adaptation. This could result in a real or perceiv ed lack of adequate social support system, disparit y between expectations and realit y, and low self -esteem. Man y immigr ants undergo radical changes in their social status and ma y also be subject to discrimination. This could be an additional risk factor for suicide, as evidenced b y one of the U .S. studies where immigr ant's suicide r ates were positiv ely correlated with the negativ e words used b y the majorit y to describe their ethnic group (R atkowska & De Leo , 2013). In most studies conducted in Europe, America, and A ustralia, the highest risk of suicide was found in immigr ants from northern Europe (including the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Finland), and Eastern Europe (especially from R ussia and Hungary). The lowest risk w as found in immigr ants from southern Europe and the Middle East (R atkowska & De Leo , 2013). With regard to immigr ants from Asian countries, the risk of suicide seems gener ally low for men but appreciably higher for women. The r ates v ary, therefore, not only in relation to the country of origin but also for sex of the immigr ant. F or example, in a study conducted in the United States, Asian, black, and Hispanic men had the lowest risk of suicide, while non-Hispanic white and Asian women had higher risk than the host population (R atkowska & De Leo , 2013). The high suicide r ates among immigr ants from Northern and Eastern Europe might be partly explained b y the high alcohol consumption t ypical of these countries. F or example, there is a significant correlation between alcohol consumption and suicide in Finland; Finnish immigr ants who died b y undetermined causes of death in S weden also tend to ha ve high alcohol lev els in their blood. A similar trend w as found in R ussia, where suicide r ates related to alcohol abuse are v ery high, and among R ussian immigr ants who died b y suicide in Estonia (R atkowska & De Leo , 2013). The low r ates of suicide among immigr ants from southern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia ma y be due to some protectiv e factors, such as the strong influence of tr aditional values, family , and religious beliefs. These countries are more collectivist, ha ve strong family ties and a strong group identit y outside their country of origin. Both in Catholic and Muslim countries, religion ma y be a strong deterrent to suicide, which is considered a sin in the Catholic religion and is forbidden b y Islamic la w. The protectiv e role of religion could also depend on the ties with the religious communit y, which might represent a strong source of social support (R atkowska & De Leo , 2013).Among asylum seek ers, those at higher risk for suicide are y oung, male, low income, with past tr aumatic experiences, and lack of social support. R efugees and asylum seek ers often have sev eral of these risk factors. R efugees are perhaps the most vulner able group of all immigr ants: they are often fleeing w ar, torture, and persecution, and suffering with PT SD, depression, and anxiet y. Lack of adequate prepar ation, the w ay in which they are receiv ed in the destination country , poor living conditions, and lack of social support and isolation usually add to these vulner abilities. R efugees ma y also feel guilt y for lea ving the lo ved ones at home or for their death. The sense of guilt, together with isolation and pathologic symptoms due to tr auma, ma y be a strong risk factor for suicide (R atkowska & De Leo , 2013). Diagnostic Dilemma: Psychosis or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder A 32- year-old black African, Muslim woman with a history of both PT SD and psy chosis presented to mental health services for the first time with a history of auditory and visual hallucinations, persecutory delusions, suicidal ideation, recurring nightmares, h yper- arousal, and insomnia. She reported seeing blood on the w alls, men in white following her , and hearing v oices sa ying that some men were coming to get her . These symptoms were worse at night. She became v ery distressed and troubled to the point of w anting to end her life. Her background history suggested co-morbid PT SD. Twelve years ago , she sa w her family (parents, sisters and brother) being killed during the civil w ar in her birth country in Africa. Her clinical PT SD symptoms, such as the recurring nightmares, h yper-arousal, and insomnia, began shortly afterw ards. Eight y ears later , she came to the United Kingdom as an asylum seek er. During her first few y ears in the UK, she had no social support, w as unable to speak English, experienced homelessness and w as unsuccessful in gaining asylum. Her auditory and visual hallucinations and persecutory delusions started at this time. A few months before her first contact with mental health services, her psy chotic symptoms and PT SD features became more frequent and intense. With no stable relationship she became pregnant and visited her gener al practitioner who referred her to our first -episode psy chosis unit.Upon admission, she presented as well-k empt y et she appeared distressed. She w as withdr awn and quiet and there w as some dela y in her responses to questions. She w as tearful and her mood w as low but reactiv e. She described vivid and clear auditory and visual hallucinations and persecutory delusions. Her medical psy chiatric, personal, and family histories were unremarkable. A ph ysical examination, neurological examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan were normal. The results of our routine blood in vestigations were in the normal r ange, and a pregnancy test w as positiv e. At our clinical interview , she clearly fulfilled the criteria for PT SD and psy chotic disorder not otherwise specified. Because of the intensit y of her symptoms, her distress and suicidal ideation, our mental health team recommended ongoing hospitalization. She w as started on trifluoper azine* (5 mg/da y) and cognitiv e-beha vioral ther apy for psy chosis. She also started a prenatal follow - up. She self -reported a partial impro vement in her clinical picture and her psy chotic symptoms gr adually resolv ed over a three- week period, although they occasionally resurfaced when she w as under stress or whenev er her medication compliance lapsed. She was discharged from hospital and is now living in tempor ary accommodation funded b y local services and w aiting for her asylum re- application to be processed. She continues to have ongoing PT SD symptoms associated with the initial tr agic ev ent as persistent remembering of the stressor ev ent with recurring and vivid memories, nightmares, h yper- arousal and initial insomnia. She also a voids circumstances resembling the initial stressor event, such as w ars and violence. * Trifluoperazine (Stelazine) is a typical antipsychotic primarily used to treat schizophrenia. It is part of a class of drugs called phenothiazines. Source: Co entre & Power, 2016. Actions and Referrals for Various Lev els o f Risk Because risk occurs on a continuum, assessment, management, and referr als will be different for each situation. Identif ying at -risk individuals, accessing services, and relying on evidence-based care remain k ey challenges. Simply impro ving or expanding services does not guar antee that services will be used, nor will it necessarily increase the number of people who follow recommended referr als or treatment (Stone et al. , 2017).The suicide continuum begins with suicidal thoughts, ev olving into a wish to die, consolidated into an intention to act, and resulting in a plan to end one' s life. The ev olution of these steps can occur o ver minutes or y ears. Each step along the continuum presents an opportunit y to interv ene and prev ent the act of self -directed violence. Often, the first opportunit y to assess an individual' s suicide risk occurs because of w arning signs that are identified b y a caregiv er, gatek eeper , or lo ved one. Howev er, all too often a patient 's risk is identified after a suicide attempt is made (V A/DOD , 2013). For people who surviv e a suicide attempt, the period after an emergency department (ED) visit is a time of high risk. R eductions in subsequent suicide deaths ha ve occurred b y engaging patients in timely treatment and pro viding followup services after discharge from the ED . Adults who receiv e medical care immediately after a suicide attempt are more likely to receiv e mental health treatment compared to those who did not receiv e medical care. The ED pro vides an important opportunit y to assess the patient's mental health needs and pro vide followup resources at a particularly critical juncture (Cr ane, 2016). Importance of Secondary Suicide Risk Screening In a multicenter study of 1,376 emergency department patients with recent suicide attempts or ideation, an interv ention consisting of secondary suicide risk screening b y the ED ph ysician, discharge resources, and post -ED telephone calls resulted in a 5% absolute decrease in the proportion of patients subsequently attempting suicide and a 30% decrease in the total number of suicide attempts o ver a 52- week followup period. Source: Co yne, 2017. Levels of Risk High acute risk for suicidal ideation and beha vior includes patients with w arning signs, serious thoughts of suicide, a plan or intent to engage in lethal self -directed violence, a recent suicide attempt, or those with prominent agitation, impulsivit y, or psy chosis. In such cases, clinicians should ensure constant observ ation and monitoring before arr anging for immediate tr psy chiatric ev aluation or hospitalization (DV A/DOD , 2013). A person with high risk ma y be in danger of crossing a threshold and acting on suicidal impulses when they experience some \"last str aw,\" some unbear able insult or burden that seems to mak e life unliv able. When in this state of thinking, external controls ma y be needed to prev ent a suicidal act. Some interv ention ma y become necessary to interfere with the tr ajectory tow ard death, such as restriction of access to the means of completing a suicidal act. This ma y prev ent a fatal act, but does not necessarily resolv e the suicidal impulse or crisis (DV A/DOD , 2013).Intermediate acute risk includes patients with suicidal ideation and a plan but with no intent or prepar atory beha vior. A combination of w arning signs and risk factors might include a history of self -directed violence or previous suicide attempt (DV A/DOD , 2013). Patients at this lev el of risk should be ev aluated b y a beha vioral health pro vider. The decision whether to urgently refer a patient to a mental health professional or ED depends on the patient 's presentation. If closer ev aluation rev eals that the lev el of illness or other clinical findings w arrant a higher lev el of care, the patient ma y be hospitaliz ed. If , in conjunction with the pro vider, a patient feels he or she is capable of maintaining safet y using non-injurious coping methods and a safet y plan, the patient ma y be managed in outpatient care (DV A/DOD , 2013). Low acute risk patients include those with recent suicidal ideation who ha ve no specific plans or intent to engage in lethal self -directed violence and ha ve no history of activ e suicidal beha vior. Consider consultation with a beha vioral health specialist to determine the need for referr al to treatment that will address symptoms and safet y issues. These patients should be followed up for reassessment (DV A/DOD , 2013). Those not at an elevated risk for suicide include patients that at some point in the past had reported thoughts about death or suicide, but currently don' t have any of these symptoms. There is no indication to consult with beha vioral health specialists in these cases, and the patients should be followed in routine care, continue to receiv e treatment for their disorder , and be re-ev aluated periodically for thoughts and ideation (DV A/DOD , 2013).

Documentation includes pro viding a written summary of an y steps tak en, along with a statement of conclusions that shows the r ationale for the plan. The plan should mak e good sense in light of the seriousness of risk (CS AT, 2015). Documenting Fernando, Iraqi War Veteran The following is from a progress note for F ernando , a 22- year-old Hispanic male and Ir aq war veteran who w as doing well in treatment for dependence on alcohol and opiates, but had missed his group ther apy sessions and not returned phone calls for the past 10 da ys. This situation occurred in a substance abuse clinic within a hospital and required immediate supervision and interv entions of high intensit y.Step One: Gather Information Fernando came in, unannounced, at 10:30 a.m. toda y and reported that he relapsed on alcohol and opiates 10 da ys ago and has been using daily and hea vily since. Breathalyz er was 0.08, and he reported using two bags of heroin earlier this morning. He reported that he held his loaded rifle in his lap last night while high and drunk, contemplating suicide. Gathering information in volves collecting relev ant facts. Screening questions should be asked of all new clients when y ou note w arning signs and an y time y ou ha ve a concern about suicide, whether or not y ou can pinpoint the reason. Inquiries about suicidal ideation and attempts should start with an open-ended question that in vites the client to pro vide more information. F ollowup questions are then ask ed to gather additional, critical information. R outine monitoring of suicide risk should be a basic standard in all substance abuse treatment progr ams. Step Two: Access Supervision or Consultation Upon consultation with a supervisor , it was determined that emergency interv ention w as needed because of intense substance use, suicidal thoughts with a lethal plan, and access to a weapon. Consultation is a formal process whereb y information and advice are obtained from (a) a professional with clear supervisory responsibilities, (b) a multidisciplinary team that includes such people, and/or (c) a consultant experienced in managing suicidal clients who has been v etted b y your agency for this purpose. Immediate supervision or consultation should be obtained when clients exhibit direct suicide w arning signs or when, at intak e, they report ha ving made a recent suicide attempt. Substance abuse relapse during treatment is also an indication for supervisory involvement for clients who ha ve a history of suicidal beha vior or attempts. You should not mak e a judgment about the seriousness of suicide risk or try to manage suicide risk on y our own unless y ou ha ve an adv anced mental health degree and specializ ed training in suicide risk management and it is understood b y your agency that you are qualified to manage such risk independently . Step Three: Take Responsible Action At 11:00 a.m. , a hospital securit y guard and this writer escorted F ernando to the ED , where he w as check ed in. He w as cooper ative throughout the process.A useful guiding principle in taking responsible action is that y our actions should mak e good sense in light of the seriousness of suicide risk. Seriousness is defined as the likelihood that a suicide attempt will occur and the potential consequences of an attempt. Judgments about the degree of seriousness of risk should be made in consultation with a supervisor or a treatment team, not b y a healthcare pro vider acting alone. In some instances, an immediate response is required. Examples of immediate actions include arr anging tr ansportation to a hospital ED for ev aluation, contacting a spouse to have him or her arr ange to remo ve a gun from the home and arr ange safe stor age, and arranging on the spot to ha ve a mental health specialist further ev aluate a client. Examples of non-immediate, but important, actions include making a referr al for a client to an outpatient mental health facilit y for ev aluation, scheduling the client to see a psy chiatrist for possible medication management, and ordering past mental health records from another pro vider. Step Four: Follow Up Dr. McInt yre, the ED ph ysician, determined that F ernando requires hospitalization. He is currently a waiting admission. This writer will follow up with the hospital unit after he is admitted and will r aise the issue of his access to a gun. Suicide prev ention efforts are not one-time actions. They should be ongoing because suicidal clients are vulner able to a recurrence of risk. A team approach is also essential, as it requires y ou to follow up on referr als and coordinate with other pro viders in an ongoing manner . Source: CS AT, 2015. Management of Suicide Risk Effectiv e management of mental health conditions (particularly major depression) can reduce the risk of suicide and ma y decrease suicide r ates. This includes impro ving access to mental health services, counseling and other psy chosocial services, encour aging use of crisis lines, and pharmaceutical treatments (discussed in Module 6). It is important that interv ention and treatment be direct and specific to address potential risk factors (DVA/DOD , 2013). Because suicide attempts are known to be a strong predictor of future attempts and deaths by suicide, continuit y of care is critical. Effectiv e clinical care should include monitoring patients for a suicide attempt after an ED visit or hospitalization and pro viding outreach, mental health followup , ther apy, and case management.In response to the high incidence of suicides, recent attention has focused on prev ention. In the United States, suicide prev ention str ategies include ph ysician education, lethal pharmacother apy, gatek eeper education, and psy chother apy. The success of these str ategies has v aried consider ably. Physician education, lethal means restriction, and gatek eeper education ha ve had the greatest impact on decreasing suicide rates (Hassamal et al. , 2015). Improving Access to Mental Health Services Unfortunately , although most W ashingtonians ha ve some form of health insur ance, nearly half of the population faces barriers to healthcare services because of geogr aphy and income challenges. Limited access to tr ansportation as well as difficult y accessing ph ysical and beha vioral healthcare services increases risk and reduces communit y integr ation and wellbeing (WSDOH, 2016). Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas About 75% of W ashington State is considered a Mental Health Professional Shortage Area b y feder al standards. More than 90% of the state is eligible for feder al funding to recruit and retain primary care pro viders. Affordable and accessible mental and gener al healthcare is critical to reducing suicide and must be tak en into account. Source: WSD OH, 2016. The w ay beha vioral healthcare is pro vided in W ashington is changing r apidly under the Healthier W ashington Initiativ e. Legislation has been passed directing the state to integr ate the pa yment and deliv ery of ph ysical and beha vioral health services under Medicaid b y 2020. Chemical dependency services ha ve been a vailable under managed care since 2016 (WSDOH, 2016). Psychosocial Interventions Many types of psy chosocial interv entions are beneficial for individuals who are experiencing suicidal ideation or beha viors. Psy chother apy is one t ype of psy chosocial interv ention that has been shown to reduce suicide risk. It can help people learn new w ays of dealing with stressful experiences, recogniz e patterns of thinking, and identif y alternativ e actions when thoughts of suicide arise (NIH, 2017).Psychotherapy usually takes place in a one-on-one or group format and can vary in duration from several weeks to ongoing therapy, as needed. Treatment that employs collaborative and integrated care can engage and motivate patients, increasing retention in therapy and decreasing suicide risk (Stone et al., 2017). Other psychosocial interventions are described in the following case. The Importance of Therapy: Terry Background On the morning of December 25, 2000, Terry Wise tried to kill herself by taking an overdose of Tylenol. She awoke two days later in the intensive care unit. Assessment in the ICU In the ICU, Terry received an evaluation from a social worker. Terry reported that the death of her husband from Lou Gehrig's disease was a trigger for her suicide attempt. She said she felt lost, didn't know what to do, and found no joy in living. During this initial assessment, Terry admitted that her attempt was the culmination of years of depression and other problems that started in her childhood. She said she w as overwhelmed by an intense emotional pain that had been building for years, and when her husband died the pain became unbearable. Discussion Certain groups have higher suicide attempt or completion rates than the general population. Terry has likely been living with clinical depression most of her adult life. Along with this suicide attempt, the death of her husband and her stated history of depression, Terry may be at increased risk for self-harm. What Actions Should You Take? Because suicide attempts are known to be a strong predictor of future attempts and deaths by suicide, continuity of care is critical. Once Terry is ready to be released from the ICU, what will help her the most? Correct answer: dEncouraging her to start dating again.a. Admitting her to a psychiatric hospital for a short time against her will.b. Making sure she doesn't have access to a gun.c. Referral to mental health services, counseling, and pharmaceutical treatments.d.Mental Health Services Terry agreed to start ther apy, and ultimately it changed her life. By working with a counselor , Terry realiz ed that the tr auma she experienced when she w as younger still affected her emotions as an adult. Her counselor helped her find w ays to cope with her feelings. Ther apy also allowed her to see how others would ha ve reacted to her death b y suicide. Most important, T erry's ther apist trusted her and respected her and, for T erry, her therapist's compassion made a huge difference. Bottom Line It is important that T erry's interv ention and treatment be direct and specific to address potential risk factors. Effectiv e management of mental health conditions (particularly major depression) can reduce the risk of suicide and ma y decrease suicide r ates. Terry's reco very w as a process.

It uses a risk -reduction, relapse prev ention approach that includes an analysis of risk factors and stressors (eg, relationship problems, school or work-related difficulties) leading up to and following the suicide attempt; safet y plan development; skill building; and psy cho-education (Stone et al. , 2017). CBT-SP also has family skill modules focused on family support and communication patterns as well as on impro ving the family' s problem-solving skills. A r andomiz ed controlled trial utilizing CB T-SP found that 10-session outpatient cognitiv e ther apy designed to prev ent repeat suicide attempts resulted in a 50% reduction in the lik elihood of a suicide re-attempt relativ e to treatment as usual among adults who had been admitted to an emergency department for a suicide attempt (Stone et al. a multi-component ther apy for individuals at high risk for suicide and who ma y struggle with impulsivit y and emotional regulation issues. DBT includes individual ther apy, group skills tr aining, between-session telephone coaching, and a ther apist consultation team. In a r andomiz ed controlled trial of women with recent suicidal or self -injurious beha vior, those receiving DB T were half as lik ely to mak e a suicide attempt at the two- year followup than women receiving communit y treatment. The women also required less hospitalization for suicide ideation, and had lower medical risk across all suicide attempts and self -injurious acts combined (Stone et al. , 2017). DBT has been shown to reduce the r ate of suicide among people with borderline personalit y disorder , a mental illness char acteriz ed by unstable moods, relationships, self - image, and beha vior. A ther apist tr ained in DB T can help a person recogniz e when his or her feelings or actions are disruptiv e or unhealth y, and teach the skills needed to deal better with upsetting situations (NIH, 2017). Improving Mood\u2014Promoting Access t o Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) TheImpro Mood\u2014Promoting Access to Collabor ative Treatment (IMP ACT) progr am aims to prev ent suicide among older primary care patients b y reducing suicide ideation and depression. IMP ACT facilitates the dev elopment of a ther apeutic alliance, a personaliz ed treatment plan that includes patient preferences, as well as proactiv e followup (biweekly during an acute phase and monthly during continuation phase) b y a depression care manager . The progr am has been shown to significantly impro ve qualit y of life, and to reduce functional impairment, depression and suicidal ideation o ver 24 months of followup relativ e to patients who receiv ed care as usual (Stone et al. , 2017). Collaborative Assessmen t and Management of Suicidality ative Assessment and Management of Suicidalit y (CAMS), is a ther apeutic approach for suicide-specific assessment and treatment. The progr am's flexible approach involves the clinician and patient working together to dev elop patient -specific treatment plans. Sessions in volve constant patient input about what is (and is not) working with the goal of enhancing the ther apeutic alliance and increasing treatment motiv ation in the suicidal patient (Stone et al. , 2017).CAMS has been tested and supported in six correlational studies, in a v ariety of inpatient and outpatient settings, and in one r andomiz ed controlled trial (RCT) with sev eral additional RCT s under w ay. A feasibilit y trial with a communit y-based sample of suicidal outpatients r andomly assigned to CAMS or enhanced care as usual (intak e with a psychiatrist or psy chiatric nurse pr actitioner followed b y 1 to 11 visits with a case manager and medication as needed) found better treatment retention among the CAMS group and significant impro vements in suicidal ideation, o verall symptom distress, and feelings of hopelessness at the 12-month followup (Stone et al. , 2017). Attachment-Based Attachment -Based F amily Ther apy (ABF T) is a progr am for adolescents aged 12 to 18 designed to treat clinically diagnosed major depressiv e disorder , eliminate suicidal ideation, and reduce dispositional anxiet y. An RB T using ABF T found that suicidal adolescents receiving ABF T experienced significantly greater impro vement in suicidal ideation o ver 24 weeks of followup than did adolescents assigned to enhanced usual care. Additionally , a significantly higher percentage of ABF T participants reported no suicidal ideation in the week prior to assessment at 12 weeks and again at 24 weeks than did adolescents receiving enhanced usual care (Stone et al. , 2017). Gatekeeper Training Gatek eeper tr aining\u2014 also called and referr al training\"\u2014helps people without formal psy chosocial tr aining pla y a critical role in suicide prev ention. It teaches educators, coaches, clergy , emergency responders, primary and urgent care pro viders, and others in the communit y to identif y people who ma y be at risk of suicide. It pro vides information on how to respond, including encour aging the at -risk person to seek treatment and support services. R esearch shows that man y at-risk people turn to family or friends for help . They often show w arning signs that family and friends ma y notice first. An at -risk person benefits from an informed support network ready to connect them to the right help (WSDOH, 2016). A Note on Language Training on recognizing a person at risk and connecting them to an appropriate resource is often called gatekeeper training . In some communities, the word gatekeeper is a reminder of people and systems that create barriers to getting help . Instead, the Washington State Department of Health recommends the term Recognition and Referral (R&R) training. Source: WSD OH, 2016. One closely studied gatek eeper progr am, Applied Suicide Interv ention Skills T raining (ASIST), helps hotline counselors, emergency work ers, and other gatek eepers identif y and connect with suicidal individuals and direct them to a vailable resources. In an RCT , researchers ev aluated the tr aining across the National Suicide Prev ention Lifeline network of hotlines during 2008-2009. Using data from 1,410 suicidal individuals who called 17 Lifeline centers, researchers found that callers who spok e with A SIST-trained counselors were significantly more lik ely to feel less depressed, less suicidal, less o verwhelmed, and more hopeful b y the end of their call, compared to callers who spok e to non- ASIST tr ained counselors. Counselors tr ained in A SIST were also more skilled at k eeping callers on the phone longer and establishing a connection with them (Stone et al. , 2017). Gatek eeper tr aining has been a primary component of the Garret Lee Smith (GLS) Suicide Prevention Progr am, which has been implemented in 50 states and 50 tribes. A multi-site evaluation assessed the impact of communit y gatek eeper tr aining on suicide attempts and deaths b y comparing the change in suicide r ates and nonfatal suicidal beha vior among young people aged 10 to 24 in counties implementing GLS tr ainings, with the tr ajectory observ ed in similar counties that did not implement these tr ainings. Counties that implemented GLS tr ainings had significantly lower y outh suicide r ates one y ear following the tr aining implementation. This finding equates to a decrease of 1 suicide death per 100,000 y outh ages 10 to 24, or the prev ention of appro ximately 237 deaths in the age group , between 2007 and 2010 (Stone et al. , 2017). Counties implementing GLS progr am activities also had significantly lower suicide attempt rates among y outh ages 16 to 23 in the y ear following implementation of the GLS progr am than did similar counties that did not implement GLS activities. More than 79,000 suicide attempts ma y have been prev ented during the period examined (Stone et al. , 2017). Crisis Lines Crisis interv ention progr ams pro vide support and referr al services, t ypically b y directing a person in crisis (or a friend or family member of someone at risk) to tr ained v olunteers or professional staff via telephone hotline, online chat, text messaging, or in person. Crisis interv ention approaches impact k ey risk factors for suicide, including feelings of depression, hopelessness, and subsequent mental healthcare utilization. Crisis interv entions can put space or time between an individual who ma y be considering suicide and harmful beha vior (Stone et al. , aluation of the effectiv eness of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to prev ent suicide, 1,085 suicidal individuals who called the hotline completed a standard risk assessment for suicide, and 380 of those completed a followup assessment between 1 and 52 da ys after the initial assessment. Researchers found that o ver half of the initial sample had a plan for their suicide when they called. R esearchers also found that among followup participants, there w as a significant decrease in psychological pain, hopelessness, and intent to die between initiation of the call (time 1) to followup (time 3). Between time 2 (end of the call) to time 3, the effect remained for psychological pain and hopelessness, but w as not significant for intent to die, suggesting that greater effort at outreach during and following the call is needed for callers with high levels of suicide intent (Stone et al. , 2017). Crisis lines pro vide immediate access, often 24 hours a da y, to crisis interv ention. They are an access point for emergency care, clinical assessment, referr al, and treatment. When other pro viders are closed and personal support networks are una vailable, crisis lines can be a lifeline for people at risk of suicide. Crisis lines are hea vily used. From October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015, almost 50,000 calls to the National Suicide Prev ention Lifeline originated in W ashington. Close to half of those calls were from people who selected the V eterans Crisis Line for help (WSDOH, 2016).

It is estimated that 75% of individuals who die b y suicide are in contact with a primary care ph ysician in the y ear before their death, and that 45% do so within one month of their death. In contr ast, only 20% of these patients sa w a mental health professional in the preceding month (HHS , 2012). Impro ving clinician skills to recogniz e and manage risk factors for suicide has been shown to reduce r ates of suicidal ideations in patients. The Prev ention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly: Collabor ative Trial (PROSPECT) found that primary care interv ention reduced suicidal ideations. Studies ha ve found that 70% of the elderly who committed suicide sa w a primary care ph ysician within a month of their death. These data underscore the potential impact of primary care-based screening and interv ention str ention ma y be mark edly helpful in managing underlying mental disorders and the danger of repeated or more dangerous self -directed violence. All medications (prescription drugs, o ver-the-counter medications, and supplements) used b y patients at risk for suicide should be reviewed to ensure effectiv e and safe treatment without adv erse drug inter actions. When prescribing drugs to people who self -harm, consider the to xicity of prescribed drugs in o verdose and limit the quantit y dispensed or available, and/or identif y another person to be responsible for securing access to medications. The need for followup and monitoring for adv erse ev ents should be addressed (DVA/DOD , 2013). Although there is limited evidence that psy chiatric medications reduce suicidal thoughts and beha viors, a decrease in the long-term suicide r ate for patients with mood disorders treated with lithium, neuroleptics, and antidepressants has been reported (P ompili & Goldblatt, 2012). Individuals who ha ve psy chiatric and substance use problems should receiv e psy chosocial interv entions along with medication. The only two evidence-based medications that ha ve been shown to lower suicidal beha viors are lithium and clozapine. Howev er, these medications do not reach ther apeutic -acting antipsy chotic medications may be used to directly address agitation, irritabilit y, psychic anxiet y, insomnia, and acute psychosis, until such time as a beha vioral health assessment can be made. The amount and type of medication must be carefully chosen and titr ated when the individual is deemed to be under the influence of alcohol, illicit substances, or other medication in prescribed or o verdose amounts.Lithium Lithium, which is an effectiv e mood stabiliz er, is appro ved for the treatment of mania and the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder . A number of cohort studies ha ve described the anti-suicide benefits of lithium for individuals on long-term maintenance. Mood stabiliz ers are used primarily to treat bipolar disorder , mood swings associated with other mental disorders, and, in some cases, to augment the effect of other medications used to treat depression (NIMH, 2016). A possible explanation for its anti-suicidal effects of lithium is that it reduces the relapse of mood disorders. Howev er, lithium is not as potent in acute phase ther apy as other antidepressants, which do not seem to ha ve similar anti-suicidal efficacy . Possible mechanisms include an effect on aggression or impulsivit y, both of which are associated with an increased risk of suicide. P eople treated for an affectiv e disorder ha ve a 30 times greater risk of suicide than the gener al population, and the evidence that lithium reduces the risk of suicide and possibly deliber ate self -harm in people with bipolar disorder and recurrent unipolar depression indicates that lithium should continue to ha ve an important clinical role (Cipriani et al. , 2013). Lithium Used to Treat Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Lithium should be considered for patients diagnosed with unipolar depressive disorder who ha ve had a partial response to an antidepressant and for those with recurrent episodes who are at high risk for suicidal beha vior, provided they do not have a contr aindication to lithium use and the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Lithium should be considered for patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder who do not ha ve contr aindications to its use. Lithium should be a voided or used in caution in patients with impaired renal function, those taking concurrent medications that increase or decrease lithium concentr ations or those with other risk factors for lithium to xicity. When prescribing lithium to patients at risk for suicide, it is important to pa y attention to the risk of o verdose b y limiting the amount of lithium dispensed and the form in which it is pro vided. Source: DVA/DOD, 2013. AntidepressantsSuicide is strongly associated with poor mental health, especially mood disorders. Antidepressants are the most common treatment for mood disorders, but effectiv e use of these medications requires administr ation to patients who ha ve been properly diagnosed and then adequately followed up . There is a consensus as to the importance of primary care doctors' education progr ams for impro ving the management of depression with antidepressants in order to reduce the risk of suicide. Furthermore, a number of multi- component suicide prev ention progr ams emphasiz e the crucial importance of primary care education progr ams to facilitate optimal antidepressant prescribing (Gusm\u00e3o et al. , 2013). Howev er, there are concerns about the efficacy and safet y of antidepressants, with some authors suggesting that these medications are at best no better than placebo and others that antidepressants ma y actually increase the risk of suicidal beha vior, particularly in young people. In contr ast, still other authors contend that there is a bias in these findings and that the benefits are in fact greater than the risk. F or instance, one meta- analysis of 27 RCT s examined antidepressant prescribing in children and adolescents to age 18 with a diagnosis of major depressiv e disorder and showed that benefits appeared to far outweigh a small increased risk of suicidal beha vior (Gusm\u00e3o et al. , 2013). Although depressiv e symptoms are often associated with risk for suicide, no antidepressant medication has y et to be shown to lower suicide risk in depressed patients. Howev er, because of the relationship between low CSF serotonin lev els and the emergence of aggression and impulsivit y, the selectiv e serotonin reuptak e inhibitors (S SRIs) ha ve been recommended for the treatment of depressiv e disorders when suicidal risk is present. Howev er, treatment with S SRIs must be carefully monitored and managed during the initial treatment phase because of the potential for the possible emergence of suicidal ideation and beha viors during this time. The FDA has recently created a black bo x warning when prescribing S SRIs for persons under the age of 25. Antidepressants Used to Treat Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Antidepressants ma y benefit suicidal beha vior in patients with mood disorders. Treatment for the underlying cause should be optimiz ed according to evidence-based guidelines for the respectiv e disorder . Young adults (18-24) started on an antidepressant for treatment of depression or another psy chiatric disorder should be monitored and observ ed closely for emergence or worsening of suicidal thoughts or beha viors during the initiation phase of treatment. Patients of all age groups who are managed with antidepressants should be monitored for emergence or worsening of suicidal thoughts or beha viors after an y change in dosage. When prescribing antidepressants for patients at risk for suicide, pa y attention to the risk of o verdose and limit the amount of medication dispensed and refilled. Source: DVA/DOD, 2013. Clozapine Clozapine is an at ypical antipsy chotic medication used primarily to treat individuals with schizophrenia. Howev er, it is the only medication with a specific U .S. Food and Drug Administr ation (FDA) indication for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal beha vior in patients with schiz ophrenia or schiz oaffectiv e disorder who are at risk for ongoing suicidal behavior (NIH, 2017). While clozapine is beneficial for some patients, there are risks associated with this drug. Specifically , clozapine can decrease the number of neutrophils, a t ype of white blood cell, that function in the body to fight off infections. When neutrophils are significantly decreased, sev ere neutropenia ma y result and the body ma y become prone to infections. For this reason, patients taking clozapine need to ha ve their absolute neutrophil count (ANC) monitored on a regular basis (FDA, 2016). Key Point about Clozapine Clozapine should be considered for patients diagnosed with schiz ophrenia at high risk for suicide, who do not ha ve contr aindications to clozapine, and will be compliant with monitoring. Source: DVA/DOD, 2013. Antipsychotics Atypical antipsy chotics ma y be used as treatment augmentation in the management of major depressiv e disorder and treatment of bipolar depressiv e disorders. Aripipr azole, quetiapine, and olanzapine in combination with fluo xetine include depressiv e disorders in their label indications. Their labels also include the same bo x warning as antidepressants for an increased risk of suicidal thinking and beha viors. There is no evidence to support this increased risk in adults, albeit at ypical antipsy chotics ha ve not been as extensiv ely studied as antidepressants (DV A/DOD , 2013). Key Points About Antipsychotics There is no evidence that antipsy chotics pro vide additional benefits in reducing the risk of suicidal thinking or beha vior in patients with co-occurring psy chiatric disorders. Treatment for the psy chiatric disorder should be optimiz ed according to evidence- based guidelines for the respectiv e disorder . Patients who are treated with antipsy chotics should be monitored for changes in behavior and emergence of suicidal thoughts during the initiation phase of treatment or after an y change in dosage. When prescribing antipsy chotics in patients at risk for suicide pa y attention to the risk of overdose and limit the amount of mediation dispensed and refilled. Source: DVA/DOD, 2013. Antiepileptic Dr ugs Patients started or who are managed with antiepileptics should be monitored for changes in behavior and the emergence of suicidal thoughts. There is no evidence that antiepileptics are effectiv e in reducing the risk of suicide in patients with a mental disorder (DVA/DOD , 2013). Antianxiety Agents Anxiet y is a significant and modifiable risk factor for suicide and the use of anti- anxiet y agents ma y have the potential to decrease this risk. An y one of sev eral rapidly acting, anti- anxiet y agents (eg, clonaz epam, a benz odiazepine) are candidate pharmaceutics for use in emergency psy chopharmacology for anxiet y reduction in patients who exhibit suicidal behaviors. The use of an y medications for this purpose must consider the risk of death from suicide v ersus the risk of serious adv erse effects from psy cho pharmacology (to include disinhibition that could lead to suicide) v ersus the utilit y of v arious be effectiv e in treating symptoms of anxiet y, insomnia, hypervigilance, and other anxiet y symptoms. In gener al, benz odiazepines are not recommended for long-term use in chronic aggression because of the potential for dependence and toler ance, resulting in an increase in impulsivit y aggression. Benzodiazepines can occasionally disinhibit aggressiv e and dangerous beha viors and enhance impulsivit y. Benz odiazepines tak en in ex cessiv e amounts can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. In combination with other centr al nerv ous system depressants, such as alcohol and opiates, the potential for to xicity increases exponentially (DV A/DOD , 2013). Care of Patients with Substance Use Disorders Every year about 650,000 people receiv e treatment in emergency departments following a suicide attempt. In 2011 appro ximately 230,000 ED visits resulted from drug-related suicide attempts, and almost all in volved a prescription drug or o ver-the-counter medication (S AMHS A, 2016). Did You Know . . . The number of ED visits for drug-related suicide attempts increased 51% o verall from 2005 to 2011 and more than doubled among people age 45 to 64 (S AMHS A, 2016). Substance use disorders are a prev alent and strong risk factor for suicide attempts and suicide. Three k ey issues to bear in mind in working with this population are assessing intoxicated patients, differentiating unintentional and intentional o verdose ev ents, and special assessment consider ations (DV A/DOD 2013). Individuals at acute risk for suicidal beha vior who appear to be under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, either based on clinical presentation or objectiv e data (breath or laboratory tests), should be maintained in a secure setting until into xication has resolv ed. Risk assessment needs to be repeated once the patient is sober in order to determine appropriate next steps. Risk management options include, but are not limited to , admitting the patient for inpatient hospital care, making a referr al for residential care, deto xification, ambulatory care, or scheduling outpatient followup in the near future (DV A/DOD , 2013). Individuals with substance use disorders are particularly susceptible to suicide ideation and suicide attempts. Indeed, suicide is a leading cause of death among people who misuse alcohol and drugs. A significant percentage of deaths b y suicide in volve alcohol into xication or opiates (S AMHS A, 2016). Number of Substances Used The number of substances used seems to be more predictiv e of suicide than the types of substances used. Alcohol misuse or dependence is associated with a suicide risk that is 10 times greater than the suicide risk in the gener al population, and individuals who inject drugs are at about 14 times greater risk for suicide. Acute alcohol into xication is present in about 30% to 40% of suicide attempts (S AMHS A, 2016). One of the reasons alcohol and drug misuse significantly affects suicide r ates is the disinhibition that occurs when a person is into xicated. Although less is known about the relationship between suicide risk and other drug use, as noted abo ve, the number of substances used seems to be more predictiv e of suicide than the t ypes of substances used. More research is needed on the association between different drugs, drug combinations, and self -medication on suicidal beha vior (S AMHS A, 2016). Coordinating Services For suicide prev ention to be effectiv e, pro viders of mental health and substance abuse services must coordinate services with each other and with other service pro viders in the communit y. It is gener ally recogniz ed that mental health and substance abuse services can have a greater impact when communit y gatek eepers refer at -risk patients to these specializ ed pro viders. The effects of mental and substance use services can also be enhanced when specializ ed pro viders refer patients to communit y progr ams that can augment care (HHS , 2012). Cooper ation, collabor ation, and communication between mental health and substance use providers, as well as communit y support, are critical components of patient safet y and recovery. Mental health and substance abuse pro viders should link with communit y agencies for suicide prev ention, mental health adv ocacy organizations, aging services organizations, v eterans support organizations, and progr ams pro viding peer support services. These progr ams foster a sense of connection and belonging and pro vide critically needed services, including emplo yment and v ocational help , housing assistance, peer support, and social inter actions that are not focused on illness (HHS , 2012). All patients at acute risk for suicide who are under the influence (into xicated b y drugs or alcohol) should be ev aluated in an urgent care setting and be k ept under observ ation until they are sober . Patients who are under the influence should be reassessed for risk for suicide when the patient is no longer acutely into xicated, demonstr ating signs or symptoms awal (DV A/DOD , 2013).Obtaining additional information from sources such as family members, treatment providers, and medical records, can be in valuable in making the determination between intentional and unintentional o verdose. Into xicated or psy chotic patients who are unknown to the clinician and who are suspected to be at acute risk for suicide should be tr ansported securely to the nearest crisis center or ED for ev aluation and management. These patients can be dangerous and impulsiv e; assistance in tr ansfer from la w enforcement ma y be considered (DV A/DOD , 2013). Intoxication with drugs or alcohol impairs judgment and increases the risk of suicide attempt. Use of drugs or alcohol should routinely be assessed with all persons at an y risk for suicide. Psy chiatric and beha vioral comorbidities (mood, anxiet y disorder , aggression) should be assessed in patients with substance use disorder at risk for suicide. Also tak e into account social risk factors such as disruptions in relationships and legal and financial difficulties, which are important in individuals with substance use disorders (DV A/DOD , 2013). Discer ning Unintentional vs. Intentional Overdose Intentional o verdose is the most common method of attempted suicide and the possibilit y that an o verdose w as an intentional act of suicide should alw ays be considered. Differentiating between unintentional and intentional o verdose is gener ally str aightforw ard in patients who are forthcoming. Howev er, man y patients will insist an o verdose w as not intentional ev en if it w as, and the differentiation is especially challenging in patients with a history of substance abuse (DV A/DOD , 2013). Unfortunately , there is limited data on the differentiation between unintentional o verdose and suicidal beha vior in substance abusers. A vailable data indicate that risk factors for suicide attempt (compared to unintentional o verdose) include female sex, comorbid depression, interpersonal distress or disruption, and use of substances other than one' s drug of choice. Prior suicide attempts also increase the lik elihood that a recent o verdose event w as intentional (DV A/DOD , 2013). A risk factor for unintentional overdose is a recent loss of toler ance, for example due to incarcer ation or deto xification. Individuals using recreational drugs with high potential for miscalculation (eg, into xicants sold in head shops as \"bath salts\") were more lik ely to experience (DV A/DOD , 2013).Although not t ypical, there are instances when intentionalit y is unclear or ambiguous ev en among substance abusers who are forthcoming, for example a case where the individual was experiencing suicidal ideation when she o verdosed but appeared not to ha ve intended to attempt suicide, or when a distressed person knowingly pushed the limits of dosage and stated \"I didn' t care if I liv ed or died\" but seemed to ha ve no clear agenda for suicide (DVA/DOD , 2013). Developing and Monitoring a Safety Plan Safety planning is a pro vider-patient collabor ative process\u2014 a prev ention tool designed to help an individual manage suicidal thoughts. The safet y planning process produces a written plan that restricts access to means for completing suicide, encour ages problem- solving and coping str ategies, enhances social supports, and identifies a network of emergency contacts. Safet y plans should be tailored to the individual, identif ying specific warning signs as well as coping str ategies that ha ve been effectiv e in the past (DV A/DOD , 2013). Developing the Plan Although no univ ersally accepted safet y planning method exists, the Safety Planning Intervention has gained widespread acceptance in the suicide prev ention communit y and has been incorpor ated into numerous treatment guidelines and interv entions. The plan is collabor atively built b y a clinician with a patient and encour ages individuals to engage in six sequential steps when feeling suicidal: The Safet y Planning Interv ention has a strong empirical foundation supporting each of its six steps, as well as evidence that it impro ves the a verage number of outpatient mental health visits for suicidal patients during the 6 months following the index ED visit, when compared with treatment as usual (Boudreaux et al. , 2017).Identif y early w arning signs 1. Emplo y internal coping str ategies 2. Distract with social engagement or change of en vironment 3. Access suicide-protectiv e social support 4. Seek help through crisis resources5. Restrict access to lethal means (Boudreaux et al. , 2017) 6.The plan and the process of dev eloping it should be included in the medical record, and the patient should receiv e a cop y. The safet y plan should be specific and should list situations, stressors, thoughts, feelings, beha viors, and symptoms that suggest periods of increased risk, as well as a step-b y-step description of coping str ategies and help seeking beha viors (DVA/DOD , 2013). Monitoring the Plan A common misconception is that suicide risk is an acute problem that, once dealt with, ends. Unfortunately , individuals who are suicidal commonly experience a return of suicide risk following an y number of setbacks, including relapse to substance use, a distressing life event, increased depression, or an y number of other situations. Sometimes suicidal behavior ev en occurs in the context of substantial impro vement in mood and energy . Therefore, monitoring for signs of a return of suicidal thoughts or beha vior is essential (CSAT, 2015). There is a tendency to refer a patient experiencing suicidal thoughts and beha viors to another pro vider and then assume that the issue has been tak en care of . This is a mistak e. It is essential to follow up with the pro vider to determine that the person k ept the appointment. It is also critical to coordinate ongoing care and to alert other pro viders when a patient has relapsed and ma y be vulner able to suicidal thoughts. Monitoring emphasiz es the importance of w atching for a return of suicidal thoughts and beha viors, following up with referr als, and continual coordinating with pro viders who are addressing the patient 's suicidal thoughts and beha viors (CS AT, 2015). Monitoring can include following up with the ED when a patient has been referred for acute assessment as well as continual coordinating with mental health pro viders, case managers, or other professionals. The client 's condition and y our responses should be documented, including referr als and the outcomes of the referr als. Other monitoring actions include: Confirming that the client still has a safet y plan in effect. Monitoring and updating the treatment plan. Confirming that a client has k ept referr al appointments. Following up if a recurrence of suicidal thoughts or attempts is observ ed. Keeping family members engaged in the treatment process. Confirming that the client and the family ha ve an emergency phone number to call. Confirming that the client does not ha ve access to a method of suicide. Completing a formal treatment termination summary when this stage of care is reached. (CS AT, 2015)These approaches t ypically include followup contact and use div erse modalities (home visits, mail, telephone, e-mail) to engage recent suicide attempt surviv ors in continued treatment to prev ent re- attempts. T reatment ma y focus on impro ved coping skills, mindfulness, and other emotional regulation skills, and ma y include case management home visits to increase adherence to treatment and continuit y of care; and one-on-one interpersonal ther apy and/or group ther apy. Approaches that engage and connect people to peers and pro viders are especially important because man y attempters do not present to aftercare; 12% to 25% re- attempt within a y ear, and 3% to 9% of attempt surviv ors die by suicide within 1 to 5 y ears of their initial attempt (Stone et al. , 2017).

I'd been trying to get a gun, and word got around. The school called m y mom and a social work er came to talk to me. But what really changed m y mind w as my dad. I could feel his lo ve, and it felt lik e he would la y down his life for me. Thinking about that would snap me out of it \u2014suicide would hurt m y family more than I'm hurting now . In my worst moments the thought lingers, but now I know I could nev er go through with suicide. My faith gets me through those times\u2014knowing that something bigger is out there and I shouldn' t rob m yself of what is y et to come. My kids giv e me a sense of purpose. I'm able to sa y to m yself, \"No, that 's not an option, y ou can' t do that. \" And I w as really lucky to ha ve that connection with m y dad. Annie Ost, Spokane Source: WSDOH, 2016 Certain protectiv e factors, such as ha ving robust social supports or ha ving strong problem solving skills, diminish the risk of suicide. A person' s support network can be a source of strength in times of crisis and during reco very. Strong social ties can decrease stress and increase a person' s abilit y to cope with the stressful ev ent or situation (WSDOH, 2016). Some believ e the health of a societ y is reflected in its incidence of suicide and that a societ y sustains itself through well-defined norms and customs that go vern inter actions; when a person is immersed in the life of the communit y there are shared ideas of what is inappropriate and appropriate. If regulation or integr ation is too high or low , then suicides and other social ills will occur (WSDOH, 2016).A care network can offer gener al support (positiv e contact, tr ansportation and childcare during appointments, messages of lo ve and concern), crisis support (getting a person to a hospital or crisis center and visiting them while there, arr anging for care of the home, children, or pets during crisis care or reco very) and ongoing attentiv eness to signs of a new crisis. Supports such as these are a k ey part of care for people at risk of suicide (WSDOH, 2016). Laypeople with appropriate tr aining can also be critical in helping to prev ent suicides. Gatek eepers (individuals who are in a position to recogniz e someone at increased suicide risk) ma y include clergy , first responders, and those emplo yed in institutional settings such as the military . Review of progr ams pro viding education and tr aining in gatek eepers has demonstr ated positiv e effects. F or example, implementation of the U .S. Air F orce suicide prev ention progr am w as associated with significant declines in suicide (Hassamal et al. , 2015). Peer Support Programs Promoting connectedness among individuals and within communities through modeling peer norms and enhancing communit y engagement ma y protect against suicide. Peer norm programs seek to normaliz e protectiv e factors for suicide b y encour aging help- seeking, talking to trusted adults, and promoting peer connectedness. By lev eraging the leadership qualities and social influence of peers, these approaches can be used to shift group-lev el beliefs and promote positiv e social and beha vioral change. These approaches typically target y outh and are deliv ered in school settings but can also be implemented in communit y settings (Stone et al. , 2017). Progr ams such as Sources of Strength can impro ve school norms and beliefs about suicide that are created and disseminated b y student peers. In an RCT of Sources of Strength conducted with 18 high schools (6 metropolitan, 12 rur al), researchers found that the progr am impro ved adaptiv e norms regarding suicide, connectedness to adults, and school engagement. P eer leaders were also more lik ely than controls to refer a suicidal friend to an adult. F or students, the progr am resulted in increased perceptions of adult support for suicidal y ouths, particularly among those with a history of suicidal ideation, and the acceptabilit y of help-seeking beha viors. Finally , trained peer leaders also reported a greater decrease in maladaptiv e coping attitudes compared with untr ained leaders (Stone et al., 2017). Video: What is Sources of Strength? (3:10) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgi9GjhW3Ss Community Engagement Activities Communit y engagement is an aspect of social capital. Communit y engagement approaches may involve residents participating in a r ange of activities, including religious activities, communit y clean-up and greening activities, and group ph ysical ex ercise. These activities provide opportunities for residents to become more in volved in the communit y and to connect with other communit y members, organizations, and resources, resulting in enhanced o verall ph ysical health, reduced stress, and decreased depressiv e symptoms, thereb y reducing risk of suicide (Stone et al. , 2017). Among the groups disproportionately affected b y suicidal ideation and beha viors, a one- size-fits- all approach to suicide prev ention does not work. These guidelines can help tailor messages, interv entions, and progr ams to a specific communit y: Involve communit y members and leaders from the beginning and respect them as experts on their own experience. Become familiar with the communit y's history , risk and protectiv e factors, cultur al norms around language and communication, beliefs about death, and definition of the problem. Avoid viewing one or a few members of a communit y as representativ e of an entire demogr aphic group . Put values of inclusion and equit y front and center in decision making and progr am design. Include accessibilit y concerns such as tr ansportation, cost, language tr anslation, location, space, and materials for people with disabilities. (WSDOH, 2016) What is Sour ces of Str ength?

Video: What is the Healing of the Canoe?

Rising Sun is designed to identif y a toolkit of common outcomes to be used in ev aluating suicide prev ention efforts to assess the correlates associated with suicide prev ention interv entions across Arctic states. Common outcomes and their measures, dev eloped through engagement with Indigenous peoples' organizations and communit y leaders, as well as mental health experts, will facilitate data sharing, assessments, and interpretation of interv entions across service systems in the Arctic region (NIMH, 2017). The ultimate goal is to gener ate shared knowledge that will aid health work ers in better serving their communities, and help policy -makers measure progress, ev aluate interv entions, and identif y regional and cultur al challenges to implementation. Arriving at common outcomes, through their measures and reporting systems, is especially important in the Arctic, where the v ast geogr aphy, high number of remote communities, and breadth of cultur al div ersity pose challenges for systematic approaches to suicide prev ention (NIMH, 2017). Reducing Access to Lethal Means What is Healing of the Canoe?What is Healing of the Canoe?Lethal means are the instruments or objects used to carry out a self -destructiv e act (ie, firearm, poison, medication). Although it is difficult to predict who will attempt suicide, the availabilit y of lethal means ma y increase the risk for suicidal ideation and beha vior. Lethal means assessment is necessary for both o verall risk assessment and for safet y planning for patients being discharged (Betz et al. , 2016). This assessment is critically important because certain lethal means such as firearms, hanging/suffocation, or jumping from heights pro vide little opportunit y for rescue and ha ve high fatalit y rates (Stone et al. , 2017). Reducing access to lethal means can reduce suicide r ates, especially in times of crisis or during stressful tr ansitions. R esearch indicates that: The interv al between deciding to act and attempting suicide can be as short as 5 or 10 minutes. People tend not to substitute a different method when a highly lethal method is unavailable or difficult to access. Increasing the time interv al between deciding to act and the suicide attempt b y making it more difficult to access lethal means, can be lifesa ving. (Stone et al. , 2017) Various str ategies to reduce access to lethal means ha ve been dev eloped and implemented in sev eral countries. Means restriction is considered a k ey component in a comprehensiv e suicide prev ention str ategy and has been shown to be effectiv e in reducing suicide r ates (DVA/DOD , 2013). If a lethal method is not immediately a vailable, the crisis will often pass, and the person may nev er attempt suicide. Others ma y still mak e an attempt but use a less deadly method. A suicide attempt using a gun leads to death in 85% to 90% of cases; an attempt by medication o verdose or a sharp instrument leads to death about 1 to 2% of the time. It is important to understand that most people who attempt suicide once, and surviv e, nev er attempt again. Putting time, distance, and other barriers between a person at risk and the most lethal means can mak e the difference between life and death (WSDOH, 2016). Though limiting access to materials used for hanging is difficult, ev en in restrictiv e places such as jails and hospitals, limiting or reducing access to other lethal means is possible at both the individual and communit y levels. Safe stor age of firearms and medications, reduced access to common poisons, and placement of suicide barriers at the edges of tall buildings and bridges are pro ven str ategies (WSDOH, 2016). Source: WSD OH, 2016.Model for Reducing Access to Highly Lethal Suicide Methods Conceptual model of how reducing access to a highly lethal and commonly used suicide method saves lives at the population level. Drop in overall suicide rate is driven by decline in rate of suicide by the restricted method. Means restriction Highly lethal, commonly used suicide method is made less accessible or less lethalSubstitution Attempter substitutes another method; on average, substituted methods are less lethalFewer attempts prove fatalSuicidal crisis p asses fo r many The acute period in which a person will attempt is often short Delays can save time but not all lives 89-95% of attempters do not go on to die by suicideDelay Attempt is temporarily or permanently delayed Healthcare pro viders should routinely assess the presence and a vailabilit y of lethal means in a patient 's home and pro vide education about how to reduce risks and limit access to lethal means. F or patients at highest risk, mak e sure firearms are made inaccessible to the patient. F or patients at intermediate to high acute risk of suicide, discuss the possibilit y of safe stor age of firearms with the patient, command, and family . This can include locking up firearms, using trigger locks, or storing firearms at the military armory , at a friend' s home, or local police station. Ammunition should be stored separ ately (DV A/DOD , 2013). When clinically possible, limit access to medications that carry risk for suicide, at least during the periods when patient is at acute risk. This ma y include prescribing limited quantities, supplying the medication in blister packaging, pro viding printed w arnings about the dangers of o verdose, or ensuring that currently prescribed medications are activ ely controlled b y a responsible part y. Also pro vide information on how to secure chemical poisons, especially agricultur al and household chemicals, to prev ent accidental or intentional ingestions. Man y of these chemicals are highly to xic (DV A/DOD , 2013). Continuity of CareBecause a v ariety of healthcare pro viders, friends, and family members ma y be associated with the care of a person determined to be at risk for suicide, continuit y of care is critical. Maintaining continuit y across facilities and pro viders is difficult and ma y be helped b y electronic medical records; howev er, not ev eryone has access to this information. Mental health information has higher lev els of consent in order to access records. Continuit y of care should be maintained when patients who are or ha ve been at risk for suicide, in tr ansition between care facilities or between other health systems or pro vider organizations. Pro viders must pa y attention to sev eral potential risks for discontinuities during tr ansitions between care settings. These ma y include tr ansitions: From primary care to beha vioral health From the emergency department to ambulatory care From inpatient units to other settings such as nursing homes, rehabilitation, or other residential treatment settings From nursing homes and residential care units to ambulatory services (DV A/DOD , 2013) A multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of suicidal patients maximiz es pro viders' ability to pro vide optimal management and services to their patients. Mechanisms for bridging tr ansitions and for pro viding information to new pro viders must be dev eloped on a system-b y-system basis. Continuit y of care is enhanced during tr ansitions when pro viders directly contact other pro viders and followup appointments are scheduled. T ransition support services (such as telephone contact with beha vioral health pro viders) ma y impro ve continuit y of care should there be a dela y in followup services (DV A/DOD , 2013). All patients who present to the ED for a suicide attempt or who are at risk for suicide require mental health ev aluations. Howev er, these patients ma y receiv e only limited mental health services, ma y not receiv e adequate treatment for underlying mental health or substance use disorders, and frequently do not receiv e any followup care. If patients do not require inpatient care, they should be informed about risks and be referred for mental health services before discharge. Howev er, although a simple referr al is important, it ma y not be sufficient (HHS , 2012). Patients lea ving the ED or hospital inpatient unit after a suicide attempt, or otherwise at a high risk for suicide, require r apid proactiv e outreach and followup . Having surviv ed a suicide attempt is one of the most significant risk factors for later death b y suicide. The risk is particularly high in the weeks and months following the attempt, including the period after discharge from acute care settings such as EDs and inpatient psy chiatric units (HHS, 2012).For patients who are transferred from the ED to medical-surgical services for the treatment of injuries related to a suicide attempt, followup mental health ev aluations should be conducted before discharge to decide between transfer to a mental health inpatient unit or referral to outpatient care. These evaluations should consider the support available from family and friends and the patient's clinical status. Before a decision to discharge is made, followup appointments for mental health care should be made and patients (and families or friends) should be coached about the importance of continuity in care (HHS, 2012). All patients who are admitted to an inpatient mental health unit require followup mental health services after discharge, as well as connections to communit y-based supports. Healthcare systems should seek to dramatically shorten the time between inpatient discharge and followup outpatient treatment. For example, EDs and others providing services to these patients could set a goal of ensuring that followup occurs within 48 hours or, at most, within a week of discharge (HHS, 2012). Continuity of care following a suicide attempt should represent a collaborative approach between patient and provider that gives the patient a feeling of connectedness. Strategies may include telephone reminders of appointments, providing a \"crisis card\" with emergency phone numbers and safety measures, and sending a letter of support. Motivational counseling and case management can also be used to promote adherence to the recommended treatment (HHS, 2012). Suicide in Veteran Populations Historically, suicide rates have been lower in the military than those rates found in the general population. However, with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, military suicide rates have been increasing and surpassing the rates for society at large. The Army has had the highest proportional number of suicides compared to the other services; howev er, the rates in all the services have been increasing in recent years (USU, 2016). In a recent survey, veterans identified suicide as the most formidable challenge they face. Sadly, approximately 22 veterans die by suicide every day. Contributing to this problem, one of the most common mental health diagnoses among veterans returning from the current war theatres is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is a known risk factor for both suicidal ideation and behavior (DeBeer et al., 2016). A Soldier's StoryA soldier who had joined the Washington National Guard after returning from deployment came into the Joint Services Support (JSS) office at Camp Murray, asking for help finding a job. While talking with the Employment Transition Team, the soldier revealed financial struggles, fear of returning home because of domestic violence, o verwhelming depression, and suicidal thoughts. The JSS multidisciplinary team sprang into action. Five weeks later the soldier had a regular therapy schedule, gift cards for food and gas, an electronic benefits card, a refreshed r\u00e9sum\u00e9, a suicide prevention mentor, an order of protection against the abusive partner, and safe transitional housing. Outstanding disability claims were resolved, and, as the soldier was about to move into an apartment, a job offer came through from a prominent Washington company. The soldier's life moved from a place of desperation to a place of stability. It is not unique for a person seeking help to have multiple needs spanning many systems. What is unique is that this soldier had the ability to get all of these needs met in one place by a collaborative, supportive team of professionals, each of whom was well-trained and attuned to depression and suicide risk. The JSS states that its purpose is to \"enhance the quality of life for all Guard members, their families, and the communities in which they live and contribute to readiness and retention in the Washington National Guard.\" The JSS at Camp Murray combines strong and supportive leadership, cross-system teamwork, and attention to soldiers' emotional needs and ability to thrive at work\u2014a program model that improves job performance and saves lives. Source: WSDOH, 2016. Veterans: Population-Specific Data About 13% of Washington's population has participated in the armed forces. In 2010, the age-adjusted suicide rate among Washington's veteran or active-duty military members was 55 per 100,000, compared to 15 per 100,000 for those not in the military. From 2000 to 2010, 16% of males and 26% of females in the military who died b y suicide were under 35 (WSDOH, 2016).Information from the Office of Mental Health Oper ations on causes of death for all v eterans who use VHA healthcare services since 2000 shows that r ates among VHA users are higher than those of the gener al population. Users of VHA services account for 1,600 to 1,900 suicides per y ear, or about 5 per da y. Among the deaths from suicide, appro ximately half had a diagnosis of a mental health condition recorded in their medical records in the y ear prior to their death, and appro ximately three-fourths, within the past fiv e years (DV A/DOD , 2013). The Department of V eterans Affairs reported that in 2014: About 67% of all v eteran deaths b y suicide were the result of firearm injuries. About 65% of all v eterans who died b y suicide were age 50 or older . Risk for suicide w as 21% higher among v eterans when compared with U .S. civilian adults. Risk for suicide w as 18% higher among male v eterans when compared with U .S. civilian adult males. Risk for suicide w as 2.4 times higher among female v eterans when compared with U.S. civilian adult females. (USDV A, 2016b) Among deplo yed and non-deplo yed activ y veterans who serv ed during the Ir aq or Afghanistan w ars between 2001 and 2007, the r ate of suicide w as greatest in the first three y ears after lea ving service. Compared to the U .S. population, both deplo yed and non-deplo yed veterans had a higher risk of suicide, but a lower risk of death from all other causes combined (USDV A, 2015). Contr ary to popular belief , while ground services ha ve experienced the stress of repetitiv e and extended deplo yments, the 2009 Department of Defense Suicide Event Report (DODSER) identifies only 7% of military suicides occurred among service members with multiple deplo yments. The report also stated that while half of those who were military suicides had been deplo yed at some time to Ir aq or Afghanistan, only 17% experienced combat. Another finding is that although senior noncommissioned officers t ypically experience repetitiv e deplo yments, most suicides occur among the junior enlisted (WSDOH, 2016).Washington' s Healthy Youth Survey data show that children of military families are at higher risk of suicide. A higher percentage of tenth gr aders with parents in the military reported symptoms of depression in the past y ear compared to tenth gr aders from civilian families. They also answered y es more frequently to questions about serious consider ation of suicide, making a suicide plan, and attempting suicide, and fewer than half answered yes when ask ed if there were adults to whom they could turn for help when feeling sad or hopeless (WSDOH, 2016). Among male v eterans, suicide r ates are highest in the y ounger and older y ears, and among female v eterans, suicide r ates are highest in the y ounger y ears. Howev er, because the age distribution of the living v eteran population is hea vily weighted tow ard middle- aged adults, the resulting burden of suicide, in terms of the number of liv es lost, is highest among middle- aged v eterans, despite the lower rates of suicide observ ed for this sub-population. Analysis of suicide risk within the v eteran population indicates that it is important to develop and direct v eteran suicide prev ention initiativ es that are tailored to reach v eterans of all ages (USDV A, 2016b). Military Culture But I fear they do not know us. I fear they do not comprehend the full weight of the burden we carry or the price we pa y when we return from battle. This is important, because a people uninformed about what they are asking the military to endure is a people inevitably unable to fully gr asp the scope of the responsibilities our Constitution levies upon them. . . . W e must help them understand, our fellow citiz ens who so desper ately w ant to help us. ADM Michael Mullen, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff United States Military Academ y, West Point, 2011 The abilit y to understand and appreciate military culture and to tailor clinical pr actices based on that understanding is imper ative for clinicians working with service members (USU, 2016). The military is controlled b y civilian leaders who in volve service members in conflicts not necessarily supported b y the majorit y of civilians, who ma y not fully understand the impact military service has on individuals and families. There are few opportunities for honest, open, and thoughtful dialogue between civilians and military personnel. P olitical, cultur al, and social differences between civilian and military life can complicate our understanding of the complex issue of suicide (WSDOH, 2016).The military changes and builds one's identit y and espouses v alues, beliefs, and norms that are quite contr ary to civilian life. Close relationships are formed within units, and these become disrupted when soldiers are tr ansferred or mo ved to other units or when deplo yment ends. The intensit y of such relationships is seldom found in civilian life. Service members can return home with decreased opportunit y to participate as intensely in military culture. The tr ansition to civilian life can lea ve them feeling less integr ated and less regulated (WSDOH, 2016). The w arrior ideal is deeply embedded in the psy che of service members. T o be unable to live up to this ideal can ha ve significant consequences. Missing one's battle buddies/team, not ha ving a mission, and failing to liv e up to v alues and ideals can cause a service member or v eteran to feel isolated and inadequate. Man y believ e that for a w arrior to develop symptoms of stress of an y kind is a failure to liv e up to the w arrior ideal (Schmidt, 2012). No matter what br anch of service, service members are taught that service comes before self and the mission comes first. Strength, v alor, cour age, fortitude, honor , esprit de corps , respect, and integrit y are considered to be the noble tr aits of a w arrior (Schmidt, 2012). When a service member lea ves the military , they ma y feel rules begin to disintegr ate, leaving feelings of unrest, alienation, anxiet y, and lack of purpose. During deplo yment, family members often become more independent and self -reliant, causing the soldier to feel less needed and believing the family can surviv e just fine without her or him (WSDOH, 2016).

Military Stress: PFC Wilson BackgroundPrivate First Class Shania Wilson serv es in Alpha Compan y, 181st Brigade Support Battalion, 81t Brigade Combat T eam, W ashington Arm y National Guard. A mother of three, she w as stationed at Joint Base Balad for eight months, pro viding securit y for the hospital and Ir aqi business on base, escorting local nationals working on base, and pro viding Personal Securit y Detail services. A second deplo yment sent Priv ate Wilson to Afghanistan with the 96th T roop Command based out of Y akima. \"I w asn't supposed to be on that deplo yment, but I w as called to dut y and had to go ,\" she reported. She pulled securit y duty in a v ariety of places and on sev eral occasions experienced firefights, witnessed the death of three members of her unit, applied first aid to the sev erely wounded, and on two occasions experienced two separ ate blasts from an impro vised explosiv e device. After her deplo yments, Priv ate Wilson enrolled in college. Sev eral students in one of her classes surmised she w as in the military and she o verheard them refer to her one da y as a \"baby killer .\"Recently , a video w as shown in her science course that made her feel uncomfortable and since that time she' s had more difficult y concentr ating on her studies. She has not sought an y medical or beha vioral health assistance for fear that it could interfere with her career in the National Guard and also remo ve her from the chance to support her unit on another upcoming deplo yment. In fact, the 81st Brigade Combat T eam and 506th Military P olice Compan y receiv ed notices of sourcing from the P entagon, meaning they could be tapped for an upcoming deplo yment. Assessment During a routine medical appointment with a nurse pr actitioner , the NP noted that Priv ate Wilson k ept her ey es down and fidgeted with her cell phone during the initial part of the appointment. When ask ed how she w as feeling, Priv ate Wilson said she w as fine ex cept that since returning from her second deplo yment, she has felt lightheaded with ringing in her ears, has had problems thinking and remembering, and has become more irritable. \"I wasn't supposed to be on that [second] deplo yment, but I w as called to dut y and had to go,\" she reported. A t school, she reported feeling isolated and uncomfortable and said she wasn't doing well. She said she w asn't sleeping well and feels hopeless, lik e there w as no reason to liv e other than her children and unit. She admitted she had begun to drink heavily. She mentioned that she w as worried about a possible deplo yment and had mix ed feelings about returning to dut y. DiscussionPrivate Wilson experienced significant tr auma during her deplo yments, including the death of her fellow service members. She also appears to be experiencing ph ysical and psychological after -effects of being in close pro ximity to 2 IED blasts. Although she has expressed mix ed feelings about a third deplo yment, she also expressed a sense of dut y and a desire to protect her National Guard career . Whhat Actions Can You Take? Private Wilson is clearly ha ving difficult y dealing with her experiences in the w ar. During the patient assessment, what should y ou do first? Answer: c Bottom Line Any healthcare pro vider ma y come in contact with someone who ma y be at risk for self - harm.

Veterans: Risk and Protective FactorsTell Priv ate Wilson that it tak es time to reco ver from a military deplo yment and she will be fine.a. Report Priv ate Wilson to her supervisor at the W ashington Arm y National Guard. b. Determine Priv ate Wilson' s level of risk for suicidal ideation and beha vior b y asking open-ended, gener y.c. To safeguard Priv ate Wilson' s safet y, have her admitted to a psy ch ward. d.A protective factor is an ything that mak es it less likely for a person to dev elop a disorder . A risk factor is an ything that mak es it more likely for a person to dev elop a disorder or predisposes a person to high risk for self -injurious beha viors. Both protectiv e and risk factors can include biologic, psy chological, or social factors in the individual, family , and environment. Historically , the suicide r ate has been lower in the military than among civilians. This protective effect has been thought to be related to a selection bias for health y recruits, emplo yment, purposefulness, access to healthcare, and a strong sense of belonging (DVA/DOD , 2013). Protective Factors Within a social support system such as the military , protectiv e factors include: Strong interpersonal bonds Communit y support Emplo yment Intact marriage Child-rearing responsibilities Responsibilities or duties to others A reasonably safe and stable en vironment Personal tr aits that are protectiv e factors include: Help-seeking Good impulse control Good skills in problem solving, coping, and conflict resolution Sense of belonging, sense of identit y, and good self -esteem Cultur al, spiritual, and religious beliefs about the meaning and v alue of life Optimistic outlook \u2014identification of future goals Constructiv e use of leisure time (enjo yable activities) Resilience Access to healthcare is also a protectiv e factor and includes: Medical support Mental health care Clinical care for substance use disorders Participating in treatment A sense of the importance of health and wellness (V A/DoD , 2013) A study published in 2015 look ed at changes in suicide mortalit y of v eterans and non- veterans b y gender and history of VHA service use. It found that suicides among women veterans increased b y 40% from 2000 to 2010, compared to a 13% increase in women non-veterans. The study also showed that among women v eterans, those who use VHA care ha ve suicide r ates as much as 75% lower than those who do not. Male v eterans also saw reduction in suicide r ates, about 20%, for those who used VHA services (Hoffmire et al., 2015). Risk Factors Suicide prev ention is a serious issue for service members and their lo ved ones. Stress that never seems to let up can affect an yone, and some service members ma y be at greater risk for suicide than others. Risk factors ma y include: Being a y oung, unmarried male of low r ank A recent return from deplo yment, especially when experiencing health problems Adverse deplo yment experience Lack of adv ancement or reduction in r ank A sense of a loss of honor or a perceiv ed sense of injustice or betr ayal Heavy drinking or other substance use problems Disciplinary actions Mental health problems Career -threatening change in fitness for dut y Command/leadership stress, isolation from unit Transferring dut y station Deplo yment to a combat theater (WSDOH, 2016) National Guard members and reservists are of special concern because they often liv e in areas with limited access to healthcare services.

A 2010 offering, Health Promotion, Risk Reduction, Suicide Prevention Report, suggested potential causes for these higher r ates: Lapses in garrison leadership supervision and control Lowering recruitment standards through increased use of w aivers Admittance of recruits who engage in high-risk beha vior (WSDOH, 2016) Veterans: Intervention Strategies Training on resilience, stress, and prepar ation ha ve done little to curb rising suicide r ates. The emphasis must go deeper to explore issues such as regulation, integr ation, belongingness, burden, and habituation and allow service members to reflect meaningfully upon their military experience (WSDOH, 2016). The United States Air Force Suicide Prevention Program includes 11 policy and education initiativ es that are designed to change the culture surrounding suicide. The progr am uses leaders as role models and agents of change, establishes expectations for beha vior related to awareness of suicide risk, dev elops population skills and knowledge (education and training), and in vestigates ev ery suicide. The progr am represents a fundamental shift from viewing suicide and mental illness solely as medical problems and instead sees them as larger service- wide problems impacting the whole communit y (Stone et al. , 2017). The progr am has been associated with a 33% relativ e risk reduction in suicide. It w as also associated with relativ e risk reductions in related outcomes, including moder ate and sev ere family violence, homicide, and accidental death. An assessment comparing suicide r ates before and after the launch of the progr am found significantly lower r ates of suicide after the progr am w as launched. These effects were sustained o ver time, ex cept in 2004, during which there w as less rigorous implementation of progr am components than in the other years (Stone et al. , 2017). Good health is critical to military and family readiness, allowing service members to perform their responsi bilities at work and at home to the best of their abilities. Source: Military OneSource.

Health-Promoting Behaviors Several health-promoting beha viors, including ph ysical activit y, stress management, and interpersonal relationships, ha ve been demonstr ated to decrease suicidal ideation. Those who engage in ph ysical activit y or participate in sports are at lower risk for suicidal ideation than those who do not. In the realm of spiritual growth, individuals who feel they ha ve a purpose in life reported lower suicidal ideation than those who did not. In terms of social relationships, there is a significant body of literature identif ying social support as a protectiv e factor for suicidal ideation (DeBeer et al. , 2016). Of particular interest, researchers ha ve found that suicide attempters tended to ha ve diets lower in dietary fiber and polyunsatur ated fat compared to individuals who had no history of suicide attempts. Further , men and women who had prior suicide attempts were more lik ely to ha ve insufficient intak e of v egetables and fruits respectiv ely compared to non- attempters (DeBeer et al. , 2016).

Adults who participated in an ex ercise interv ention showed decreased lev els of PTSD symptoms compared to baseline, and this reduction lasted after the interv ention w as completed (DeBeer et al. , 2016). Veterans with PT SD who felt they ha ve purpose and meaning in life ha ve better outcomes than those who do not. Social support is associated with lower PT SD symptom sev erity in trauma-exposed individuals. Disrupted sleep is a core symptom of PT SD, and research demonstr ates that cognitiv e-beha vioral treatments that reduce insomnia and nightmares can reduce other symptoms of PT SD (DeBeer et al. , 2016). Video: Veterans and PTSD: Challenging the Misconceptions (2:13) https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov Addressing Depression Major depressiv e disorder , which is highly comorbid with PT SD, independently increases risk for suicidal ideation and attempts. Thus, identif ying modifiable factors that could reduce the association between PT SD symptoms and suicidal ideation is a high research priorit y (DeBeer et al. , 2016).

Source: VeteransCrisisLine.net Risk o f Imminent Harm The potential for suicide exists when there is no longer a sense of belonging, when a person feels he is a burden, and when there is habituation to self -injury . This can lead a person to gr adually o vercome the desire for self -preserv ation and lower resistance to self - injury through rehearsal or observ ed self -harm actions (WSDOH, 2016). Imminent harm is a situation in which a person's risk status is believ ed to indicate actions that could lead to his or her suicide. Healthcare pro viders working in EDs, acute care, and medical offices must be able to identif y, treat, and follow up with those at risk for harming themselv es. Risk of imminent harm is especially elev ated during the da ys and weeks following hospitalization for a suicide attempt, especially for people diagnosed with major depression, bipolar disorder , and schiz ophrenia. F ollowup and referr al effectiv e care (WSDOH, 2016).Recognizing Self-Injurious Behaviors Self-injurious behaviors and intentions are deliber ate acts done with the knowledge that they can or will result in some degree of ph ysical or psy chological injury . Self-injurious behavior in volves direct and intentional self -injury that causes tissue damage, injury to oneself , or injury to health. It also includes suicide attempts (Xin et al. , 2016). Non-suicidal self -harm is included in some suicide risk measures, such as the Self -Injurious Thoughts and Beha viors Interview . Howev er, recent research found that including nonsuicidal self -harm did not pro vide additional predictiv e abilit y to a model including suicidal cognition and beha viors. Ov erall, there is consider able evidence that past suicidal plans and attempts should be considered for ev aluation of current and future risk, but other beha viors, such as nonsuicidal self -harm and communications, ma y not be v alid factors for man y individuals (Harris et al. , 2015). Assessing Intent Intentions are self -instructions that guide engagement in a beha vior or lead to an outcome. Measures of intention pro vide a numerical score that reflect how hard a person is willing to try or the lik elihood a person will perform or try to perform a particular beha vior. Several theories incorpor ate intentions as a primary determinant of beha vior. These theories argue that intention is an important underlying driv er of beha vior and that other influencing factors are either mediated b y intention or serv e as moder ators (Williams, 2016). The abilit y to perceiv e intentionalit y appears to be automatic and b y adulthood most individuals share a common understanding of the concept of intentionalit y. Given the importance of inferring the intentions of others, it is not surprising that most adults are keenly attuned to intentionalit y cues. The fast and automatic oper ation of these cognitiv e processes allows us to mak e inferences quickly about the mental states of those around us (Brotherton & French, 2015). A great deal of evidence demonstr ates that suicidal beha viors (plans and attempts) can be predictiv e of suicide. Including an individual' s intent to die in a risk assessment impro ves the validity of past suicidal beha viors as indicators of current and future risk. Man y instruments, such as the Suicidal Beha viors Questionnaire-R evised and the Suicide Intent Scale, include items on communication of suicide ideation and beha vior (Harris et al. , 2015). Howev er, measures of intention that only capture a person' s gener al desire to perform a beha vior are significantly less robust predictors of subsequent beha vior than measures of intention that assess the intensity and level of effort the person is prepared to exert to perform the beha vior (Williams, 2016). Beck Suicide Intention Scale The Beck Suicide Intention Scale (SIS) examines subjectiv e and objectiv e aspects of the suicide attempt, the circumstances at the time of the attempt, and the patient 's thoughts and feelings during the attempt. It is based on a clinical interview using an instrument with 15 items referring to the patient 's precautions and beliefs of the act. Each item is scored on a scale from 0 to 2, with a possible total score of 30 indicating the highest intention of suicide and a wish to die. The SIS questionnaire co vers precautions, planning, communication, and expectations regarding medication load, the degree of planning, and wish to die or liv e. It is divided into two sections: the first eight items constitute the \"circumstances\" section (part 1) and are concerned with the objectiv e circumstances of the act of self -harm; the remaining sev en items, the \"self -report \" section (part 2), are based on the patients' own reconstruction of their feelings and thoughts at the time of the act. Source: Grimholt et al., 2017. A person' s intent ma y be inferred from how they describe a \"wish to liv e\" or a \"wish to die.\" These terms ha ve proven useful in assessing suicide ideation and beha vior, and are included in Beck' s Scale of Suicidal Ideation and the Suicide Status F orm. Ov erall, there is strong evidence that suicidal affects can be v alid indicators of current and future risk (Harris et al. , 2015). Paradoxically , an examination of U .S. suicide attempters indicated that prior v erbalization of suicidalit y had little relationship with a \"wish to die\" during the attempt. A large study of French univ ersity students found higher -risk suicide attempts, included less communication of suicidalit y, while a psy chological autopsy study of 200 Chinese suicide victims rev ealed about 60% had not communicated their intentions, in an y way, prior to death (Harris et al. , 2015). Self- Injurious vior such as cutting, burning, hitting oneself , scratching oneself to the point of bleeding, or interfering with healing is a relativ ely frequent beha vior in young people. The concern is that it these beha viors can become chronic and ev olve into other forms of self -injurious beha vior, such as suicide attempts. Because injurious beha vior and suicidal beha vior often occur together , it is important to consider the nature of the link between these two t ypes of beha vior. Some specialists see nonsuicidal self-injurious beha vior as a w ay to regulate negativ e emotions, while others argue that it is a factor in the emergence of suicidal ideation and attempts (Gr andclerc et al. , 2016).Stigma There is a misconception\u2014ev en among some healthcare pro viders\u2014that individuals who self-harm choose to suffer . This creates stigma regarding self -harm. Similar experiences with stigma ha ve been reported b y people diagnosed with borderline personalit y disorder . Gener al psy chiatric admission is of uncertain ther apeutic v alue for self -harming and suicidal individuals and ma y even be harmful for those with borderline personalit y disorder , especially if admissions are length y and unstructured. Although often lacking, specializ ed services are essential\u2014particularly in situations of unique vulner ability, such as suicidal crises. When the risks of suicide and sev ere self -harm are acute, it is essential that services are offered in a compassionate manner that honors the human dignit y of the person who is suffering (Liljedahl et al. , 2017). About Self-Harm\u2014A Nurse Practitioner's Perspective self in volves people with borderline personalit y disorders; self - harm is an antidote to psy chological numbing. This doesn' t let pro viders off the hook in terms of assessing safet y and lethalit y but this sort of situation requires a different kind of assessment. A clinician must decide what direction the self -harm is heading\u2014from superficial and visible self -harm to deeper and less visible self -injury . People with certain t ypes of mental illness are more lik ely to be associated with escalating self -harm, with an ev er- greater lik elihood of a completed suicide. Objects, Substances, and Actions Common in Suicide Attempts Lethal means are things people might use in a suicide attempt that are lik ely to result in death (eg, firearms, medications, poisons). This can include objects such as firearms, substances such as alcohol or drugs, and actions such as jumping from a building. In Washington State, most people who die b y suicide use a firearm, suffocation (frequently hanging), or poisoning (drug or medication o verdose or sw allowing harmful substances). About half of suicides in W ashington in volve firearms. Less common, but still of concern, are suicide deaths b y jumping/falling or cutting. Limiting or reducing an at -risk person' s access to lethal means effectiv ely prev ents suicides (WSDOH, 2016).Possible determinants for different methods of suicide such as age, gender , suicide intent, mental health status, and timing ha ve been identified b y researchers. A study conducted in New Y ork found that although the most common method of suicide w as firearms, fall from height w as a common method b y elder residents. A study in Japan found that men were more lik ely to use lethal methods than women, with similar findings in European populations. The method used in an unsuccessful suicide attempt ma y predict later completed suicide, suggesting the study of suicide methods ma y be of significance in suicide prev ention (Sun and Jia, 2014). Suicide methods can be divided into two main categories: violent methods , which include firearm or shotgun, hanging, cutting and piercing with sharp objects, jumping from high places, and getting run o ver by train or other v ehicles. Nonviolent methods include ingestion of pesticides, poison b y gases, suffocation, and o verdose. Access, a vailabilit y, social acceptabilit y of certain suicide methods and some location-specific factors such as access to firearms or tall buildings are important factors to consider (Sun and Jia, 2014). Objects Commonly used in Suicide Attempts Household gun ownership r ates at the state lev el are a significant positiv e predictor of both homicides and suicides. A substantial proportion of Americans\u2014o ver 50%, in some states\u2014 live in households with guns and ma y not need to purchase a new firearm to carry out a violent act (S wanson et al. , 2015). More than half of male suicides (55.4%) in 2014 were firearm-related (NCHS , 2016). Although individuals who own firearms are not more lik ely than others to ha ve a mental disorder or to ha ve attempted suicide, the risk of a death is higher among this population because individuals who attempt suicide by using firearms are more likely to die in their attempts than those who use less lethal methods (HHS , 2012). Among v eterans, the most common means for suicide is firearms, with appro ximately 41% of female and 68% of male suicide deaths resulting from a firearm in 2014. The use of firearms as the mechanism for suicide death decreased among civilians from 2001 to 2014, but remained stable among v eterans. These results strongly suggest that firearms safet y initiativ es are lik ely an important component of an effectiv e suicide prev ention str ategy for male and female v eterans (USDV A, 2016b).

Data Sources: NCES N ational Vital Statistics System for numbers of deaths; US Cen sus Bureau for population estimates. Substances C ommonly Used in Suicide Attempts Poisoning (predominantly drug o verdose) is the leading mechanism for suicide death among females and the third leading mechanism for males aged 35 to 64. Despite this, current suicide prev ention str ategies are primarily targeted tow ards teenagers, y oung adults, and elders. This increase in suicide attempts (and suicide death) among middle- aged adults underscores the importance of understanding risk factors for suicide in this age group to ensure that targeted prev entive interv entions are implemented (T esfazion, 2014). Nearly all drug-related ED visits in volving suicide attempts among middle- aged adults involve prescription drugs and o ver-the-counter medications. About half of visits in volved anti-anxiet y and insomnia medications, 29% in volved pain reliev ers, and 22% in volved antidepressants. Within this age group , more than a third of all drug-related ED visits involving a suicide attempt also in volved alcohol, and 11% in volved illicit drugs (T esfazion, 2014).Among female v eterans, poison is the second-most common means of suicide\u201432% who die by suicide use poison. Among male suicide victims, suffocation is the second-most common cause of death (17%, 2014) (USDV A, 2016b). Inert gas asph yxiations such as those from helium ha ve also increased in the United States. The increasing familiarit y and lethalit y with helium is partly the reason for the rise in suicide b y helium. There are a man y internet websites that pro vide details on helium asphyxiations. Helium suicides ha ve also been publiciz ed as simple and painless. More formal recommendations regarding suicides with inert gas asph yxiations such as helium need to be dev eloped. Besides ph ysically restricting access to helium, one w ay to curb helium suicides would be to ha ve professionals assess if at -risk patients ha ve read materials on helium suicides (Hassamal et al. , 2015). Actions Common in Suicide Attempts The most frequent \"other \" suicide methods in 2014 for females were falls (2.8%) and drowning (1.4%). F or males, the most frequent \"other \" methods were falls (2.2%) and cutting or piercing (1.9%) (NCHS , 2016). Although falling from buildings or bridges is a relativ ely small percentage of suicide attempts, it is a particularly lethal method of suicide (Hemmer et al. , 2017). F or both females and males, about 25% of suicides in 2014 were attributable to suffocation (includes hanging, str angulation, and suffocation), an increase over previous y ears (NCHS , 2016). In the United States, from 2000 to 2010, asph yxiations increased b y 52%. The high prevalence of asph yxiations can be attributed to easy accessibilit y of rope and widespread availabilit y of other means for hanging. Currently , there are no specific formal proposals on how to reduce asph yxiation suicides. The easy a vailabilit y of ligature materials mak es prevention of hanging suicides a difficult task. R esearch indicates that those who attempted suicide b y hanging viewed it as a quick, simple, and painless death. Therefore, one w ay to reduce hanging suicides would be to challenge perceptions of hanging as a quick, simple, and painless suicide method (Hassamal et al. , 2015).

Talking About Lethal MeansProfessionals who pro vide healthcare services to patients at risk for suicide are in a unique position to ask about lethal means and work with these individuals and their support networks to reduce access. Pro viders can educate patients and families about safe firearm storage and access, as well as the appropriate stor age of alcoholic bev erages, prescription drugs, o ver-the-counter medications, and poisons. Howev er, man y may fail to do so , or do so only when a patient is identified as being at a v ery high risk for suicide (HHS , 2012). Individuals experiencing significant distress or who ha ve a recent history of suicidal behavior should not ha ve easy access to means that ma y be used in a suicide attempt, including firearms, other weapons, medications, illicit drugs, chemicals used in the household, other poisons, or materials used for hanging or suffocation. Providers should talk to patients and caregiv ers about reducing the stock of medicine in the medicine cabinet to a nonlethal quantit y, and locking medicines that are commonly abused (eg, prescription painkillers and benz odiazepines). This approach can be useful in helping to prev ent suicide, as well as unintentional o verdoses and substance abuse (HHS , 2012). Talking about Lethal Means\u2014A Nurse Practitioner's Guidance Once y ou ha ve identified that y our patient is at risk for self -harm, try to identif y any lethal means that y our patient might be able to access once he or she lea ves your office. Ask direct questions: \"While y ou're in this dangerous period, ma y I call y our partner or family member and ask them to remo ve the guns or poisons from the house?\" Ask permission and show concern in a non-judgmental manner \u2014this is more lik ely to elicit information from y our patient. Y ou can continue b y saying \"I w ant to let y ou know that I appreciate and am honored that y ou've shared y our thoughts with me. I'm just concerned that y ou ma y go again to a place of despair when y ou lea ve and I'm thinking of your safet y.\" Try to establish and maintain trust with y our patient \u2014if you think the person is at risk, there is no reason to co ver your concern or to lie. Restricting Access to Lethal Means Means restriction is the techniques, policies, and procedures designed to reduce access or availabilit y to means and methods of deliber ate self -harm. Among suicide prev ention interv entions, reducing access to highly lethal means of suicide has a strong evidence base and is now considered a k ey str ategy to reduce suicide death r ates (Betz et al. , 2016).Reducing access to firearms is particularly important, since firearm suicide attempts ha ve a high case-fatalit y rate and firearms account for 51% of all suicide deaths in the United States. P atients with firearm access at home might be considered at particularly high risk for discharge to their home, giv en that firearm access is a risk factor for suicide, the actual act of a suicide attempt often occurs within only minutes of the decision to attempt, and appro ximately 90% of firearm suicide attempts are fatal (compared to as few as 2% of medication o verdoses) (Betz et al. , 2016). While access to firearms and other lethal means in a patient with suicidal ideation and behavior b y itself does not mandate psy chiatric admission, restricting access to firearms is a key component of home safet y planning that should be addressed with all patients being discharged. Safe stor age of firearms and other lethal means has been associated with less risk for suicide among adults and y outh, and lethal means counseling in EDs might affect storage beha vior (Betz et al. , 2016). Reducing access to potentially to xic medications is also important but can be a challenge, given that man y of the medications used to treat mental illness can be to xic in an overdose. In one sample, 60% of patients reported currently taking at least one medication for an emotional or psy chological problem, and medication o verdose w as the suicide method most commonly reported as ha ving been considered (Betz et al. , 2016). Access to other lethal means of suicide\u2014such as sharp objects or supplies for hanging\u2014is also difficult to control giv en their widespread a vailabilit y for other purposes. Installing bridge barriers or otherwise restricting access to popular jump sites ma y prev ent deaths, depending on specific local conditions. Intervening at Suicide Hotspots Suicide hotspots, or places where suicides ma y take place relativ ely easily , include tall structures such as bridges, cliffs, balconies, and rooftops; r ailway tracks; and isolated locations such as parks. Efforts to prev ent suicide at these locations include erecting barriers or limiting access to prev ent jumping, and installing signs and telephones to encour age individuals who are considering suicide to seek help (Stone et al. , 2017).A meta- analysis examining the impact of suicide hotspot interv entions implemented in combination or in isolation, both in the United States and abroad, found associated reduced r ates of suicide. F or example, after erecting a barrier on the Jacques-Cartier Bridge in Canada, the suicide r ate for jumping from the bridge decreased from about 10 suicide deaths per y ear to about 3 deaths per y ear. Moreo ver, the reduction in suicides b y jumping w as sustained ev en when all bridges and nearb y jumping sites were considered, suggesting little to no displacement of suicides to other jumping sites. Further evidence for the effectiv eness of bridge barriers w as demonstr ated b y a study examining the impact of the remo val of safet y barriers from the Gr afton Bridge in A uckland, New Z ealand (see bo x) (Stone et al. , 2017). Unintended Consequences\u2014The Grafton Bridge, Auckland, New Zealand Safety barriers to prev ent suicide b y jumping were remo ved from Gr afton Bridge in Auckland, New Z ealand, in 1996 after ha ving been in place for 60 y ears. The barriers were reinstalled in 2003. A study compared mortalit y data for suicide deaths for three time periods: 1991-1995 (old barrier in place) 1997-2002 (no barriers in place) 2003-2006 (new barriers in place) Removal of barriers w as followed b y a fivefold increase in the number and r ate of suicides from the bridge. Since the reinstallation of barriers, there ha ve been no suicides from the bridge. This natur al experiment shows that safet y barriers are effectiv e in preventing suicide: their val increases suicides; their reinstatement prev ents suicides. Source: Harvard School of Public Health, 2017. jump sites are well-suited for suicide prev ention, giv en that a great number of suicides are often limited to a few structures. A t these hotspots, substantial suicide preventive effects can be achiev ed by a few prev ention efforts. Most interv entions for suicide prev ention on bridges are of a structur al nature (Hemmer et al. , 2017). Did You Know . . . The A urora Bridge in Seattle had the second highest suicide death toll in the United States (behind the Golden Gate Bridge). In 2006 emergency call bo xes and signs with a suicide hotline number were installed on the bridge. Suicides continued to occur at an a verage of about fiv e per y ear until a fence w as installed in 2011. In the 18 months afterw ard, only one suicide occurred (Dr aper, 2017). Outside view visualization of the Aurora Bridge Fence suicide barrier in Seattle prior to its construction in 2010. Source: Washington State Department of Transportation. Some interv entions to prev ent jumps from hotspots or other methods of suicide are not feasible for bridges. Although blocking access roads to hotspots ha ve been shown to deter suicide jumps, this is not a viable measure for most bridges. There is evidence that the number of suicides b y carbon mono xide poisoning in public parking lots has been reduced by installing aid signs. Howev er, no studies exist that ev aluate the effectiv eness of aid signs as the sole interv ention when used on bridges or other jumping sites, although they are widely installed (Hemmer et al. , 2017). Some research has shown that, if in addition to aid signs, emergency helpline phones are directly a vailable on bridges, the phones are used on a regular basis. Other research has shown that, in combination with increased police presence, emergency helplines led to a decrease in the number of suicides at the Sunshine Skyw ay Bridge in Florida (Hemmer et al., 2017). Safe St orage PracticesSan Francisco VA Health Care System providers are helping prevent Veteran suicide through lethal means safety. Source: U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs.Safe stor age of medications, firearms, and other household products can reduce the risk for suicide b y separ ating vulner able individuals from easy access to lethal means. Such pr actices ma y include education and counseling around storing firearms lock ed in a secure place (eg, a gun safe, lock bo x), unloaded and separ ate from the ammunition; and k eeping medicines in a lock ed cabinet or other secure location a way from people who may be at risk or who ha ve made prior attempts (Stone et al., 2017). In a case-control study of firearm-related ev ents identified from 37 counties in W ashington, Oregon, and Missouri, and from fiv e trauma centers, researchers found that storing firearms unloaded, separ ate from ammunition, in a locked place or secured with a safet y device w as protectiv e of suicide attempts among adolescents. Further , a recent systematic review of clinic and communit y-based education and counseling interv entions suggested that the pro vision of safet y devices significantly increased safe firearm stor age pr actices compared to counseling alone or compared to the provision of economic incentiv es to acquire safet y devices on one' s own (Stone et al. , 2017).

Counselin g on Access t o Lethal Means (ED CALM) The Emergency Department Counseling on Access to Lethal Means (ED CALM) has tr ained psychiatric emergency clinicians in a large children' s hospital to pro vide lethal means counseling and safe stor age bo xes to parents of patients under age 18 receiving care for suicidal beha vior. In a pre/post qualit y impro vement project, researchers found that, at post test 76% reported that all medications in the home were lock ed up as compared to fewer than 10% at the time of the initial ED visit. Among parents who indicated the presence of guns in the home at pre test (67%), all (100%) reported guns were currently locked up at post test (Stone et al. , 2017). Policy-Based Strategies Policy-based str ategies that restrict access to lethal means ha ve led to positiv e results. F or example, limiting access to suicide methods such as carbon mono xide has resulted in decreases in suicide b y carbon mono xide. R estriction of other suicide methods has also shown positiv e results. The implementation of enhanced restrictions to purchase firearms in the District of Columbia led to reductions in firearm-related suicides (Hassamal et al. , 2015). Implementation of means restriction is broad and can include (1) complete remo val of a lethal method, (2) reducing the to xicity of a lethal method, for example, reducing carbon mono xide content emissions from v ehicles, (3) interfering with ph ysical access, for example, using gun locks, (4) enhancing safet y, for example, encour aging at -risk families to remo ve lethal suicide means from the home, or (5) reducing the appeal of a more lethal method, for example, changing the perception of hanging as a quick and painless death. The majorit y of suicide attempts are tr ansient and the time between contemplating suicide and the attempt is less than 5 minutes for man y attempters. The method depends on what is readily a vailable (Hassamal et al. , 2015). Although this goal focuses on reducing access to lethal means among individuals at risk, evidence for means restriction has come from situations in which a univ ersal approach w as applied to the entire population. F or example, the deto xification of domestic gas in the United Kingdom and discontinuation of highly to xic pesticides in Sri Lanka were univ ersal measures associated with 30% and 50% reductions in suicide, respectiv ely (HHS , 2012). Concluding RemarksSuicide and suicide attempts are serious public health problems and issues of societal concern. R ates of suicide ha ve been on the rise for more than a decade and the costs stretch well into the billions of dollars each y ear. While suicide is a r are outcome statistically , it has a far -reaching effect. Each of us lik ely inter acts with suicide surviv ors and with those who think of suicide on a daily basis\u2014 at home, at work, and in our communities. A number of barriers that ha ve our impeded progress in reducing suicide in the United States, including stigma, mental illness, being a surviv or, and fear of discussing suicidal thoughts. F ortunately , like man y public health problems, suicide is prev entable and more is being done to prev ent suicide than ev er before, as evidenced b y the work of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prev ention, the release of the first world report on suicide, and more timely surv eillance data (Stone et al. , 2017).
