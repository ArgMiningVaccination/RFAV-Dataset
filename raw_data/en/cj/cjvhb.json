Recommended Reviews [Learn more about reviews.](https://www.yelp.com/reviews-trust-link-tree?l=en_US) Overall rating 5 stars 4 stars 3 stars 2 stars 1 star - 11/15/2016 All the practitioners are top notch. They are so welcoming and accommodating, they really listen to what is going on so they know how to best help. Just great energy all around. I always feel like a million bucks when I leave. Highly recommend!!! - 8/4/2021 So I went in to try acupuncture for pain management. Place seemed nice enough and first visit was good even. Was told would need several weeks to feel a change. So made an appointment for the following Friday. I just got a call that they are cancelling my appointment, couldn't reschedule me with anyone else. Less than 48 hours notice. I told the young man this was not an auspicious beginning and he said yeah tell me about it. Gotta say I can't recommend. - 10/19/2021 Love balance. I have been treated by Ric for a variety of reasons and always leave there feeling like I have made progress. Both he and Laura are amazing practitioners and people. - 11/28/2013First to Review I consider Ric and Laura to be among the most gifted and compassionate healers I have ever known. Balance is a really unique place, and it was a real blessing to find them. - 2/3/2016 I have been seeing Laura and Ric since they started their business decades ago. They are both local, regional and national experts in the field of acupuncture, nutrition and Chinese medicine. I've watched them grow Balance into a full service clinic that includes a wide array of alternative medical treatments and consultations healing virtually any and all ailments, endorsed by medical practitioners in all areas of both Western and Chinese medicine. Laura and Ric live their beliefs and practice the types of lifestyles and healing behaviors they teach. They know acupuncture inside and out and are extremely realistic about the expectations of and benefits from treatment. They treat the whole person- body, mind and soul and never forgo an opportunity to educate a person on how to heal themselves and improve their health naturally and uninvasively. Aside from their vast knowledge of the field of acupuncture and alternative medicine, they are genuinely loving, honest and empathetic people who are constantly seeking ways to reach out to our community to make them healthier and better educated in healing their bodies (and souls).
