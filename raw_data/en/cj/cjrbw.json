The main principle of Ayurveda is to set the balance in different aspects. When this balance disturbs, within or with the rest of the world we fall ill. And Ayurveda treatment is a methodology to bring back this balance and harmony, wherever it disturbs. So the approach of Ayurveda is more universal and holistic. Ayurveda treatment is not about- - Just using this or that herb for the treatment. - Doing some tantrums in name of health. - Making some unrealistic rules about life. - Selling some tea or spices in name of Ayurveda. - Guiding you for some \"monotonus\" rules for rest of the life. Ayurveda treatment is about- - Ensuring best quality of life. - Helping you to understand life in easier way. - Bringing freedom from all type of pains and discomforts. - Igniting the inner capacity of healing of the human body. - Rooting out the causative factors of the disease. Because of all these unique things, Ayurveda treatment is like a journey. A process and a commitment to improve the quality of life. Doshas: The Principles of Ayurveda Treatment Ayurveda augments about bringing the naturalness in body. This is why principles of Ayurveda revolves around the nature only. As we know, entire universe is regulated by the forces of Air, Sun and Moon. These three are responsible for harmony as well as the disturbances in the universe. Same three are basic concepts of Ayurvedic [Tridoshas](https://www.sukhayuayurved.com/tri-doshas/) i.e. Vata, Pitta and Kapha in human body. These are traits. These are bio-humors. Vata-Pitta and Kapha represents the scale of different activities in the body. These three Doshas regulate all the systems of the body physically and the psychological part of the body as well. When these three are in balance, we are healthy and their imbalance leads to disease. When we say balance, this cannot be an absolute condition with 33.33% share for all these three doshas. Balance means, the kind of harmony. When you need Vata for different activities, this should be available for the body, same applies to all. As long as these are in harmony the fellow will be healthy; any disturbance among these will result in a diseased condition. So in Ayurveda the main line of treatment is always aimed towards creating harmony among these three Doshas. Ayurveda Treatment is About Bringing Balance of Doshas There are two methods for Ayurveda treatment- - Shamana : to pacify Vata-Pitta-Kapha. - Shodhana: to cleanse the system and to expel the Vata-Pitta-Kapha. Selection of one of these procedures is done by a Vaidya, as per the condition of the patient and level of disease. The following examples can explain Shamana and shodhana easily. Here are examples of both types of treatments. Shamana Treatment - Sesame oil (Til tail) is good to pacify Vata. - Clarified butter (Ghee) pacifies Pitta. - Honey (Madhu/Shahd) is best for pacification of Kapha. As a reader you should take these as examples only. Because when words like - best for the pacification of this or that dosha is there- it means that it can aggravate the other dosha too. The most common mistake in following Ayurveda is- many Vaidyas believe that when they are pacifying or treating one Dosha, they miss the other two. The concept of Shamana treatment is based on the concepts of - Agonise and Antagonist. Agonise, means adding up, increasing. You have low Vitamin D and you take a pill for that with the same supplement- this is the example of Agonism. Antagonists are opposites. Your uric acid is high and you take a particular medicine that lowers it down. This is antagonism. But in Ayurveda, this is a bit complicated. Ayurveda doesn't believe in chemical constituents. The concept of Ayurveda revolves around Gunas- the specific characters. Ayurveda defines everything in terms of characters and specifications. Doshas have their specification, so has all the medicines and techniques. And amazingly what an Ayurveda medicine can do, the same can be done through dancing or running or even sleeping. Because dancing, sleeping, and running also bring changes in the body!! Shodhana Treatment The Shodhana treatment works according to the location of the Doshas in the body. Because location of Vata dosha is in lower one third of the body therefore the treatment involved applies in this region. The Shodhana treatment for the Vata diseases is the [Basti therapy](https://www.sukhayuayurved.com/ayurveda-treatment/panchakarma-treatment/classical-panchakarma/basti/). The anal route of medicines. The aggravated Pitta is expelled out of the body by Virechana i.e. therapeutic purgation. The Kapha Dosha dominates in the upper one third of the body. The nearest exit for the upper one third is mouth. Therefore aggravated Kapha is expelled out of the body by [Vamana therapy](https://www.sukhayuayurved.com/ayurveda-treatment/panchakarma-treatment/classical-panchakarma/vaman/) i.e. therapeutic vomiting. Vata is the only active Dosha in the body and rest two are dependent on Vata for their activities; so by harmonizing the Vata Dosha indirectly we are harmonizing all the three Doshas. This is the reason the Basti treatment is told as half of all the treatments. Some scholars of Ayurveda also told the Basti treatment as the complete treatment. This is about Shodhana part of Ayurveda treatment. How Does Ayurveda Treatment Work Ayurveda treatment, as said above is based on the approach of bringing back the balance in the body. Now it depends on your condition and diagnosis by a Vaidya, which line of treatment he selects. Because Ayurveda works on the holistic approach and is natural, it becomes important to work on different aspects of life. Lifestyle and diet are two important pillars of Ayurvedic treatment. How do we live and what we eat are two factors, which can impact all of our trillions of cells in one go. Western science nowadays recommends following proper diet and lifestyle, but the first line of treatment for Ayurveda is to lead a healthy lifestyle and proper diet. So success and failure of Ayurveda treatment depend on the way we follow the treatment. What is special about Ayurveda Treatment at Sukhayu Ayurveda is ancient, mystic, and simply complicated. It is simple because it only mirrors nature. And complication comes from the philosophical background of Ayurveda. When it is about applying ancient Ayurveda in 20th century. It is important to follow two conditions- - The original crux of Ayurveda should be maintained. - Ayurveda should be \"palatable\" for modern day lifestyle. - We need to apply Ayurveda as a contemporary system of medicine. - Outdated systems are never compatible. With these four points in mind [Vaidya Pardeep Sharm](https://www.sukhayuayurved.com/about-us/vaidya-pardeep-sharma/) [a](https://www.sukhayuayurved.com/vaidya-pardeep-sharma/) started Sukhayu Ayurved in Jaipur. This is why Sukhayu has its own crux.... Applying Ayurveda in Modern Day Context This is the reason, for Ayurveda treatment at [Sukhayu Ayurved](https://www.sukhayuayurved.com/about-us/) we believe in applying Ayurveda with proper scientific exposition. We use modern diagnostic tools extensively for sake of accurate diagnosis. Under the guidance of Vaidya Pardeep, we follow the principle of Charak Samhita which says- It is important to make a proper diagnosis before selection of any medicine or treatment.Charka Samhita This is the reason Sukhayu Ayurved doesn't have any product line to sell. And we believe in making a proper diagnosis before commenting on the treatment possibilities. Therefore for sake of accurate treatment, we work on exclusion and inclusion of the patient for the treatment. All your Queries about Ayurvedic Treatment Here are the FAQs and their answers about Ayurveda Treatment, this will help you to understand the details of treatment as per Ayurveda in a better way- Generally, when the conventional system of medicine fails every eyeball turns to Ayurveda. But it is not like that \"everything is curable in Ayurveda\". Ayurveda is the only science, where diseases are classified as Sadhya (curable), Asadhya (Incurable), and Pratyekhyey (Just Manageable). When you visit a knowledgeable Vaidya he can guide you about the category of the disease you are in. Everything is curable through Ayurveda, only quacks say so, not the educated Vaidyas. Not at all. Panchakarma is part of the Shodhana treatment. Yes Basti is like a complete treatment. But medicines, diet and lifestyle- are other tools for the treatment and it can be done easily. When panchakarma is required and when not- a genuine Vaidya can decide. Restrictions are for the purpose of the treatment. For example you are diabetic and you want to intake sugar- it wont help you certainly in managing the condition. Therefore, you need to restrict yourself. This is the reason in Ayurveda treatment there are some restrictions on diet and lifestyle. For diabetes you need to continue the medicines for whole life. Same is applicable with Hypertension, thyroid and many other conditions in western medicines. Contrary to this, if Ayurveda takes 4 to 5 months for a disease it becomes slow? Ayurveda might be slow, but results of Ayurveda treatment are always permanent. In this way when we are targeting towards harmonizing all the three Doshas, we are working for complete "}
