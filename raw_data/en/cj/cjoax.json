Whereas static tests provide some information on overall potential acid generation independent oftime, kinetic tests explicitly defme reaction ratesthrough timeunder thespecific conditions test that isapplied. However, general literature does notclearly demonstrate that kinetic testing iscapable ofproviding highly accurate or precise long-term predictions about acidgeneration and metal liberation. Such tests provide arelatively short- term, qualitative appraisal ofthepotential oxidation of thesamples inquestion. Kinetic testdata often poorly predict actual future water quahty numbers because the minerals thatsupply buffering (i.e.,carbonates) generally react rapidly, while theminerals thatsupply acidity (i.e..pyrite) react relatively slowly. Many tests areonly indicative oftherapid reactions. Most short-term, kinetic tests areconducted atprivate laboratories, usually fora20-week period.

Long-term, laboratory kinetic tests that attempt to simulate field conditions especially the annual precipitation and particle size, willoften leach larger samples (kilograms) ofrun-of-mine material forover a year. Since these tests aremore expensive, they are conducted attheminesite where larger samples canbe more easily accommodated acidgeneration, neutralization, and metal depletion and to test control/treatment techniques.

Landusky Geological comparison .Geological/paleoenvironmental comparisons between very similar deposits havebeen shown tobeappropriate inlieu ofmore extensive baseline kinetic testing. While useofthiscomparative technique hasmostly been directed toward coalmining, recent studies indicate (USFS/DEQ 1995) thistechnique also applies locally tovery similar metal deposits with similar rock types and associated alteration. This method hasbeen used inMontana forhomogeneous metal deposits such asthestratabound copper-silver innorthwestern were verysimilar. Results indicate, that foreach rock type, material from both minesites arevery similar with respect togeology andmineralogy (Richardson 1973; Russell 1991b; Russell 1995), iron sulfide types and occurrences (Honea 1992), total sulfur, paste pH,NP, AP,andNNP (Miller 1995). Onthis basis, ageologic comparison method wasusedandonly limited kinetic testing wasconducted ontheLandusky materials.

Therefore, thesame criteria developed fortheZortmem mine would apply fortheadditional waste tobe generated bytheLandusky extension.

The major aquifer surrounding the Little Rocky Mountains istheMadison Group. TheMadison Group (also called theMadison Mountains, the Lodgepole Limestone isabout 478feet thick, andthe Mission Canyon Limestone is325feet thick (Feltis 1983). TheMission Canyon Limestone forms great ridges attheouter rimoftheLittle Rocky Mountains, aswellasseveral prominent ridges andbuttes areaand inthefoothills (Feltis 1983).

Groundwater isrecharged throughout the Little Rocky Mountains including the open pitareas. Some ofthisrecharge, discharges to surface insections from500to3,000 feet inlength (Knectel 1959). Although some recharge totheMadison Group occurs from precipitation ontheflanks ofthe Little Rocky Mountains andbyinfiltration from streams, theprincipal regional source ofrecharge fortheMadison Group are thevastoutcrops oftheBigSnowy and Little Belt (Feltis 1983).

Allsoilmapping anddescriptions developed and presented inthe 1991summary soil survey were conducted inaccordance with theNational CooperativeSoil Survey using procedures outlined inUSDA Handbooks 18,430,and 436, andunpublished soil survey guidelines provided bytheMontana Department ofStateLands (DSL 1985). Bodies ofsoil (soil mapping units) were initially identified emd verified inthe field using topographic maps and both color and black-and-white aerial photography ofthestudy areas. Aspart ofthefield verification of soil units (soil with similar characteristics), profiles ofdelineated soilunits were exposed byexcavation at asample site. Based onfield observations ofsoil profiles and interpretation of soiland landform relationships, adjoining soilthat differed markedly in physical and/or chemical characteristics were delineated intoseparate units with aminimum sizeoftwo acres. SoU that differed slightly inphysical and/or chemical from adjoining use in sampled forsubsequent laboratory analyses forsoilproperties important totheassessment ofasoil asasuitable plant growth medium. The assessment ofsoil characteristics also included the evaluation ofsoilmaterials foruses other than cover soil,growth medium; evaluations forsuitability drain layer, were alsocompleted. 3.3.2.1 Mountain Soil Soil inthemountainous portions ofthestudy area are predominantly young soil inthe early stages of development duetotherelatively continuous lossofsoil material from rapid runoff onsteep slopes (ZMI 1993, Appendix 3). Soil material (less than 2mm-sized fraction) isweathering from exposed rock surfaces and masses ofbroken rockdeposited byerosion inrock falls Drainage bottoms andanylowterraces consist ofwater deposited materials (alluvium) derived from these parent materials. Detailed soil-type mapping, map unit descriptions, site-specific soilprofile descriptions, and 3-118 portion ofthestudy area similar ageasthemountain soil.

Soil ofmuch ofthese steeper areas have coarse fragment factors ofapproximately 0.21. intheGoslin FlatsandRuby Flats 8percent range from atrace to approximately 60percent.

The soil isanessential resource, which when properly salvaged, protected, and redistributed, would hasten reclamation andnew soilformation. Soilofthe Little Rocky Mountain area are likely a minimum of10,000 years oldandhavedeveloped since the lastmajor climatic change and major soil distiu'bance associated with theretreat oftheicesheets and glaciers. These soilhave developed degrees distinct layers orhorizons inresponse to climate, weathering ofparent materials, erosion and deposition ofsoil materials, and biological activity including introduction oforganic matter from thedecay ofvegetative litterandplant roots. Salvaged topsoil (surface horizon) usually have higher organic matter contents, which typically increases productivity. Salvaged subsoil, due tonatural sorting greatly onaffected landforms canoccurma matter ofafew years, depending onenviromnental conditions and effectiveness oftheimplemented reclamation plan. The absence ofareclamation program involving soilsalvage, storage, andreplacement would waste the previous 10,000 years of soil development. Salvage, storage, and theordered replacement ofsoilmaterials \"short-circuits\" thetime required toreach ahigher level ofsoildevelopment, soil stability, and vegetative productivity comparable to existing, predisturbance conditions. Based onthequahtative characterization ofthe soil resource andquantitative analytical impact susceptibihty and recl2miation suitabihty canbeassessed. The sections describe reclamation potential of various soil inthiscontext. 3.3.3.1 Mountain Soil Soiloccupying steep slopes arefrequently susceptible to accelerated water erosion, particularly when disturbed; however, most ofthemountain soilsituated onsteep slopes within theZortman andLandusky area havelow tomoderate erosion potentials. These soil have ahigh coarse fragment content, which serves to stabilize thesoil-sized fraction and, insome cases, armor thesurface; both factors increase resistance towater erosion and soil loss.Over time, themountain soilhave become armored through Inaddition, soilare covered withvegetation toreduce erosive rainfall impact velocities. Roots amd organic matter accumulation increase infiltration characteristics intothe soil.The development ofsoilstructure, effects offreezing and thawing, plants root growth, andthe activity bysoil animals reduce soilbulk density. The high coarse fragment content, incombination with (1)mostly coarser soil textures, ofthestudy areawould result inmostly low accelerated erosion.

Low elevation, south-facing slopes support adiversity of shrub species, providing browse andsnow-free areas for wintering wildlife. Lower elevation riparian zones support aspen andwillow communities, providing habitat requirements forturkeys, passerine birds andsmall mammals. Adjoining shortgrass prairies provide habitat forpronghorn antelope andforaging areas forraptors. Numerous wildlife studies havebeen conducted within theZortman area, ageneral reconnaissance andaseries oftheimpacts oftheproposed Zortman mine was conducted in1978(WESTECH 1978).

BaldEag le -The bald eagle isafederally listed endangered species. Montana Mountains observed site.Bald eagles have been recorded intheLittle Rocky Mountains onone occasion during Audubon Society Christmas Birdcounts (American Birds 1982). However, bald eagles are winter residents within Phillips County, particularly along theMissouri juidMilk Rivers, concentrating in areas ofopen water where asfood thatcould provide nesting orforaging habitat donot exist(WESTECH 1991). The Phillips Resource Area is used during spring and fallmigration, withpeak use occurring inMarch, April, andNovember. Bald eagles appear tomigrate through Phillips County somewhat concurrent withthewaterfowl spring and fallmigrations (BLM 1992b).

Two separate studies conducted during the late 1970s thoroughly searched thenon-reservation portion ofthemountains during thenesting season, and noperegrines were observed (Farmer 1977,Scow 1978). Seven peregrine falcon sightings were recorded during spring of1986 within thePhillips Resource Area(BLM 1986). Anarea ofthe Little Rocky Mountains containing cliffnesting sites forperegrines was searched inJuly1985andApril 1986. Prairie falcons were actively defending territories atthis site, prohibiting theestablishment ofaperegrine falcon nesting territory (BLM 1985, 1986). Currently, a peregrine falcon working group isinvestigating siteswithin thePhillips Resource Area, including theLittle Rocky Mountains, for potential reintroduction of peregrine falcons. Additionally, potential nesting sites within 1/2mileoftheproposed minedevelopment land-use andpoisoning programs over thelast century have substantially reduced potential black-footed There arehistorical records ofblack-footed ferrets in theprairie habitat within Phillips Resource Area, but none within the Little Rocky Mountains. Flath and Clark (1986) listtwo ferret specimens from Phillips County in1923and1924. Recent unconfirmed sightings havebeenmade inadjoining areas, andskeletal remains were found ontheFortBelknap Indian Reservation in 1983. The historic range oftheferrets corresponds tothe range ofblack-tailed prairie Montana.

The area surrounding theCamp Creek campground provides good habitat forsongbirds. Currently there areminimum associated with thewildlife display describing thewildlife thatcanbe observed inthearea. The Phillips Resource Area contains three Recreation Management Areas (RMAs). BLM land within the Phillips Resource Area provided anestimated 29,600 recreation visits in1992(Whitehead 1995). The Little Rocky Mountain RMA, which encompasses approximately 25,800 acres ofpublic land, isintheareaoftheZortman andLandusky mines. Anestimated 7,000 visits occur aimually onBLM lands within this RMA. Primary dispersed usesinclude hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, all-terrain vehicle (ATV) use, wildlife/bird watching, caving, climbing and hunting. These activities occur inmany locations inthe Little Rocky Mountains, including many oftheroads, trails andmountains inthe vicinity oftheZortman and Landusky mines. Sightseeing (i.e., walking, biking, or driving ontheaccess roads and trails throughout the area) andpicnicking account forthemajority withapproximately \u00a3md trails.

The landforms, colors and textures ofthelandscape havebecome more varied than theplains, andrepresent aunique scenic resource within theHigh Plains province. Forms aremore distinct, and range from sharply angular along ridges separating the many drainages, tothemore rounded forms ofthetops ofthebuttes. Coniferous vegetation provides year- round green color. The scattered open, grassy areas, rock outcroppings, andareas with dense tree cover provide variation intheoverall textures andpatterns of thelandscape. Although mountain scenery isofhighvalue within the LittleRocky Mountains, portions oftheproject site itself havebeen heavily impacted mine exploration andoperation activities. Prior surface mining operations began atboth theZortman andLandusky mines, surface disturbance associated with historic mining activity was visible inAlder andRuby Gulches nearZortman and in thearea ofGoldBugButte near Landusky. Visual contrasts were caused byaccess roads, exploration pits, surface mining, aditsandwaste rock stockpiles. Visibility ofthese disturbed areas wasgenerally confined toa small localviewshed andnotvisible from themain travel routes. Current disturbances tothelandscape include those activities associated with the existing Zortman and Landusky mines. These visual contrasts include open pits,waste rockdumps, heap leach pads, plant facilities, andchanges invegetation pattern caused bylogging and forest fires.

Thenoise andleaching measurements were collected a24-hour period using aLarsen Davis Laboratories Model 710 Dosimeter/Sound Level Meter, emdwere recorded as equivalent continuous noise levels (Leq). Thissound levelmeter meets theinstrument standards established bythefederal government. Baseline noise levels were collected onMarch 10and 17, 1991 todetermine normal ambient levels withminimal contribution from mining activities.

The estimated noise level attheTown ofZortman, about 4 miles from theblast site, is81dBA. These noise level approximations areprobably higher than actual levels experienced because theelevated terrain between the mines and thetowns andmeteorological conditions (wind, humidity) would further reduce noise levels. However, conditions such asdirect windfrom thenoise site tothereceptor can also result inhigher than predicted levels. 3-170 TABLE 3.9-1 BASELINE AMBIENT NOISE LEVELS (dBA)MEASURED totheMillGulch leach pad 6Northwest pitfloor island oftheQueen Rose Pit 7 Mission Canyon gate 8 King's Creek Monitoring well location 9West Timberline oftheKing's Crerek reclamation project 10Lower eastridge Access roadway across the1984Landusky paddike 12West fence lineoftheLiuidusky 1983 leach pad contingency pond 14Along theridgeline above oftheLewis property AVERAGE 60.1 51.3 'Mining operations suspended during ^Noise levels atthislocation byvehicular traffic. ooRooooC4-Io .s u C/3 O <> -s 2Sf i s Affected Environment 3.10SOCIOECONOMICS topics are within thestudy area. 3.10.1 Study Area existing anduseofnatural resources.

Therefore, socioeconomic statistics forboth Blaine and Phillips counties include information about thepopulation ontheFortBelknap Indian Reservation. However, statistics about Blaine County aremuchmore heavily influenced bythereservation population, which TheFortBelknap Indian Reservation hasaUmited job base andfew private employers. The three largest employers located onthereservation aregovernment agencies. TheFortBelknap Indian Community employs about 135people, theFort Belknap Agency ofthe Bureau ofIndian Affairs (BIA) employs about 55 people, and the Indian Health Service ofthe Department ofHealth andHuman Services employs about 35people.

Taxable value isestablished byMontana statute asapercentage ofmarket value byPhillips County government andonsome byZMIbytheCityofMalta. Property taxes for public education areassessed atseveral different jurisdictional levels. The State ofMontana levies property taxes forthestate university system and for programs thatsupport local public schools. State levies forlocal school support arepooled andredistributed by formula. Therefore, theymay indirectly benefit schools within Phillips County through theState school funding equalization programs. Other State mandated public education property taxes areassessed atthecounty level forsupport ofpublic schools within thecounty andforschool are pooled atthecounty levelandredistributed byformula toschools within thecounty.Still other public education directly bythelocal school districts whereZMI property islocated. These aretheMalta Elementary School District, which operates elementary schools inMalta and Zortman; theMalta High School District, which serves high school students from Malta, Zortman, andother communities in Phillips County, theLandusky Elementary School District, which operates the Landusky Elementary School; andtheDodson High School District, which serves highschool students from Landusky, Dodson andother communities inPhillips Coimty.

These workers lived inthearea before themines reopened, and probably would continue tolivethere ifthemines closed (Benson 1994). 3.10.5 Social Conditions Inthissection, County, including theFortBelknap Indian Community centered ontheFortBelknap Indian Reservation. Then, an overview ofsocial values (orother population amixed picture, suggesting thepositive andnegative factors associated with rural areas. The county lacks some basic services: thenumber of physicians per100,000 population ismuch lower than stateemdnational educational attetinment lacking some plumbing (anindicator quality) averages. thestateandnation, family income islower below lower waslower than state averages, \u00a3mdthecrime rate(1991) waslower than state averages. Other positive factors arethesparse population (which contributes tothelow crime rate), plentiful opportunities predominance 3.10.5.2 Social 3.10-18 presents information about County much ofwhich isavailable notbe forthe Belknap ofthispart Educational attainment andnational averages, and the proportion ofhousing lacking some orallplumbing is higher than state averages. Blaine County asawhole hasamuch lower rateofphysicians topopulation than thestateandnational averages. (This care income in1991 islower than state andnational averages and, inBlaine County andthe reservation, median family income isalsolower than both reference areas. Inaddition, thepercent of families below thepoverty lineandtheunemployment rate(both for1989) were higher than state averages, especially ontheFortBelknap Indian Reservation, and 3-204 Affected Environment out-migration thecrime rate inBlEiine County waslower than state averages. Again, positive characteristics are sparse population, plentiful opportunities forrecreation, and apredominance of family ranching operations. Inaddition, persons onthe Fort Belknap Indian Reservation receive targeted federal assistance formedical care, housing, nutrition, andeducation which cancontribute toahigher level of social well-being. 3.10.5.3 Social Values inPhillips County Residents ofPhilhps County place considerable value upon self-reliance, life,andtheavailability of natural resources. Self-reliance istypified bythe essential public safety andhealth services volunteerism. Fireandambul2mce services are allvolunteer, andemployers generally support theiremployees obligation tobeon24-hour call. Phillips County residents also value the attributes ofrural, small-town hfesuch asgood, andlack ofurban congestion. Negative attributes are lackofcommercial transportation, limited availability of goods and services, lack ofcultural activities, andan undiversified economy. Forlong-term residents of Phillips County, the positive attributes generally outweigh thenegative. Natural resources andother aspects oftheenvironment areimportant toPhillips County residents economically because many stillrelyon agriculture for aUvelihood, for the recreational opportunities they afford, and fortheappeal of undeveloped orminimally developed space (SBS Economic Consulting 1990). 3.10.5.4 Social Values inBlaine County Social values inBlaine County varyamong thethree largest social groups: farmers and ranchers, townspeople, andNative Americans oftheFortBelknap Indian Community. Social values ofNative Americans residing ontheFortBelknap Indian Reservation are described inanother section (Ref?). Blaine County farmers and ranchers are generally political conservatives whose predominant social values are frugality, self-reliance, andhard work. Independence andaclose isimportant tofarmers interchange isalsovalued (Economic Consultants Northwest ofHarlem andChinook value the attributes oflocal, small-town life: characteristics andhasstimulated community action foreconomic development (Economic Consultants Northwest 1991). 3.10.5.5 Social Values oftheFort Belknap Native American Community Most oftheinformation presented bthissection on social values oftheFortBelknap Native American Community hasbeen paraphrased from available reports. The ofexisting reports individuals selected due toconvenience, availability, and willingness tospeak (Bigby 1993, King 1993, Spencer 1993). Noadditional formal research hasbeen undertaken forthisstudy to defme (a)thesocial TheFortBelknap Indian Community, centered onthe Indian Reservation, encompasses two tribal groups, theAssiniboine andtheGros Ventre, which have distinct tribal histories, experience, and concerns. The two tribal groups share ajoint government and English asaprimary language. Intermarriage alsooccurs between members ofthetwo tribes. There issome the Little Rocky Mountains, inDodson and inFortBelknap Agency housing. Within tribal groups, sub-groups may be defined byage, tribal blood degree, traditionalism, and assimilation. On-reservation ofjobsandhousing (Economic Consultants Northwest 1991). Asagroup, theAssiniboine characterize themselves as sticking together, getting along withoneanother, and looking fordirection totheoldest, wisest andmost spiritual among them (tribal elders). Native American religion andtraditions arehighly valued. Asagroup, theGros Ventre characterize economic well-being. Atendency Americans issaid toexistamong theGros Ventre (Economic Consultants Northwest The Community alsomaybe grouped interms theFortBelknap Indian Community since even before theadvent oftheZortman mine extension proposal. Some members oftheNative American community object totheexisting mineandtheproposed extension because ofpotential effects upon lifestyle and cultural values, thenatural environment, andeconomic development potentials based onnatural and cultural resources. Formal organizations havebeenamong the most publicly outspoken groups within thecommunity. Organizations opposing theexisting mineandproposed extension include Red Thunder, Inc.and Island Mountain Protectors (Ref?). Partoftheconcern among Native Americans over the existing mineandproposed extension maybelinked to useoflocations intheLittle Areas thataresought forsuch purposes aregenerally remote amd usually free of modern land uses. These characteristics aresought because theactivities Native Americans wish topursue require uninterrupted solitude, availability ofspecific resources. These locations havebecome lessand lessavailable with modern development and, therefore, more important to Native Americans. The activities thatexpress traditional cultural values include vision questing, ceremonial sweats, collection ofplants forceremonial andmedicinal purposes, and thecollection ofvarious minerals for paints. Native Americans donotusually equate the conduct ofthese activities with specific localities, but with amore generalized setting that affords the opportunities they feelareimportant (BLM 1987). The Little Rocky Mountains aresuchanarea, according to comments made byseveral Native Americans and comments made attheEISscoping meetings. The reader would fmdmore information ontheusesoftheLittle Rocky Mountains byNative Americans in Section 3.12, Cultural Resources. Strahn (1992) provides information onthemeaning of mining inLittle Rocky Mountains totheFortBelknap Indian Community. According toStrahn, current grow stems the\"immense cultural significance (oftheLittle Rocky Mountains]\" (Strahn 1992, p.6).The tothemountains without thebenefits ofownership. In this context, the Little Rocky Mountains areboth symbol andsubstance oftribal tradition, ofthelossof traditional tribal resources and values, and ofthe potential toregain traditional values and restore continuity between present and past. 3.10.5.6 Ability toAdapt toChange in Phillips County Information inthissection istaken theJudith Phillips Resource Management Plan information wastaken from the socioeconomic report ofSBSEconomic Consulting 3-207 Affected Environment (1990). Note that thediscussions with study area residents thatarereferenced inthese sources were not specifically intended toassess thecommunity's ability theearly 1900s. Thegold district oftheLittle Rocky Mountains was incommercial production using a cyanide process almost continuously from 1903 until 1949. After a30-year hiatus, goldmining resumed in 1979,when theZortman andLandusky mines were opened intheir current form. Bentonite mining and milling took place inPhiUips County from 1979, until the minewasclosed andtheplantwastorndown tobethelargest gasproducer inthearea.Two natural gas pipelines cross Phillips County, and their construction created short employment bursts: the Northern Border Pipeline segment oftheTrans-Alaska PipeUne system in1981and1982, andtheWhitewater Gathering System from 1978 to1986(SBSEconomic Consulting 1990). Malta, thecounty seatandprincipal community, retains itsidentification with agriculture. Residents who discussed social conditions with theBLM in1989 described Malta asasmall, friendly, rural, and cooperative community. However, theynoted several changes within therecent past that have affected community diversity andthedistribution ofpower and resources within thecommunity. Although oftenmust leave because ofthelackofjob opportunities. Malta also has agrowing elderly population because medical facilities andhousing attract retirees from thesurrounding countryside. Losing the bentonite plant in1988 didaway with alargenumber of relatively high-paying mining jobs. Although people employed attheZortman mines andearly weekend dances inMalta attracted large local crowds. Today, withthepopulation aging, residents increasingly depend onfamily andfriends forsecurity group forsocial that decisions mining, oilandgas,agriculture, andtransportation that have acrucial effect onlocaleconomic well-being are made bycorporations based elsewhere orbyagencies subject tomore outside than local influence (SBS Economic Consulting 1990). InPhiUips County, attitudes expressed toward mining in the1989 interviews were generally positive. Thiswas mainly duetothebeUef thattheZortman andLandusky mines havehadapositive effect onthelocaleconomy. Some who had positive attitudes toward mining acknowledged having concerns about water quahty and visual impacts; however, theyseemed tofeel the environmental effects ofmining could bemanaged. There was thecycUcal nature of and beyond local control. 3.10.5.7 County Information 1987). Additional information istaken from thesocioeconomic report of Economics Consultants Northwest (1991). Although Blaine County ismainly agricultural, mining has historicaUy contributed to local economic development, and local attitudes toward mining reflect this belief. Commercial mining within thecounty has focused onoil,gas,and coal. Major oilandgasfields begun inthe first ofthecentury eastofChinook fedbyoilwas in from to1964. Commercial coalmining occurred from 1930 to1970 near Chinook. Granite quarrying took during inthegoldmining history ofthebroader region because itisadjacent toLittle Rocky Mountains (Economic Consultants Northwest 1991). The social structure ofBlaine County isanadaptive one which addresses local issues through cooperative action andprovides mutual support inthefaceofchange that isbeyond local control. Although people intheareaare independent, social interchange isamong themost valued fraternal andreligious organizations. These groups have cooperated witheachother toaddress community issues ofhousing and neighborhood revitalization and economic development. Atthesame time, residents are wellaware that decisions about mining, Uttle affinity forlocal society (Economic Consultants Northwest 1990). Local attitudes toward mining aregenerally positive. However, there isalso awariness towards mining because ofitscyclical nature andpotential toconflict with visual ofwell-being. and social section oftheBLM's Judith-Valley-Phillips Resource Management PlanManagement Situation Analysis (BLM 1989), thesocioeconomics report of Economic Consultants Northwest (1991) prepared for Pegasus Gold, thework ofStrahn (1992), andtheWest Highline Resource Management ofconflict development. During the 1880s, widespread illegal mining occurred intheLittle Rocky Mountains. In1895, Mountains. theFortBelknap Indian Community depending onhow mining effects, including socioeconomic and environmental effects, areperceived. The social structure oftheFort Belknap Indian Community iscomplex. Although divided inmany ways,thecommunity shows evidence ofgroup action issues. whether one hasland orislandless; andbyage, kinship, place of residence, and spiritual orientation. Most group action topromote economic well-being and solve social problems involves agencies oftheFortBelknap Indian Community Council. Recent examples include adrug abuse program, ajoint housing initiative with the National Indian Housing Council, aparenting skills program forteens, apopulation andlabor ofhunting, fishing, andtourism onthe reservation (Economic Consultants Northwest 1991). Attitudes toward mining within theFortBelknap Indian Community areconditioned bythehistorical experience withmining intheLittleRocky Mountains. mines areaccepted bysome within theFortBelknap Indian Community asageneral economic benefit and source ofemployment. For others, theeconomic benefits donot offset attitudes ofresentment and opposition. Strahn (1992) argues that opposition to mining intheLittleRocky Mountains onthereservation typically goeshand-in-hand witharevived adherence to native religious andsecular traditions. Thecombination ofthetwo represents anew political and cultural consensus according referendum ofaproposal toallow mining Little Mountains. Opposition tomining alsohasbeen expressed byRed Thunder, Inc., aprivate interest group which ishighly visible andmakes effective useofmodern techniques of politics, communications, advance traditionalism. Tosummeirize, feeltheirwayoflife-small communities surrounded by arelatively unspoiled environment and outdoor recreation opportunities-is desirable. However, realconcern generations duetoa over resource development including mining. Ingeneral, residents favor economic growth through resource development orother industry because itwould provide 3-209 Affected Environment employment forthem and their children andwould promote overall economic well-being. Ontheother hand, they wish tocontinue toenjoy the lifestyle associated withoutdoor recreation, sparse population, andundeveloped natural surroundings. TheFortBelknap Indian Community isalsotornover themining issue, but inadifferent way. Like the surrounding Belknap Native Americans areconcerned about alack alike. However, isoffset Rocky Mountains because Landusky mines. 3-210 Transportation 3.11TRANSPORTATION This section describes both the historic andcurrent transportation network which provides access tothe Zortman/Landusky project areaandother portions of theLittleRocky Mountains inthevicinity oftheproject area.

This discussion focuses primarily onroads that (a)provide access tothe proposed extended Area area fortransportation includes major highways andminor roads inBlaine and Phillips counties thatprovide access totheZortman/Landusky project area. Regional highways androads provide the primary means ofaccess inandoutoftheproject area while local roads provide access tothecommunities of Zortman andLandusky, aswell asthesouthern Little Rocky Mountains including theZortman/Landusky mining areas.

While thesignificance of cultural hasbeen welldefined andprotection steps codified, protection offered totraditional lifeway values hasbeen interpreted much more broadly under AIRFA thanunderNHPA. The discussion ofbaseline cultural resources forthe Zortman mine extension project andLandusky Mine reclamation hasbeen divided into three sections: prehistoric (archaeological) resources, historic resources, and ethnographic ortraditional Native American resources. Studies havebeenconducted intheZortman andLandusky vicinity tolocate, record, andevaluate all three ofthese resource types, and toinclude archaeological andhistoric field surveys, historic records searches, and interviews with Native Americans (ethnographic studies). Native American cultural resources include thevalues Native Americans associate witheach resource orresource class. TheBLM hasdefined anArea ofPotential Effect properties, archaeological and historical resources (seeFigure 3.12-1), containing approximately 12,800 acres. Both direct and indirect impacts within theAPEwould beanalyzed. Deaver and Kooistra (1992) note thatmany traditional NativeAmericans believe theLittle Rocky Mountains are all and thevalues associated withthem. 3.12.1 Regulatory Setting and Significance Criteria The key legislative directives for identifying and protecting historic properties areprovided inSection 106 oftheNHPA. Regulations implementing thislegislation arefound define requirements forfederal agencies toconsult withtheState Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), the Federal Advisory Council onHistoric Preservation (Council), andother interested parties toensure that historic properties areduly considered asfederal projects areplanned and implemented. These requirements areinaddition toconsideration given all resources underNEPA. The steps intheSection 106 process areasfollows: Define theArea ways toavoid impacts if significant properties areidentified; Provide theCouncil opportunity to comment ontheproposed undertaking and Proceed with theundertaking theterms ofaMemorandum bytheNHPA. Eligible properties include buildings, structures, sites, andgroups ofsuch resources maybeconsidered eUgible forinclusion in theNational Register ifthey possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feehng, andassociation.

Thepath toritual authority wasquestioned, and many elders who possessed knowledge ofnative doctoring, sacred songs, 2mdreUgious protocols died without passing ontheirknowledge totheir christianized children (Tucker 1981 inStrahn 1993).

Significant topographic modification hasoccurred atboth mines from the mining activities conducted diuing theyears 1979 through 1994. Thetopographic alterations create far-reaching, indirect impacts beyond the direct aesthetic effects. The changed topography has resulted insignificant modification tothenatural water balance andquality of water resoiu-ces inthearea. For instance, waste rockdumps, mine pits,andheap leach increased thesurface areaandallow ofsiuface capability tohighly ofbroken uprockandsediment. Water infiltrating through these surfaces isable toreadily dissolve minerals anddegrade water quality. Therefore, asa result ofthetopographic changes imposed bymining, seepage togroundwater hasincreased andthequality havebeenshown togenerate acid when contacted bysurface water orgroundwater seepage, increasing the potential forwater quality degradation. resulting acceleration andvelocity map etal.1990), the thelowest riskarea designated (Earthquake Zone 1).TheNational Geophysical and Solar Terrestrial Data Center oftheNational Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration conducted asearch of recorded earthquakes within aradius of200miles ofthe mining area (Colder Associates 1992). The largest earthquake ofrecord, with aMagnitude of5,occurred in1968 approximately 77miles away (that is,the estimated distance oftheearthquake lociorcenter to the Little Rocky Mountains). The horizontal acceleration attheZortman Mine from thiseventwould havebeen approximately 0.01 g,aunitexpressing a percentage oftheearth's gravitational pull.

Some additional mining would occur attheSeaford and Williams clay pits,andKingCreek limestone quarry to provide reclcimation materials. New disturbance would occur atLSI, theproposed sitetoquarry limestone for theZortman Mine. Little alteration attheSeaford clay pits, since theamount ofclaytobemined isrelatively small andthesitehas already been disturbed. However, themodification would begreater than that anticipated under Alternatives 1or2.Agreater level oftopographic impact would occur attheWilliams clay pit,based andtheresultant disturbance ofapproximately 9acres.

Thecumulative effect ofmore protective reclamation covers and pitbench reclamation would betolessen adverse indirect impacts towater quality. 4.1.5.2 Adverse Creek andWilliams clay pits,and King Creek andLS-1 limestone quarries would be unavoidable. Significant, indirect adverse consequences toother resources such aswater, soils, vegetation, and habitat would continue; however, theenhanced reclamation covers andother reclamation mitigations should lessen these impacts relative toAlternatives asreclaunation materials toprotect other environmental resources such assurface water and groundwater. Long-term productivity ofgeologic resources could beaffected, as follows. Asignificant and viable mineral deposit is proven toexist indeeper zones below theZortman and Landusky Mine pits. a pit,cmestimated 14 material would have toberemoved forafuture mine operation toaccess deeper ore reserves, adding significant, possibly prohibitive startup costs toanynew mine venture. I 4-10 Geology inreclamation constitutes anirretrievable commitment of resources. Because these resources areavailable locally and regionally inessentially unlimited quantities, the impact isnot significant. Ifpitbackfill effectively prohibits future mining itcould result inaneconomically irreversible lossoftheprecious metal deposits. 4.1.6 Impacts Resources :Impacts togeologic resources would bebased onthe activities associated with expansion oftheZortman andLandusky mines and ZMI's proposed reclamation procedures fornewand existing disturbances. These activities were described in Section 2.8.Approximately additional tonsof oreand60million additional tons tons oforeand7miUion tons ofwaste rock would begenerated attheLandusky Mine.

Some additional mining would occur attheSeaford and Williams clay pits,andKingCreek limestone quarry to provide reclamation materials. New disturbance would occur atLS-1, theproposed sitetoquarry limestone for theZortman Mine. Approximately 10acres would be disturbed attheSeaford Clay pit. This disturbance would begreater than thatanticipated under the first three alternatives. Approximately 7acres would be disturbed attheWilliams Clay pit.This disturbance would begreater project modification atLS-1, limestone quarry less under 3.Roads to limestone would bereclaimed toapproximate original contoiu.

Both actions represent asignificant direct impact to existing topography. Impacts tovisual resources associated mine higher than byAlternative 3.The difference stems primarily from reclamation provisions toreslope existing waste rock facilities and oreheaps. This alternative only calls forresloping of 4-13 Environmental Consequences facilities (newandexisting) to3H:1V where topography allows andtomeet specific design criteria forstability. Therefore, some facilities would likely continue tohave slopes steeper than3H:1V, andupto2H:1V.

Because these resources areavailable locally and regionally inessentially unlimited quantities, the impact analysis water quaility problems, and (2)prevent thedevelopment of similar water quality degradation. The analysis ofthe first three (noexpansion) alternatives concentrates almost entirely onthe abiUty oftheproposed reclamation measures tomitigate existing andpossible future water quality problems. 4.2.1 Methodology 4.2.1.1 Infiltration Modeling The Hydraulic Evaluation ofLandfill Performance (HELP) model wasused inthisanadysis toprovide a semi-quantitative assessment oftheeffectiveness of proposed reclamation covers atminimizing infiltration. HELP isadeterministic water balance model thatuses climatic, soilanddesign data todetermine theHELP model isapphcable thesame asforalandfill. TheHELP model provides auseful tool forrelative comparisons however, due tothemany assumptions inherent inthemodeling, thecalculated volimies of infiltration and discharge should beconsidered as estimates only. Discharge atthetoeofafacihty ismade upof infiltration through the facility, surface water draining underneath facility, andgroundwater springs orseeps discharging frombeneath the facility. foreach reclamation typeandby adjusting seepage depending on thetypeandextent ofreclamation proposed forthe upgradient recharge area.Waste rock piles and pads arecomposed of heterogeneous materi<ds. When water andoxygen percolate through such theyreact (seeacidrockdrainage ofthepathways theinfiltrating water generate acidrockdrainage, others may inUttleornoacidformation ordissolution of rockand heap leach piles, thereby reducing therateofacidrock drainage formation. The success ofcapping may bemeasured in unit time and iscalculated by multiplying themass bythe total flow. Loads are commonly expressed inlbs/day. An increase in concentration ofacontaminant canbebeneficial ifthe overall load decreases. Ithasbeenassumed thatacidandmetal leachates emanating from the bottom may actually increase or,at best,remain roughly unchanged forthe firstfewyears after capping. The constituent loads ,however, are expected tobereduced quite rapidly. Itisanticipated thatconcentrations may alsodecrease inthetoe-drain leachates severed years after capping. This pattern has been demonstrated atcapped waste piles innorthern Austraha (Gibson and Pantelis 1988; Ritchie Gibson etal.1989; Ritchie 1994), attheHeath Steele Mines inNew Brunswick, Canada (Bell, Riley andYanful 1994) and attheBersbo during development ofthis Dreift EIS that reported actual monitoring results following capping, especijJly overextended time periods. TheAustrahan studies already mentioned givegeneral guidance, butrepresent very different precipitation (tropical), evapotranspiration, slopes and underlying sediment conditions ascompared totheZortman- Landusky sites. Also theAustralian caps contained toaidinmoisture retention. climate itssuccess contamination hasbeen largely duetothereduction in oxygen transport through thecap rather than the reduction ofwater infiltration. Even theAustralian experiences havebeen relatively short-term; data are available fromcapped waste rock forlessthan tenyears. Ritchie (1994) states that itisstilluncertain whether the environmental impact mayreturn toitspre-capping level soil layer that isinitially saturated will, when placed onawaste rock pile, ultimately desaturate willincrease with time, resulting inincreased oxygen diffusion into the pile. Furthermore, asingle cover soil designed tohave alowhydraulic conductivity could facilities mayrespond quite differently tocapping than either theAustraUan or Canadian examples. Older umemediated waste rock piles have agreater chance ofhaving facihties, asitmaybeatyounger lessoxidized sites. Mining activity ingeneral andacid rock drainage in particular canresult inhighsediment loads which can smother bottom-dwelling aquatic organisms anddestroy their habitat. Acid rock drainage also releases acidity and relatively highmetal concentrations, both ofwhich maybechemically toxic toaquatic plants andanimals andtothefishthatfeedonthem. responses such asfish killsmay result from acute events likean accidental release from aprocess chemical pond, or from chronic, long-term, exposure resulting from contact with waste rock ortailing leachates. Long-term ingestion hasbeen estimated by studying thepresent measured concentrations jmdflow volumes emanating from facilities, andevaluating the impact att2uned byreducing flow ofwater through the facilities foreach alternative. Wherever possible, current water quality conditions from monitoring stations atordirectly below thetoedrains havebeen used, butinmany cases, existing data arerestricted to monitoring stations immediately above acapture pond oratsome distcmce downstream where flow isreceived from oneormore upstream facilities. Surface water quality hasbeen used astheprimary medium to evaluate theimpacts toallwater resources. groundwater parallel those tosurface water (seeSection 3.2.6). Also, surface water quality usually represents \"worst-case\" conditions when compared toadjacent groundwater, particularly bedrock groundwater which ismuch less likely tobe impacted than alluvial groundwater.

Extensive review ofthemine water quality Uterature shows that accurate and precise predictions ofpost reclamation water quality cannot bemade given the current state oftheart.Because mineralogy andother factors orlimestone added tothefacihties (e.g., theGold Bug and reliable prediction ismade evenmore tentative. Assuch, estimates ofpost-reclamation water quality havebeenmade primarily byprofessioniil judgement after considering adlthefactors discussed above. 4-26 Water Resources andGeochemistry Anticipated water quality from spent ore piles was discussed 3.2.2.Asmentioned, andmolybdenum. andmetal-laden.

After reclamation, thelower 140 feet ofthe backfill would besaturated. This saturated fillwould receive recharge ofoxygenated water from the pitwalls and likely become asource of continued discharge. Backfilling even acidic. Chemical concentrations would increase inthe pit backfill, primarily because themining process hasincreased the reactive surface area ofthegeological materials (see Section 3.2.2.1).

Notable differences occur atGoslin Flats, Alder Gulch, and Montana Gulch due rockandleach pad facilities andthedeepening andthen backfilling oftheLandusky pit. Haul road areas shown tohave significant acid generating potential would becapped with6inches reduce ofrevegetation overlying rock with potential.

Due tothe effective water quality management attainable attheGoslin Flats leach pad, short andlong-term water quality isexpected tobebetter than that fortheCarter Gulch waste repository. That isbecause Carter Gulch waste repository isin steep terrain which makes effective monitoring and capture ofeffluent muchmore problematic.

Conversely, thebenefit of constructing twolarge already moderately-impacted theriskoffuture uncaptured orprocess Gulch isexpected to besimilar tothat observed today (Table 4.2-1). However, due tothemagnitude ofearth moving associated with theCarter Gulch waste rock repository and theAlder Gulch leach pad, suspended solids concentrations inAlder Gulch areexpected toincrease during the initial construction phase. Longer-term minor increases inTDSsmdsulfate concentrations and loads areexpected due tosome impacted water bypassing thecapture systems (Table 4.2-1).

Review ofZMI Revegetation Efforts .Inastudy on reclamation success, Michael Spry (1986) conducted a revegetation program ondisturbed sites attheZortman andclay pits.Thepurpose ofthestudy wastodevelop areclamation program that would meet the requirements mandated under theMontana Metal Mine Reclamation Actof1972. Based upon environmental conditions (physical andchemical), andenvironmental factors limiting revegetation potential (moisture, wind, and soil nutrients). Sprywas able todevelop some recommendations for the revegetation ofseveral Mine. limiting factor atall sites anenhanced be necessary forsuccessful revegetation. Inaddition, applications offertilizer andmulch may substantially enhance revegetation; however, further studies were necessary todetermine appropriate application rates. Spryused several grass species toquickly revegetate the disturbed areas. The results varied from sitetosite, e.g. bluebunch wheatgrass and germination butgermination waspoorwhen species appropriate seedand fertilizer rates, timing, andseeding methods, tomaximize plant establishment. Reclamation Activities .Interim and final reclamation activities andrevegetation trials havebeenongoing since and preparation andmethods toachieve post-operation landuse objectives. Monitoring ofthereclaimed sites is conducted species used forrevegetation include avariety of wheatgrasses, particularly intherevegetation efforts, since themid-1980's. Thecompany reclamation efforts appear toberelatively successful. Total vegetative cover and plant density increased between 1990 and1992 onmost sites, particularly perennial grasses, and litter increased on80percent ofthe sites. Tree andshrub survival hasbeen variable. Limited success and trees due toplant mortality appears tobetheresult ofcompetition byherbaceous plant species, an inhospitable growth medium, (compacted soil), wildlife depredation, orburying or pasting down woody plants during hydromulching. Countermeasures tothese deterrents toshrub andtree survival could bedeveloped todecrease The andrevegetation conducted todate indicates trends similar toother research inthe Northern Great Plains. These trends include; 1) achievement ofpremining cover and producti\\^ty for assuming thegrowth with treeandshrub estabhshment thesame for reported 2.5H:1V slopes a moderately high tohigh potential forerosion. The velocity ofsurface water runoff increases withincreasing steepness, thus increasing erosion andreducing the potential Rating .Due tothelarge area ofdisturbance andlimited revegetation efforts, impacts from mining activities between 1979 and thepresent arerated negative high. 4.4.3 Impacts from Alternative 1 Alternative Background .Under thisNoAction Alternative, ZMI would continue activities already permitted atboth theZortman andLandusky mines.

Proposed Reclamation . Under Alternative 1, reclamation plans consist ofplacing alayer ofcover soil approximately 8inches thickondisturbed sites prior to reseeding and planting. Most slopes intheleach pad andwaste rock areas would remain atapproximately a 2H:1V angle andwould beover 200 feet toreclamation todetermine oreforreclamation medium. Direct Impacts .Under thisalternative there would be nofurther surface disturbance ateither mine, andno new direct impacts are .Indirect impacts tovegetation, under Alternative 1,result from aninadequate reclamation plan that, over thelong-term, isunlikely tomaintain a suitable environment formost vegetation.

Eventually, forested would return siteswhich reclaimed tograsslands 4.5WILDLIFE ANDAQUATICS 4.5.1 Methodology Issues concerning wildlife potentially impacted by potential mine expansion, operations, and closure/ reclamation activities were developed from thepublic scoping process andconsultation with local, stateand federal agencies. These are summarized inSection 1.6and listed below: Loss ordisturbance tofederal threatened or endangered wildlife species and their habitats. Loss ordisturbance tofederal Category 2 candidate species. Degraded water quality andadverse impacts on fishandaquatic organisms. Increased wildlife mortality from mining activities. Adverse impacts tobats occupying or hibernating atAzure Cave. Based onthese issues aseries ofsignificance criteria was developed toevaluate impacts tofisheries and wildlife from theseven alternatives. Significance criteria used in theevaluation ofimpacts include: Disturbed area contains habitat officially designated as critical habitat for federal threatened orendangered species bythe USr^WS (Noareas designated ascritical habitat foranythreatened orendangered occurs area). Disturbed area contains habitat orknown use zu'eas forfederal candidate species. Mine activities disturbs known populations or individuals offederal andstate sensitive species, particularly batsandnesting raptors. Noise (decibels) ofmine activities atAzure Cave exceed levels considered potentially detrimental tohibernating bats. Potential wildlife mortality frommining related activity (cyanide ponds, vehicle collision) experiences anincrease above levels habitat available inthe Little Rocky Mountains asexamined byScow (1978) are considered low,medium, and high negative impacts, respectively. Residual water quality exceeds baseline water quality levels shown inTable 3.2-9, orexceeds maximum freshwater Increases insuspended solids streams that could bedetrimental toaquatic macroinvertebrates Section 4.2. Evaluations andcomparisons ofimpacts ofalternatives based ontheabove significance criteria were separated into seven subsections. These subsections include, habitat loss, wildUfe mortahty, noise, nesting raptors, specid status species, residual water quality, and reclamation. Special status species included federally Usted threatened, endangered, Category 2candidate species, and state sensitive species. Several special status species described inSection 3.5either donot occur are generally evaluated collectively under habitat lossand wildlife mortality sections. Methods used inthisevaluation involved areview of existing information including baseline reports, previous environmental impact statements. Applications for Amendment toOperating Permits, scientific journals. 4-121 Environmental Consequences andconsultation with locjil, state and federal agency personnel. Several analyses, based onexisting information, were conducted thatdevelop arelative index ofimpacts by thedifferent alternatives. Although these calculations absolute numbers forpotential impact, they didprovide aconsistent estimate information analyses. These assumptions areexplained inthetext. Specific methods (1)obtaining information on theoccurrence offederal habitat from theUSFWS, BLM,MDFWP andtheMontana Natural Heritage Program (MNHP); (2)calculating wildlife mortality onthescientific literature, baseline and wildUfe monitoring reports, andestimates ofincreased traffic byalternative; (3)evaluating noise impacts to hibernating bats based oncalculations presented in Section 4.9,and consulting with experts from Bat Conservation International (BCI); (4)evaluating residual water quahty based oncalculations presented inSection 4.2;(5)evaluating impacts tonesting raptors based on baseline reports andelement occurrence searches conducted bytheMNHP; and(6)estimating habitat loss bycompeuing total acreage ofdisturbance reported by toabaseline evaluation oftheLittle Rocky Mountains south ofthe Fort Belknap Indian conducted byScow (1979). Thebaseline evaluation byScow (1979) fisheries criteria: -NoSignificant Impacts, i.e.,impacts do criteria Low -Slightly exceeds significance criteria Moderate -Moderately exceeds significance criteria High -Greatly exceeds significance criteriaBeneficial -Impacts thatimprove theresource Negative thevalue oftheresource below 1979 baseline conditions ormaintain conditions atlessthan baseline conditions 4.5.2 Impacts from Mining, 1979 to Present TheZortman andLandusky mining sites intheLittle Rocky Mountains contain seasonal and year long habitats foranumber ofwildlife species, particularly bighorn sheep, mule deer, various batsandupland game birds. Negative impacts towildlife haveoccurred from habitat loss,human andmechanical harassment and wildlife towildlife from attheZortman andLandusky Mines habitat intheLittle Current mining activities intheLittleRocky Mountains havebeen estimated tohavedecreased year long crucial habitat forbighorn sheep by4percent (BLM 1992b), and overall wildlife habitat 4.5-1). This habitat reduction isconsidered orareexpected tooccur within theimmediate vicinity ofmining operations within the Little Rocky Mountains andadverse impacts have not occurred. Prior tomining attheZortman 1979b). Peoples Creek wasamajor fishery prior tocyanide poisoning caused exploration hasoccurred. area since 1979; however, theresulteuit decrease inflowhasbeen negligible (see Section 4.2.2). King Creek hasalsoexperienced a negligible amount offlow diversion since 1979. Rock Creek hasbeen impacted atsurface water levels (Table 3.2-18). These chemical concentrations are notelevated above acute orchronic levels detrimental to aquatic life.Mining activity ingeneral andacidrock drainage inparticular canresult inhighsediment loads which can smother bottom dwelling aquatic macroinvertebrates and destroy their habitat. As described inSection 3.5.9, overall low total arereflective mining activity. Montana Gulch, which flows intoRock Creek, was heavily impacted prior to1979. Changes inwater flows, degraded water quality, andreduced availability ofwater sources within mined areas hasimpacted water supplies forterrestrial wildlife both within anddownstream of existing mine operations. Wildlife mortality from allmine-related activities (vehicle collision, cyanide poisoning) recorded byZMI since 1979 have been relatively minor; however, concerted efforts todocument mortality were not initiated until 1990. Wildlife mortality records from mine process ponds aresummarized below: YEAR Wildlife andAquatics during emergency disposal operations and will not preclude wildlife useorresult inanysignificant short- term orlong-term habitat loss. Thus, short-term lossof habitat availability would remain 1,245 acres or6 percent from pre-1979 conditions (Table 4.5-2) This would result inalownegative impact. Long-term impacts based onthesuccess ofreclamation atre- establishing wildlife habitat are discussed under reclamation. Long-term habitat losswould notbe significant. Nohabitat disturbance beyond currently permitted activities would occur attheLandusky Mine. Wildlife Mortality Wildlife mortality from process ponds would beminimal under Alternative 1.Allprocess ponds attheZortman andLandusky mines havebeencovered withbirdnetting and areenclosed Water catchment ponds atRuby, Alder andCarter Gulches currently catch seepage and capture water andpump ittotheZortman water treatment plant. Capture ponds attheLandusky Mine include Sullivan Park, Mill Gulch, and the85/86 contingency pond. Water temporarily stored inthese ponds contain acid rock drainage with high metals concentrations that could adversely effect wildlife drinking from these ponds. Capture ponds would remain unfenced under Alternative 1and potentially attract wildlife. Collisions withhaultrucks andemployee vehicles would beapotential source ofwildlife mortality. Current ofwildlife mortality from vehicle collisions are minimal andconsidered non-significant. Only afew minor haul tripswould occur attheZortman 1;however, 400and 1,500 tripcommuter trips peryearwould occur attheLandusky Mine. Based onthese estimates oftraffic, wildlife mortality would initially remain at current non-significant levels then decrease below current levels through 2000. Haul traffic would occur 24 hours aday forapproximately 5years resulting in short-term non-significant impacts. Long-term impacts from wildlife-vehicle collisions would decrease topre-mine levels because haul truck and employee vehicle traffic would diminish and virtually cease Jifter completion offinal reclamation andno mining Mine under 1andnoise impacts tobats hibernating in Azure Cave would notoccur. Mine andreclamation activities under thisalternative (including Goslin Flats would bemore thanonemilefrom Azure Cave andnoisewould be55dBA orroughly the noise produced urban residential area 4.9-3). Considering that thebats areinside a cavewhich further attenuates sound, this level ofnoise would not likely impact bats atAzure Cave (Taylor 1994). Nesting Raptors Raptor surveys were conducted inallpermitted areas prior toinitiation ofmining activity in1978andprior to subsequent amendments tomining permits (Farmer Themost recent survey fornesting raptors 1990. Nobreeding habitat havebeen located inornear existing permitted areas andnosignificant short- or long- term impacts toraptors would occur asaresult of Alternative 1. Special Status Species There arenoknown occurrences of,orpotential habitat forbald eagle, peregrine falcon, piping plover, orblack- footed ferret intheproject vicinity under Alternative 1. Most federal candidate species and state species of special interest orconcern would notbeimpacted bythe NoAction Alternative in the Little Rocky Mountains; however, nesting raptor species would likely occur inthe Little Rocky Mountains during summer breeding ormigration. Important known habitats forbatsinclude caves, cliffs, crevasses, riparian areas, late serai forest, andabandoned mines. This havenoadverse tobats. Residual Water Quality oftheZortman and Landusky mines arcephemeral anddonotsupport water nosignificant impacts (adverse orbeneficial) tofishery resources from residual water quality would occur under Alternative 1. However, current efforts tocontrol acidrockdrainage have notbeen effective and itwould belikely thatacid rockdrainage would drain intostreams supporting fish, particularly Rock Creek. Downstream water quality impacting macroinvertebrate habitat would belittlechanged from existing conditions under Alternative 1.Metals concentrations inmost streams would beabout thesame asbaseline conditions (Table 4.2-1). However, some metals would stillbe elevated above federal standards forchronic effects to aquatic life(seeTable 4.2-1) inMontana Gulch. Ongoing degradation ofmacroinvertebrate habitat and wildlife drinking water supplies would continue inthe upper reaches ofRuby Gulch, Alder Spur, andCarter Gulch attheZortman Mine and inUpper Sullivan Creek, MillGulch, Montana Gulch, andKingCreek at theLandusky Mine. Reclamation would likely cause periods ofelevated suspended solids insurface water, particularly nearWilliams clay pit. Itisanticipated that ongoing sediment runoff would becontrolled by construction ofsediment trapsandsettling ponds. Reclamation Based onanalysis presented in Section 4.4.3, nodirect impacts tovegetation orwildlife habitat would occur under Alternative 1.However, indirect impacts tovegetation andsubsequently wildlife habitat result from inadequate reclamation ofexisting disturbance. Over theshort-term, wildlife forage would become established andhabitat would improve inmost areas particularly aspre-mine lodgepole pine forests are replaced with reclamation seed mixes containing preferred wildlife forage species. Additional wildlife habitat could beimproved bycreating breeding and roosting orhacking areas onexposed highwalls status species such and breeding andhibernating bats. Over thelong-term, approximately 75percent oftherevegetation efforts are expected to failbecause ofsteep slopes, erosion, inadequate plant growth media, andacidrock drainage.This failed revegetation would result inhigh negative impacts onthere-establishment ofwildlife habitat. Bats potentially occurring intheareacould ingest large quantities ofwater and acidrock drainage containing elevated metals. Batsmust drink every night during the breeding season andmay drink uptoathird oftheir weight inwater. Reclamation under Alternative 1would notadequately control acid rock drainage, and this alternative would toproduce water inseepage andcatchment ponds thatcould bedetrimental tobats impacts from Alternative 1include: 54acres ofdisturbance from historical mining activities prior to1978 1,245 removed due tomining anddegraded water quality Nonewdisturbance Noforeseeable future actions Pastandpresent mining activities have directly impacted approximately 1,300 acres ofwildlife foraging, breeding, resting andhiding areas resulting ina6percent loss in overall wildlife habitat intheLittle Rocky Mountains. Assuming complete success ofrevegetation efforts, short term positive impacts would berealized aswildlife forage becomes established above pre-1979 conditions. However, assuming reclamation would failon75percent ofthereclaimed area, cumulative impacts towildlife, fisheries andaquatic macroinvertebrates would from acidrock drainage. Long-term cumulative impacts andwildlife arerated high negative because ofreclamation failure andcontinued acidrockdrainage impacts to wildlife, fisheries and aquatic macroinvertebrates. 4.5.3.2 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts Unavoidable adverse impacts tofisheries and wildlife under Alternative 1would belong-term andconsist of habitat lostfrom existing mining plus acres offailed reclamation over time. Continued acidrock drainage seepage andcontaminated catchment ponds could be 4-127 Environmental Consequences detrimental tobatsandother wildlife thatdrink from these ponds. 4.5.3.3 Short-term Use/Long-term Productivity Long-term productivity offishand wildlife would be impacted under this alternative. Establishment of vegetation would belesseffective because ofshallow soil depths and steep, long slopes. Degradation of vegetation andhabitat from acidrock drainage would likely continue into theforeseeable future. Current reclamation hasnotbeen effective atcontrolling andwould notbe effective atcontrolling acid rock drainage and subsequent significant impacts tofisheries and wildlife. Comparable stability and utility inthereclaimed landscape would notbeachieved. 4.5.3.4 Irreversible 4.5.4 Impacts from Alternative 2 Under this alternative, ZMI would continue already permitted activities atboth theZortman andLandusky mines. The reclamation plans would berevised, as proposed byZMI, toeffect source control andtreatment ofacidrock drainage. The result ofimplementation of this alternative would beincreased source control measures andagreater reliance onlong-term corrective action forcapture ofseepage water and acidrock drainage. 4.5.4.1 Impacts Impacts tofisheries and wildlife under Alternative 2 would generally be similar toimpacts under Alternative 1.Impacts towildlife habitat, noise, nesting raptors andspecial status species would bethesame as Alternative 1.Major differences inimpacts between Alternatives 1and 2would beassociated with the increased level ofreclamation activities, andincreased hauling reclamation materials. Evaluationofimpacts foreach alternative ispresented inTable 4.5-1. Negative impacts tofishand wildlife related to Alternative 2would include: Increased wildlife disturbance and mortality from traffic associated with theWilliams and Seaford clay pits. Improved capture andtreatment ofseepage and acid rock drainage would result inimproved water quality and fisheries habitat below capture andtreatment facilities. Thiswould reduce the negative impacts ofexisting operations; impacts from process ponds would bethesame asAlternative 1. Wildlife Mortality Based ontraffic estimates presented inSection 4.11, between 1,500-2,100 round tripcommuter and (both reclamation andhazardous materials) round attheZortman Mine, habitat alongRuby Gulch. Thehaulroutes would travel summer andyear-round habitat formule deer. Clay would behauled totheLandusky Mine approximately from clay pitcmdtravel through ofwildlife mortality caused byvehicle collision. Traffic andassociated wildlife mortality would increase during the first 5years then decrease inthe final 3years ofimplementation apotential short-term increase inmortality would bealownegative impact. Wildlife mortality from vehicle collisions under this alternative would decrease over thelong-term asmine operations andclosure activities end,eventually reaching levels comparable topre-mining conditions. Nofuture mining isforeseeable under thisalterative. Residual Water Quality Ongoing degradation ofmacroinvertebrate habitat and wildlife drinking water supplies would continue as described forAlternative 1.Most streams Wildlife significant change King Creeks; Creek isoutside (Table 4.2-2). Nosignificant impacts (adverse orbeneficial) tofishery resources from residual water quality would occur under Alternative 2. Improved capture andtreatment facilities would improve downstream water quality, butsome metals (e.g., zinc) would stillbeelevated above federal standards for chronic effects toaquatic life(see Table 4.2-1) in Montana Gulch. Asdescribed byconstruction of sediment trapsandsettling ponds. Reclamation Based onanalysis presented in Section 4.4.4, nodirect impacts tovegetation orwildlife habitat would occur. Indirect impacts tofisheries andwildlife associated with reclamation would besimilar under Alternatives 1and 2.Reclamation slopes would continue tobe1H:1V at mine pits;however, other facilities (i.e.heap leach pads) would begraded to2.5H:1V or3H:1V possible, rock drainage. A65percent revegetation failure (seeSection 4.4.4) would result in limited success ofre-establishing bighorn sheep and other wildlife habitat. Reclamation under Alternative 2 would notadequately control acid rock drainage, particularly atthevarious sources and thisalternative would continue toproduce water inseepage and catchment ponds thatcould tobatsand other wildlife. Because oflong-term continued acidrock drainage andreclamation failure, long-term impact to fisheries andwildlife associated withreclamation success israted moderate negative. 4.5.4.2 Cumulative Impacts Cumulative impacts under Alternative 2from pastand collisions andanincreased level ofreclamation. Potential mortality impacts; and65percent ofreclamation would failover thelong-term, resulting acreswould bedisturbed atthe clay pitsforatotal of1,254 acres. 4.5.4.3 Unavoidable Adverse Unavoidable adverse impacts would bethesame as discussed inAlternative 1with slightly less potential impacts from wildlife using downstream contaminated water sources. 4.5.4.4 Short-term Use/Long-term Productivity Long-term productivity offishand wildlife under this alternative would begreater thanunder Alternative 1. Potential impacts tofishand wildlife from acid rock drainage andcontaminated water would becontrolled by active water treatment; however, productivity upgradient (i.e.,mine pits, leach pads, waste rock) would beless productive thanAlternatives 3through 7because source control would indefinitely. 4.5.4.5 Irreversible Commitments Themore than 1,254 acres been disturbed from pre-1979 conditions would bein jeopardy ofnotbeing reclaimed adequately under this alternative. Thiswould over the short-term butpopulations would recover andeven increase aftermine closure and final reclamation. 4.5.5 Impacts from Alternative 3 Under this alternative, ZMI would continue already permitted activities atboth theZortman andLandusky mines. Therevised reclamation plans proposed byZMI with additional measures ofthisalternative, facilities acid generating and willrequire reclamation covers BorC which willinclude compacted clay, possibly aPVC 4-129 Itisanticipated thatsupplemental materials would need tobeimported for this alternative. Sources ofsupplemental reclamation material include theKing Creek andBeaver Creek limestone quarries, andWilliams clay pits. Existing facilities would alsobereclaimed toa 3H:1V slope, with constructed benches forerosion control. Slope lengths between benches would extend 200feet inlength. 4.5.5.1 Impacts Impacts towildhfe habitat, noise, nesting raptors and special status species would generally betheScmie as Alternative 1.Major difference inimpacts from Alternative 3would beassociated theincreased level ofreclamation andincreased haul traffic. Adverse impacts tofisheries and wildlife habitat would be reduced under Alternative 3.Evaluation ofimpacts for each alternative ispresented inTable 4.5-1. These result from would materials from contacting thecover soil,impacting vegetative growth, anddamaging wildlife forage and habitat. Improved potential fortheestablishment of vegetation and wildlife forage onreduced slopes. Expanded water catchment facilities tofurther reduce thepotential ofacid rock drainage release. Potential negative impacts result from: Direct lossofhabitat asaresult ofanincreased need forlimestone andclayascover material. Indirect wildlife mortality from increased haul traffic toclayandlimestone sources. Expanded water catchment facilities containing high metals and acid rock drainage concentrations could attract and potentially contaminate wildlife.Wildlife Mortality Based ontraffic estimates hazardous materials totheZortman Mine. Reclamation attheLandusky Mine would require an estimated 4,400 to16,000 round tripcommuter tripsperyear. the first6years ofreclamation andwould bea short-term moderately negative impact. Long-term wildlife mortality would return topre-mine, non- significant levels following completion of final reclamation. Residual Water Quality Most streams inthe vicinity oftheZortman and Landusky mines areephemeral change experience aminor degradation overtheshort thearea ofinfluence ofboth mines (Table 4.2-2). Thus, minor adverse impacts to fishery resources from residual water quahty would occur inRock Creek under Alternative 3;however, chemical levels would bebelow acute orchronic levels detrimental toaquatic life. Capture andtreatment facihties under thisalternative would reduce ormaintain downstream metals concentrations insurface water ator below federal standards for effects onaquatic macroinvertebrates. However, estimated facihty drainage above capture systems would exceed aquatic lifecriteria over theshort-term. These concentrations, asinAlternatives 1and 2,result inanegative impact to wildlife drinking water supplies and aquatic macroinvertebrate habitat onalocal(mined area) scale. Reclamation andtheoperation oflimestone and clay quarries would result inshort-term increases in concentrations andlong-term detrimental toaquatic Based ofvegetation impacts presented in Section 4.4.5, direct impacts tovegetation and wildlife habitat would consist of44.5acres ofnewdisturbance at clay pitsandUmestone quarries toprovide additional reclamation materials. Indirect impacts would consist of reduced averse impacts tofisheries andwildlife reduce impacts tovegetation and wildlife habitat. Reclamation slopes would be3H:1V resulting inimproved vegetation cover and greater success inre-establishing bighorn sheep and other wildlife habitat. Thiswould result inashort-term moderate positive impact. Over the long-term, rock drainage would continue tocreate lownegative long-term impacts tofishery and wildlife resources. Seepage andcatchment ponds under this alternative would continue tobeunfenced andcould bedetrimental tobatsandother wildlife. 4.5.5.2 Cumulative Impacts habitat from pastmining. Wildlife habitat willnotbe restored topre-mine conditions, however, and cumulative impacts arerated lownegative. 4.5.53 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts The potential for wildlife mortality from vehicle collisions would increase over the lifeofthemine. Over thelong-term, wildlife populations would recover and biggame would likely increase aftermine closure and final reclamation assuming 95percent success and depending onmanagement ofwildlife populations. Impacts towildlife from ponds fullofcontaminated water Alternative 2asless would beexpected. 4.5.5.4 Short-term Use/Long-term Productivity Long-term productivity offishand wildlife under this alternative would begreater thanunder Alternatives 1 and 2.Potential impacts tofishand rockdrainage andcontaminated water would atthesource andbyactive water treatment. This provides agreater level ofenvironmental protection and significantly reduces potential damage towildlife forage andhabitat from acidrock Resource Commitments There arelimited irreversible orirretrievable wildlife or fisheries resource commitments under Alternative 3. Habitat loss resulting from 5percent long-term reclamation failure would equal 65acres. 4.5.6 Impacts from Alternative 4 This alternative consists oftheCompany Proposed Alternative (CPA) formine expansion atboth the Zortman andLandusky mines including corrective reclamation measures ofexisting disturbance. Major activities that impact wildlife and fisheries include: construction ofaheap leach alimestone source south ofGreen Mountain. 4.5.6.1 Impacts direct and indirect impacts tofishery and wildlife resources could occur including direct lossofhabitat, increased wildlife mortality, noise disturbance to hibernating bats, disturbance tonesting raptors and special status species, restricted wildlife movement asa result oftheconstruction oftheconveyor, altering surface water quality, andlimited restoration ofwildlife habitat. Impacts foreach alternative ispresented in Table 4.5-1. Habitat Lx)ss Alternative 4would result inlossofwildlife habitat from 1979 conditions of1,296 acres attheZortman Mine and 913acres attheLandusky Mine (Table 4.5-2). Total new disturbance to wildlife habitat would be approximately 891acres attheZortman Mine and73 acres attheLandusky Mine (Table 4.5-2). Total direct removal ofvegetation and wildlife habitat from previously undisturbed areas under Alternative 4would be964acres andaccount foranadditional 5percent decrease inoverall wildlife habitat. Total 1979 baseline conditions would be2,209 acres orapproximately 11percent ofoverall habitat. lossandwould beamoderate negative impact. Except forGoslin Flats, most ofthevegetation removed would be inLodgepole pine forest with minor disturbance occurring inponderosa pineanddouglas fir 4-131 Environmental Consequences forest. Forested areas provide andescape cover species, andpotential habitat and grassland habitats usedbypronghorn antelope, and0.97acres ofwetlands. Some riparian habitat would alsobe disturbed where roads, conveyor andpower corridors, andother facilities cross orareconstructed inriparian areas along drainages. tobiggame andupland game bird habitats, particularly along Alder Gulch. Use of Carter Gulch asawaste rock repository would disturb high-value white-tailed deer habitat. Restricted Access Construction oftheconveyor from theZortman Mine to Goslin Flats would result inrestricted wildlife access along Goslin Flats. Overhead spans ofPonyandAlder Gulches bytheconveyor would not restrict wildlife access inthese However, the constant noiseandpsychological barrier ofcrossing restrict movement animals. Thiswould result inahighnegative impact inthat could become restricted, theeffective habitat and theoverall carrying capacity within and nsaLt thestudy sitedecreased. Wildlife Mortality Wildlife mortality from process ponds would beminimal under Alternative 4.Allprocess ponds attheZortman andLandusky mines would recorded theZortman 4.These haul trips would traverse year-round mule deerandbighorn sheep habitat. Based on traffic projections provided in Section 4.11, haul traffic would increase significantly through year 2004, then decrease toaround current levels inyears 2005and2006. Haul traffic would occur game andother wildlife seem tohave acclimated to traffic and mining operations. thisalternative would would benon-significant todirectly disturb hibernating bats (Taylor 1994). There maybesome indirect effects during sustaining, foraging, or fall arrival ofbats. Attenuation with distance atAzure Cave yields noise levels from theconveyor wellbelow background levels effectively eliminating audible sound from theconveyor atthecave. Noise impacts atAzure Cavefrom mining andreclamation significant impact tohibernating bats.Nolong-term impacts would occur because noisewould virtually cease upon final recleunation. Nesting Raptors Based onthe results ofnesting raptor surveys and element occurrence searches conducted byMontana National Heritage Program, Alternative 4would not significantly impact nesting raptors. Special Status Species There arenoknown federally Hsted threatened or endangered wildlife species intheareas proposed for disturbance; however, potential nesting habitat for peregrine falcons exists approximately twomiles west of theproposed Goslin Flats leach pad. There arenoknown occurrences of,orpotential habitat forbald eagle, peregrine falcon, piping plover, orblack- footed ferret intheproject vicinity under Alternative 4. Thenorthern goshawk could occur inforested areas in the Little Rocky Mountains; however, nesting raptor surveys conducted prior habitat disturbance or noise from crushing andconveyor activities. Little specific information isknown regarding thesummer ranges and foraging habitat ofthe bat species hibernating inAzure Cave. However, some orallof these batspecies would likely occur intheLittleRocky Mountains during summer breeding ormigration. Important habitats forbats include riparian areas, late serai forest, andabandoned mines (Taylor 1994). This alternative would impact approximately 10acres of aspen riparian habitat along theconveyor route that likely supports bats. (Because ofthesmall area of disturbance, few batswould likely besignificantly thatwould breeding bats. Short-term positive impacts would berealized assuming process ponds areadequately netted toprevent batsfrom drinking contaminated water. Thetwobodies ofstanding water closest toAzure Cave would beremoved under Alternative 4.Considering the importance ofdrinking water tosummer resident bats, the loss ofthese open water bodies could have a considerable adverse impact onbreeding orsummer resident bats, causing them toabandon current breeding arests orseekwater from other sources such asprocess andcatchment ponds. Replacement ofthese ponds could bemitigated byconstructing species isnon-significant.Wildlife andAquatics Residual Water Quality inthe vicinity oftheZortman and Landusky mines areephemeral change experience animprovement inresidual water quality due tothereduction ofGoldBugAdit flow. Beaver Creek isoutside the area ofinfluence ofboth mines (Table 4.2-2). Thus, moderate beneficial impacts to aquatic lifeandfishery resources fromimproved residual water quality would occur inRock Creek under Alternative 4. Metals concentrations inAlder Gulch would increase above pre-1979 conditions andreach levels exceeding federal standards forchronic effects toaquatic life. However, Alder Gulch was historically impacted by mining andcontains ahighly variable andimpoverished macroinvertebrate population (WESTECH 1991). Metals concentrations inMontana Gulch above the confluence withRock Creek would begreatly reduced from existing conditions. Thiswould result inahighly positive impact foraquatic macroinvertebrate habitat. However, significant flow reductions areexpected in Montana Gulch due toshort-term pitdewatering and long-term reduction inrecharge toGold Bugand andlonger-term buildup of fines intheGoslin Gulch/Ruby Creek drainage. These sediment fines would negatively impact existing macroinvertebrate habitat andimpede therecovery of already lowabundance and diversity oftaxa.

Reclamation Fisheries andwildlife habitat associated withreclamation would improve sheep zmdother wildlife habitat. Limiting habitat forbighorn sheep intheLittle Rocky Mountains isopen grassy areas onsouth facing slopes.

Short-term impacts ofthereclamation forage provided revegetation. treeswould of3H:1V would reduce erosion, butareas with2H:1V or2.5H:1V would experience continued erosion. Additionally, failure of long, steep slopes isassumed on5percent ofreclaimed areas infiltration andeventual acidrockdrainage would continue tocreate lownegative long-term impacts to fishery andwildlife resources. Additionally, succession and forest regeneration would revert totheoriginal habitat. Seepage andcatchment ponds under this alternative would continue tobeunfenced andcould be detrimental tobatsandother wildlife. 4.5.6.2 Cumulative Impacts Cumulative impacts from Alternative 4include: 54acres ofdisturbance from historical mining activities prior of5percent quality due towater bypassing capture systems and concentrations ofsome metals exceeding federal chronic freshwater criteria andadversely impacting aquatic macroinvertebrates; Improvement ofwater quality and habitat inMontana Gulch; and foreseeable inPonyGulch inthefuture. Additional direct andindirect disturbance offisheries, aquatic macroinvertebrates, and wildlife would occurfrom reasonably feasible developments under Alternative 4.Potential impacts would begreatest from future mining inPonyGulch (noexpansion needed for 2million tons). Impacts associated with exploration, such asadditional roads, would likely beminor; however, lossofhabitat andshort-term disturbance would occur, primarily from theroads. Primary impacts ofexploration maybedisturbance tohibernating bats at The 2million deposit islocated Cave. Mining activity thatincludes blasting, large machinery andorecrushing operations within '/imilecould create anoise impact on batshibernating inAzure Cave (Taylor 1994). However, analysis ofnoise impacts estimate alevel of64dBA at Azure andreclaimed within anapproximately 2year time frame, reducing thechances of long-term impacts tobats inAzure Cave. Pastandpresent mining activities have directly impacted 1,245 acres ofwildlife foraging, breeding, resting and hiding areas. Proposed disturbance under Alternative 4 would impact 964acres ofwildlife habitat foratotal disturbance ofabout 2,209 acres or11percent of habitat inthe Little Rocky Mountains. Assuming 95percent success ofreclamation and the establishment ofgrassland areas beneficial towildlife, cumulative impacts towildlife habitat arerated low negative. Cumulative impacts ofresidual water quality onaquatic macroinvertebrates, post reclamation, israted non- significant based onaverage metals in downstream waters remaining atbaseline levels inmost drainages. Alder Gulch would experience some degradation inwater quality andcontain zinc levels exceeding federal standards forchronic effects toaquatic life.Metals concentrations inMontana Gulch would be greatly reduced from existing conditions. Thiswould result inahighly positive impact for aquatic macroinvertebrate habitat and create conditions conducive tothe recovery ofpopulations of macroinvertebrates inMontana Gulch fir along Carter, andPony Gulches combined with habitat previously lostdue tohistoric and existing mining could adversely impact summer breeding batsby directly removing breeding and foraging habitat or causing bats toavoid thearea. Cumulative impacts ofpastandpresent mining and reasonably feasible developments onincreased mortality towildlife would beshort-term andconsidered low toincrease atthestart currently isnotaproblem. Overall cumulative negative Unavoidable Adverse Impacts The potential for wildlife mortality from vehicle collisions would increase 3-4foldover the lifeofthe mine. Over thelong-term wildlife populations would recover andbiggame populations would increase after mine closure and final reclamation. Assuming 95 percent success anddependent onmanagement of wildlife populations, 110acreswould notbereclaimed inthelong-term. The lossofstanding water bodies near Azure Cave could reduce summer batpopulations bthe area. Construction oftheconveyor beltwould disrupt home ranges and travel corridors forbiggame during mine life. 4.5.6.4 Short-term Use/Long-term area healthy populations of endemic wildlife. Oneofthelimiting factors forbighorn sheep inthe Little Rocky Mountains isopen, grassy, south facing slopes interspersed with forest. Almost all ofthesouth facing slopes intheLittleRocky Mountains arecovered withlodgepole pine. Through mining and proper reclamation, many ofthecurrently wooded, south facing slopes would bechanged intograssy slopes planted with trees thatwould benefit bighorn sheep and other wildlife (BLM 1992a). Impact from Alternative 4 would begreater than impacts from Alternatives 1-3 because of864acres ofdisturbance. Butassuming only5percent reclamation failure, 4.5.6.5 Irreversible orIrretrievable Resource Commitments There arelimited irreversible orirretrievable wildlife or fisheries resource commitments under Alternative 4. Habitat lostduring mining activities canbereclaimed andreplaced during reclamation activities. Displaced wildlife populations would recolonize reclaimed areas andcreation ofopen grassy habitats would benefit thatmaybelimited by Mountains intheshort-term. Asplanted trees grow, habitat would return toforested canopy in 70-80 years. 4.5.7 Impacts from Alternative 5 Alternative 5would approve expansion ofboth the Zortman andLandusky mines butimposes within upper Alder Gulch. tofisheries and wildlife under thisalternative would besimilar tothatdescribed forAlternative 4, although somewhat less inmagnitude since no disturbance would occur atGoslin Flats. Impacts would bethesame under Alternatives 4and 5fornesting raptors, special status species, and wildlife mortality from process ponds. Evaluation ofimpacts foreach alternative ispresented inTable 4.5-1. Habitat Loss ofapproximately 1,355 acres Zortman Mine and915acres attheLandusky Mine. towildlife would be approximately 950acres attheZortman Mine and75 acres attheLandusky Mine. Total direct removal of vegetation and wildlife habitat from previously undisturbed areas under Alternative 5would be approximately 1,025 acres. Habitat lossattheZortman Minewould occur primarily inforested areas andsome riparian habitat inAlder and Carter Gulches. The acres occur inyear-round deer andaccoimts 4-135 Environmental Consequences habitat ofavailable habitat lossfrom 1979would beapproximately 2,270 acres and would account fora11percent decrease from 1979 conditions. This lossofhabitat acreage would bea moderate negative impact belocated onGoslin Flats, would notbe directly disturbed; however, emergency land appUcation could periodically disturb 285acres atGoslin Flats resulting inashort-term loss ofavailable habitat. Under associated withtheconveyor would notoccur. However, impacts tohigh-value white-tailed deer habitat would occur inAlder Gulch from theleachpadandwaste rock repository. Wildlife Mortality Based haul tripswould traverse year-round mule deer andbighorn sheep habitat. Wildlife mortality from vehicle collisions would beshort-term andwould increase slightly through year 2006. Haul traffic would decrease tocurrent levels inyear2007and essentially cease thereafter. Haul traffic would occur 24hours a day forapproximately 12years. Short-term impacts mortality ratesunder thisalternative would notbeasignificant long-term impact. Noise Noise impacts toAzure Cave from mining and reclamation activities under Alternative 5would be58 dBA (Table 4.9-3). This noise level islessthanan ofanurban residential area where bats arecommonly found. Therefore, no significant impact isanticipated. Residual Water Quality Most streams inthe vicinity oftheZortmjm and Landusky mines areephemeral inwater quality duetothebypass capture system; andRock Creek would experience an improvement inresidual water quality due tothereduction ofGoldBugAdit flow. Beaver Creek is outside the area ofinfluence ofboth mines (Table 4.2-2). Thus, reduced negative impacts from past andpresent mining toaquatic lifeandfishery resources from improved residual water quedity would occur in Rock Creek and slight adverse impacts would occur in KingCreek under Alternative 5. Metals concentrations inAlder Gulch would increase above pre-1979 conditions andreach levels exceeding federal standards forchronic effects toaquatic life. However, Alder Gulch was historically impacted by mining andcontains ahighly variable andimpoverished macroinvertebrate population (WESTECH 1991). Metals concentrations inMontana Gulch above the confluence withRock Creek would begreatly reduced from existing conditions. Thiswould result inahighly positive impact foraquatic macroinvertebrate habitat. Themagnitude ofearth moving associated with the Carter Gulch waste rock repository andAlder Gulch leadpadwould increase suspended solids inAlder Creek. However, these sediments would settle in capture and treatment facilities andwould have negligible impacts ondownstream macroinvertebrates. Overall impacts rating ofresidual water quality on fisheries and aquatic macroinvertebrates is low/moderate negative anddegraded water quality in Alder Gulch. Impacts ofreclamation effectiveness onwildlife habitat would besimilar toAlternative 4withimproved short term success ofrevegetation. Reclamation under Alternative 5would provide more favorable wildlife habitat. Reduced slopes would increase vegetation cover andreduce potential erosion problems. Almost allof thesouth facing slopes intheLittle Rocky Mountains arecovered withlodgepole pine. Through mining and proper reclamation, many ofthecurrently wooded, south facing slopes would bechanged intoopen grassy slopes with small planted trees thatwould benefit sheep andother wildlife (BLM 1992a). feet inlength. This lossof114acres would create low negative long-term impacts tofishery and wildlife resources. 4-136 Wildlife andAquatics 4.5.7.2 Cumulative Impacts Cumulative impacts forwildlife and fisheries would be similar toAlternative 4.Major differences under Alternative Sinclude: 1,025 acres ofnew disturbance towildlife habitat. Wildlife access and effective habitat not restricted bytheconveyor. Pastandpresent mining activities have directly impacted 1,245 acres ofwildlife foraging, breeding, resting andhiding areas. Proposed disturbance under Alternative 5would impact 1,025 acres ofwildlife habitat foratotal disturbance ofabout 2,270 or of Mountains. Assuming 95percent success ofreclamation and theestablishment ofgrassland areas beneficial to wildlife for70-80 years, cumulative impacts to wildlife habitat arerated lownegative. Exploration activities would target mineralized areas near theupper Alder Gulch leach pad impacting primarily Lodgepole pine habitats. Overall cumulative impacts rating forAlternative 5islow/moderate negative because ofwater quality impacts tofisheries and macroinvertebrates 5percent reclamation failure (114 acres) andmining inPony Gulch. 4.5.73 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts The potential for wildlife mortality from vehicle collisions would increase 3-4foldover the lifeofthe mine.

Wildlife mortality under thisalternative would notbea significant long-term impact. Noise Noise impacts from theconveyor would besimilar to Alternative 4.Duration ofuseoftheconveyor rockwould beconveyed from theZortman Mine toGoslin Flats. Enclosing the conveyor would reduce overall noise, butwould have littleimpact onnoise levels atAzure Cave. Noise impacts toAzure Cave from mining and reclamation activities would be66dBA, orroughly the noise produced inanolder urban residential area (Table 4.9-3). This noise levelwould notpresent a significant adverse impact tohibernating bats (Taylor 1994).

NAAQS andPSD Increments were selected ascriteria forthese assessments because they represent enforceable standards andcriteria under State ofMontana and federal regulations. The evaluations totheAverage 24-Hour activities. Airquahty impacts associated with the alternative actions were estimated using data collected during on- sitemeasurements, asreported intheAirQuahty Permit Applications forthetwomines submitted tothe AirQuality Division 3.6-1 through 3.6-3 listthemaximum andaverage PM,,, concentrations atthese stations for select monitoring periods during theyears 1990through 1993. 4.6.1.1 Emissions Models Two different emissions models wereused inthisimpact analysis. Arelatively unsophisticated model called SCREEN wasused alternatives atboth mines.SCREEN was alsoused tocalculate emissions fortheLandusky Mine alternatives, emissions rates for Alternatives 4through 7would bevery Mine extension alternatives. isdesigned to specifically evaluate emissions from fugitive concern more truly represents theimpacts stemming from road traffic.A brief description ofeachmodel follows.

The sources maybepoint, line, orarea sources. Area sources were used tomodel impacts from mining activities, and linesources were used tomodel impacts from haulroad 1993). \"worst case\" meteorological data were incorporated into themodel. FDM accounts for deposition through twoparameters: thegravitational settling velocity and thedeposition velocity. Three particle as65,27, and8percent oftheemissions, respectively. Additional keyinputs tothemodel aretheroughness and velocity. Friction velocities are calculated internally intheFDM from thewind speed andthe reference height ofthemeteorological data. A roughness height of15cm,wasused inthisanalysis quality ofdataused and assumptions aremade they are conservative, sothaterrors orvariance would result in overestimation ofimpacts. Model results indicating an exceedance ofstandards suggest thatanexceedancc is possible, but arefined modeling analysis would be necessary foramore precise air quality impact assessment. 4-142 AirQuality 4.6.1.2 Sources ofAirEmissions 4.6.13 Sensitive Receptors Sixemissions source types were used toestimate emissions rates forthealternatives. These emissions sources were selected because beresponsible contribution ofPMk, (mine pit,waste rock oretransfer operation, andtheheap leach model intoonepoint source, butasstated previously does not account foremissions from reclamation haul trucks in transit through thetowns. Theemissions ofdrilling, and hauling activities were incorporated into atotalmine pitemission rate which varied byalternative. Hauling activities were grouped asore,non-acid waste rock, andonehalf ofthewaste hauling. Waste Rock Emissions from thewaste rock repository consisted ofone half thewaste rock hauling, waste rockdumping, andtopsoil dumping. Crusher The totalemissions lbs/day) attheprimary crusher included from ore dumping, non-acid waste rockdumping, primary crushing, andprimary screening. Transfer Operations Five transfer points along the conveyor linefrom themine pittotheGoslin Flats leach padwere modeled using oreandnon-acid waste rock emissions. Emission varied by alternative. Heap Leach Pad :Emissions (302lbs/day) from the heap leach padconsists ofsecondary wereassumed tobethesame forthetwoheap leach pad sites. Reclamation Hauling Clay hauling from the Seaford Clay Pittotheleach pads forliner material andvarious facilities forreclamation from thetopsoil area tothevarious facilities forreclamation covers, weremodeled as two separate line sources. Emissions rates depended onthealternative considered.Known orestimated emissions rates locations. The andLandusky were selected asthe sensitive receptor locations forthisanalysis. Theywere chosen because oftheir proximity tothemining activities, population potentially affected, andlocation on routes used byhaul trucks todeliver reclamation and construction materials. 4.6.1.4 Impact Significance The airemissions levels estimated loreach alternative havebeencompared baseline airquality thedetermination isbased on whether airquality would bebetter than baseline conditions (positive impact) orworse than baseline conditions (negative impact). Tables 3.6-1through 3.6-3 provided average PM|o concentrations forthestudy area, including thesensitive receptor locations inZortman and Landusky. At these two sites, average concentrations were between 9and13/ig/m^ forthe three monitoring durations. Baseline prior tothebeginning oflarge-scale mining Rocky Mountains. Allemissions levels projected under thisanalysis, for allalternatives, would cause negative impacts since baseline airquality could onlybereached when allmine activity oftheairquality The frequency and duration are also evaluated. Airemissions caused bymining activities could beofashort-term duration, inthattheairquality would degrade forshort, possibly intense periods then clear up;orlong-term, such astherelatively constant emissions from mining andreclamation which would TABLE ofair emissions also varies. Inparticular, airemissions from most mining and reclamation activities would be constant. The airemissions resulting from haul trucks passing through Zortman andLandusky dust models conducted forZortman Mine activities, especially the impacts resulting from haul truck traffic through the town ofZortman. Significance criteria areexceeded in Zortman foralternatives convoys would typically passthrough town inamatter of minutes jmdtheairwould usually clear relatively soon after. Therefore, theduration oftheimpact would be very short term, andoccur onlywhen theconvoys pass through town. 4.6.1.5 Cumuiative from historic andrecent mine activities isnotrelevant toacumulative impacts analysis, since airquality would usually improve veryquickly after emissions cease. Therefore, thecumulative impacts analysis forthisresource relies onairemissions from existing sources (say, average PM,o concentrations in Zortman) combined with ongoing and/or projected mine activities, plus reasonably foreseeable developments iftheapplicable emissions would occur concurrent with theother airemi.ssions sources. 4.6.2 Impacts from Mining, 1979 to Present Airquality impacts from mining fortheyears 1979 to present, based onthe limited data available and summarized inSection 3.6.1, have notexceeded applicable airquality standards. No airquality monitoring datawere available todetermine baseline (pre- 1979) conditions. Other sources andLandusky leach pads. Each ofthese sources and their nature were discussed inSection 3.6 Asummary ofemissions from each isrepeated at Based these emission estimates andambient airmonitoring results, theassay lab isincompliance with beexpected tocontinue fortheaction alternatives. Under either scenario, the emissions would notconstitute asignificant impact. Because theemissions would cease fortheno-action alternatives forthemine extension alternatives, leademissions arenotdiscussed under each alternative's impact analysis. Stack testing ofemissions from therefinery indicate a total particulate emission rate of2.42 tons peryear AOD of1.4^g/m' and0.3/tg/m', respectively. These concentrations are wellbelow applicable Montana and federal ambient PMio standards. Emissions from therefinery would cease under ano-action alternative andbeexpected to continue atsimilar rates forthemine extension alternatives. Under either scenario, theemissions would notconstitute asignificant impact. Refinery emissions arenotdiscussed under each Alternative's impact analysis. Emissions ofhydrogen cyanide from andLandusky mines Limit (aconcentration established fortheprotection ofhuman health, worker safety) forhydrogen cyanide is10ppm(ACGIH 1993). When compared totheTLV, hydrogen cyanide concentrations emanating from theleach padsdonot represent asignificant impact. 4.6.3 Impacts from Alternative 1 Thisnoaction alternative limits activities attheZortman andLandusky Mines toalready permitted actions. Air emissions would originate from the limited ore processing operations attheZortman Mine, continued mining attheLandusky Mine untilapproximately early 1996,andreclamation atboth mines. 4-145 Environmental Consequences 4.6.3.1 Impacts PM,o concentrations were measured atanumber of monitoring stations atvarious times during theyears 1990 through 1993. Arithmetic average PM,o concentrations atZortman ranged from 9to13/tg/m^. Arithmetic average concentrations atLandusky ranged from 10to12/ig/m^. Projected airquality concentrations formining and reclamation activities atboth mines were estimated using theSCREEN model and the appropriate emissions sources forthe activities. Nooperational calculations wereconducted fortheZortman Mine since concentrations alternative. Impacts arenotsignificant from either The reclamation activities forwhich impacts were assessed included material handling, such astruck loading anddumping, grading anddozer activities, and material transport, which involves emissions from haul roads.

These concentrations arewellbelow theapplicable federal andstateambient air quality standards (see Table 4.6-1). These concentrations reflect alow level ofimpact atboth receptor isnot significant.

This estimate includes impacts from reclamation activities and haul trucks carrying reclamation materials. Sothatcomparison canbemade between alternatives, theestimates derived using the airpollutants include carbon monoxide (335tonsperyear), nitrogen oxides (430 tonsperyear), sulfur dioxide (47tonsperyear), and volatile organic compounds (28tons peryear). Ambient airquahty impacts from these pollutants were modeled using SCREEN. SCREEN predicted ambient airquality impacts foreach ofthepollutants listed above at Zortman (the nearest sensitive receptor) asfollows. Carbon monoxide 1-hour and8-hour impacts were estimated at274 /tg/m'' and 192^g/m', respectively. Nitrogen oxides annual at35 ^lg/m^ 15^g/m', and4 fig/m\\ respectively. Volatile organic compounds annual impacts were estimated at23fig/m^.

These impacts are allwellbelow thecorresponding federal and ambient airquality standards (see Table 4.6-1), andwould result innosignificant impact.

Direct impacts to recreational orland useresources would occur if construction oroperation oftheproject resulted inthe termination ofuseormodification oftheresources within thestudy area. Indirect impacts would occur if construction oroperation activities altered recreation usepatterns, recreation demand, access, orthequality oftherecreational experience. Impacts torecreation andland usewere considered significant if:(1)project-related changes would alter or otherwise physically affect established, designated, or planned recreation areas oractivities; (2)project- related changes would conflict with officially adopted pohces orgoals forlandmanagement; (3)project- related forrecreational use; (4)project-related a land uses; (5)project-related changes would have amajor within 0-5miles ofcurrent orproposed mine activities. The regional area includes recreation and landuseresources innorth central Montana, including themany recreational opportunities and facilities found along theMissouri River. Short term impacts are defined asthose occurring during the lifeofmine operations. Long term impacts aredefined asthose occurring after reclamation andrevegetation. 4.7.2 Impacts from Mining, 1979 to Present Asdescribed inthe affected environment chapter (Section 3.7), recreation activities in1979 centered around thetwo campgrounds (Montana Gulch Zortman), picnicking inMission Canyon, and the hiking, hunting, picnicking, and sightseeing opportunities available throughout theLittle Rocky Mountains. Prior to1979, recreationists could drive theZortman/Landusky county roadandusethat road toaccess hunting and hiking areas, and for sightseeing (including viewing historic mining structures). BLM lands weremanaged formultiple useincluding wildlife habitat, forestry, mining and recreation. Agriculture was thedominant useonprivate lands surrounding theLittle Rocky Mountains. Impacts torecreation activities canbegenerally to ofvisible land environment today stillincludes thetwo campgrounds, picnic spots andPowWow grounds in Mission Canyon, andthedispersed activities available in 1979. However, theZortman/Landusky county road overAntoine Butte isclosed tonon-mine business which lossofaccess tohunting areas and sightseeing opportunities. ZMIdoes offermine tours of their operations. Although visitor usedata forthecampgrounds isnot available for1979, overall recreational visits totheLittle Rocky Mountain Recreation Management Area has been declining inthe lastdecade (Whitehead 1995). Thewater well attheMontana arsenic contaminated water to1979andwhich wascapped soon after drilling, was plugged andabandoned in1991. Since 1979 there have been periods ofsurface water degradation atthe campground due toovertopping ofupstream capture systems attheLandusky Mine. Noise from blasting can occasionally beheard atthePowWow grounds in Mission Canyon on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. There hasbeen asubstantial increase intheamount of visible land disturbance since 1979. upseveral ofthepeaks and buttes near canreduce environment andreduce scenic viewing opportunities. Mine havenow become visible torecreation areas asfarsouth asthe Missouri ofthemines, aswell astoviewers PowWow grounds inMission Canyon. Light sources at themines areparticularly visible atnight, from both nearby and distant viewpoints. (Visual impacts are further evaluated inSection 4.8.) Lands used formine operations have precluded other land uses intheimmediate area ofmine operations. 4-155 Environmental Consequences BLM lands inthesurrounding area stillprovide for other uses such aswildlife habitat and recreation. Native Americans usemany oftheareas intheLittle Rocky Mountains forcultural purposes, including vision quests. Since 1979 there havebeen indirect impacts to several ofthese sitesfrom thevisual \u00a3mdnoise impacts caused bymine operations. 4.7.3 Alternative 1 Under Alternative 1,mine expansion planswould notbe approved. Mining activities previously permitted would continue, andreclamation procedures would proceed as approved. Previously permitted activities atthe Zortman mine include continued leaching atthe89pad areactive and91heap leach pads. These activities would havenoappreciable effect onrecreation resources. Existing impacts to recreation, asdescribed intheprevious section, would remain thesame until reclamation andrevegetation activities reduced theindirect visual impacts caused by land disturbance, andtheZortman/Landusky road is available forusebythepublic. Reclamation generally includes regrading offacilities to slopes nosteeper than 2:1andasoilcover ofeight inches. Reclamation specialists predict thattheexisting reclamation plan under Alternative 1would notbe 1994). Inthose reclamation failure, therewould belong-term significant impacts toland useandrecreation. Water quality may remain drainages of cover soil isnotadequate Ifthis occurs, water quality attheMontana Gulch may remain poor. However, awater quality compliance planmaybeimplemented byZMI to address water quality issues, andwould likely be required inallalternatives. With implementation ofthe compliance plan, both surface andgroundwater quality should beimproved inalldrainages affected bymining operations, including Montana Gulch. Mining isanapproved useofBLM lands intheLittle Rocky Mountains (BLM 1994). Denial ofmine extension plans would end thisland use after the currently permitted operations have ended, having a significant impact onmining within the Little Rocky Mountains.4.7.3.1 Cumulative Impacts Under Alternative 1,future mining activities would be limited. Further reclamation andremediation measures mayberequired inthefuture tocorrect problems with future which would involve road building and exploratory drilling. Long-term impacts torecreation andlandusewould bereduced byanyimprovement in reclamation success, however, continued building of exploration roads would addtothevisible disturbance in thearea,andlower thescenic quality ofthelandscape. This would continue theimpacts torecreationists expecting toview natural appearing mountain scenery while recreating within theviewshed ofmining activities. Insummary, mining operations atboth have created significant short-term impacts inthelocal These impacts arecaused byaccess restrictions andthedegradation ofthescenic quality ofthearea, which impacts willoccur torecreationists who mayview themine area until thedisturbed areas willnotentirely impacts stillbenoticeable unnatural topography anddifferences in vegetation Reclamation fidlure would cause long-term impacts toboth recreation andland use.

Reclamation measures would improve theprobability of successful revegetation and control ofwater quality problems. Successful reclamation iscritical for: disturbed areas toreturn toother land usessuch inthevisual lands; andthegeneral improvement condition areas. 4.7.4.1 Cumulative Impacts AsinAlternative 1,future mining activities arenot reasonably foreseeable with implementation of 2.Itispossible thatafewexploration roads maybebuilt, butexploration andlanduseresources.

Activities attheZortman power quarry south ofGreen facihties or activities would occur toareas in,orimmediately adjacent to,existing mining operations. However, the overland conveyor, carry orefrom themine totheheap leach pad inGoslin Gulch; andtheGoslin Flats heap pad, would restrict access toGoslin Gulch, which isoccasionally usedbyrecreationists and biologists toaccess Saddle Butte andtheAzure Cave.

Recreationists driving upthecounty Road) Facihties atGoslin Flatswould require night lighting, creating source Trail users onOld natural appearance ofthe landscape anddecrease thequaUty oftherecreational environment. Mine lifewould be extended byapproximately five toeight years after project startup. Proposed activities attheLandusky mine include expansion oftheexisting pitsandheap leach pads, and development ofalimestone quarry atKings Creek. 4-158 Recreation andLand Use None ofthese proposed facilities would directly impact developed recreation facilities. TheMontana Gulch campground isnot within view ofmining areas. Assuming that awater compliance plan will be implemented, water quality atthecampground should improve. Indirect impacts would bethesame asthose caused byexpansion oftheZortman Mine -primarily visual impacts intheamount of mine disturbance. Theexpanded mine pitsand/or heap leach padswould beseenfrom several ofthe higher peaks inthearea including Mission, Indian and Silver Peaks, Thornhill Butte, andfrom ofU.S. any notbedirectly impacted bytheproposed mine expjmsion.

Phillips County would require therezoning oftheGoslin Gulch land from agriculture toindustrial. After reclamation, grazing could beanappropriate useonreclaimed lands. 4.7.6.1 Cumulative Impacts Possible future developments attheZortman mine include mining inthePonyGulch area, expansion ofthe Goslin Gulch leach padandadditional limestone quarry development. AttheLandusky mine foreseeable future actions include continued mining oforeandwaste rock atexisting pitsandtheSouth GoldBug pit,additional heap leach capacity, andadditional limestone mining at theKing Creek quarry and aproposed quarry in Montana Gulch. Exploration activities could occur over atenyear period anddisturb anadditional 128acres throughout thatportion oftheLittle Rocky Mountains oftheFortBelknap Indian Reservation. This additional disturbance would befrom roadandtrench construction and drill sites.Mine orchristmas tree cutting. Disturbance from additional oreandwaste rock mining and exploration activities would increase the amount ofindustrial activity occurring intheareaand decrease theamount ofland inthe Little Rocky Mountains thatprovide undisturbed, intact landscapes andenvironments. Future mine development would prolong theuseoffacilities inGoslin Flats, increasing theduration ofvisual impacts inthat area. Operation ofalimestone quarry attheMontana Gulch sitewould cause substantial visual and noise impacts to recreationists attheMontana Gulch campground. The quarry maybepartially visible from thecampground and theaccess road tothequarry, which would haul campground. Insummary, there hasbeen significant short-term impacts tothelocal recreational environment caused primarily byindirect visual impacts from existing mine developments, andfrom access restrictions. Onamore regional level, impacts arenotconsidered significant. Recreation activities outside ofthe Little Rocky Mountains, including prairie doghunting anddeveloped caused bymine disturbance arenoticeable from very long distances, including viewers ontheMissouri Breaks Backcountry Byway, butthese impacts arenotsignificant enjoyment oftheir activities. TheCPAwould extend themine lifeforapproximately eight years, and create new areas ofvisible ground disturbance and industrial activity. Foreseeable mine development andexploration activities would extend those impacts formany years intothefuture anddelay reclamation ofallmine return toother landusesincluding wildlife habitat areas would allow recreationists tousethearea again forhunting and other activities, andtheindirect visual impacts would be reduced. 4.7.6.2 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts Indirect visual impacts torecreationists, andother users including Native Americans, willoccur forthehfeof purposes 4-159 Environmental Consequences such aswildlife habitat andrecreation (hiking, gathering forest products) would beprecluded until after final reclamation. 4.7.63 Short-Term Use/Long-Term Productivity Impacts totheproductivity ofdisturbed lands occurring since 1979and willcontinue forthe lifeofmine, projected to bearound eight years. Foreseeable developments could extend impacts forseveral more years. However, the long-term productivity ofdisturbed areas could be returned with successful reclamation. Reclaimed areas atboth theZortman andLandusky long-term reduction inthequality ofthe recreational environment duetoresidual visual impacts. Reclaimed land inGoslin Flats could most likely be used forlivestock grazing, which isthecurrent land use. 4.7.6.4 Irreversible orIrretrievable Resource Commitments Mining andLandusky anirretrievable change inthescenery ofthe area.

Thedegree to which project facilities would impact thescenic qualities ofthelandscape depends ontheamount ofvisible contrast tothe landscape character. Theamount ofcontrast theexisting landscape features isdefined byananalysis ofeach ofthebasic visual elements were addressed indetermining thelevel ofvisual contrast. These include thetypeandextent of actual physical contrast brought about bytheproject, andthe visibility oftheproposed project facilities to sensitive viewpoints within thestudy area. Thetypeof physical contrast isdetermined byevaluating the following criteria: scale differential, spatial dominance, landforms, soil color, landscape diversity, structural compatibility, andvegetation patterns. Scale differential refers totheproportionate sizeofproject components thelandscape. Variables considered inevaluating visibility offacilities included viewer orientation, view distance, duration of view, lighting conditions, topographic and/or vegetation screening, andviewer sensitivity. The unique value; from (orthevisual setting of)parks, wilderness areas, natural areas orother sensitive land use;views from (orthevisual setting of)travel routes, including roads and trails; andviews from (orthevisual setting of) established orplanned recreational, area. within thestudy area,termed Key Observation Points (KOPs), were selected as representative views from travel routes, recreational areas, residential areas, andviews from several sites of significance toNative significant visibility characteristics oftheKOPs and results ofthe visibility analysis from eachKOP. Visibility oftheproposed facilities from theKOPs were analyzed through the examination ofaerial photographs, 7.5min.topographic maps, site visits, photographs taken from theKOPs, and computer visibility models. Inaddition tothe visibility analysis, photographic simulations oftheproposed action and alternative facilities were prepared from selected viewpoints. Simulations arefrom viewpoints with representative views from recreation areas, travel routes andareas traditionally usedbyNative Americans, anddisplay the existing view andviews with theproposed and/or alternative project facilities. Simulations arefound in Appendix D. 4.8.2 Impacts from Mining, 1979 to Present Modern mining began attheZortman andLandusky mines in1979. Atthat time, surface disturbance associated with historic mining activity was visible in Alder andRuby Gulches nearZortman, and inthearea surrounding were evident inthelandscape, caused byroad building, surface mining, adits, waste rockand tailing. However, these disturbances wereonarelatively small scaleandtheareacould stillbecharacterized asbeing generally natural appearing, except inafewlocalized areas. Historic mining haddisturbed approximately 37 acres inthe vicinity oftheZortman mine and approximately 19acres inareas surrounding the Landusky mine. Views ofthedisturbed areas confined toasmall local viewshed, andwere notnoticeable from themain roads surrounding the Little Rocky Mountains. In1979 the visual resources ofthe Little Rocky Mountains were evaluated bytheBLM using theVisual Resource Management (VRM) methodology.

Benches along the highwall create strong geometric linesandforms that contrast withthecharacteristic linesandshapes naturally occurring mountain landscapes. The scale ofthe disturbance dominates theviewers attention.

TheLandusky mine hastwice the amount ofdisturbed acres astheZortman Mine, and objectives ofVRM Class IIlandscapes. 4.8.3 Impacts from Alternative 1 Under Alternative 1,permitted activities would continue, butmine extension plans would notbeapproved. Previously permitted activities attheZortman mine include continued leaching atthe89pad and reclamation and closure activities. There is approximately oneyear ofleaching capacity atthe89 pad, finalreclamation should likely continue through 1995.Heap leaching willcontinue for several years after the lastoftheorehasbeenmined- final reclamation would take 2-3years after active leaching iscomplete. Permitted operational activities would havenoappreciable effect ontheexisting visual quality atthemines. Existing disturbance hasalreadycaused significant long-term impacts tothescenic quality ofthemined areas. After successful reclamation, visual contrasts would be reduced. Revegetation ofreclaimed facilities would mitigate much ofthecolor contrasts caused bythe exposed rockand soil.However, reclamation specialists predict that thereclamation measures outlined for Alternative 1would fail inmany areas -theresult of steep slopes onreclaimed facilities and thepossible failure ofthereclamation covers toprevent water quality problems and acidification ofsoil. Inareas where revegetation was not successful, bare soilwould be exposed andwould continue thevisual contrasts that currently exist. The alteration oftopography caused by mine pitsandthelargeman-made landforms caused by theheap leach andwaste rock facilities would continue tobeapparent, even after reclamation. Visual contrasts resulting from thefailure ofreclamation ground cover insome areas, thecontrasts inlandforms, andthevisual scar leftbythepithighwalls would attract attention from several sensitive viewpoints, causing long- term significant impacts tothevisual resources ofthe southern LittleRocky Mountains. These impacts would beespecially evident attheLandusky mine, which is visible toagreater number ofobservers than the Zortman mine, including travellers along thetwomajor highways inthearea, U.S. 191andStateHighway 66. 4.8.3.1 Cumulative Impacts Foreseeable future mine development orexploration activities intheLittleRocky Mountains arevery limited delineated orereserves would notbeapproved. Anyroad building associated with exploration activities would cause additional color and linecontrasts. Insummary, mining activity from 1979 topresent has caused significant long-term impacts tothe visuad resource. Alternative 1would notallow further ground disturbance which would stop additional, additive impacts from occurring, buthasareclamation plan which maynotbesuccessful. Long-term impacts would remain afterimplementation ofthereclamation plan. 4.8.3.2 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts Unavoidable adverse impacts include contrasts created bytheexposed rock ofthemine pithighwalls, contrasts caused bylargeman-made landforms (heap leach pads andwaste rock stockpiles), andpossible color contrasts created bythe failure ofreclamation areas.

Long-term impacts from both theLandusky and Zortman mines, caused primarily from thealtered topography and vegetation patterns, would remain significant toclose inviewpoints aftermine closure and reclamation. Even though reclamation would reduce many oftheexisting visual contrasts, some contrasts would remain andbenoticeable from several sensitive viewpoints, especially frommany ofthesurrounding peaks. Post-reclamation contrasts include form, line, color, andtexture contrasts ofthe pithighwalls and landform contrasts caused byheap leach rock Objectives forVRM such asMission Peakand OldScraggy. 4.8.4.1 Cumulative Reasonably foreseeable mine development and exploration activities areasdescribed forAlternative 1.

Part ofthose corrective actions include using limestone ascapillary break material inthe reclamation covers. This requires themining of limestone attheLS-1 quarry, located about halfway between Shell Butte andGreen Mountain (Zortman mine), and attheKings Creek quarry on highground with agenerally northwest aspect, and would bevisible from Mission Peak andother high mountain peaks inthevicinity oftheLandusky Mine. Impacts from limestone mining would include line,form color andtexture contrasts created bytheexposed location andused as backfill inthemine pits. Thiswould reduce existing landform contrasts bythose facilities andwould lessen thevisual impact ofthe pits, asthesurface 3should possibility ofsuccessful reclamation revegetation, thereby reducing thecolor contrasts caused byexposed soil.

Visual ofthe pitexpansion would increase inthealteration ofexisting topography, and exposure ofsoilandrockfrom thenewly disturbed area, which would create color, form andtexture contrasts. The impacts caused by pitextension would be incremental toexisting disturbance, andwould not significantly change themagnitude ofexisting contrasts ordraw additional visual attention tothe site. The increased size ofthedisturbance would bemost noticeable from viewpoints north oftheZortman Mine, including Beaver Mountain andthetown ofLodge Pole. Thewaste rock repository inCarter Gulch would This area iscurrently mostly covered inconifers, andhasadarkgreen color generally natural appearance, although there areafew exploration/access roads inthis area. Visual impacts would include color, formandtexture contrasts created bythealteration ofthenatural drainage pattern, andthe light contrasts with thecolor andtexture ofthesurrounding conifers. Although additional visual impacts would occur from thewaste rock repository inCarter Gulch, such impacts would beinanarea adjacent toexisting disturbance, thereby causing aincremental increase in visual effects. Theoverland forhauling orefrom 4.5feetwide, would befenced tolimit public access; it would tomaintain public toPony Gulch. Aroadway, constructed along theconveyor route, would addadditional disturbance, bringing the total width of visible ground disturbance to approximately 50feet. The conveyor would pass through landwhich isgenerally undisturbed, mixed- forest/shrub land inthemountain section, andgrassy pasture intheGoslin Flats area. Construction of theconveyor would introduce alinear feature inthe landscape, creating alineandcolor contrast noticeable from several roads thearea (7-mile roadandtheBear inwhat isnow pasture land. Approximately 5,200 feetwide, the facility would stack orein25-foot liftsuptoamaximum depth of200 feet. Other facilities include atopsoil stockpile onthe east side oftheleach pad, orestockpiles andabuilding which would contain secondary and tertiary crushers, and solution ponds and a processing plant located onthesouth endofthe facility. Construction oftheleachpadand facilities would create amajor new disturbance inthelandscape, affecting approximately 250acres ofland. Visual impacts from the facilities would include strong form and color contrasts created bythe introduction ofalarge geometric shape which would beincongruous withany natural features found inthesurrounding landscape. Structures associated withtheplantwould alsointroduce lineandform contrasts. Night lighting would be required atthemine pits,crusher facilities and atthe new facilities inGoslin Flats, creating avisible light source formiles around. The character ofthelandwould bechanged from agricultural toindustrial. The leach padand facilities into would have the longest duration ofview oftheleach pad, asthefacility would U.S. bethemost evident inmorning light,when sunillumination would brighten the facilities. Rerouting oftheZortman-to-Landusky access road, transmission lineand pipeline (the pipeline and transmission linearetobeburied), andbuilding newor upgrading existing access/haul roads, would have an additive effect ontheoverall amount ofdisturbance visible from viewpoints within thestudy south of Green Mountain intheupper reaches ofLodge Pole Creek. Approximately 13acres would bedisturbed by thequarry, creating color andtexture contrasts with the surrounding landscape features. Thequarry would be visible from Beaver Mountain andOldScraggy Peak. Anadditional 4.2acres ofdisturbance would occur at theSeaford clay pit -visual contrasts from that disturbance would beseen from U.S.Highway 191.

Activities Mine include extension of existing mine pitsandleach pads, anddevelopment ofa limestone oftheproposed extension isina highly visible location onthesouth face sideof Gold Bug Butte isvisible frommany locations, and existing exploration roads coming outoftheGoldBug Pitandrunning thesouth facewould create more visible disturbance from southerly viewpoints. Impacts would include line, formandcolor contrasts. Thetopographic changes in Gold BugPeak would besilhouetted from some viewpoints, drawing visual attention. From viewpoints north leach pads would create additional surface area ofvisible disturbance noticeable from several keyviewpoints, including points along U.S.Highway 191,Montana Highway 66,thepowwowgrounds inMission Canyon, andseveral high points inthesurrounding such as Mission PeakandThornhill Butte. Development ofalimestone quarry attheKingCreek location would disturb approximately 10acres (includes disturbance from pit,storage and haul roads) and produce approximately 50,000 tons oflimestone. Located onhighground northwest oftheexisting Queen Rose Pit,anewquarry attheKingCreek sitewould create visual impacts, including color, formandtexture contrasts, noticeable from Mission Peak and other dispersed areas inthe surrounding landscape. Approximately 7acres ofdisturbance would occur atthe Williams Clay pit-visual contrasts from thatdisturbance would beseenfromHighway 66andwould attract the viewers attention.

AttheLandusky mine foreseeable future actions include continued mining of oreandwaste rock atexisting pits,additional heap leach capacity, andadditional limestone quarry operations at theKingCreek quarry and aquarry inMontana Gulch. Exploration activities could occur over atenyearperiod and disturb anadditional 128acres throughout that portion oftheLittle Rocky Mountains outside ofthe Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. This additional disturbance would befrom roadandtrench construction and drill sites. Road construction creates strong line andcolor contrasts thatcanbeseen formiles from the disturbance. Mine development inthePonyGulch areawould disturb approximately 14acres ofland. This butcanbeseenfromOldScraggy ofland intheLittleRocky Mountains thatprovide undisturbed, intact landscapes and environments. Future mine development would prolong theuseoffacilities in Goslin Flats, increasing theduration ofvisual impacts in that area. These activities would add totheoverall amount ofvisual contrasts present intheLittle Rocky Mountains andcause further degradation ofthescenic qualities ofthehigh-value mountain landscapes. Insummary, pastandpresent mining activities, and those activities proposed under thisalternative wouldcreate significant long-term impacts tothe scenic resource ofthearea. Reclamation would reduce many ofthevisual contrasts existing inthelandscape, and those which would becreated bytheproposed expansion, but the residual impacts (impacts after reclamation) from sensitive viewpoints inclose proximity totheminewould stilldraw attention, andwould notbe for change inthelandscape tobelowand not attract attention. 4.8.6.2 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts Unavoidable adverse impacts include contrasts created bytheexposed rock ofthemine pithighwalls (including limestone quarries), contrasts rock inthevegetative lands. 4.8.6.3 Short-Term Use/Long-term Productivity Scenic resources ofthearea have development thearea ofcurrent mine disturbance, andtheproposed areas ofnewdisturbance including Carter waste rock repository, thelimestone quarries atLS-1 andMontana caused bythemine pitsand the large man-made landforms created bytheheap leach padsandthewaste rock stockpiles. 4.8.7 Impacts Alternative padwould Goslin Flats development ofmine facilities inGoslin Flats orRuby Flats.

Impacts tothevisual resource would remain significant atboth theZortman andLandusky mines for the lifeofthemines, although these impacts would not include the Goslin Flats orRuby Flats lands. Reclamation measures would reduce most ofthevisual contrasts attheZortman mine tonon-significant levels except from sensitive viewpoints immediately surrounding themine, including OldScraggy Peakand Saddle Butte. Visual contrasts remaining after reclamation attheLandusky mine would leave significant impacts toseveral sensitive viewpoints including Mission Peak, andfrom selected viewpoints along U.S. 191andStateHighway 66. Aheap leach inupper Alder Gulch would permanently change which be filled inwith substantial formandcolor except forafewaccess roads. The sitefortheleach pad isinanarea that is visually contained bysurrounding topography, causing visual impacts tobemostly localized tohighpeaks OldScraggy short andfrom Ricker Butte, approximately 7miles eastofthemine.

Alternative 5would reduce theamoimt of land affected bythese visual impacts compared to Alternative 4bynotallowing development intheGoslin Flats orRuby Flats area,andbynotincluding thePony Gulch mine asareasonably foreseeable development. 4-173 Environmental Consequences 4.8.7.2 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts Unavoidable adverse impacts include contrasts created bytheexposed rock ofthemine pithighwalls (including limestone quarries), contrasts caused bylargeman-made (heap padsandwaste rock stockpiles), anddifferences inthevegetative patterns andtextures of Short-Term Productivity thiswould include theareaofcurrent mine disturbance, andtheproposed areas ofnewdisturbance including (\"lulch rock quarries andMontana bythemine pitsand largeman-made landforms created bytheheap leach padsandthewaste rock stockpiles. 4.8.8 Impacts from Alternative 6 Under Alternative 6,thewaste rock repository forthe Zortman minewould berelocated from Carter Gulch to Ruby Flats, located northeast oftheproposed heap leach pad inGoslin Flats. Visual impacts from this alternative would besignificant atboth theZortman and Landusky mines. Ruby Flats isgrassy, rolling pasture land, currently free fromanymajor ground disturbance. Approximately 200 acres would beaffected bytheconstruction and operation ofthewaste rock repository. Thisdisturbance would create visual impacts intheGoslin Flats viewshed, which islocated inanarea ofhigher visibility than theCarter Gulch site. Impacts from the waste rock repository would include strong form and color contrasts which, whencombined withtheproposedheap leach pad inGoslin Flats, would create alarge industrial ofsubstantial visual impacts totravellers on7-mile andBearGulch roads. Both theproposed heap padandthewaste foreground distance zone forusers ofthetworoads into Zortman, andeven after reclamation and successful revegetation, would present large scale, unnatural looking landforms causing significant visual contrasts.

These guidelines were designed to protect against theinterference ofthepublic's outdoor activities. system which isadjusted tothe human ear. Noise impacts associated with thealternative actions were estimated byusing data collected during on-site noise measurements, where possible. Noise measurements weremade ondayswhen nomining activities occurred toestablish baseline levels. Operational noise levels were measured ondays with normal mining activities. 4.9.1.1 Sources ofNoise Manufacturers data fornoise levels forvarious pieces of equipment were used intheassessment. Table 4.9-1 presents noise levels formining equipment and processes based onmanufacturers specifications. These estimated noise levels from various sources were extrapolated toZortman and Landusky mining operations using sitespecific information, ifavailable. Asanexample, themanufacturers specifications indicate that noise levels from conveyors willbe56dBA at 50feet. Neither mine hasacomparable conveyor, so themanufacturers areused intheimpact analysis. Similar noise levels havebeen reported inthe literature forenclosed crushing operations. These noise benoticeable havecomparable OPERATIONAL NOISE LEVELS (DECIBELS) MEASURED AT50FEET FORVARIOUS TYPES OF MINING EQUIPMENT Equipment Environmental Consequences 4.9.1.3 Noise Receptors The sensitive receptors considered thenoise impacts atthe closest sensitive receptors, theworst-case noise levels associated with each areasource foreach alternative wascalculated by: 1) Determining the individual expected forthealternativenoise sources 2) Logarithmically combining the sources andreceptor orforestation, noise levels because ofgreater attenuation.

Under many ofthereclamation alternatives, haul trucks would travel through thetowns ofZortman andLandusky todeliver materials such as clay, limestone, and soiltomine facilities. Aseparate analysis under theheading\"Roads\"isincluded for reclamation haul truck noise impacts. Noise impacts from reclamation materials hauling areestimated assuming noattenuation. Inother words, noise levels estimated foreach alternative have beencompared against baseline noise conditions inthe study area todetermine whether impacts arepositive or thedetermination isbased on whether anoise belower than baseline conditions impact) orhigher than (negative impact). Table 4.9-2shows typiced noise vju\"ious Baseline noise conditions tobetypical of rural towooded residential communities, approximately 40to50dBA. Allnoise levels projected under this analysis, for allalternatives, would cause negative impacts. Baseline conditions would onlybereached once allactivity associated with themines ceases. Theestimated impacts havebeen rated aslow,medium, orhighmagnitude, using guideline for outdoor (seeTable 3.9-3). Low noise impacts arethose thatarebelow 53dBA. Medium noise impacts were assigned toalternatives in which noise levels were estimated tobeintherange of 53to57dBA, andhigh noise impacts were assigned to alternatives inwhich substantial exceedamces oftheEPA guideline were estimated (above 57dBA). Impacts are considered tobesignificant ifthelevels estimated atthe receptor locations would interfere withoutdoor activity, since outdoor recreation isacommon activity of residents and visitors intheLittle Rocky Mountains. The frequency and duration ofimpacts are also evaluated. Noise caused bymining activities could beof ashort-term duration, inthatthenoisewould occur for short, possibly intense periods then cease. Or,the impacts could beoflong-term duration, such asthe noise frommining andreclamation which would extend until closure isapproved. Thefrequency ofnoise also varies. Inparticular, noise from most mining and reclamation activities would beconstant. Theloudnoise resulting from blasting would beofvery short duration andoccur infrequently. Thenoise resulting from haul trucks through Zortman andLandusky would occur onafrequent, butshort-duration basis. 4.9.1.5 Cumulative Noise Noise caused byhistoric andrecent mine activities isnot relevant toacumulative impacts analysis, since noise dissipates almost immediately. Therefore, the cumulative impacts analysis forthisresource relies on noise from existing sources (say, noise associated with thetown ofZortman) combined withongoing and/or projected mine activities, plusreasonably foreseeable developments ifthenoise generated would occur concurrent withtheother noise sources. Because ofthe addition ofallsources, cumulative noise impacts should always behigher thanestimated direct impacts. 4-178 TABLE 4.9-2 dBMEASURED Ldn uidB Outdoor Location -90- Environmental Consequences 4.9.2 Impacts from Mining, 1979 to Present Noon-site noise monitoring isavailable prior to1990.

Differences among thenon-expansion alternatives in terms ofprojected employment, payroll, business purchases, emdtaxes reflect differing activities duetothe modification ofreclamation procedures proposed by ZMI under Alternative 2and theagency-mitigated reclamation procedures proposed under outputs ofgold and silver. These arethe economic characteristics which driveZMI's liabihties for property taxesandthegross proceeds andmetal mines license taxes. Theexpansion alternatives. Alternatives 4through 7, would permit continued mineral development activity andtheconstruction ofexpanded ornew facilities atthe Zortman andLandusky mines. Differences among the expansion alternatives interms ofprojected employment, payroll, business purchases, and taxes reflect thevarious locations andconfigurations ofheap leaching andoreandwaste rock handling asdiffering methods andintensities ofreclamation activity. Thetiming ofadditional construction, mining, issimilar among theexpansion alternatives although Alternative 6lasts ayear less overall compared toAlternatives noticeable inAlternatives 5and 6,where employment levels fortheyesu'2004 year.ZMI's taxliability would differsomewhat among because of varying levels ofcapital expenditure andproductivity. In general, however, differences among Alternatives 4 through 7fallwithin arelatively narrow range. Figiwes 4.10-1 and4.10-2 byplotting employment andspending from 1996 to2012, thetime horizon encompassed by this assessment. Theemployment levels from Table represent thesum capital plus expenditures for contracting, allexpressed in1994 doUiu^s. Readers ofthefollowing assessment should note that in socioeconomic terms, thekeydifference between the non-expansion alternatives (Alternatives 1-3) andthe expansion alternatives 4-7)isthetiming development activity, therefore thetiming ofimpacts upon thesocial and economic environment. Theendofmineral development activity occurs almost immediately under Alternatives 1 through 3and isdelayed for5to7years these impacts would bedelayed foranumber ofyears under the expansion alternatives. Some consideration hasbeen given inthisanalysis tothe economic effects ofreasonably foreseeable includes mining ofore inthePonyGulch areaandexploration activities. Development would translating intoabout twomonths of additional mining activity. It isunlikely that this additional development would require ZMI toadd employees; spending would beproportional to theamount ofneworetobeextracted andtherefore would berelatively small.

Employment andearnings changes were estimated using amultiplier approach similar theonedescribed economic impact. Dollar impacts havebeen converted to1994 dollars for consistency. Employment andearnings ofworkers by from theRegional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II)ofthe Regional Economic Analysis Division, Bureau of Economic Analysis, USDOC (1992). County-level impacts andstudy area-level impacts were estimated expenditures tothecounties andthestudy area, andthen applying thestate-level multipliers to each expenditure type.The allocations reflect local spending information obtained fromZMI(Eickerman 1993). Changes intotal population andschool-age population were estimated from changes intotalemployment by using factors derived from information inSection 3.10. Perhaps themost important arederived from thechanges indirect and secondary employment estimated and projected as described above. Todevelop factors needed toderive outmigration from employment changes, interviews were conducted with ZMIandknowledgeable individuals inthecommunity to gather information about thepercentage ofworkers with strong local Ereaux 1994, 1994, Rust 1994, Soiseth 1994). Based ontheinformation gathered inthis process, assumptions were developed forthree categories of workers. First, ZMI's managerial and professional employees, about 15percent ofZMIemployment, are allassumed toout-migrate because nocomparable employment ingoldmining would beavailable locally. Second, ofthehourly work force and their households areassumed toout-migrate. Ononetheone hand, reflects andhave strong inPhillips andBlaine counties through ownership, involvement inagriculture, family allegiances, andother personal relationships. Onthe other hand, thelocaleconomy probably would notbe strong enough attime ofclosure, either sooner under thenon-expansion alternatives orlater under the expansion alternatives, tooffer satisfactory forthelong-term. Ifallworkers with local tieswere theoutmigration rate for would beabout This has been increased to50percent ontheassumption that some locally-hired workers would out-migrate for economic reasons anddespite local ties. Finally, itwas assumed that households ofworkers employed in communities asaresult ofsecondary spending impacts would out-migrate atthesame rate ashourly note thatthestate- level multipliers used reflect conditions found inthe Montana economy asawhole, aneconomy that ismuch more diversified than thelocaleconomies within the study area. Secondary, ormultiplier, effects aresmaller inlocal economies, like Phillips andBlaine counties, because ofleakage, the loss oflocal business and 4-205 Environmental Consequences household spending tomarkets andtrade centers outside the local area.

Asa result, employment, earnings, andpopulation impacts areprobably overstated. Inother words, thesecondary effect ofZMI's operation within thelocaleconomies of Phillips and Bljiine counties probably islessthan has been estimated and reported inthis assessment. Similarly, thepotential secondary effect ofZMI's closure probably would belessthan hasbeen projected ofoutmigration presented oftheuncertainty economic effects ofZMI employment inPhiUips and Blaine counties. These limitations arediscussed above. Second, there isthe uncertainty associated with theoutmigration rates developed forthisassessment. Empirical information available waslimited tothepercentage oflocally hired employees. Other rates havebeen assigned based upon impressions gathered from sources cited above, theory andprofessional experience. This approach may not sufficiently account forthestrength oflocal ties, willingness toaccept alowered standard ofliving, thetendency that actual outmigration bycommunity may vary from the community-level projections presented here. 4.10.1.3 Facilities andServices Impact Assessment Methods Facilities and services impacts were assessed by determining whether estimated population changes in communities ofthestudy areawould potentially alleviateChanges inlocal government fiscal conditions were assessed for selected jurisdictions bycomparing estimated changes inrevenues and expenditures.

However, statewide economic effects also were considered andwere evaluated inastatewide context. Thefollowing general criteria alsowere andwhether theimpact relevant totheagencies' decision activities. 4.10.2 Impacts oftheZortman and Landusky Mines, 1979 to 1994 The existing Zortman andLandusky mines havebeen in operation inPhillips County since 1979. Atthat time, noother economic activity approached agriculture in importance inPhiUips County and intheLittle Rockies area.Over time, themines haveadded diversity toan economy hampered bylimited natural resources and distance from population centers. Initially, themines created about 30to40direct jobs 90jobs withZortman Inc.andabout 100 jobs with contract miner NA. Degerstrom (DSL/BLM 1990). Currently employment atthemines averages about 200workers. Themines alsoemploy about 20additional persons annually between April and October toperform reclamation andother seasonal work. Since their inception, theZortman havehadasignificant effect ontheeconomic situation inPhillips County bydiversifying employment earnings, jmd contributing tothelocal taxbase.ZMI alsohascaused significant growth inZortman and supported or enhanced property values inPhillips County, Malta, and Zortman.

However, theimpact does represent the restoration ofsome recreation-based potentially would occur asZMI eliminates jobsalthough several factors would reduce theimpact of the layoffs onthepopulation within thestudy area. Ciurent ZMI employees, many ofwhom were hired from the local labor force, maintain strong ties to communities inPhillips andBlaine counties through landownership andinvolvement inagriculture, family allegiances, andother personal relationships. Because newly unemployed workers some andLandusky mines (and perhaps atpotentially affected trade who areaandtherefore arenotaccounted overstate theamount ofoutmigration thatactually would occur over time, following closure oftheZortman Landusky mines. Section 4.10.1.2 discusses themethods andassumptions used intheoutmigration analysis and their limitations. Based onthese assumptions, itis projected thatapproximately 150direct and indirect worker households would out-migrate from Phillips County and about 10direct County. Note that thepotential exists foroutmigration ofworker households from Blaine verystrong 150households would Similarly, assuming anoutmigration of11households, thetotalimpact onthepopulation persons (animpact ofless than 1%). This total potentially could include about 10school-age children. The estimates oftotal population and school-age children inrelation toworker households arebased ofdirect \u00a3md indirect worker households areMalta (100 households, 330 and130school-age children) andZortman (45 households, 50persons, and20school-age children). inDodson children. SomeZMI number of households involved. ZMI would eliminate jobs quickly under Alternative 1,population outmigration would occur more gradually asemployment levels increase inPhillips County andontheFort Belknap Indian Reservation immediately after mine closure andwould then decline asworkers either find new jobs, out-migrate, orbecome discouraged and become long-term unemployed workers. Percapita personal income alsowould tend todecline inPhillips butsignificant effect onproperty values electric power costs. Property values potentially would decline inPhillips County, andespecially inthecommunities ofMalta tothe presence ofZMI's operations. AsZMI reduces its employment levels, residential andcommercial property values would drop inZortman. Over thelong term, in theabsence ofother industrial development oranother basis forattracting residents, Zortman would wither away from the BigFlatElectric Cooperative potentially would increase significantly ifZMI closes. This isbecause Big Flat would losethelower rates itcurrently enjoys duetothe volume andpattern ofZMI's power consumption. The local would have topaymore forthepower it purchases, andBigFlatwould stillface anumber of fixed costs which could notbecuttoanyappreciable degree, including existing debt. BigFlatwould passon higher unit costs toitsremaining customers, and this would have significant impact oncustomer electric bills. Itisestimated that ahousehold now heating with instead of$200 amonth (Henderson 1994). heated byelectricity within Big Flat's service area areconcentrated inrural areas ofPhillips and Blaine counties where natural gas isnotavailable. These areas include therural area ofPhillips County south of MjJta andaround Regina, rural areas around Turner andHogeland within Blaine County, and theFort Belknap Indian Reservation (Fewer 1995). Households heating with electricity would beaffected byhigher electric rates because ofthehigher total costtheyincur forthehigher consumption ofelectricity that electric heat entails, especially inthewinter months. Local jurisdictions inPhillips County would accumulate direct taxrevenues under Alternative 1.However, average annual revenues would decline rapidly after 1996andwould eventually disappear entirely atthe conclusion ofallactivity atthemine site $120,000 4-217 districts combined, $110,00 fortheDodson High School District, and$70,000 forLandusky Elementary School, allin1994 theCityofMalta would benegligible.

Under Montana's system ofschool finance, schools would also lose direct state aidandbudget capacity forevery student lost. Phillips County alsowould loseannual Metal Mines License Tcix distributions tothePhillips County Hard Rock Trust Reserve, which hadabalance ofabout $1 million in1994. Under Although ZMIwould continue topaymetal mines license taxes foratime Alternative 1,theamount would decline rapidly between 1996and2000, thelastyear ofgoldand silver production. Under Alternative 1,the State would accumulate anadditional $440,000 inmetal mines license taxes. Costs forproviding services may decline somewhat for PhiUips County government asmine employment declines and population begins toout-migrate. However, revenues lostwould potentially exceed the County's ability tocut costs for several reasons. Agriculture continues togenerate most ofthedemand forCounty services, theCounty already isatminimal levels formany services, and Phillips County officials probably would find itpolitically unacceptable toraise taxes sufficiently tooffset all lostmine-generated revenues. Therefore, itislikely thatsome services would have tobereduced orcut entirely.

Social impacts ofthealternative would besignificant and negative especially inMalta andZortman where ofAlternative 3onthe social environment onthe Fort Belknap Indian Reservation would be significant and generally beneficial. Although some Native Americans residing on thereservation areemployed byZMI andwould be itspresence would bebeneficially affected astheclosure activities begin and themines ultimately are closed. This beneficial ofAlternative quality problems. Theimprovement maybesignificant tothose Native Americans whose concerns have centered upon access torelatively natural landwithin theLittleRocky Mountains inwater intheKings Creek drainage due tothe additional disturbance required tomine limestone for use inreclamation. 4.10.5.2 Cumulative Impacts Further mining attheZortman andLandusky mines would notbeallowed beyond that already permitted under Alternative 3,and theagencies believe the reasonably foreseeable opportunity forfuture mining would belimited. Therefore, nosignificant additional socioeconomic impacts would occur under Alternative 3 duetoreasonably foreseeable future actions. Interms ofemployment, thecumulative impact ofAlternative 3 Environmental of full- and part-time employment inPhillips County, 202 employment asdescribed in and reclamation oftheZortman andLandusky mines under Alternative 3would beunavoidable. Adverse impacts described above arelossofemployment andearnings, loss ofdirect tax revenues, adverse impacts to theagency-modified reclamation procedures. To areasonable degree, long-term productivity forwildlife habitat, grazing, and recreation would berestored. However, intheshort-run, more intensive economic productivity associated withmining 4.10.5.5 Irreversible orIrretrievable Resource Commitments No irreversible orirretrievable commitments of socioeconomic resources have been identified for Alternative 3. 4.10.6 Impacts from Alternative 4 4.10.6.1 Impacts Under Alternative 4(theCompany Action), theZortman andLandusky beexpanded andoperated foranadditional 7years before and closure activities begin. Implementation ofAlternative 4could begin asearly as 1996. Construction ofnew facilities would require substantial capital expenditure andemployment ofsome construction This isassumed expend similar expenditures. Closure activities areassumed tobegin intheyear2002 and lastthrough 2012, with final reclamation taking place in2006 and2007 andmonitoring occurring thereafter. The direct employment, payroll cuid expenditure associated withZMI's continued operations under Alternative 4arepresented inTable 4.10-1 through Table 4.10-3. During theextended mining sustain direct andindirect economic activity intheState ofMontana, inPhillips County and, toamuch lesser extent, inBlaine County. The additional employment andearnings generated asaresult would beasignificant benefit, especially when compared inmagnitude tothe effects ofthenoexpansion alternatives (Alternatives 1 through 3). Also, sustaining ZMI operations athistorical operating levels for7more years would have significant positive impacts onPhillips County and thecommunities of Malta andZortman interms offiscal conditions, community resources, and social well-being among its residents. Positive effects alsowould befelt inBlaine County. However, theywould besmall compared to existing conditions. Businesses elsewhere intheState of Montana would continue tobepositively affected over theextended lifeofZMI's operations, especially those inBillings andHelena which supply ZMI withgoods and services. Property values would besupported at present levels inPhillips County andespecially inthe communities ofMalta andZortman. Consumers who buy electricity from theBigFlat Electric Cooperative would continue tobenefit from thevolume anddemand- spreading discounts BigFlatearns from itssupplier by themines asacustomer. This effect would be concentrated inparts ofBigFlat's service area that rely disproportionately onelectric heat forhome heating because they lackaccess tonatural gas.These areas therural area ofPhillips County south ofMalta and around Regina, rural areas around Turner and Hogeland within Blaine County, andtheFortBelknap Indian Reservation. Oncertain occasions, ZMIwould allow employee wood gathering aslong asallState and Federal guidelines arefollowed (Eickerman 1993). TheState treasury would e\u00a3U\"n additional revenues for each year ofcontinued operation, apositive impact. Economic effects onthe Fort Belknap Indian Reservation would berelatively small, ifpositive, and there would beneficial conditions inthesocial environment in Malta andZortman, where mine employees and their families areperceived aspositive contributors to,andan integral part of,local social structures. 4onthesocial environment ontheFort Belknap Indian Reservation, atleastduring theextended mining phase, would besignificant and generally perceived asadverse. Although some Native Americans residing onthereservation areemployed byZMIand would benefit economically from theadditional years of employment andincome, many Native Americans who oppose themine andhave expressed ahigh level of concern about itspresence and itsimpact onthe environment. Their sense ofwell-being andevaluation of the quality of lifeonthe Fort Belknap Indian Reservation would continue tobeadversely affected during theextended mining phase before closure activities begin andthemines ultimately areclosed. Theeconomic impacts ofclosure under 1.Itispossible thatbydelaying closure under Alternative 4,the relative magnitude ofthe impacts maybesomewhat different because conditions maychange farther out inthefuture. However, this is notlikely since population andemployment projections available now forPhillips County indicate thatalmost no growth isanticipated forthecounty through theyear 2012. InBlaine County, where theavailable population andemployment projections indicate some growth is anticipated through theyear 2012, therelative impacts ofclosure would therefore beeven smaller under Alternative 4thanunder Alternative 1,because they would thebackdrop ofasomewhat 7.Under Alternative 4,ZMI's to2012 would cumulatively generate anadditional 5,000 job-years ofdirect and secondary employment and dollars ofdirect andsecondary earnings within theState aremore theemployment effects ofAlternative 1.During thesame period, Blaine overstated, asdescribed inSection 4.10.1.2. Although theone overall economic employment andincome for theeconomy asawhole forsome additional years, the alternative maysimultaneously adversely affect specific economic .sectors that depend onspending by recreationists attracted tothearea by itsrecreation resources. Recreation resources generate andincome andBlaine counties havebeen impacted impacts fora number ofyears andwould intensify them somewhat (see Section 4.7). Businesses inthe retail trade and services sectors oftheeconomy (e.g., eating and drinking places, lodging places, suppliers, andoutfitters) potentially would beaffected ifanadditional decline in thequality ofrecreation resources leads tofewer than expected hunters, campers, hikers, andsightseers using lands surrounding theZortman andLandusky mines. hkely tooccur, the economic repercussions ofthiseffect probably would be quite small. Nevertheless, theimpact represents the above, which isbased onthemining itself. Under Alternative 4,theexisting work force potentially would stay inplace foranadditional 7years, and because there would benosignificant change in employment level during thistime period, nochange would beexpected intotal community and school population, other than theaging andturnover consistent with thetrends described inSection 3.10. ZMIwould employ contract crews forconstruction of new facilities, including awater treatment plant, crusher, conveyor, andleach pad, aswell ascontract crews for fmal reclamation. Itisassumed Big Flat Electric Cooperative would employ acontracted crew for construction ofapower linebetween theZortman and Landusky mines. Contract employment would occur in 1996and1997and in2006and2007. Contractor employees would seektemporary housing in Zortman andwould tocommute weekly without their families. Accommodating thisdemand bemost difficult when permanent employment at themines isatfullstrength. Inaddition, there isa greater demand forhousing hunting season, to November. However, sufficient housing hasbeen available inthepast forcontract crews andwould probably beavailable when needed during the construction phases (Kalal 1994). Local jurisdictions inPhillips County would accumulate additional taxrevenues under Alternative 4.Revenue flowswould besustained foranadditional 7years, but average annual revenues would rapidly after 2001andwould disappear entirely after theconclusion ofallactivity atthemine site in2012. Under 4,additional ZMI's operations from 1996 to2012would accumulate forlocal jurisdictions. Projected amounts would bea cumulative total of$2.6million forPhillips County, $1.3 million fortheMalta High School andElementary combined, $1.1 million fortheDodson School District, and$730,000 onrevenues generated School District proceeds taxes, orabout 81 percent District received orabout 20percent oftotal budgeted revenues; Malta High School about $1.58,000, ofschool would also lose direct state aidandbudget capacity forevery student lost. The Phillips County HardRock Revenue Fund would potentially receive suinual distributions from stateMetal Mines License Tax receipts foranadditional 7years. Local school districts would alsoreceive about $16,000 annually per district inMetal Mines License Tax distributions foradditional years ofmining. Adistribution from the Phillips County Hard Rock Reserve would belimited initsability tomitigate impacts only onaone-time basis, while fiscal problems faced byeach jurisdiction would belong-term. The Phillips County Hard Rock Trust Reserve hadabalance ofabout $1 million in1994; under Alternative would bereleased forlocal use inrange oftheyears 2004 through 2006, depending on when mine employment potentially would drop to.50 percent oftheaverage forthepreceding 5years. At least one-third oftheprincipal and interest inthe tru.st reserve account mustbeallocated proportionally among affected school districts within thecounty. Assuming the minimum one-third ofthefunds areallocated, allthe affected school districts inPhillips County would proportionally share inanestimated total ofabout $530,000. Districts affected bytheclosure might include those inwhichZMI employees' school agechildren reside orattend school and districts where themines have been apart ofthetaxbase. After theschool district allocation, theremaining funds inthe trust reserve account maybeexpended directly byPhillips County. theCounty grants localgovernment units topayoffdebt, offset taxincreases caused bythemine shutdown, promote economic development, recruit or isretained bytheState.ZMI isprojected to continue paying metal mines Ucense taxes under Alternative 4through 2007. Under Alternative 4,the State would beprojected toaccumulate anadditional $4.5million inmetal mines license taxes, about 10times the total projected tobeaccumulated under Alternative 1. Under Alternative 4,costs forproviding services would continue atcurrent levels formost jurisdictions or2004,when layoffs would begin astheclosure cyclecommences attheZortman andLandusky mines. Until that time, facilities within thestudy area that presently are atcapacity would continue tooperate under some strain. These include Malta's water and wastewater utilities, schools inMalta, medical careand emergency-response providers inPhillips County, and schools Additional revenues accumulated during ZMI's additional 7years ofmining may provide sufficient fiscal resources toaccomplish some improvements forthePhillips County providers. Schools atHays andLodgepole, however, would not benefit because themine facilities arenottaxable school district.

Mine employees areamong thehighest remain active inlocal churches, civic service andeconomic development organizations, volunteer public safety andemergency services, and youth recreation programs. ZMI also directly donates funds which help tosustain orenhance theactivities of various educational, civic,and social organizations; this pattern potentially would continue. Traditional rural family values would continue tobesustained tosome extent inMalta and Phillips County byZMI's goverimients in Phillips County would continue tobeoffered atcurrent levels. Additional revenue flows willallow reduction of debt inMalta (Ereaux 1994).

Alternative 4also would positive affect retail trade andservice sectors in Malta, themain shopping center located inPhillips tothose described for PhiUips somany fewer ofBlaine County depend onthemines ofmine operation would represent sustained economic opportunity forthose Native Americans employed byZMIandothers whomaybenefit from the secondary economic effects ofZMI's operations. This is because, regardless ofeconomic issues, many Native Americans onthereservation oppose themines and have expressed ahigh Reservation Native American concerns about quality oflifereflect a distinctive social and cultural group's reaction tohow ZMI's presence and themines' effects upon the environment have affected social andcultural activities, sitesofcontemporary orheritage significance, lifestyles which depend onaccess, useand appreciation of relatively natural land within the Little Rocky Mountains, andtheusecmdappreciation ofstreams that drain portion oftheZortman andLandusky mining area and eventually enter the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. Although some Native Americans residing onthereservation areemployed byZMIand feelbetter offeconomically, expansion andbecause closure would asasignificant andgenerally adverse quality Indian Reservation, and within thestudy area as well, would benegative, even though some Native Americans, aswellassome inthenon-Native American community, would view thepredominantly positive economic the quality oflife.

Itis unlikely theadditional mining would leadZMI toadd employees, and additional spending would be proportionately small. Reasonably foreseeable exploration activity topossibly expand orereserves or further define existing reserves could toproposed spending levels under Alternative 4.Therefore, neither reasonably foreseeable development would materially change themagnitude or duration ofany ofthe impacts identified for Alternative 4. socioeconomic impact 4 mayberepresented over thepast 15years asmine employees have integrated intoandstrengthened local social structures.

Three types ofvehicle trips byworkers toandfrom truck trips associated materials; and truck trips associated with thehauling ofhazardous materials, such ascyanide and diesel fuel. These vehicle residents who liveadjacent tothose roads. In addition, internal mine truck traffic willbe duetopotential impacts (high, medium, orlow), traffic volumes experienced due toproject activities from 1979 -1994 mining activities, aswell asthose projected for thefuture under various project alternatives, willbecompared with theactual capacities of thehighways andlocal roads utilized. Based on theTransportation Research Board's Highwav Capacity Manual ,theproject areahighways are generally capable ofsupporting asmany as 5,700 trips perdaybefore driving conditions would become congested. Iftraffic volumes exceed this threshold, traffic congestion increases considerably. Similarly, the local roads used toaccess thecommunities of Zortman andLandusky traffic that ranges from 70 percent to100percent ofthese capacities would berated asmedium negative, impacts rangingfrom 1to70percent ofcapacity would berated aslownegative, andwhere traffic would not increase at allabove baseline conditions, impacts would berated asneutral. With respect toaccidents, actual numbers of accidents onstudy area highways willbe compared between theperiod before mining (1970s) andduring recent mining activities (1980s) toassess whether ornotaccidents and accident rates increased asaresult ofincreased traffic due tomining. For potential future accident calculation, the accident rate experienced during recent mining activities (1980-1989) willbeappHed toprojected future traffic under thevarious project numbers. Ifthecalculated number ofaccidents isgreater than50percent oftheannual average experienced during the recent mining phase, impacts would berated as high negative. Forincreases of25 -50percent, impacts would beratedmedium negative, and forincreases from 1-25percent, impacts would berated lownegative. Potential effects oftheproject alternatives on vehicle andpedestrian access tovarious parts of theLittleRocky Mountains, including theareas currently the extent ofthearea excluded from public access due toroad closures willbecompared between baseline (pre-1979) andthepresent andprojected future mining eras.Where project activities result in ofmajor areas inthesouthern Little Rocky Mountains orroads Forimpacts tolarge areas orwhere important road closures would occur, but mitigation could beapplied (permitted access onoccasions, alternative roads constructed), impacts would berated asmedium negative. Forclosures ofsmall areas, orwhere road closures donotaffect larger areas, orwhere alternative access roads areavailable, impacts would berated aslownegative. 4-241 Environmental Consequences Transportation ofhazardous materials toand from themines, and risks associated with potential accidents and spills . According totheMontana Highway Patrol and Montana Department ofTransportation, accident rates forhazardous material haul trips have notbeen calculated todate. Records on thenumber ofaccidents involving commercial vehicles hauling hazardous materials are available, however. Asanexample, there were atotal of14accidents involving commercial vehicles hauling hazardous materials in1993 in theentire State ofMontana (Montana Highway Patrol 1994). Unfortunately, theState does not track thetotalnumber ofhazardous material haul trips that taking place anaccident hkely tobehundreds ofthousands ofsuch haul trips (e.g., gasoline tankers supplying service stations statewide), onecan assume theaccident rate isverylow ingeneral. For theZortman andLandusky mines, no hazardous material hauling accidents occurred from 1979 to1994. Forassessing potential future impacts, projected hazardous materials haul trips for allalternatives willbecompared with thenumbers utilized bythemines from 1979 to1994. 4.11.2 Impacts From Mining, 1979 toPresent Impacts associated with recent mining activities are evaluated incomparison tothestudy areatransportation network as itexisted prior to1979. General traffic volume and accident datawere available from the Montana Department ofTransportation andMontana Highway Patrol andwere used forcomparison ofpre- associated withrecent mining operations. Traffic Aftercommencement ofpermitted mining activities in 1979, traffic volumes onstudy area roads increased considerably (Table 3.11-1). Specifically, average daily traffic(ADT) volumes increased from 1975 to 1980(Montana Department ofTransportation 1994, 1990, and 1991). These elevated traffic volumes havegenerally persisted throughout thepast 15years that mining prior thatcommuting mine workers added an average ofapproximately 100roundtrips per day, virtually every day, tothetransportation network from 1979 to1994. Similarly, truck traffic ofthisproject, experienced 1979 to 1994were fairly largewhen compared withpre-mining highways thatactually serve these highways haveoperated atlessthan one-fifth oftheir ofZortman andLandusky andthemines experienced traffic volumes farbelow their capacity values. Consequently, the increase intraffic volumes associated withrecent mining activities isconsidered tohave had thenumber ofaccidents andaccident rate onstudy area highways actually dropped after 1979, despite theincrease intraffic volumes (Table 3.11-1). 1989, a153percent increase intraffic volumes. Route 66and U.S. Highway 2also experienced reductions inaccidents inthe1980s, despite similar Various factors notrelated totraffic volume, including mayhave played arole areahadnoimpact accident rates inthestudy area. Public Access totheLittle Rocky Mountains One ofthemore pronounced impacts ofmining access andvehicle use ofroads inthecurrent mining areas were permitted and those areas were used foravariety ofrecreational and cultural purposes. Since 1979, theZortman Mine Access Road, theZortman toLandusky road, andthe Landusky Mine access roads havebeen closed tothe public forsafety reasons. Similarly, Mission Canyon closed theLandusky Mine, ashas theroad thatextends upAlder Gulch near theZortmjin Mine. Altogether, these road closures havehadahigh negative impact onthelocal transportation network as itrelates toaccess tothesouthern Little Rocky Mountains because theyhave effectively excluded access toaconsiderable portion ofthesouthern Little Rocky Mountains once available forpublic use.The impacts andcultural access toSaddle Butte, Goslin Gulch, andPonyGulch isstillavailable, although permission to cross Flats isrequired. Transportation ofHazardous Materials Asdescribed inSection 3.11, very transportation hazardous materials inthelocal project areaoccurred prior to1979. Commencement ofmining activities in theLittleRocky Mountains resulted inthetransport of large quantities ofchemical reagents, motor vehicle fuels, andother regulated hazardous materials toboth theZortman andLandusky mines. Although production rates atthetwomines varied from 1979 to1994, itis estimated that approximately 4,200 truck trips (roundtrips) peryearwere required tosupply themines with thematerials they needed. This transport of regulated hazardous materials created ariskofaccidents and potential releases ofhazardous materials. Fortunately, over the15year operating period, there werenoreported accidents associated with theproject invoKing thetransport ofhazardous materials.Transportation 4.11.3 Impacts From Alternative 1 Traffic Under Alternative 1,reclamation would bequickly completed attheZortman Mine (ending about 1998) and final mining, leaching, andreclamation would be completed attheLandusky Mine around theyear2000. Under projected employment conditions, this project scenario would result inroughly 95commuter roundtrips perday in1996andwould truck traffic tothemines would alsodiminish astheproductive lifeofthemines ends. Alternative 1 features the least intensive reclamation effort ofall project alternatives considered. Na truck trips associated withhauling materials would consist primarily ofreagents required forfinalheap leaching atthemines. After heap leaching iscompleted, decrease consist primarily ofgasoline anddiesel inreclamation relative torecent mining activities. As described inSection 4.11.2, the traffic volumes associated withmining operations would have negative impact onthetransportation network inthe areaduetotheabundance ofavailable roadand highway capacity attheZortman Mine 4-243 3nVIO o > a 6 3 u u>o c t 2 o ou a (J g 5o u a s oCmO CO s u ONo Vi U I o H <^ oa EdXU (/3 < e L. o Coo eq<ac T3W_o \"ao o I a I o. 5 J3 g I < < C/3 fO CQX r- tothetransportation system asawhole based rates fortheproject areahighways during thepeak period ofthe project. This would be impact. Residents ofthecommunities ofZortman andLandusky and their petswould to accidents during commute hours asmineworkers zirrive orleave during shift changes. Similarly, truck traffic through communities would alsocreate ariskof accidents. Thisincreased riskofaccidents isconsidered tobealownegative impact onthecommunities, volumes would bevery low. After closure oftheZortman andLandusky mines is completed, traffic volumes would diminish to approximately baseline orhistoric levels, resulting ina neutral impact over thelong-term. Public Access totheLittle Rocky Mountains With respect topubhc access tothesouthern Little Rocky Mountains, theNoAction Alternative would result inacontinuation ofthehigh negative impacts experienced from 1979 to1994 over theshort-term. Areas androads closed tothepublic would remain closed until final reclamation iscompleted around the endof2000. After closure ofthemines iscompleted, public access would berestored, andbaseline conditions would once again beexperienced with respect to transportation. Thus, over thelong-term, aneutral impact would beanticipated. Transportation ofHazardous Materials Transportation ofhazardous materials would continue foranadditional years theNoAction Alternative, withshipments tapering offafter themines gooutofproduction, leaching ofore ceases, and reclamation iscompleted (around 2000). Historically, there have been nodocumented accidents involving trucks transporting hazardous materials totheZortman andLandusky mines. Under this theduration alternative, theNoAction Alternative would have alow negative impact onlocal residents. After closure ofthe mines iscompleted, hazardous material dropback Thus, Alternative 1and post-closure. Since there areno reasonably foreseeable developments associated with this alternative, noadditional impacts havebeen identified forcumulative impacts discussion. 4.113.2 Unavoidable Adverse Restriction ofpublic access tothesouthern LittleRocky Mountains would beconsidered anunavoidable adverse impact. Thisimpact could notbemitigated because, by their nature, mining operations arehazardous and incompatible with public activities, such ashiking or hunting. Bynecessity, public access must berestricted from mining areas. Thisimpact would essentially bea continuation ofanexisting impact, dating back formining would not the long-term productivity ofthe transportation network. impacts would cease tooccur andthestudy areawould likely return tobaseline conditions with respect to transportation. 4.11.3.4 Irreversible orIrretrievable Resource Commitments With respect totransportation, this alternative would result innoirreversible orirretrievable resource commitments. Project areas roads andhighways would continue toexistandbeaccessible astheywere under baseline conditions prior to1979. 4-254 Transportation 4.11.4 Impacts From Alternative 2 Traffic Under Alternative 2.reclamation efforts would require considerably more hauling ofclay tobothmines than previously described forAlternative 1.These additional reclamation activities would also increase commute roundtrips bymine workers toasmall extent over the lifeofthealternative. Under projected thisproject of95trips perdaywould represent an increase above baseline (pre- 1979) conditions, buta decrease intraffic relative tothe1979 to1994mining period (which averaged 100roundtrips perday). AttheZortman reclamation include clay capping ofnumerous facilities thatwould notbe completed untilapproximately 1998. This claycapping truck trips (roundtrips) over the duration tripswould pitupSeven the community ofZortman andupthemine access road to theZortman Mine. Clay hauling out byconvoys of9-15 Caterpillar that8-10convoy roundtrips perdaywould be required over aperiod ofupto12daysfrom 1996 to 1998under Alternative 2. AttheLandusky Mine, reclamation would feature more extensive clay capping than described under Alternative 1.This additional capping would require a total of10,300 truck roundtrips over the5yearduration ofthealternative which would becompleted around the end of2000. These extend from Asdescribed primarily consist ofreagents required forheap leaching attheLandusky Mine. compared withanaverage of4,200 from 1979 to1994 (Figure 4.11-1). Despite thismodest increase, traffic volumes under thisalternative stillremain far below thecapacity ofthetransportation system inthe project areaandwould therefore have alownegative impact (Figure 4.11-2). Internal mine traffic associated with active mining and waste rock hauling would bethesame asdescribed for Alternative 1sincenoadditional orewould asawhole based andLandusky and their petswould besomewhat vulnerable to accidents during commute hours asmineworkers arrive orleave during shiftchanges. Moreover, truck convoys passing through those communities would alsocreate a risk ofaccidents. This increased risk adjacent presence ofchildren and other pedestrians.

Similarly, notbeaware thattruck traffic alsobecome ofclayhaulconvoys because traffic destined for thetown ofZortman and/or theminemerges there. After closure oftheZortman andLandusky mines is completed, traffic volumes would diminish to approximately baseline orhistoric levels, resulting ina neutral impact over thelong-term. Public Access totheLittle Rocky Mountains Asdescribed previously. Alternative 2would result ina continuation ofthehigh negative impacts experienced from 1979 to1994overtheshort-term. Areas androads closed tothepublic would remain closed until final reclamation iscompleted around theendof2000. After closure ofthemines iscompleted, public access andbaseline conditions would once again beexperienced withrespect totransportation. Over the long-term, impacts would bereduced toinsignificant.

Consequently, mine hauling oflimestone forreclamation purposes would alsoberequired. Under projected employment conditions, this project scenario would result inroughly 95commuter carwithconvoy speeds reduced to15mph astheypass through town. would include capping ofnumerous facilities thatwould notbe untilapproximately clay thecommunity berequired forhauling hazardous materials (five trips perdayorupto1,775 trips annually). These trips would primarily consist ofreagents required forheap leaching attheLandusky Mine. After leaching is completed, these tripswould decrease andwould consist primarily system area andwould therefore have alow negative impact (Figure 4.11-2). Internal mine traffic associated with active mining and waste rock hauling would bethesame asdescribed for Alternative 1,sincenoadditional orewould bemined. The hauling oflimestone forreclamation purposes would generate upto4,000 additional truck trips per year attheZortman Mine and9,000 trips peryear at theLandusky Mine. These tripswould notimpact the public transportation network, butcould impact wildlife andother resources, such asairquality due todust generation. With respect toaccidents, theaddition ofcommuter and trips system asawhole could accident peryear, based accidents related totruck convoys (upto150roundtrips or300one-way trips through town per day) is considered tobeamedium negative impact onthelocal communities, due tothe large sizeand lack of maneuverability Theuseofaleadcar reduction communities should reduce theriskofaccidents.Asdescribed previously, thepotential forincreased accidents could arise from additional truck traffic associated with hauling ofclay atcertain locations. These locations After closure oftheZortman andLandusky mines is completed, traffic volumes would diminish to approximately baseline orhistoric levels, resulting ina neutral impact over thelong-term. Public Access totheLittle Rocky Mountains Alternative 3would result inacontinuation ofthehigh negative impacts experienced from 1979 to1994over the short-term.

These locations include thejunction ofU.S.Highway Road. After closure oftheZortman andLandusky mines is completed, traffic volumes would diminish to approximately baseline orhistoric levels resulting ina neutral impact over thelong-term. Public Access totheLittle Rocky Mountains Due tocontinued closure ofthemining area portions of theLittle Rocky Mountains andassociated access roads. Alternative 4would result inacontinuation ofthehigh negative impacts experienced from 1979 to1994overthe short-term. Areas androads closed tothepublic would remain closed until final reclamation iscompleted around theendof2007. Inaddition. Alternative 4would also include construction and for transportation oforefrom theZortman Mine tothe Goslin FlatsHeap leach pad.

The riskof spills islower under this alternative relative toAlternative 5,which would feature extended heap leaching inUpper Alder Gulch, thereby requiring that allhazardous materials trips passthrough townand terminate atthemine. After closure ofthemines iscompleted, hazardous material haul tripswould drop back toextremely low baseline levels. Thus, over thelong-term, aneutral impact would beanticipated.4.11.6.1 Cumulative Impacts Asreasonably foreseeable actions, additional mining in PonyGulch intheZortman areaand attheLandusky Mine would result inadditional impacts, beyond those described forAlternative 4.Totheextent mining is extended bythese actions, traffic impacts similcU' to those described above would beextended aswell. Commuters, hazardous material useandhauling, and reclamation material hauling would continue toadd traffic tolocalandregional roads forthe lifeofthese actions. Asdescribed previously, thisimpact islow negative because local roads and regional highways would haveadequate capacity tosupport thisextended period ofadditional traffic, assuming traffic notsubstantially higher thandescribed forAlternative 4. Reclamation activities attheZortman Mine, foreseeable PonyGulch Mine, andtheLandusky Mine thatwould require hauling byconvoy through thelocal communities would impact during theduration ofhauling. Inaddition, thereasonably foreseeable action atPony almost certainly require closure ofPony Gulch tothepublic forsafety reasons. Closure of vehicle andpedestrian access toPonyGulch would be considered ahigh negative impact, asrecreational opportunities inandaround Pony Gulch would be adversely affected forthe lifeofthemine. The impacted israted ashighbecause PonyGulch would be oneofthefewremaining access points forthesouthern Little Rocky Mountains under Alternative 4. Cumulatively, andwithfewexceptions, closure ofthe Pony Gulch access road would result invirtual elimination ofvehicle access tothesouthern Little Rocky Mountains.

For theZortman Mine, hazardous material would bedirected primarily totheGoslin Flats leach padandprocessing plant forheap leaching activities. Additional mining atLandusky would require continued hauling ofhazardous materials through thetown of Landusky. Asdescribed previously, since thesmall risk ofaccidents and spills would remain along local and regional roads over theduration ofthis action, reasonably foreseeable mining attheZortman and Landusky mines would have alownegative impact on local residents.

These sites are allwithin theworking boundaries oftheTCP Historic District. Impacts from previous periods ofmining within theZortman and Landusky Project areas were existent prior to1979and carry over intothepresent period. Table 4.12-1 shows thattheexisting impacts forphysical, visual, andaural impacts associated with theZortman Mine siteare all high, yielding anoverall impact assessment ofhigh. Similarly, theexisting impacts forphysical, visual, and aural impacts associated with theLandusky Mine site are allhigh, yielding anoverall impact assessment of high.

Since 1979, there hasbeen additional disturbance to these areas and extensive new physical disturbance associated with Antoine Butte and Shell Butte (Zortman), andGoldBug Butte andMission Peak Asshown inTable 4.12-1, existing and aural impacts arealso significant, ranging from neutral tohigh, depending upon visibility anddistance frommining activities.Impacts toNative American cultural resources include impacts totheNational Register eligible TCP Historic District, individual cultural properties identified within the District, and theassociated traditional Native American values. Aslong asthemines continue to operate, these impacts remain asignificant andserious issue forNative American traditionalists. This conclusion follows from the literature review (see Section 3.12.3); comments from tribal members presented atthepublic scoping meeting fortheZortman Mine Expansion EISheld inLodgepole, Montana testimony ofVirgil McConnell before theState ofMontana (1990). Allof this information supports the perception to traditionalists thatmore sites and areas would be rendered unavailable, unacceptable, orlessdesirable with thecontinuation ofmining inthe Little Rocky Mountains. 4.12.3 Impacts from Alternative 1 Under theNoAction Alternative, there would beno expansion ateither theZortmam orLandusky mines.

The toxic effects ofhazardous materials used intheproject area vary considerably bymaterial. Exposure tocertain materials could cause severe injury orimmediate death inlowconcentrations, while materials spilled orreleased intotheenvironment. The following isadescription ofthetoxic hazards associated with each material used atthe Zortman jmdLandusky mines. Most ofthisinformation wasderived available inproject Operating Plans.

Mills were anddieselmayhave alsobeen mining inthe Little Rocky Mountains, andother information sources revealed no evidence that significant dumping, accidental spills or releases ofhazardous materials occurred prior to1979. Although spills orreleases ofhazardous materials may have occurred inthe noevidence ofsuch in1979. Water quality datafrom period ofcyanide or other hazardous materials inanyoftheproject area drainages. 4.14.4 Impacts From Mining 1979 to Present Two types ofgeneral impacts relating tohazardous materials haveoccurred attheZortman andLandusky mines during theperiod ofrecent mining activity. First, several cyanide heap leach padsandwaste rockdumps have residual hazardous materials andwastes present in them thatcannotbecompletely removed, detoxified, or cleaned up. Second, accidental releases orspills of cyanide solution andpetroleum hydrocarbons have occurred inthepast, asdescribed inSection 3.14.4. In general, these spills were responded toandcorrective measures were taken, although notalways inatimely enough fashion toprevent environmental degradation. Also, residual contamination mayremain over thelong- term. Routine mining operations inrecent years haveincluded theuseofcyanide solution forheap leaching onseveral heap leach pads and process circuits atboth the Zortman andLandusky mines. Although these cyanide solutions areneutralized andheap leach pads arerinsed attheendoftheir useful lives, residual cyanide may remain present inthepads thelongtermdueto blind-offs (zones inaccessible tosolution movement duetosettling oraccumulation offines) and/or preferential flow patterns that prevent uniform andcomplete removal ofcyanide from theleach padoremass. Studies conducted during 1990 indicate thepotential for retained cyanide inheaps after rinsing tobeminimal (Schafer 1991). Similarly, various chemical reagents used tocontrol thechemistry ofcyanide solutions or maintain pumps, lines (e.g., anti- sealants) have alsobeen applied totheheap leach pads, which may retain these materials ifrinsing isnot completely effective. Various wastes disposed of specifically ontheZortman 89pad,such aslaboratory rinses, fume scrubber runoff, reagent residues from dumped reagent containers, andwater treatment plant metal hydroxide sludge (2,000 tonsperyear)may also persist intheleach padtotheextent rinsing does Inthecase ofmetal sludge, there isalso thepotential that rock thatcould form within theleach pad in thefuture could remobilize these metals. Blasting oforeandwaste rock inthemine pits is accomplished usmgANFO, which isamixture of ammonium nitrate andother aquatic plants, and athigher concentrations, cancause health problems inhuman populations and wildlife. As inSection 3.2and 4.2,elevated nitrate levels havebeen observed indrainages inthestudy area. Itis quite possible that these elevated levels aredue to runoff ofnitrate residues present inwaste rockand possibly reclaimed (and perforated) leach pads. Reclamation ofheap leach padsandwaste rockdumps attheZortman andLandusky mines would include reclamation covers thatshould substantially reduce the amount ofinfiltration thatwould occur, thereby reducing theamount ofleachate generated. This subject willbe discussed further insubsequent sections. thatresidual metals, cyanide compounds, prevent release ofthese materials tosurface water bodies andtheenvironment. Residual cyanide compounds maybreakdown within the 4-288 Hazardous Materials leach padsonihcirown, despite lessthan 100percent effective rinsing. Thisbreakdown would occur more quickly ifthepHofresidual solution orleachate is neutral oracidic, since cyanide canonly persist in alkaline conditions (pH greater than 9).Given the potential fortheformation ofacid rock drainage in spent orewithin theleach pads, residual cyanide within thepadsmaybeneutralized before disposal (LAD) ofneutralized cyanide solution. Solutions disposed in thismanner must have cyanide concentrations ator below 0.22mg/1WAD. tounusually high received atthemine siteandtherelated generation of considerable excess solution intheleach pads. The solution was neutralized with calcium hypochlorite before LAD. Approximately 20million gallons of neutralized solution were disposed on17acres ofLAD area. Although LAD practice, and soils aretested forattenuation capacity beforeLAD ispermitted, treated cyanide solution was detected insurface and alluvial groundwater inAlder Gulch because steep slopes andhigh application rates caused thesolution torunofftheLAD area intothe gulch. LAD, totalcyanide levels Gulch peaked at0.48mg/l anddiminished notbeen confirmed. Noother routine mining operations oractivities have been identified thatwould result intherelease of hazardous materials into theenvironment. Based on review ofavailable reports anddocuments jmdother information provided Zortman and Landusky mines were completely consumed, with nowaste products generated, or eventually degraded with noapparent significantenvironmental ofsuchconsumption and cyanide, the overwhelming majority ofwhich isdegraded in contained facilities through dilution (rinsing) andother natural processes. Afewexamples ofresidual hazardous wastes remain, including waste oiland lubricants, spent citrus-based solvents, andcupels and slagfrom theassay laband refinery. These wastes are disposed inaccordance with stateandfederal regulations atapproved facilities. Asecond source ofimpact related tohazardous material usehasresulted from accidental spills orreleases of cyanide solution from heap leaching facilities. As described inSection 3.14, sixaccidental spills orreleases ofcyanide solution occurred between four One release from theZortman (onNovember 1,1982) contaminated thewater supply system forthetown of Zortman, which was replaced byanother source. Another release from theZortman Mine (October 1987) entered Ruby Gulch andwas neutralized toalarge extent with calcium hypochlorite, although Gulch in Accidental solution from similarly impacted MillandMontana gulches. ofthese gulches September 1993) near theprocessing plant andoneprocess pond. At leastone ofthese spillsmayhave exceeded several thousand gallons. Although pumping of this groundwater was initiated, itisunlikely allofthe cyanide solution canberecovered. tocompletely clean upthese spills, these incidents were rated ashaving high negative impacts, though no domestic water supply orsurface waters were affected. Asmentioned previously, given theinstabihty ofcyanide, itispossible thataccidentally spilled cyanide solutions may degrade quickly and naturally and thatwater resources may notbeimpacted over thelong-term or offsite. However, since thetiming andextent ofthis degradation cannot bepredicted with occurred attheZortman September 1991. This release waseffectively cleaned up tothesatisfaction oftheMontana Department ofHejilth andEnvironmental Sciences. this possibility. Asdescribed inChapter 3.14, virtually all hazardous materials and wastes are stored on containment facilities orabove concrete surfaces, where complete and effective clean upofspills canbe achieved. Given thatnoinformation onadditional spills oraccidents hasbeen reported, that virtually all hazardous materials and wastes are stored on containment structures orsurfaces, and thatmine personnel aretrained have been identified attheZortman and Landusky mines. 4.14.5 Impacts From Alternative 1 Alternative 1would involve little additional mining or heap leaching inthefuture asremaining permitted ore attheLandusky Mine would allpermitted oreattheZortman Mine wasexhausted in1990,noadditional mining would occur attheZortman operation under this alternative. Continued mining foranother year atLandusky, along withassociated heap leaching ofthatore,aswellasfinal reclamation thatwould take place atbothmines would require continued useofthevarious hazardous materials until finalreclamation iscompleted. FortheZortman Mine, useofhazardous materials would continue until about theendof1997. FortheLandusky Mine, use would continue until theendof2000. Under Alternative 1,nonew leach pads, waste rock dumps orrepositories, orother relevant facilities would beconstructed. Thus, the locations andstorage Alternative 1would besimilar tothose described forrecent mining. Cyanide heap leaching foranadditional three tofour years attheLandusky Mine AttheZortman Mine, butdisposal oflabrinses, fume scrubber runoff, crushed reagent containers, andwater treatment plant sludge would continue inthe89leachpadforanadditional two years, untilreclamation ofthat facility around late1997 or1998. After that, treatment plant sludge would be deposited inalined holding pond thatwould becapped after treatment plant closure. Lab rinses, scrubber runoff andreagent containers would notbegenerated after mine closure. Asdescribed inSection 4.14.4, residual cyanide solution andother compounds may remain inailoftheleach pads due toincomplete rinsing. Similarly, residual nitrates from blasting may remain intheleach padsandwaste dumps. Asforthe 89leach pad, continued disposal oftreatment plant sludge, labrinses, fume scrubber runoff, andreagent containers would contribute additional opportunity for long-term contamination oftheoremass contained in theleach pad, should final rinsing bemeffective at completely removing, neutredizing, or at least substantially diluting those materials. Thecontinued active leaching attheLandusky Mineonthe87/91 and91leach padswould increase the thatmaycontain other hazardous materials/reagents. Asdescribed geochemical testing ofspent ore has within thereclaimed leach pads. Assuming thisoccurs, cyanide solution be neutralized byacidic leachate asthese materials drain andmixwithin theleach pads. Conversely, residual cyanide solution, which isalkaline, could neutralize some oftheacid rock drainage aswell. Ingeneral, as described inSection 4.2.1.3, anticipated water quality from leach pads would include alkaline pHs (with residual cyanide present) intheimmediate short-term after reclamation, followed byincreased acidity over time react, thereby neutralizing residual cyanide inleachate. Theextent intotheenvironment viasurface water andgroundwater transport onthe effectiveness of reclamation capping andwater capture andtreatment. Effective reclamation capping would minimize infiltration ofwater thatcould liberate and/or react with hazardous materials andform contaminated leachate. 4-290 Hazardous Materials Effective water capture andtreatment would minimize the opportunity forcontaminated leachate from impacting water resources downstream ofthemine sites. Athorough evaluation ofreclamation capping andwater capture andtreatment measures hasbeen presented in Section 4.2. Based onthat evaluation, reclamation covers under Alternative 1would haveminimal effect on reducing infiltration andwould notimprove water quality above present levels. Water capture and treatment would likely have tocontinue inthelong- term. Totheextent leachate from reclaimed facilities contains materials orcompounds, the discharge ofthat leachate isconsidered tohave a negative impact. Capture and treatment of contaminated leachate would mitigate impacts downstream, however. Another routine ornormal waste disposal practice under thisalternative would betheland application disposal (LAD) ofneutralized cyanide solution. LAD would most likely occur attheendofmine life,assuming no emergency LADs would ofsoil intheLAD area to cyanide and metals. Assuming LAD is performed properly, neutralized cyanide solution and metals should notimpact soilorwater resources. If performed improperly, LAD would negatively impact soilandwater resources because cyanide and/or metals concentrations would notbeeffectively attenuated bythe soil. Improper LAD canoccur ifneutralization of cyanide prior toapplication isineffective (solution applied tosoilhasahighcyanide that soil cannot attenuate) and/or appHcation ofsolution occurs atexcessive rates (which could result inrunoff of solution intoadjacent surface water resources). Under such conditions, ofhazardous theenvironmental impacts of such depend materials released, thequantity released, andwhere therelease were tooccur and thenature and timing ofthe response. Potential releases could range from a10 gallon spill ofdiesel fuel inthefueling area that is immediately andeffectively cleaned up,toacatastrophic release of50,000 gallons ofcyanide solution into a surface water drainage. Ingeneral, thehazardous materials ofgreatest concern would beliquid fuelsandcyanide. Liquid fuels such asgasoline and diesel are used and stored inlarge quantities. Cyanide isof concern because itishighly toxic, used inlarge quantities, hasawide distribution ofuse atthemine sites (leach pads, ponds, pipelines, process plants), and problems haveoccurred with spills oraccidental releases ofcyanide solution inthepast. waste rock attheLandusky Mine, hauling ofreclamation materials, capping and diesel or gasoline could killvegetation ifreleased inavegetated area (e.g., truck crashes into forest, overturns and spills fuel), impact surface water quality, andharm aquatic organisms (ifspilled intoacreek), impact groundwater resources, and/or ignite andcause afire that either burns mine facilities orcauses aforest Cyanide itsuse iswidely distributed atthemine sites in various heap leach pads, solution ponds, andtreatment plants, with associated networks ofpipelines connecting these facilities. Unlike other hazardous materials, which arestored andused inlimited locations, thenumber and size of facilities containing cyanide solution are extensive, thereby increasing thenumber oflocations where spills orreleases could occur. Potential releases inthefuture occur asaresult offailure ofa facility, such asaleak inaleach padorpond liner, or bursting ofasolution pipeline onanunlined surface. In addition, accidental spills orreleases could occur asthe ofhuman error, such asthedraining ofaspray lineonanunlined surface. Ifspilled oraccidentally released, cyanide solutions could cause wildlife mortality, impact surface water quality, harm aquatic organisms (if spilled intoacreek), orimpact groundwater resources. The release ofhydrogen cyanide gaswould beof greatest concern tomineworkers responding tothespill, since thelocations where occur aregenerally Consequences stored inoronlinedheap leach pads orsolution ponds tominimize the potential for release into the environment. Inaddition, mine personnel aretrained in emergency response and spillcontainment practices. Forpotential future spills ofsolution thatwould enter a surface water drainage, ZMI's Cyanide SpillContingency Plan calls fortemporarily orleach pads. Downstream surface andgroundwater monitoring siteswould be sampled and analyzed for possible cyanide contamination toconfirm that the spillhadbeen contained andimpacts minimized. For spills orreleases togroundwater, pump back operations would be initiated andrecovered solution would berouted to contained facilities. Ifrecovery isincomplete, or ofcontamination issuspected, wells recovery ofsolution solutions, andmonitoring of groundwater conditions. Thecombination ofcontsdned storage andemergency preparedness would minimize the chance ofanaccidental spill or release. Nevertheless, given that spills haveoccurred inthepast atthese mines andother cyanide leach arelease inthefuture isnotzero. Depending onthematerial released, thequantity and the response, themagnitude oftheassociated impacts may varyandcould behighandnegative. Since thepotential impacts associated with accidental spills orreleases of hazardous materials vary considerably andcannot be predicted with certainty, noimpact rating assigned. Other hazardous materials used attheZortman and Landusky mines such ashydrochloric acid, sodium materials impacts associated with pastandcurrent use ofhazardous spent oreheaps within decommissioned leach pads atboth mines. Residual cyanide solution, aswellasother process chemicals mayremainintheoreheaps duetoineffective rinsing and neutralization over the long-term. Approximately 20million tons ofspent ore would remain within decommissioned leach pads attheZortman Mine, and115million tons would remain inleach pads attheLandusky Mine. Potential infiltration intothese heaps could contact and mobilize these residual hazardous compounds, which could thenbe released into the soilandwater resources through perforations inleach pad liners. Contamination ofwater resources with hazardous materials could negatively impact vegetation and should contaminated water andhuman populations should wells orother domestic water supplies be affected. However, capture andtreatment of contaminated water would eliminate these impacts. Land apphcation disposal (LAD) ofcyanide solution inthe past contaminated water resources inAlder Gulch. FutureLAD under Alternative 1could also negatively impact soil andwater resources intheGoslin Flats area. Impacts could arise from ineffective neutralization ofcyanide prior toapplication andapplication ofsolution atexcessive Atleast sixseparate spills oraccidental solution have occurred since 1979. Asaresult, cyanide hasbeen detected in surface andgroundwater resources inRuby theZortman Mine and MillandMontana below theLandusky Mine. Past cyanide contamination inAlder Gulch hasbeen significant enough towarrant closure and replacement ofthetown of Zortman's water supply. 4.14.5.2 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts Past spills orreleases ofcyanide solutions thathave contaminated surface andgroundwater resources may prove difficult, ifnotinfeasible toremediate. Although natural processes maydegrade spilled cyanide solution over time, itisunclear whether ornot this natural degradation would occur before contamination migrates offsite. Efforts toneutralize and/or pump groundwater contaminated with cyanide solution havehad limited success todate. Future accidental spills orreleases of cyanide solutions could increase thisimpact, ifsuch 4-292 Hazardous Materials releases were similarly difficult totreat, capture, or otherwise neutralize. Potential future contamination ofwater resources from leach padsandwaste rockdumps draining hazardous leachate would only be avoidable through oflong-term monitoring, treatment ofdrainage/leachate. 4.14.5J Short-term Use/Long-term Productivity Thegeneration ofleachate from reclaimed leach pads that contains residual cyanide, metals, and other reagents could cause long-term negative impacts to surface andground water resources, vegetation and wildlife downstream ofthepermit area. Mitigation in theform ofmonitoring, andtreatment of constitute anirreversible and irretrievable lossofthose resource commitments. 4.14.6 Impacts From Alternative 2 Alternative 2would involve noadditional mining as described forAlternative 1.Theprimary difference for Alternative 2relates tothereclamation measures. Since more intensive reclamation covers would beused, the effectiveness ofreclamation as itrelates topotential haizardous materials impacts would increase. Under Alternative 2,nonew leach pads, waste rock dumps orrepositories, orother relevant facilities would beconstructed. Thus, andstorage disposal practices, thepotential forresidual hazardous materials inreclaimed leach padsandwaste rock repositories to react with infiltrating water butover thelonger generation would besimilar tothatexperienced forAlternative 1.Aside from short term reduction of associated withAlternative 2 would thesame asdescribed forAlternative 1andlong- term water capture LADwould likely occur notimpact LAD ifneutralization of cyanide prior toapplication isineffective (solution applied tosoilhasahighcyanide concentration that soil cannot attenuate) and/or application ofsolution occurs atexcessive rates (which could result inrunoff of solution intoadjacent surface water resources). Under such conditions, vegetation would belostand/or would failtoreestablish afterLAD and ofsuch fuelandgasoline would beused ingreater quantities under Alternative 2duetomore intensive reclamation capping, thepotential foran accidental release isincreased tosome extent.

Theprimary difference would relate totheuseofaclay 4-293 Environmental Consequences mine inSection 4.14.6, theproposed claycap is expected toreduce infiltration and subsequent generation ofleachate from leach pads over theshort term. However, thecap isexpected todegrade over tobesimilar tothat expected forAlternative 1. 4.14.6.2 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts Unavoidable adverse impacts would bethesame as described forAlternative 1. 4.14.6.3 Short-term Alternative 3 Theprimary difference forAlternative 3relates tothe agency mitigated reclamation measures. Since more intensive reclamation covers would beused, relative to Alternatives 1or2,theeffectiveness ofreclamation as itrelates topotential hazardous materials impacts would increase toaconsiderable extent. Inaddition, since this alternative would include hauling andplacement of considerably more clay for reclamation, the use/consumption ofdiesel fuel, gasoline, oiland lubricants, and antifreeze would increase, relative to Alternatives 1or2. The locations ofhazardous material use,handling, and storage would hazardous materials inreclaimed leach padsandwaste rock repositories to react with infiltrating water andleave thefacility would bereduced toalarge extent bymore both clayandcapillary break layers onvirtually allmine facilities. Based on infiltration modeling described inSection 4.2.5, therecleunation covers would bemost effective at minimizing infiltration, and therefore, potential generation ofleachate contaminated with hazardous materials. Inaddition, leach pad liners would notbe perforated until water quality management objectives have been met foraperiod often years. The combination ofmore effective reclamation capping, along withextensive leachate monitoring ofwater quality forleach pads, notimpact prior isineffective (solution appUed tosoilhasahighcyanide that soil cannot attenuate) and/or application ofsolution occurs atexcessive rates (which could result inrunoff of solution intoadjacent surface water resources). Under such conditions, vegetation would belostand/or would failtoreestablish afterLAD and ofsuch would solution. Since diesel fueland gasoline would beused ingreater quantities Alternative 2due toevenmore intensive reclamation, thepotential foranaccidental release isincreased to some extent.

Since there areno reasonably foreseeable future actions associated with this 4-294 Hazardous Materials alternative, noadditional impacts havebeen identiHed forcumulative impacts discussion. 4.14.7.2 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts Unavoidable adverse impacts would bethesame as described forAlternative 1. 4.14.7.3 Short-term asdescribed forAlternative 1. 4.14.8 Impacts From Alternative 4 Continued mining attheZortman andLandusky operations, along with associated heap leaching ofore, andextensive reclamation thatwould takeplace atboth mines would require under thisalternative is presented inSection 2.8. AttheZortman Mine, proposed heap leaching feature ofthisalternative is therelocation oftheentire cyanide solution circuit and related hazardous materials toGoslin Flats adjacent to theleach pad. Aside from cyanide solution, lime, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, smti attheGoslin Flats leach padand processing plant complex almost exclusively after final rinsing oftheZortman 89padandremoval ofcyanide solution from theZortman process ponds arecompleted (around Reclamation oftheolder leach padsand process-related facilities (ponds, pipelines, Merrill- Crowe Plant, etc.) attheZortman Mine would be carried outover the firstfewyears ofthisalternative. With afew exceptions (vehicle fuels, ammonium nitrate), this ofheap leaching andmetal extraction activities shifts thefocus hazardousmaterials-related impacts (routine oraccidental) may occur toGoslin Flats. AttheLandusky Mine, solution ponds andprocessing plants would remain atthesame locations. Thus, the locations ofuse, storage, andhandling ofhazardous materials would notchange. Additional mining would merely continue existing hazardous material use,both in terms oflocation andquantity forabout leach activities atthe Zortman Mine would proceed forapproximately seven years after construction oftheGoslin Flats leach pad, conveyor, andCarter Gulch waste rock repository were completed. The89leach padwould berinsed and reclaimed, along with theother Newheap ofthe89 leachpad iscompleted, metal hydroxide water of pad,along leach pads inmost cases, and the likelihood of significant retention ofcyanide solution and other hazardous materials islow.The potential forpresence ofresidual hazardous materials intheleachpadmustbe considered after rinsing, however, given that rinsing is notalways completely effective andtheimpacts generation ofacid rock drainage islikely within the reclaimed leach pads. Assuming thisoccurs, itislikely that residual cyanide solution would beneutralized by acidic leachate asthese materials drain andmixwithin theleach pads. Conversely, residual cyanide solution, which isalkaline, some oftheacidrock drainage aswell. Ingeneral, asdescribed inSection Environmental water quality from leach padswould include alkaline pHs (with residual cyanide potentially present) intheshort-term after reclamation, followed by increased acidity over time asremnant sulfides react, thereby neutralizing residual cyanide inleachate. Although cyanide would beneutralized byacid rock drainage intheleachate, other hazardous materials, such asacid andcould become evenmore soluble Theextent thatresidual hazardous materials within the leach pads andwaste rock repositories mobilize and escape into theenvironment viasurface water and groundwater transport would depend on the effectiveness ofreclamation capping andwater capture andtreatment. Effective reclamation capping would minimize infiltration ofwater thatcould liberate and/or react withhazardous materials hasbeen presented inSection 4.2. Based onthat evaluation, reclamation covers under Alternative 4would have less than thedesired effect atreducing infiltration intothe lead pads.Asaresult, infiltration mayovertime react and generate contaminated leachate. Totheextent leachate from thereclaimed leachate could occur attheolder Zortman leach pads, leach pad,andatthewaste rock repositories along withanyoftheleach pads orwaste rock repositories at theLandusky Mine. Since Alternative increase thenumber ofleach padsandwaste rock repositories, increase thevolume ofore that could contaminated with cyanide orhazardous material residues, andintroduces thisimpact toanew location (Goslin Flats), themagnitude and distribution ofthis potential impact would begreater than described for Alternatives 1through 3. LAD would occur attheendofmine life. Forthe area toattenuate cyanide andmetals hasbeen completed. Neutralized cyanide solution and metals should not impact soil, water resources, vegetation, orwildlife. Improper LAD canoccur if neutralization ofcyanide prior toapplication is ineffective (solution applied tosoilhasahigh cyanideconcentration that soil cannot attenuate) and/or application ofsolution occurs atexcessive rates (which could result inrunoff ofsolution intoadjacent surface water resources). Under such conditions, vegetation would failtoreestablish afterLAD and wildlife could belost ifexposed totoxic levels of cyanide and/or metals insoilorsurface water. fuelandgasoline would continue tobeused ofreclamation orgasoline could killvegetation if released inavegetated area (e.g., truck crashes into forest, overturns and spills itsfuel), impact surface water quality andharm aquatic organisms (ifspilled intoa creek), impact groundwater resources ifaspillmigrates crusher area, andwaste rock cyanide beof greatest concern tomineworkers responding tothe spill, since thelocations where spills could occur aregenerally removed from populated aregenerally stored inoronlinedheap leach pads orsolution ponds tominimize the potential for release into the environment.

Forpotential future spills ofsolution thatwould enter a surface water drainage, ZMI's Cyanide SpillContingency Downstream surface andgroundwater monitoring siteswould be sampled and analyzed for possible cyanide contamination toconfirm that the spill hadbeen contained andimpacts minimized.

The potential forspills orrelease ofcyanide solution would beincluded locations past. ofmine lifewould another year, thereby extending theperiod ofriskthatanaccident orrelease could occur. Other hazardous materials used attheZortman oftherelatively limited quantities used, the limited distribution ofuse (e.g. refinery only), and substantial containment provided atstorage locations, these materials are ofless concern because the likelihood ofarelease totheenvironment is considerably smaller. 4.14.8.1 Cumulative Impacts Zortman Mine -Cumulative impacts would consist of thecombination ofimpacts from 1979 tothepresent, theproposed activities under Alternative 4,andimpacts from reasonably foreseeable future actions. Impacts from 1979 topresent andAlternative 4were discussed previously. Forreasonably totheZortman Minewould months. The additional 2million tons oforewould alsobeleached ontheGoslin Flats leach pad, thereby increasing the totalmass oforethatcould contain residual cyanide solution and other hazardous materials byabout 2 percent. Additional heap leaching attheGoslin Flat hazardous material could occur.

Theuseofawater treatment plant atLandusky would result undetermined quantities. isthecase would likely thatcould with metals. Effective reclamation capping ofthat leach padwould limit infiltration and potential mobilization ofmetals, although capture andtreatment ofleachate maybe required. Insummary, theaddition ofhazardous materials andtheperiod thatanaccidental spill orrelease could occur. Reasonably foreseeable future actions would increase thevolume ofspent ore that could contain hazardous material residues and thereby increase theamount and sources of contaminated leachate (possible new leach pad at Landusky), should reclamation capping beineffective. 4.14.8.2 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts Past spills orreleases ofcyanide solutions thathave contaminated surface andgroundwater resources may prove difficult, ifnotinfeasible toremediate. Although natural processes maydegrade spilled cyanide solution 4-297 Environmental Consequences over time, itisunclear whether ornot thisnatural degradation would occur before contamination were migrate offsite. Efforts toneutralize and/or pump groundwater contaminated with cyanide solution have hadlimited success todate. Future accidental spills or releases ofcyanide solutions could increase thisimpact, ifsuch releases were similarly difficult totreat, capture, orotherwise neutralize. Potentid future contamination ofwater resources from leach pads and waste rock repositories draining hazardous leachate would onlybeavoidable through implementation oflong-term monitoring, collection, and treatment ofdrainage/leachate, should reclamation capping prove ineffective. 4.14.8.3 Short-term Use/Long-term Productivity Thegeneration ofleachate from reclaimed leach pads that contains residual cyanide, metals, and other reagents thatcould result frommining inthestudy area over theshort-term could cause long-term negative impacts towater resources, vegetation and wildlife downstream ofthepermit that are made from non-renewable resources, such asgasoline and diesel fuel,would constitute anirreversible and irretrievable lossofthose resource commitment. 4.14.9 Impacts From Alternative 5 Use ofhazardous materials would continue atboth mines until finalreclamation werecompleted end of2007 theend outattheUpper Alder Gulch Leach Pad, with the rest ofthecyanide solution circuit remaining initscurrent place. Asaresult, thestorage, handling anduseofhazardous leach activities atthe Zortman Mine would proceed forapproximately seven years after construction oftheUpper Alder Gulch leach padandCarter Gulch waste rock repository were completed. After reclamation ofthe89leach pad,metal hydroxide water treatment plant sludge, laboratory rinses, fume reagent containers drainage may form inleachate produced inthese leach pads, residual cyanide solution maybeneutralized within before cyanide, accelerate themobilization ofmetals andother hazardous compounds.

Inaddition, monitoring of leachate contamination would rinsing, objectives for10years before liner perforation could beperformed. Thecombination of more effective reclamation covers, along with extensive leachate monitoring and water quality objective compliance forleach pads should greatly reduce the potential forrelease ofcontaminated leachate inthe future, relative toAlternative 4.

This appendix summarizes the technical approaches ofaplan Improvement Plan Bureau) andtheBLM. Theplanhasbeen byBLM andHRB from water quality improvement measures proposed byZMI, and after consultation withEPAandtheMontana Water Quality Division. TheBLM utility ofmined lands withadjacent lands as required bytheMontana Metal Mine Reclamation ofHealth and Environmental Sciences), have filed civillawsuits against ZMI and itsparent corporation, Pegasus Gold Corporation, wastewaters attheZortman andLandusky Act and theState ofMontana Water Quality Act. The United inthe civil lawsuits. Additional, alternate or supplemental measures, beyond those required byBLM andHRB,may result from settlement orlitigation. The more restrictive (protective) measures would ultimately berequired.1.1RELATION TODRAFT EIS ALTERNATIVES The facility construction jmdmonitoring requirements summarized inthisappendix, while based onthe existing mine facilities, areactions common inthisDraft oneofthemine capture would bebuilt to accommodate mine facilities. Thissummary emphasizes: Water oftheImprovement ofwater andpractices forachieving water quality Monitoring requirements andother data collection activities; and, Schedule forconstructing water management facihties andimplementing monitoring practices. 1.2IMPROVEMENT PLAN OBJECTIVES Theobjectives ofthisWater Quality Improvement Plan are toprevent unnecessary orundue degradation of federal lands asrequired bytheFLPMA and toachieve comparable stability and utility ofmined lands with adjacent lands asrequired bytheMMRA. Measures to improve andmaintain water quality areanintegral these guidelines forore mining anddressing BAT (Best Available Technology Economically Achievable, 40CFR 440) water quality standards and finalcompliance withMontana Pollution Discharge Elimination System (MPDES) water quality effluent limits, andtheClean Water Act, inaccordance with aspecific schedule. Thework required would fall intothree general categories: A-1 Appendix A Water management andtreatment practices for improving water quality; Water quality monitoring; and Determination ofpre-ZMI mining water quality andcollection ofdata insupport ofwater quality permit effluent limits. 1.3REQUIRED ENGINEERING PLANS Upon approval bytheregulatory agencies oftheoverall plans andconcepts intheWater Quality Improvement Plan detailed byZMI. Qutdity Storm Water Management Plan forZortman andLandusky Mine Sites; and Work Plans Supporting MPDES Permit fortheZortman andLandusky Mine SiteDrainages. 2.0WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN Based onthehydrogeologic conditions attheZortman and Landusky sites (see Chapter 3), theWater Management Planprovides abasis forsegregating various waters, andidentifying which waters could bemanaged with sediment anderosion control practices andwhich waters would require capture andtreatment. 2.1WATER MANAGEMENT ZONES Waters types ofwaters atthemine sites, thefollowing would beachieved: Areas contribute toeach drainage diversion/discharge aredelineated. Areas producing poor quahty discharge (mine drainage) are delineated from ju^eas of relatively good quality discharge (storm water).Water quality management requirements which best fiteachwater classification areidentified. beclassified within oneofthese three types ofwatermanagement areshown oftheWater Management datawere used tocomplete a foreachZortman andLandusky ispresented foranannual time period, andtherefore assumes nochange instored water within each drainage. Since thewater balance uses annually averaged input andoutput values, thewater balance does not affect thedesign capacity ofwater management facilities proposed inthisplan. Instead, the design capacity isbased onshort intense storm events such asthe10-year 24-hour storm. The results ofthewater balance areshown year). Table A-2(dryyear) andTable A-3(wet year). Asthese tables indicate, groundwater outflow from each basin ishighly variable depending onhydrologic conditions. This indicates thatestimates ofgroundwater discharge arefairly sensitive tovariations inprecipitation, evapotranspiration and surface runoff estimates. For example, during anaverage year, precipitation estimates inRuby Gulch varyby20million gallons (from 120to 140million gallons), surface runoff estimates varyby13 million gallons (from 1.1to14million gallons) and evapotranspiration estimates varyby20million gallons (from 100 to120 million gallons). However, groundwater varies over arange of39million gallons\u2014a substantially larger range than theother hydrologic variables inthewater balance. Also, note thatuseofawater netinflow ofgroundwater tosome basins forsome hydrological scenarios. Since thedrainage have been selected tocorrespond to topographic boundaries, thewater balance illustrated aregroundwater boundaries andthere Water Quality PlanSummary 3.0WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLAN Theproposed facilities andpractices arebased onsite specific conditions ineach drainage. Figures andtables identifying each discharge and theassociated water management practice(s) follow thetext. The water management practices are established technologies toreduce oreliminate thedischarge of impacted water. When fiilly implemented, thewater management practices would improve water quality in affected drainages with theperformance criteria of achieving compliance with final jjermit effluent limits. Improvements inwater quality would bemonitored in accordance with theprocedures inSection 4. While sitespecific plans vary, thegeneralized plan for improving water quality isto: Segregate good quality water originating instorm water management zones frompoor quality water originating inmine drainage zones orseeps; Treat surface water runoff instorm water management zones through BestManagement Practices (BMPs); Apply BMPs inmine drainage water management zones where appropriate toaugment mine drainage water capture and treatment facilities byreducing sedimentation incapture systems; and Capture allpoor quality surface water and alluvial groundwater from mine drainage or stormwater management zones and treat this water inorder tomeet applicable water quality standards. 3.1WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT OBJECTIVES The goal isforZMI toachieve compliance with the Montana Water Quality Act assoon aspossible, preventing unnecessary orundue degradation. Ifthe water management practice and facilities proposed in thisplandonotachieve therequired water quality objectives, ZMI would berequired toimmediately identify thesource ofthedeficiency andmodify the existing water management practices and facilities or develop additional water management practices and facilities tobeconstructed.TheWater Quality Division would issue aMontana Pollution Discharge Elimination System (MPDES) permit toZMI. TheMPDES permit may contain a compliance schedule and establish interim andfmal discharge limitations. 3.2WATER CAPTURE AND TREATMENT Poor quality water (both surface runoff andgroundwater flow)would becollected using andwater treat runoff from atleast a10- year24-hour event, orseepage from a100-year such a which aretobeused downgradient waste units. The quality ofsurface water and groundwater downgradient of the most downgradient water management facility ineachdrainage inaccordance with requirements summarized inSection 4.0. quality associated with a discharge, bypass orupset, ofawater management facility does notcomply with anticipated MPDES effluent limits atthedischarge monitoring point, ZMIwould implement corrective measures forachieving additional water quality improvements. Such measures would include additional capture and treatment facilities, additional BMPs, orother management ortreatment practices. would beconducted attheZortman water treatment plant (anactively operating lime precipitation plant) anddischarged toRuby Gulch. Anewwater treatment plant would beconstructed attheLandusky Mine intheMontana Gulch area. A-3 Appendix A 3.34 DRAINAGE SPECIFIC DISCHARGES &WATER MANAGEMENT FAdLITIES AND PRACTICES Current andfuture potential discharges ofwater from the mine sites aresummarized inTables 4through A-10. 4.0REQUIREMENTS FOR management ZMI isrequired tocollect water quality data. Monitoring istobeperformed atdischarge points anddownstream of water management facilities and practices (This monitoring isinaddition tothemine-wide water resources monitoring program). Thepurpose ofthemonitoring is to: the effectiveness ofcapture and treatment facilities; Determine theeffectiveness ofBMPs; and Document compliance with interim and final effluent limits. 4.1DATACOLLECTION REQUIREMENTS Detailed procedures related tosample collection, laboratory testing, data quality, ordatamanagement and evaluation would andincludes thefollowing: Monitoring atsurface water discharge points, groundwater monitoring sites, and ambient monitoring sites. Monitoring ofcapture system effectiveness (both surface water andgroundwater). Atleast three samples peryearofstorm water discharge monitoring points during runoff events when theoccur.Daily monitoring ofmine drainage discharge monitoring points during periods ofcapture system discharge.

Construction monitoring August 1995 aredetailed intheOrder forCompliance issued bythe DEQ's Water Quality Division onJuly Additional interim requirements havebeen prepared by BLM andHRB toimprove water Plan isapproved, to have submitted detailed drainage specific plans toBLM andHRB within oneyear. Contingent upon obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals inatimely manner, ZMI would berequired tocomplete the initial phase of inalldrainages 1997. Anyadditional construction thatmaybenecessary after 31,1999. Testing atmine drainage monitoring siteswould include whole effluent toxicity testing.
