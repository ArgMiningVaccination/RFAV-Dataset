When Brad asked me to read his new book The Body Code and to write an endorsement, I gladly accepted. The Emotion Code was a very good book, but I think The Body Code is even better. I really like the methodical way that Dr. Nelson has presented the principles and practice of The Body Code. The many life-changing testimonials and case examples in The Body Code provide great encouragement and specific actionable examples for its readers.
