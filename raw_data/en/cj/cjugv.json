But lately, there's been a jump in interest in the benefits & usages of high dose biotin. Commonly used with hair & nails, scientists are now discovering other benefits, especially when combined with products like NAD+. With so much information floating around, how do you digest all the science and make the right decision? This complete guide will help you find out everything you need to know including: What Is Biotin? Biotin (also known as Vitamin B-7) is a water-soluble vitamin\u2014meaning the body cannot store it\u2014which is crucial in helping your body convert food to energy. Most people think of the health of their skin, hair and nails when they think of biotin, however this vitamin powerhouse offers many more health benefits as well. Biotin is found naturally in egg yolks, cheese, soybeans, peanuts, leafy greens, yeast, organ meats, nuts and nut butters, mushrooms and cauliflower. Additionally, the bacteria in the gut also produces a certain amount of biotin. How Does Biotin Support the Body? There are several enzymes in the body\u2014enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, fat and protein\u2014which require biotin to function properly. Since protein is necessary for the body to repair and maintain cells, you can see how important healthy levels of biotin are. Biotin has been found to benefit those with brittle nails and is associated with healthier, stronger hair, as well as increased hair growth. Those with Type 2 diabetes, which is characterized by impaired insulin function and high blood sugar, may also benefit from biotin supplements, as some research has shown biotin concentrations in the blood to be lower in those with Type 2 diabetes. [NIH](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Biotin-HealthProfessional/), biotin is particularly important for pregnant women and nursing moms, as about a third of all pregnant and lactating women will develop a biotin deficiency despite normal biotin intake. Others at risk for biotin deficiency include alcoholics (alcohol inhibits the absorption of biotin), and individuals with a biotinidase deficiency. Biotinidase deficiency is a rare disorder which prevents the body from releasing biotin\u2014all newborns in the U.S. are screened for this disorder. A simple blood test can confirm or rule out a biotin deficiency. Although the above groups are at the highest risk of developing a biotin deficiency, new research is discovering significant health benefits to others as well, in particular, those who suffer from neurodegenerative diseases. 3000 mcg = 3mg 5000 mcg = 5mg The amount of biotin the body needs on a daily basis generally corresponds to age, although those who need to support their nerve health may benefit from much higher doses of biotin. So, how many mg/day should you be taking? While a baby, infant or toddler's daily biotin needs range from 5 mcg to 8 mcg, children between the ages of 4 and 13 need between 12 and 20 mcg of biotin per day, teens need about 25 mcg of biotin per day, adults and pregnant women need about 30 mcg of biotin per day, and breastfeeding women need as much as 35 mcg of biotin each day. Biotin Used to Support Nerve Health When biotin is taken over time in what's considered larger doses, it has been found to support better nerve health. In some neurodegenerative diseases, patients may lose the ability to support their myelin with a normal diet. Since D-Biotin is a naturally occurring form of the B vitamin, it has been shown to assist and support in the production of the myelin sheath through a production of fatty acid synthesis. When myelin, a substance which protects our nerve cells, is damaged, biotin can support key enzymes, prompting the body to produce more myelin. Communication between nerve cells is much easier when there are healthy levels of myelin in the body, and this communication is crucial in supporting nerve health. NAD+ has been called the \"fountain of youth\" by some, and was first discovered more than 110 years ago by scientists who were researching fermentation. NAD+ was originally known as cozymase, however is now known as a coenzyme which plays significant roles in the body. NAD+ works with different sets of proteins to preserve health, especially when the body is under extreme levels of internal or external stress. NAD+ is also a sort of \"courier,\" which transmits important information between molecules in the body, allowing them to properly react with each other. Since the original discovery of NAD+, many important breakthroughs have emerged, particularly in response to the fact that NAD+ levels steadily decline as we age. Dr. Ross Grant, Ph.D./CEO, Australasian Research Institute believes that combining pharmaceutical grade biotin with NAD+ could target diminishing myelin levels in the body. In other words, NAD+ working synergistically with biotin may actually repair the myelin sheath and improve mitochondrial energy production. Side effects that may occur when taking too much Biotin can include skin rashes, upset stomach, problems with insulin release, and kidney problems. [combines biotin and NAD+ into one formula, known as Myetin\u00ae](../product/myetin/). [In a 180-day clinical trial](../gaining-synergy-by-combining-high-dose-biotin-and-nad-for-neurological-health/) among those taking Myetin\u00ae, 48 percent noted a reduction in pain, while 15 percent noted a significant increase in energy levels. When free radical levels (oxidative stress) are high, NAD+ levels decrease. This oxidative stress can actually damage DNA and lower energy production. When high dose biotin and NAD+ are combined, the two work synergistically with one another. In other words, NAD+ provides the energy, while D-Biotin delivers key nutrients to the body, and it is this unique combination which makes Myetin\u00ae work. Myetin\u00ae is the first formula of its kind to combine these two powerhouses. Each Myetin\u00ae chewable tablet contains 150 mg of D-Biotin and 25 mg of NAD+ for optimal cell function. We believe in cellular level nutrition, and that it takes time to rebuild deficiencies in the body. Our goal is to help you address the underlying symptoms, rather than simply masking the problem. If you want a supplement which has pharmaceutical grade active ingredients, is manufactured in Food and Drug Administration inspected facilities, follows CGMP standards which has been rigorously tested, take a closer look at our NAD+ and Biotin combination, [Myetin\u00ae](../product/myetin/), as well as our other high-quality products.
