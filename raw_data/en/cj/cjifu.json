[[5]](#cite_note-:0-5) An article in the journal Vaccine said the site \"tend(s) to not only spread irresponsible health information in general (e.g. discouraging [chemotherapy](/wiki/Chemotherapy) or radiation for [cancer](/wiki/Cancer) treatment, [antiretrovirals](/wiki/Antiretroviral) for [HIV](/wiki/HIV), and [insulin](/wiki/Insulin) for diabetes), but also have large sections with dubious information on vaccines.\" [[38]](#cite_note-Kata2012-38) After [Patrick Swayze](/wiki/Patrick_Swayze) died in 2009, Adams posted an article in which he remarked that Swayze, in dying, \"joins many other celebrities who have been recently killed by pharmaceuticals or chemotherapy.\" Commentators of Adams' article on Patrick Swayze included bloggers such as David Gorski [[47]](#cite_note-47) and Phil Plait, the latter of whom commentary \"obnoxious and loathsome.\" [[48]](#cite_note-48) When [Angelina Jolie](/wiki/Angelina_Jolie) underwent a double mastectomy in May 2013 because she had a mutation in the [BRCA1](/wiki/BRCA1) gene, Adams stated that \"Countless millions of women carry the BRCA1 gene and never express breast cancer because they lead healthy, anti-cancer lifestyles based on smart nutrition, exercise, sensible sunlight exposure and avoidance of cancer-causing chemicals.\" Gorski called the article \"vile\" and noted that Adams had written similarly themed articles about the death of [Michael Jackson](/wiki/Michael_Jackson), [Tony Snow](/wiki/Tony_Snow), and [Tim Russert](/wiki/Tim_Russert). [[49]](#cite_note-49) Brian Palmer, writing in the [Daily Herald](/wiki/Daily_Herald_(Arlington_Heights)) of Arlington Heights, Illinois, criticized the site's promotion of alternative medicine treatments, such as bathing in [Himalayan salt](/wiki/Himalayan_salt) and eating [Hijiki](/wiki/Hijiki) seaweed, and referred to the claims Natural News made about their efficacy as \"preposterous.\" [[50]](#cite_note-50) In August 2014, Nathanael Johnson, writing for [Grist](/wiki/Grist_(website)), dismissed Natural News as \"simply not credible\" and as \"nothing but a conspiracy-theory site.\" [[51]](#cite_note-51) On August 11, 2014, Natural News published a blog post promoting a [homeopathic](/wiki/Homeopathic) treatment for [Ebola](/wiki/Ebola), which was met with harsh criticism from several commentators, and was taken down later that day.

[[53]](#cite_note-53) However, as of August 20, 2014, the site was still featuring an article written by Adams promoting the use of herbal medicines to treat Ebola. [[54]](#cite_note-54) In an article about \"fake Ebola cures\", Adams was criticized for arguing that herbs could prove effective as an Ebola treatment.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] Natural News was among the pseudoscience platforms which promoted hoaxes about the [2014 Ebola epidemic](/wiki/Western_African_Ebola_virus_epidemic), including claims that an infected woman was found in Atlanta and that Ebola was a bioweapon. [[55]](#cite_note-55) On December 8, 2016, Michael V. LeVine, writing in [Business Insider](/wiki/Business_Insider), criticized the site as part of a scientific [fake news](/wiki/Fake_news) epidemic: \"Snake-oil salesmen have pushed false cures since the dawn of medicine, and now websites like Natural News flood social media with dangerous anti-pharmaceutical, anti-vaccination and anti-GMO pseudoscience that puts millions at risk contracting preventable illnesses.\" [[18]](#cite_note-LeVine-18) On February 22, 2017, [[56]](#cite_note-Novak_2/23/2017-56) It was returned soon after. [[57]](#cite_note-57) The following year, on March 3, 2018, [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube) removed Natural News' video channel for terms of service violations, effectively removing its library of videos from the site.

[[13]](#cite_note-:16-13) Notable claims In 2011, Adams posted a report on Natural News which stated that many [blueberry](/wiki/Blueberry) food products did not contain real blueberries. [[60]](#cite_note-60) [[61]](#cite_note-61) In 2013, Adams posted an article describing what he saw when he examined [Chicken McNuggets](/wiki/Chicken_McNugget) under a microscope. He said in the article that the patterns he saw included \"dark black hair-like structures\" and a round [algae](/wiki/Algae)-like object. [[62]](#cite_note-62) [[63]](#cite_note-63) In July 2014, Adams compared media outlets that wrote positively about GMOs with [Nazi Germany's](/wiki/Nazi_Germany%27s) propagandists, calling them, \"Monsanto collaborators who have signed on to accelerate heinous crimes being committed against humanity under the false promise of 'feeding the world' with toxic GMOs.\" He continued with a statement that he set in [boldface](/wiki/Boldface): \"that it is the moral right\u2014and even the obligation\u2014of human beings everywhere to actively plan and carry out the killing of those engaged in heinous crimes against humanity.\" [[64]](#cite_note-64) [[65]](#cite_note-65) A day after the post a website called \"Monsanto Collaborator\" appeared online which listed the names of scientists and journalists who allegedly collaborate with the bio industry; Adams denied creating the website claiming that Monsanto set up the website in order to frame him.
