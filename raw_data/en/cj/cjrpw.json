This MSK (Musculoskeletal) Practice Support Program covers FOUR conditions -Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Juven ile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) Osteoarthritis (OA) and Low Back Pain (LBP). The purpose of these toolkits is to provide: Point of care tools and reference materials to guide evidence -based screening and investigations for appropriate diagnosis, triage, r eferral and treatment decisions. Resources and supports for patients to support them as partners in goal -setting and in managing pain and function relating to these diseases / complaints. The resource material has been compiled from a number of sources in cluding: guidelines published in 2006 (RA) and 2008 (OA) by the Guidelines and Protocols Advisory Committee - British Columbia, Canada; recommendations from the 2011 Canadian Rheumatology Association guide for pharmacological management of RA; the Ontari o Treatment Guidelines for Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis and Acute Musculoskeletal Injury published in 2000; guidelines published in 2009 by TOP (Toward Optimized Practice) , Alberta Canada - for acute and chronic low back pain ; New Zealand Gu idelines published in October 2004; and Advice from BC based Clinical Experts meeting between 2011 -2013 Vancouver, British Columbia. Goals and Objectives Rheumatoid Arthritis Juvenile Arthritis Osteoarthritis Low Back Pain For early RA (symptoms of < 6 months duration) - initiate rapid access, intervention and treatment in order to change the course of the disease by aggressive suppression of inflammation. For established RA - ensure suppression of inflammation and prevent joint damage through: - Initiation and maintenance of strategy for maximum control of inflammation - Management of chronic disease Identify children and adolescents with JIA as early as possible in the course of disease to: - Decrease pain - Limit or eliminate disability - Allow ear ly treatment and improved outcomes - Assist GPs with assessment of children and adolescents with MSK complaints. Avoid multiple referrals and physician visits without diagnosis Support the relationship of GPs and pediatricians in referral and shared care networks Obtain an accurate diagnosis with functional assessments Identify conditions / criteria for surgical referral Maintain or improve joint mobility Limit functional disability Manage pain and function through patient education, rehabilitation, medications and referrals Improve self -care Increase the use of evidence -informed approaches for assessment, diagnosis and treatment of non -specific low back pain Promote appropriate diagnostic tests, treatment and specialist referrals Facilitate dial ogue and improved working relationships between family physicians and other health care providers involved in the care of patients receiving treatment for LBP Encourage patients to engage in appropriate self-care activities Page 4 of 81 Electronic Toolkits Page 5 of 81 Page 6 of 81 The following diagram identifies the components of the RA and OA electronic toolkit s.

Not at All Several Days More Than Half the Days Nearly Every Day 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things 2. Feeling down, depressed or hopeless Overview The PHQ -2 inquires about the frequenc y of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past two weeks. The PHQ -2 includes the first two items of the PHQ -9. The purpose of the PHQ -2 is not to establish a final diagnosis or to monitor depression severity, but rather to screen for depression in a \"fi rst step\" approach. Patients who screen positive should be further evaluated with the PHQ -9 to determine whether they meet criteria for a depressive disorder. Clinical Utility Reducing depression evaluation to two screening questions enhances routine inqu iry about the most prevalent and treatable mental disorder in primary care. Scoring A PHQ -2 score ranges from 0 -6. The authors identified a PHQ -2 cutoff score of 3 as the optimal cut point for screening purposes and stated that a cut point of 2 would enh ance sensitivity, whereas a cut point of 4 would improve specificity. * Because the PPV varies with the prevalence of depression, the PPV will be higher in settings with a higher prevalence of depression and lower in settings with a lower prevalence.

Depending on the response, other follow -up questions may be asked. If at any point in the interview, it looks like it may not be possible to create an action plan, offer to return to it in a future interaction. Follow -up is addressed on p age 2. Question #1 of Brief Action Planning can be introduced in any clinical interaction when rapport is good. 1. Ask Question #1 to elicit ideas for change. \"Is there anything you would like to do for your health in the next week or two?\" A. If an idea is sh ared, specify details as they apply to the plan (Help the person make the plan SMART - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timed). \"What?\" \"When?\" (time of day, day of week, start date) \"How much/long?\" \"How often?\" \"Where?\" B. For individuals who want or need suggestions, offer a behavioral menu. First ask permission to share ideas. \"Would you like me to share some ideas that others I've worked with have tried?\" Then share two to three ideas. \"Some people I have worked with have ________, others h ave had success with _______ or _________.\" Then ask what they want to do. \"Do any of these ideas work for you, or is there something else I haven't mentioned that you would like to try?\" If an idea is chosen, specify the details in order to make the pla n SMART (above). C. After the individual has made a specific plan, elicit a commitment statement. \"Just to make sure we both understand the details of your plan, would you mind putting it together and saying it out loud?\" 2. Ask Question #2 to evaluate confide nce. \"I wonder how confident you feel about carrying out your plan. Considering a scale of 0 to 10, where '0' means you are not at all confident and '10' means you are very confident, about how confident do you feel about your plan?\" The word \"sure\" may be substituted for the word \"confident\". A. If confidence level >7, go to Question #3 below. \"That's great. It sounds like a good plan for you.\" B. If confidence level <7, problem solve to overcome barriers or adjust plan. \"5 is great. That's a lot higher than 0, and shows a lot of interest and commitment. We know that when confidence is a 7 or more, people are more likely to be successful. Do you have any ideas about what might raise your confidence?\" C. If they do not have any ideas to modify the plan, ask if they would like suggestions. \"Would you like to hear some ideas from other people I've worked with?\" D. If the response is \"yes,\" provide two or three ideas. \"Sometimes people cut back on their plan, change their plan, or make a new plan. Do you think any of these might work for you or something else you've thought of?\" E. If the plan is altered, repeat Question #2 to evaluate confidence with the new plan. 3. Ask Question #3 to arrange follow -up or accountability. \"Sounds like a plan that's going to work for you. Would you like to set a specific time to check back in with me so we can review how things have been going with the plan?\" Make the follow -up plan SMART. Page 26 of 81 Follow -up for Brief Action Planning 1. First ask, \"How did it go with your plan?\" A. If succes sful recognize (affirm) their success. B. If partially successful, recognize (affirm) partial success. C. If little or no success, say, \"This is something that is quite common when people try something new.\" 2. Then ask, \"What would you like to do next?\" A. If the per son wants to make a new plan, follow the steps on page 1. Use problem solving and a behavioral menu when needed. B. They may want to talk about what they learned from their action plan. Reinforce learning and adapting the plan. C. If the person does not want t o make another action plan at this time, offer to return to action planning in the future. This tool was developed by Steven Cole, Damara Gutnick, Kathy Reims and Connie Davis. The Spirit of Motivational Interviewing The Spirit of Motivational Interviewing un derlies Brief Action Planning. Partnership: Work in collaboration. Acceptance: Respect autonomy and the right to change or not change. Evocation: Ideas come from the person, not the clinician or helper. Compassion: Act with heart when providing assistance.

Key Features of Inflammation suggesting RA: Early morning stiffness (EMS) 30 minutes and stiffness post immobility Pain worse in AM and post immobility, better with mild activity Joint swelling (in 1 joint) for 6 weeks Swelling or tenderness in small joints of the hands, especially metacarpo phalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), or wrists, and in feet especially metatarsophalangeal (MTP) Symmetrical involvement Fatigue symptoms Follow -up visit: To assess disease activity and impact of arthritis, consider: Amount and severity of pain Frequency of pain Whether pain interferes with sleep Number and distribution of joints affected with pain and swelling Duration of early morning stiffness Fatigue Functional limitations Difficulties with usual activities, work, leisure The following diagram illustrates various criteria and features for differentiating between rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritic conditions. Page 39 of 81 Page 40 of 81 Typical Joint Involvement in Various Types of Arthritis Black = joints most commonly affected Grey = joints often af fected White = joints usually not affected Page 41 of 81 Red Flags Red flags help identify potentially serious conditions and require immediate or emergency / expedited referral to a specialist or emergency department. Areas for Observation: Acute monoarthritis requ ires urgent joint aspiration to rule -out septic or crystal arthritis Giant cell arteritis - if suspicion of giant cell arteritis based on typical headache, visual disturbance, jaw claudication, and/or constitutional symptoms Acute Systemic Vasculitis - significant concern for acute development of a systematic vasculitis with major organ involvement e.g. acute pulmonary, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal or neurological features; cutaneous vasculitis or digital infarcts Acute connective tissue disease - significant concern for acute development of major organ involvement from connective tissue disease, e.g. acute pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hematological, neurological features; cutaneous vasculitis or digital infarcts Significant unexplained constitutional symptoms of either fever >38 degrees or weight loss 5% in preceding 6 weeks, where there is a strong suspicion that it may relate to a connective tissue disease or vasculitis Page 42 of 81 Investigations The following investigations may be utilized for suspected or confirmed rheumatoid arthritis. Baseline only: Rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti peptide -CCP): o Useful when positive; o Negative serology does not rule out RA o High positive indicates poorer prognosis o No need to repeat over ti me Consider LFTs, TSH, Cr and urine analysis as baseline tests Baseline and Follow -up: Joint aspiration for culture, crystal and cell count, if monoarthritis, to rule out septic arthritis or crystal arthritis, or if diagnosis is uncertain to determine if inflammatory. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C -reactive protein (CRP) o High ESR or CRP suggest but do not prove inflammation o Normal ESR and CRP do not exclude inflammation o High ESR or CRP at baseline is associated with poorer prognosis o Useful for monitoring disease activity and response to treatment CBC with differentials o Anemia or increased platelets can indicate active inflammation o Monitoring for bone marrow suppression from DMARDs (e.g. MTX, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, gold, biologics) Rena l function and Liver enzymes o As baseline prior to starting medications o Monitoring for liver toxicity from DMARDs (e.g. methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide) o Urine analysis and creatinine to monitor for gold toxicity o Follow blood pressure and renal fun ction to monitor for NSAID toxicity Eye exam every 12 months to monitor for hydroxychloroquine toxicity Refer to Table X from BC guidelines for specific tests and frequency to monitor for DMARD toxicity. X-rays: Yearly X -Rays of hands and feet as well a s any symptomatic joint, early in disease and when disease is active, are recommended to assess radiographic progression (i.e. erosions and joint space narrowing) Erosions are rarely seen on X -Rays in disease of < 6 months duration and can occur even with minimal symptoms Radiographic progression indicates need for medication change.

They are as follows: SDAI CDAI Remission < 3.3 < 2.8 Low Disease Activity 3.4 - 11 2.9 - 10 Moderate Disease Activity 12 - 26 11 - 22 High Disease Activity > 26 > 22 Items from history and physical exam 1.

Physician global assessment of disease activity (0 -10 scale): _______ 5. CRP: _______ Page 45 of 81 Disease Activity State: Remission Low disease activity Moderate disease activity High disease activity Clinical Treatment Targets Eradication of inflammation in order to prevent joint damage, physical disability and premature mortality. Aiming only at controlling symptoms is not sufficient. Persistent swelling, even without pain, leads to joint erosions and deformities. Fre quent follow -up is needed (every 1 to 3 months) to assess disease activity and adjust DMARD therapy until the target is reached. Clinical Remission , i.e., the absence of signs and symptoms of active inflammation: o No swollen joints o EMS < 15 minutes o No or m inimal systemic symptoms such as fatigue o No or minimal pain from inflammation o Normal ESR or CRP o Little to no radiographic progression Page 46 of 81 If remission is achieved: o This is the main target, no change in DMARD is needed. o If remission has been sustained for > 6 months, very gradual reduction in DMARD dose might be attempted. For example reductions by 2.5 mg of methotrexate every 3 -6 months. Dose should be increased back to previous level as soon as symptoms worsen or remission state is lost. o IF DMARDs are tape red and remission is lost, there is a risk that it might not be achieved again. Therefore decision to taper must be made carefully with patient. Low Disease Activity (LDA) is an acceptable alternative target, particularly if remission is not possible in long standing disease or when co -morbidities or other patient factors limit DMARD options. Use of composite measures (e.g. CDAI and SDAI) is recommended to assess low disease activity, but the following can be useful as a guide: o < 3 swollen joints o If swell ing is present only mild swelling o No swelling of large joints o Little to no radiographic progression Yearly X -Rays are recommended to assess radiographic progression and step -up treatment if joint space narrowing or erosions progress. If Low Disease Activ ity state is achieved: o If DMARDs have not been optimized, modify DMARD therapy in an attempt to achieve remission (i.e., increase DMARD dose to maximum recommended or tolerated dose, or consider adding DMARD in combination ) o This is an alternative target which may be acceptable, especially in long standing disease, if medications have been maximized and remission does not seem possible. If Moderate or High Disease Activity state: o Treatment target has not been reached and DMARD therapy MUST be modified o This may include increasing dose of current DMARD to maximum recommended or maximum tolerated dose; changing to parenteral administration of MTX; adding a DMARD in combination therapy; or switching to a new DMARD, or a biologic if DMARD failure. Page 47 of 81 Other Manag ement Considerations Management and treatment of RA falls into two broad categories - management of early RA and management of established RA. Management of Early RA includes: Patient education including: o Self management strategies for pain and fatigue o Connecting with community resources o Address other relevant concerns such as nutrition, exercise, and mental health Referral to Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy with expertise in RA management Start NSAIDS for pain management (Start NSAIDs for pain management (see Treatment Options for Pain - Beyond Medications, Surgery and Injections for other pain management information) If confident of diagnosis, consider starting hydroxychloroquine (daily dose of 6.5mg/kg lean body weight) or sulfasalazine (star ting at 500 mg daily and increasing to 1 gm twice a day; after performing baseline CBC and LFTs) while the patient is waiting to be seen by a rheumatologist. If symptoms are severe and patient is having difficulties functioning in daily life, consider int ra- muscular injection of 40 mg of DepoMedrol. Specialist referral and be sure to indicate \"urgent - new onset of RA.\" Follow -up every 1 -3 months to adjust therapy until a state of remission or low disease activity (LDA) is achieved. Management of Establ ished RA includes: Suppression of all inflammation to prevent joint damage Follow -up by GP every 3 -6 months. At each visit: o Review current drug therapy including dose, compliance and side effects o Assess patient for active joint inflammation and disease activity, to determine if target is reached and whether therapy needs to be modified o Differentiate inflammation versus damage o Review laboratory results for monitoring DMARD toxicity Assess co -morbidities (Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, osteopor osis, infections, malignancies) and extra -articular manifestations Consider referral to allied health professionals (Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, social worker, vocational counselor) Consider implications of chronic disease (pain management, psyc hosocial issues, depression, areas of self -management, patient education) Follow -up with specialist every 6 -12 months if disease is well controlled Page 48 of 81 Decision to start Patients on DMARDs The standard of care has changed for Treatment of RA - E.A.R.L.Y Tre atment of RA with DMARDs means: E Early diagnosis and treatment of RA A Aggressive use of DMARDS alters the course of RA R Remission is the new target of RA treatment L Long Term use of DMARDs Y Yes, DMARDs are safe when monitored closely PAST PRESENT NSAIDS first Watchful waiting DMARDs last resort Early and aggressive use of DMARDs NSAIDs were the first line of treatment NSAIDs are not enough DMARDs were used as a last resort ; if NSAIDS did not control symptoms, or once damage occurred All act ive RA warrants DMARDs DMARDs are used early, continuously and aggressively Goal was to manage symptoms The goal is to eradicate inflammation in order to prevent irreversible damage Deformity and disability were a normal consequence of the disease proce ss Deformity, disability and premature death are preventable with DMARDs DMARDs were considered toxic DMARDs are safe if monitored closely Note: Gastrointestinal Issues with NSAIDs There is no evidence that NSAIDs alter the natural course of arthritis . The patient should be made aware that NSAIDs represent symptomatic therapy, and that the therapy is associated with some risk of gastrointestinal issues such as ulcers or GI bleeds. Patients should be informed to stop taking the medications and be reas sessed if they have the following symptoms: stomach pain, heartburn, blood in vomit or black stools. If the patient is experiencing GI problems, refer to guideline: Dyspepsia - Clinical Approach to Adult Patients available at www.BCGuidelines.ca Page 49 of 81 The foll owing are conditions to rule out before starting DMARDs. Condition Features Osteoarthritis Typically affects the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the hands and the carpometacarpal joint at the base of the thumb. Swelling of the joints is hard and b ony Stiffness and pain are worse after activity Stiffness in the morning or after immobility does not last long (gelling ; < 30 minutes) Crystal arthropathy: gout or pseudogout Monoarticular, especially the first MTP joint, or oligoarticular. Joint aspira tion is needed to look for urate crystals or calcium pyrophosphate crystals (CPPD). Radiologists can perform joint aspirations if GP is not confident of technique Septic arthritis Usually monoarticular but rarely can be polyarticular Joint aspiration must be performed for synovial fluid culture and cell count. Viral arthritis Transient polyarthritis usually lasting < 6 weeks Common causes: Less commonly: mumps, alphaviruses, enterovirus virus Hepatitis B & C associated a rthritis Autoimmune arthritis associated with Hepatitis B & C infection Abnormal liver function tests (AST & ALT) Perform Hepatitis B & C serology if appropriate ie: abnormal liver function test or high risk Metabolic disorders Rule out hyper or hypothyro idism (TSH), hyperparathyroidism Page 50 of 81 Management of Co -Morbidities The following table may be used for the management of co -morbidities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Condition Comments Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) All patients with RA are at incr eased risk of CVD Risk increases with increased disease activity and severity Risk increased in patients with positive RF, anti-CCP and high ESR or CRP CVD risk should be assessed in all patients Count RA as one additional risk factor for CVD in the scori ng of cardiovascular risk Monitor blood pressure regularly Measure lipids yearly Discuss weight management if needed Encourage physical activity Address smoking cessation if applicable Infections People with RA are at increased risk of infections Risk inc reases with increased disease activity and severity Some DMARDs also increase risk of infections (e.g. biologics, leflunomide, cyclosporine, methotrexate) however reduced inflammation seems to attenuate this risk. Prednisone increases risk of infection m ore than DMARDs Advise patients to seek medical attention if symptoms of infections Manage RA patients on DMARDs as immunocompromised hosts (especially if on biologics) Minimizing dose and duration of prednisone is important. Immunizations : Yearly influen za vaccine for all RA patients Pneumococcal Vaccine in all patients prior to starting immunosuppressants and one booster after 5 yrs Hepatitis A and B in high risk Osteoporosis RA patients are at increased risk of osteoporosis due to inflammation, reduced physical activity and prednisone use Assess risk factors for osteoporosis Measure bone density if risk factors, prednisone use or fragility fracture Provide counseling for Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation Encourage exercise Bisphosphonate for osteopo rosis prevention if prednisone >7.5 mg per day for expected duration of more than 3 months Depression RA patients are at increased risk of depression Screen for depression using PHQ2 and PHQ9 tools if appropriate, especially early in disease Page 51 of 81 Follow -up Assessment Checklist 1.

Child or adolescent with joint pain, swelling, stiffness, or dysfunction which has lasted longer than 2 weeks, and is unrelated to trauma. 2. Child with signs and symptoms suggestive of a generalized connective tissue or autoimmune condition. Please note: A child o r adolescent who is acutely ill can be seen urgently by phoning the pediatric rheumatology service directly. Referrals to the Pediatric Rheumatology Service at BC Children's Hospital are triaged based on the referral information. If you feel your patien t requires an urgent consultation, you may phone BCCH and ask to speak to the rheumatologist on call. The direct line to the BCCH Rheumatology Clinic is 604-875-2437. The BCCH Rheumatology Clinic Booking Clerk can be reached at 604-875-3678. The general t oll-free line for BCCH is 1-888-300-3088. There is a pediatric rheumatologist in Victoria and one in Penticton as well. In some cases, a referral to a local pediatrician is a helpful interim step, to ascertain whether the child requires a pediatric rheum atology referral. The pediatrician may be very helpful in working through the differential diagnosis of joint pain in children, and is an expert in childhood development.

These may indicate serious disease (not always confined to the back) that can cause back pain. They include: Features of Cauda Equina syndrome including sudden onset or loss of bladder / bowel control, saddle anaesthesia (emergency) Sever e worsening pain, especially at night or when lying down (urgent) Significant trauma (urgent) Weight loss, history of cancer, fever, rash, infection (urgent) Use of steroids or intravenous drugs (urgent) Patient with first episode over 50 years old (soon) Pain in child < 10 years old (soon) Abdominal pain Inter -menstrual or rectal bleeding Balance or gait disturbance Page 67 of 81 Features of Inflammatory Low Back Pain: Morning stiffness >1hr diagnostic Improved with stretching exercises or movement Night pain Onset usually <40 years of age Pain > 3 months Reduced spinal range of motion Sacroiliitis, Iritis, IBD, Enthesitis, Psoriasis, Family Hx of AS/RA/SpA If red flags are present, referral for specialist management should be considered where an emergency case r equires referral within hours; an urgent case requires referral within 24 -48 hours and a non -urgent case requires referral within weeks. Red Flags Investigations If Red Flags are present, this is the recommended approach: All patients with symptoms or s igns of Cauda Equina Syndrome should be referred urgently to hospital for orthopedic or neurosurgical assessment. If cancer or infection is suspected, order the appropriate blood tests. In the absence of red flags, no laboratory tests are recommended. Patients with red flags should be investigated appropriately and referred to a specialist if indicated by clinical findings and test results. Investigations in the first 4 -6 weeks of an acute low back pain episode do not provide clinical benefit, unless th ere are red flags. A full blood count and ESR should usually be performed only if there are red flags. Other tests may be indicated depending on the clinical situation. Radiological investigations (x -rays and CT scans) carry the risk of potential harm fr om radiation related effects and should be avoided if not required for diagnosis or management. Remember red flag pathology may lie outside the lumbar region and may not be detected by radiology. For non -specific acute low back pain (no red flags), diagn ostic imaging tests, including x -ray, CT and MRI, are not indicated. Many people without symptoms show abnormalities on x -rays and MRI. The chances of finding coincidental disc prolapse increase with age. It is important to correlate MRI findings with a ge and clinical signs before advising surgery. In chronic low back pain, x -rays of the lumbar spine are very poor indicators of serious pathology. Hence, in the absence of clinical red flags spinal x -rays are not encouraged. More specific and appropriate diagnostic imaging should be performed on the basis of the pathology being sought (e.g. DEXA scan for bone density, bone scan for tumors and inflammatory diseases). However, lumbar spine x -rays may be required prior to more sophisticated diagnostic imagi ng, for example prior to performing a CT or MRI scan. In this case, the views should be limited to anterior -posterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) without requesting oblique views. Page 68 of 81 Yellow Flags The following algorithm can be used to help determine if psychosoc ial barriers (yellow flags) are present that may hinder recovery in a patient with low back pain. Page 69 of 81 Yellow flags indicate psychosocial barriers to recovery. Identifying yellow flags in patients can be challenging. Yellow Flags indicate psychosocial ba rriers to recovery that may increase the risk of long -term disability and work loss. Identifying any Yellow Flags may help when improvement is delayed. Yellow Flags include: Yellow Flag Intervention Belief that pain and activity are harmful Educate and consider referral to active rehab \"Sickness behaviors\" (like extended rest) Educate and consider pain clinic referral Low or negative moods, social withdrawal Assess for depression and treat Treatment beliefs do not fit best practice Educate Problems with claim and compensation Connect with stakeholders and case manage History of back pain, time -off, other claims Follow -up regularly refer if recovering slowly Problems at work, poor job satisfaction Engage case management through disability carrier Heavy work, unsociable hours (shift work) Follow -up regularly refer if recovering slowly Overprotective family or lack of support Educate patient and family Page 70 of 81 Psychosocial Yellow Flags: Helping Someone at Risk - Suggested steps to better early behavioral management of low back pain problems Provide a positive expectation that the individual will return to work and normal activity. Organize for a regular expression of interest from the employer. Be directive in scheduling regular reviews of progress. Whe n conducting these reviews shift the focus from the symptom (pain) to function (level of activity). Instead of asking \"How much do you hurt?\" ask \"What have you been doing?\" Keep the individual active and at work if at all possible, even for a small part of the day. This will help to maintain work habits and work relationships. Acknowledge difficulties with activities of daily living, but avoid making the assumption that these indicate all activity or any work must be avoided. Help to maintain positive cooperation between the individual, an employer, the compensation system, and health professionals. Encourage collaboration wherever possible. Please refer to the template letter to employers - Return to Work as an example of collaboration. Make a concer ted effort to communicate that having more time off work will reduce the likelihood of a successful return to work. At the 12 -week point consider suggesting vocational redirection, permanent job changes. Be alert for the presence of individual beliefs tha t he or she should stay off work until treatment has provided a 'total cure'. Watch out for expectations of simple 'techno -fixes'. Promote self -management and self -responsibility. Encourage the development of self -efficacy to return to work. Be prepared to ask for a second opinion, provided it does not result in a long and disabling delay. Use this option especially if it may help clarify that further diagnostic work is unnecessary. Avoid confusing the report of symptoms with the presence of emotional d istress. Exclusive focus on symptom control is not likely to be successful if emotional distress is not dealt with. Avoid suggesting (even inadvertently) that the person from a regular job may be able to work at home, or in their own business because it w ill be under their own control. Self employment nearly always involves more hard work. Encourage people to recognize, from the earliest point, that pain can be controlled and managed so that a normal, active or working life can be maintained. Provide enc ouragement for all 'well' behaviors \u2014including alternative ways of performing tasks, and focusing on transferable skills.

Consult or refer to a spinal surgeon if the patient has neuromotor deficits that persist after 4 to 6 weeks of conservative treatment or sciatica for longer than 6 weeks with positive straight leg raise. 80 of 81 Giving Patients the Green Light During the course of initial presentation, diagnosis and treatment, patients may have a number of anxieties and questions that they may not necessarily raise or share with their family physician . There is clear evidence that the following strategies also improve outcomes for people with acute low back pain: Advise patients to 'stay active' and continue their usual activities Provide them with an explanation and reassurance, rather than a diagno sis Control their pain with simple analgesics, or manipulation if necessary Promote staying at work - or an early return to work, with modifications if needed Provide ongoing management and review. Staying Active and Continuing Activities - Key Points : Pain does not equate to damage.
