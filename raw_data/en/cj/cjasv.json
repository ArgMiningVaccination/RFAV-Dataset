On the other hand few species have either extincted or or have decreased drastically.House Sparrow,Vulture,Hoppie,Sarker markoha,Indian Cow,Oxen,Buffalows have decreased drastically.They have replaced Eucalyptus &Poplar from the farm fields due to non availablity of local market.The demand of Leucaenia spp. have increased among cattle rearing community.One of the old person reported that once there was no. of Akhrot (Juglans regia) trees in the area but today very few are available.The production of Anardana have decreased due to borer attack on the unripe fruit.No viable solution for the borer have been known among the farmers. He also said that once upon a time there was also 15 important local varieties of mango but today only two or three are there rest have totally extincted from the entire jurisdiction of BMC.Local Amla,Citrus like kimb,Nimbu,Galgal have been replaced with hybrid varieties.Wild Mushroom which is locally known as'' Daabey''is the chance game now ,which was abundant once upon a time.The production of' ''Guchi''( Morchela esculenta) have also decreased.The intelligentsia urged to conserve the local varieties of Mango,Citrus,Pulses,Plash,Cow &Buffaloes.Whereas the population of Goat &Sheep have increased.Indian Chicken has decreased but poultry chicken have increased.The information was mainly shared by members of BMC,PRI,Old "}
