The patriarchal stories of the Bible reflect the migration of the ancient Hebrews from Mesopotamiato Canaan and from there to Egypt. Jewish historycontinues with the Exodus from Egypt; the Sinaievent; the gradual conquest of Canaan during theperiod of Joshua, the Judges, and the Kings; thebuilding of the First Temple and, with it, the firstJewish commonwealth under Solomon; the splitting of the Jewish commonwealth into northern andsouthern kingdoms around the year 930 B.C.E.; thedefeat of the northern kingdom by the Assyrians in722 B.C.E.; and the conquest and exile of the Jews of the southern kingdom by the Babylonians in 586B.C.E., and, with that, the destruction of the FirstTemple and the first Jewish commonwealth. All of these events are familiar from their biblical accounts. Jews established a strong community in Babylonia (modern-day Iraq) that continued to exist for anotherfifteen hundred years under the Persians and then theMuslims. A number of Jews returned to rebuild thetemple in 516 B.C.E., and with their return the secondJewish commonwealth was born. It continued to exist in Israel through Greek and Roman conquest until 70C.E., when the Romans destroyed the Second Temple. Jews continued to exist in what is now Israel in fairly large numbers for the next three hundred years,but their situation became increasingly dire, and theThe Jewish Tradition Religious Beliefs and Healthcare Decisions By Elliot N.

Dorff, Ph.D., is Rector and Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of Judaism, Los Angeles, Calif.THEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSfocus of Jewish history shifted to the community in Persia. The Persian Jewish community was atthe forefront of world Jewry through the Muslimperiod, extending to approximately 1050 C.E.,but there were sizable Jewish communities inIsrael, North Africa, and southern Europe dur-ing that time. From around 1000 C.E. to the fifteenth cen- tury, the Jewish communities of North Africaand western Europe became the major centersof Jewish culture. Jews, expelled from the west-ern Mediterranean region and western Europein the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, movedto eastern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean basin, where they were concentrated until thelate nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Atthat time, because of persecution in Russia andthe development of Zionism\u2014a movement toreconstitute Jewish national life in the ancienthomeland\u2014many Jews moved to America andIsrael, although the majority of them remainedin eastern Europe until they were slaughtered inthe Nazi Holocaust. The largest Jewish community as of 1997, the last year for which figures are currently avail-able, lives in the United States (approximately5.7 million Jews), and the second largest lives inIsrael (approximately 4.7 million Jews). Thereare also Jewish communities (in order of size)numbering in the hundreds of thousands inFrance, Canada, Russia, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Ukraine, and Brazil, and there aresizable but somewhat smaller Jewish communi-ties in Australia, South Africa, Germany,Hungary, Mexico, and Belgium. It can be saidtruthfully that Jews live in almost every countryof the world, including some that are currentlyhostile to Judaism and Israel. This wide distri-bution is the result of the remarkable fact thatJews lived without a homeland for close to nine- teen hundred years, the only people to surviveunder those conditions. Although it is difficultto determine exactly how many Jews there are inthe world today, demographers estimate thatthere are about thirteen million. 1GENERAL TENETS OF JEWISH BELIEF AND PR ACTICE Jewish belief centers on the revelation of God at Sinai contained in the Torah (the five books ofMoses) and on the historical relationship of Godto the Jewish people from the time of Abrahamthrough the Exodus and into the present day.Traditional Jews consider themselves bound by the commandments of God as articulated inJewish law. Because Jewish law gives Judaism a distinctly activist cast, even those Jews who donot observe the law often are actively involved inmany projects for the improvement of life onearth. Jewish values concentrate on the life ofthe family and the community, educationthroughout life, historical rootedness, and hopefor a Messianic future when all peoples will cometo know God and follow Jewish law. In that way,Jews understand themselves as having a mis- sion\u2014that of demonstrating morality to the worldand being, terminology, \"a light untothe nations\" (Isaiah 49:6). 2For Jews, the land of Israel is the Jewish homeland not only becausemany of the critical events in the birth anddevelopment of Judaism took place there, butalso because, according to Scripture, God gavethe land to the Jews. Although Jews understandthemselves as having a divine mission, that mis-sion is to be carried out by example rather thanby actively pursuing converts; in fact, Judaismhas historically been reluctant to accept converts. While Jewish law specifies many particulars about the actions of Jews, Jewish belief is muchless determined. Consequently, Judaism has along history of lively intellectual debate on philo-sophical issues, and rabbis have taken theologicalpositions ranging from supernaturalism to natu-ralism, from rationalism to mysticism, and from acommunity-based revelational understanding ofJewish law to an individualistic, existential under- standing of it. Traditional and liberal manifestations of Judaism exist in most countries. In the UnitedStates there are four movements: the ReformMovement, the Reconstructionist Movement, the 2Conservative Movement, and the Orthodox Movement. Orthodox Jews, constituting approxi-mately 20 percent of affiliated American Jews,believe that the Torah is the literal word of God and that Jewish law is to be determined by ref-erence to the codes and responsa (literally, \"queries and replies\"; the rabbinic term denotesthe exchange of letters in which one party con-sults with another on a matter of Jewish law) ofthe past. Conservative Jews, who include some41 percent of affiliated American Jews, believethat all Jewish sources must be understood intheir historical context and that Jewish lawdeveloped historically as well. Therefore, whileConservative Jews consider Jewish law binding,they are more willing than Orthodox Jews tomake changes in its content in response to mod-ern needs. Reconstructionist and Reform Jewsdo not consider Jewish law to be binding,although many voluntarily choose to observesections of it. The Reconstructionist Movement,approximately 2 percent of American Jewry, hashistorically possessed a greater sense of commu-nity than the Reform Movement has manifestedand hence offers more encouragement to adoptthe folkways of the People of Israel. Autonomyis a central value for the Reform Movement,which represents about 35 percent of AmericanJewry. (The remaining percentage consider themselves \"just Jews.\") Thus for Reform Jewsthe law is at most a resource that the individualmay choose to consult in making a decision; it iscertainly not the authoritative command of God.Still, the 1999 Pittsburgh Platform Statement ofthe Reform rabbinate encourages Reform Jewsto learn and practice not only the moral, butalso the ritual elements of Jewish tradition,although the individual still has the right todetermine how much to observe. The rabbis ofthe various movements adhere to the positionsdescribed above, but for lay people family histo-ry, convenience, and friendships are at least asimportant in choosing an affiliation as ideologyand practice. Therefore, Jews might be membersof synagogues that are affiliated with one move-ment or another even though their own personalphilosophies and practices do not coincide with those of the institutions that they join. 3 FUNDAMENTAL JEWISH BEL IEFS CON - CERNING HEAL TH CARE Judaism's positions on issues in health care stem from three of its underlying principles:4that the body belongs to God; that the body is integrated into the entire human person and, as such, ismorally neutral, its moral valence being deter-mined by how we use our physical abilities; andthat human beings have both the permissionand the obligation to heal. GOD'SO W N E R S HIP OF OUR BODIES According to Judaism, God owns everything, including our bodies.5God loans them to us for the duration of our lives, and they are returnedto God when we die. The immediate implicationof this principle is that neither men nor womenhave the right to govern their bodies as theywill; God can and does assert the right to restrictthe use of our bodies according to the rulesarticulated in Jewish law. One set of rules requires us to take reason- able care of our bodies. That is why a Jew maynot live in a city where there is no physician. 6It is also the reason rules of good hygiene, sleep,exercise, and diet are not just recommendationsbut commanded acts that we owe God. So, forexample, bathing is a commandment ( mitzvah ) according to Hillel, and Maimonides includeshis directives for good health in his code of law,making them just as obligatory as other positiveduties like caring for the poor. 7 Just as we are commanded to take positive steps to maintain good health, so are we obligat-ed to avoid danger and injury. 8Indeed, Jewish law views endangering one's health as worsethan violating a ritual prohibition. 9So, for example, anyone who cannot subsist except bytaking charity but refuses to do so out of pride is 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERshedding blood and is guilty of a mortal offense.10Similarly, Conservative, Reform, and some Orthodox authorities have prohibitedsmoking as an unacceptable risk to ourGod-owned bodies. 11 Ultimately, human beings do not have the right to dispose of their bodies at will (that is, commit suicide), for that would be a total oblit-eration of that which belongs to God. 12In the laws of all American states, suicide is not pro-hibited, although abetting a suicide is forbiddenin all except Oregon. It is frankly difficult toconstruct a cogent argument that it is in thestate's interest to prohibit suicide, especially ifthe person is not leaving dependents behind. InJudaism the theoretical basis for this prohibitionis clear; we do not have the right to destroywhat is not ours. THE BODY AS MORALL YN E UTRAL AND POTENTIALLY GOOD The second major principle underlying Jewish medical ethics is that the body is morally neu-tral and potentially good. For Judaism the bodyis as much the creation of God as the mind, thewill, and the emotions are. Its energies, likethose of our other faculties, are morally neutral,but they can and should be used for divine pur-poses as defined by Jewish law and tradition.Within that structure, the body's pleasures are God-given and are not to be shunned, for that would be an act of ingratitude toward ourCreator. The body, in other words, can andshould give us pleasure to the extent that doingso fits within its overriding purpose of enablingus to live a life of holiness. The Jewish mode for attaining holiness is to use all of our faculties, including our bodilyenergies, to perform God's commandments.Eating, for example, is an act we do as animals,but it takes on a divine dimension when weobserve Jewish dietary restrictions and surroundour meals with the appropriate blessings. Somebodily pleasures are positively commanded.Thus, unless Yom Kippur falls on Saturday, one may not fast on the Sabbath, and one must havethree meals in its celebration. Similarly, one issupposed to bathe and wear clean clothes inhonor of the day. 13Sexual intercourse in mar- riage is not only commanded for purposes of procreation; it is also a duty that each of thespouses has toward the other for their mutualenjoyment. 14Marital union thus not only pro- duces the next generation, but also establishesthe environment in which it can be nurturedand educated in the Jewish tradition. According to the rabbis, it is actually a sin to deny oneself the pleasures that God's lawallows. 15Bodily pleasures, though, are most appropriately enjoyed when we intend toenhance our ability to do God's will, asMaimonides explains: He who regulates his life in accordance with the laws of medicine with the sole motive of maintain-ing a sound and vigorous physique and begettingchildren to do his work and labor for his benefit is not following the right course. A man should aim tomaintain physical health and vigor in order that hissoul may be upright, in a condition to knowGod...Whoever throughout his life follows this course will be continually serving God, even whileengaged in business and even during cohabitation,because his purpose in all that he does will be to satisfy his needs so as to have a sound body withwhich to serve God. Even when he sleeps and seeksrepose to calm his mind and rest his body so as notto fall sick and be incapacitated from serving God,his sleep is service of the Almighty. 16 The medical implications of this understand- ing are clear. Jews have the obligation to main-tain health not only to care for God's property,but also so that they can accomplish their pur-pose in life, that is, to live a life of holiness.Moreover, since pain is not a method of attain-ing holiness, it is our duty to relieve it. Perhapsthe most pervasive corollary of Judaism's insis-tence on the divine source of our bodies is itspositive attitude toward the body and medicine. 4 THEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSTHEPARKRIDGE CENTERTHE HUMAN DUTY TO HEAL OURSEL VES AND OT HERS God's ownership of our bodies is also behind our obligation to help other people escape sick-ness, injury, and death. 17It is not for some gen- eral (and vague) humanitarian reason or for rea-sons of anticipated reciprocity. Even the duty ofphysicians to heal the sick is not a function of aspecial oath they take, an obligation of reciproc-ity to the society that trained them, or a contrac-tual promise that they make in return for remu-neration. It is because all creatures of God areunder the divine imperative to help God pre-serve and protect what is his. That is neither the only possible conclusion nor the obvious one from the Bible. Since Godannounces himself as our healer in many placesin the Bible, 18perhaps medicine is an improper human intervention in God's decision to inflictillness or bring healing, indeed, an act of humanhubris. The rabbis were aware of this line of reason- ing, but they counteracted it by pointing out thatit is God who authorizes us and, in fact, requiresus to heal. They found that authorization andthat imperative in two biblical verses. Accordingto Exodus 21:19-20, an assailant must insurethat his victim is \"thoroughly healed,\" andDeuteronomy 22:2 requires the finder to\"restore the lost property to him.\" The Talmudunderstands the Exodus verse as giving permis-sion for the physician to cure. On the basis of anextra letter in the Hebrew text of theDeuteronomy passage, the Talmud declares thatthat verse includes the obligation to restoreanother person's body as well as her property,and hence there is an obligation to come to theaid of someone else in a life-threatening situa-tion. On the basis of Leviticus 19:16 (\"Nor shallyou stand idly by the blood of your fellow\"), theTalmud expands the obligation to provide med- ical aid to encompass expenditure of financialresources for this purpose. And fourteenth-cen-tury Rabbi Moses ben Nahman (Nahmanides)understands the obligation to care for othersthrough medicine as one of many applications of the Torah's principle, \"And you shall love yourneighbor as yourself\" (Leviticus 19:18). 19 Medical experts, in turn, have special obliga- tions because of their expertise. Thus RabbiJoseph Caro (1488-1575), the author of one of the most important Jewish codes, says this: The Torah gave permission to the physician to heal; moreover, this is a religious precept and is includ-ed in the category of saving life, and if the physicianwithholds his services, it is considered as sheddingblood. 20 The following rabbinic story indicates that the rabbis recognized the theological issue involvedin medical care, but it also indicates the clearassertion of the Jewish tradition that the physi-cian's work is legitimate and, in fact, obligatory: Just as if one does not weed, fertilize, and plow, the trees will not produce fruit, and if fruit is producedbut is not watered or fertilized, it will not live butdie, so with regard to the body. Drugs and medica-ments are the fertilizer, and the physician is thetiller of the soil. 21 This is a remarkable concept, for it declares that God does not bring about all healing or cre-ativity on his own, but rather depends upon usto aid in the process and commands us to try.We are, in the talmudic phrase, God's agents and partners in the ongoing act of creation. 22 INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSCIENCE The Jewish tradition, perhaps more than any other, has used legal methods to make moraldecisions. The underlying Jewish belief is thatGod declared his will at Sinai and specifically commanded that we not add or detract from itlegislatively but that we apply it to concrete situ-ations judicially (Deuteronomy 4:2; 13:1;17:8-13; see also Exodus 18 and 5THEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONS1:9-18). The rabbinic tradition understood that judicial mandate broadly, with the result thatrabbinic law is much more voluminous anddetailed than biblical law is. The Torah (the fivebooks of Moses), in other words, is the constitu- tion of the Jewish people, and rabbinic interpre-tations and rulings function as legislation andjudicial rulings do in American law. Custom isalso an important source of Jewish law. 23 Most decisions that Americans would call moral, then, are part and parcel of the legal sys-tem in Judaism. So, for example, if one wantedto know whether it is moral to abort a fetus or towithdraw life-support systems, one would askone's rabbi, the local expert in Jewish law, andhe (or she, in recent decades) would look up thequestion in the legal resources of the Jewish tra-dition. If there is some disagreement among pre-vious or contemporary rabbis who ruled on suchcases, or if there are complications in the specif-ic case at hand, the rabbi would use standardlegal methods in deciding that specific case. Therabbi might also consult another rabbi withacknowledged expertise in the area. The lay Jew,then, would follow the ruling of her rabbi for both communal and theological reasons. That methodology and rationale still holds for Orthodox and Conservative Jews, at least in the-ory and often in practice, for both of thosebranches of Judaism hold that Jewish law isbinding. The Reform movement, however,champions individual autonomy, so moral deci- sions are totally a matter of what the individualthinks is right. He may consult a rabbi, but therabbi's words will not be authoritative law butan individual's advice\u2014albeit an individual withexpertise in the Jewish tradition. There are also moral norms that require us to go beyond the limits of the law. Such moralnorms are as binding as the law is. Even thosewho conscientiously abide by Jewish law, then,might feel moral imperatives beyond what thelaw requires. For that matter, the rabbi mightrule on the basis of such imperatives in additionto the specific sources of the law, for ultimatelywe are commanded to \"do what is right andgood in the eyes of the Lord\" (Deuteronomy6:18). 24 THERELATIVE AUTHORITY OF THE PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT Because the body belongs to God, each person is duty-bound to seek both preventive and curative medical care and to follow the expert'sadvice in preserving one's health. Physicians, inturn, are required to elicit the patient's coopera-tion by ensuring that the patient understandsand agrees to the therapy. When several forms oftherapy are medically legitimate but offer differ-ent benefits and burdens, the patient has theright to choose which regimen to follow, as long as it fits within the rubric of Jewish law. 25 On the other hand, patients do not have the right to demand of their physicians forms of treatment that, in the judgment of the physi-cians, are medically unnecessary, unwise, or futile or that violate their own understanding ofJewish law. That is, physicians are just as much full partners in medical care as are patients. So,for example, if a patient asks for an amniocente-sis in order to know the gender of the fetus sothat she can abort it if its gender is undesirable,the physician not only may, but should refuseboth the amniocentesis and the abortion when those are the only grounds. CLINICAL I SSUES Self-determination and informed consent In general, the respect that we must show each other as people created in God's image would 6THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE PATIENT -CAREGIVER RELATIONSHIPrequire that physicians take the time to inform their patients about both the preventive andcurative steps necessary for their care so thatthey can make informed decisions. At the sametime, physicians need not inform their patientsof alternatives that are, in their estimation, med-ically futile. To this point the Jewish andAmerican traditions agree. The two traditions, however, address these matters to different degrees. American law putsgreat emphasis on patient autonomy; physicians must, therefore, inform patients of every possi-ble mishap for fear of being sued if the patientconsented to the procedure without that knowl-edge. The Jewish tradition trusts physiciansmore than contemporary American law does;indeed, suits against physicians are virtuallyunheard of in the annals of Jewish law.Moreover, Jewish sources are concerned aboutthe patient's mental health as much as her phys-ical health. Consequently, the Jewish traditionwould advise against physicians telling theirpatients absolutely everything that might gowrong in a procedure. When the probability ofproblems occurring is slight, maintaining thepatient's good spirits would generally outweighthe need to provide information about unlikelyoutcomes. Truth-telling and confidentiality Judaism strongly values telling the truth, and the Bible itself admonishes, \"stay far away from anylie.\" 26At the same time, Judaism teaches that truth is not the only value, nor is it an absolute one. Inhard cases, truth-telling must be weighed againstother moral goods. So, for example, when tellingthe truth will only harm a person and not produceany good, one must choose to remain silent oreven gild the lily. A bride, then, is to be describedon her wedding day as beautiful no matter howshe looks, for tact in such circumstances takesprecedence over truth. 27On the other hand, when writing a letter of recommendation for a job, thewriter must reveal the applicant's weaknesses rele-vant to the job, for those may have a practicaleffect on the welfare of others.Similar guidelines apply to the caregiver- patient relationship. By and large, patients dobetter when they know what to expect; they feel infantilized and undermined when relevant fac-tors about their disease are hidden from them ormisrepresented. In general, then, patients shouldbe told the truth calmly, clearly, and tactfully. If the patient's disease is incurable, he should be told; caregivers should describe how the patient's family, friends, rabbi, and other care-givers can help him cope physically, emotionally, and spiritually. The patient's welfare, however,takes precedence over the truth in such cases.Thus, it is reasonable when the physician\u2014or parents in the case of a child\u2014decide that thepatient would be better off not knowing. Duecare, though, must be given when consideringwhat is best for the patient. Proxy decisions (advance directives) and living wills Jewish law would allow Jews to write an advance directive nominating someone else to makemedical decisions for a patient when she cannotdo so personally. The proxy, of course, wouldhave no more authority in Jewish law to makemedical decisions than the patient would have,and here it is important to remember thatJewish sources give the physician, as the med- ical expert caring for God's property, moreauthority relative to the patient or the surrogatethan American law does. Still, Jews may appointrepresentatives to guide their health care. In addition, Jews may fill out a living will to indicate how they would want decisions to bemade in a variety of circumstances. In fact, all ofthe denominations of American Judaism havepublished such documents for the use of theirconstituents. Each reflects the particular denom-ination's understanding of the content anddegree of authority of Jewish law. 7 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERTHEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSUNDERL YING PRINCIPLES Marriage and children are the epitome of blessing in the Jewish view.28\"Our Rabbis taught: A man without a wife lives withoutblessing, without life, without joy, withouthealth, and without peace.\" 29A later mystical source carries this one step further: \"The divinepresence can rest only upon a married manbecause an unmarried man is but half a man and the divine presence does not rest upon thatwhich is imperfect.\" 30So important is it for a man to take a wife that \"One may sell a scroll ofthe Torah for the purpose of [having enoughmoney to] marry.\" 31 Sexual relations have two distinct purposes, both rooted in biblical commands. The very first of the Torah's commands is that given toAdam and Eve, \"Be fruitful and multiply.\" Procreation, then, is a commandment. It is also a blessing. In rabbinic interpretation, forexegetical and probably economic reasons, it isthe man who bears the responsibility to propa-gate, even though men obviously cannot do sowithout women. A man fulfills that obligationwhen he fathers at least two children. Becausewe are supposed to model ourselves after God,we should create as God did in the first chapterof Genesis (1:27), that is, create at least onemale and one female child. Two children,though, is a minimum; couples are supposed tohave as many children as possible. 32 Sexual intercourse is also understood to be a vital part of the pleasure and companionship ofmarriage. The Torah therefore declares thatwhen a man marries a woman, \"her food, herclothing, and her conjugal rights he may notdiminish\" (Exodus 21:10). Contrary to mostother ancient traditions, then, Judaism from itsearliest sources recognized that women havesexual needs as much as men do and legitimat-ed the satisfaction of those needs within mar-riage. 33CLINICAL I SSUES Masturbation With the importance of marriage and children in mind, one can understand that traditionalJudaism looked askance at interruptions in theprocess of conception and birth. Normally onewas supposed to marry and have children.Masturbation, birth control, sterilization, andabortion were, both physically and ideologically,counterproductive. Jews historically shared the abhorrence of masturbation that characterized other societies,but legal writers had difficulty locating a biblicalbasis for it. Maimonides claimed that it could not be punishable by the court because there is not an explicit commandment forbidding it. 34As he makes clear, the prohibition was based in part onassumptions about the medical consequences ofejaculation and also on concerns about self-pol-lution and murder of unborn generations. 35 In modern times, many Orthodox Jews retain these beliefs and prohibitions, but Conservative,Reform, and unaffiliated Jews largely do not. Todate there have not been official positions ofthese movements validating masturbation, but inpractice any prohibition with regard to it islargely ignored. Contraception Despite the command to have two children andthe ideal of having more, and despite the tradi-tional prohibition against \"wasting the seed,\"contraception is permitted and even requiredunder certain circumstances. In general, the tra-dition understands the command to procreate tobe the obligation of the male and not the female. This, together with the prohibitionagainst masturbation, means that male forms ofcontraception are generally not permitted, butfemale methods sometimes are. 36 In contemporary times, when many men and women pursue extended education and initiate acareer before getting married, modern move- 8FAMILY , SEXUALITY , AND PROCREATIONTHEPARKRIDGE CENTERments have varied widely in their response to the desire for family planning. Some allow cou-ples to use contraception even before they havechildren, and this has been the practice of the vast majority of Jews. Because of the loss of one-third of the Jewish population during theHolocaust, however, and because of the highrate of intermarriage and the extremely lowbirth rate among Jews, Jewish religious leadershave increasingly stressed the need for Jews toprocreate. Moreover, couples are well advised tobegin childbearing by their late twenties, if pos- sible, to avoid the increased chances of infertilityand birth defects that come with age. These fac-tors have tempered an otherwise liberalapproach to contraception on the part of manynon-Orthodox rabbis and most Jews. As we shallsee, Judaism restricts the legitimacy of abortionto cases where the life or health of the mother isat stake, and so those forms of contraceptionthat prevent conception in the first place (e.g.,diaphragm, pill) are preferred over those thatabort the fertilized egg cell (zygote) after the fact(e.g., RU-486). Sterilization The same concerns govern the issue of steriliza- tion, although there another issue arises, name-ly, the prohibition against a person mutilatinghis body in light of the fact that the body isreally God's property. Vasectomies and tubal lig-ations are rather new procedures, and so only afew responsa deal with them. Both traditional and liberal respondents forbid male sterilizationon the basis of the rabbinic interpretation andextension Leviticus 22:24, \"That which is mauled or crushed or torn or cutyou shall not offer unto the Lord; nor shall youdo this in your land.\" 38They are more permis- sive about female sterilization, both because awoman does not come under those prohibitionsand also because she is not legally obligated toprocreate. 39All sources agree, however, that even male sterilization is permitted and perhaps evenrequired if necessary to preserve the man's lifeor health. Moreover, even though I am notaware of any written opinion that would allow this practice, since vasectomy is far easier andsafer than tying a woman's tubes, I could imag-ine an argument consistent with Jewish law andprinciples that would permit a vasectomy whenpregnancy would entail a severe risk to theman's wife. After all, vasectomy does not amountto castration or to crushing the testes, and so thebiblical verses cited above are not directly vio-lated by the operation. The question, though,would be whether pregnancy could be effective-ly prevented by other means that would notendanger the woman and would not even possi-bly violate the verses cited. If so, then suchmeans would undoubtedly be preferable. Abortion and the status of the fetus In conflict situations, there is a clear bias for life within the Jewish tradition. Indeed, it is consid-ered sacred. Consequently, although abortion ispermitted in some circumstances and actuallyrequired in others, it is not viewed as a morallyneutral matter of individual desire or an accept-able form of post facto birth control. Contrary to what many contemporary Jews think, Judaismrestricts the legitimacy of abortion to a narrowrange of cases; it does not give blanket permis-sion to abort. Judaism does not see all abortion as murder because rabbinic sources understand the process of gestation developmentally. According to theTalmud, within the first forty days after concep- tion the zygote is \"simply water.\" 40Another talmudic first trimesterfrom the remainder of gestation. 41These mark- ing points are not based on a theory of ensoul-ment at a particular moment in the uterus, butrather on the physical development of the fetus.These demarcations effectively make abortion during the early periods permitted for more reasons than during the rest of pregnancy. 42 9THEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSThe fetus does not attain the full rights and protections of a human being until birth, specifi-cally when the forehead emerges or, in a breechbirth, when most of the body emerges. 43The mother, of course, has full human status.Consequently, if the fetus threatens the life orhealth of the mother, then it may and in somecases must be aborted, as the following Mishnahgraphically stipulates: If a woman has [life-threatening] difficulty in child- birth, one dismembers the embryo in her, limb bylimb, because her life takes precedence over its life.Once its head [or its \"greater part\"] has emerged, itmay not be touched, for we do not set aside one lifefor another. 44 While all Jewish sources would permit and even require abortion in order to preserve thelife or organs of the mother, authorities differwidely on how much of a threat to a woman'shealth the fetus must pose to justify or requirean abortion. 45Based on a responsum by Rabbi Israel Meir Mizrahi in the late seventeenth cen-tury, 46many modern authorities also permit an abortion to preserve the mother's mental health,and this has been variously construed in narrowor lenient terms in modern times. To the extentthat Jewish law makes special provision for anunusually young or old mother, an unmarriedmother, the victim of a rape, or the participantin an incestuous or adulterous union, abortion isconstrued to preserve the mother's mentalhealth. 47 There is no justification in the traditional sources for aborting a fetus because of thehealth of the fetus; only the mother's health is aconsideration. As a result, some people object toperforming an amniocentesis, especially whenthe intent is to determine whether to abort amalformed fetus. 48Others reason in precisely the opposite direction; they justify abortion of adefective fetus on the basis of preserving themother's mental health where it is clear that themother is not able to cope with the prospect ofbearing or raising such a child. 49Many Conservative and Reform rabbis, and even a few contemporary Orthodox rabbis, havehandled the matter in a completely differentway. They reason that traditional sources recog-nize only threats to the mother's health asgrounds for abortion because until recently it was impossible to know anything about thegenetic or medical make-up of the fetus beforebirth. Our new medical knowledge, they say,ought to establish the fetus's health as an inde-pendent consideration. 50 Abortion is particularly problematic for the contemporary Jewish community because Jews arebarely reproducing themselves in Israel and arefalling far short of that in North America, wherethe Jewish reproductive rate is approximately 1.6 or 1.7 children per couple. Consequently, even rabbis who are liberal in their interpretationof Jewish abortion law are also calling for Jews tomarry and to have children. NEW REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES Artificial insemination Since Judaism prizes children so much, it is no wonder that rabbinic authorities have permittedrecourse to artificial assistance in having them.Nevertheless some have objections to some ofthe procedures. When the semen of a man is united artificially with his wife's ovum, there are no objectionswhatsoever. 51This may be done by inserting the man's sperm into the woman's uterus directly orby uniting their sperm and ovum in a test tubeand then inserting the fertilized egg cell into thewoman's uterus. Because of Judaism's apprecia-tion of medicine as an aid to God, there is noabhorrence of such means merely because theyare artificial. The only issue is the means bywhich the husband's sperm is obtained: someOrthodox rabbis prefer that it be collected fromthe vaginal cavity after intercourse rather thanthrough masturbation to insure that there is no\"destruction of the seed in vain,\" and othersrequire that the man wear a condom with some 10small holes in it during sexual intercourse so that there is at least a chance that his wifewould be impregnated through their intercourse.Most others, however, permit masturbation forthis purpose on the ground that the man's ejac-ulation to produce semen for artificial insemina-tion of his wife is not \"in vain.\" 52 The matter becomes more complicated when the donor is not the husband. Some rabbisobject to such procedures on grounds of adul-tery. For others, however, it is called adulteryonly when the intercourse is conventional,rather than a laboratory procedure where theintent to have an illicit relationship is absent. 53 More commonly, the objection to donor insemination is based on the fear for the nextgeneration: that the progeny of the act maycommit unintentional incest\u2014a violation of theTorah's laws against incest (Leviticus 18, 20). Even for those who would invoke the lack of intent to excuse the couple from those laws,there still remains a critical health concern\u2014namely, the increased likelihood among consan-guineous unions of genetic diseases transferringfrom one generation to the next; this was aprime concern of the Conservative Movement'sCommittee on Jewish Law and Standards. 54 This issue dissolves if the semen donor is known or if the donor would not likely be amarital partner for someone in the Jewish com-munity. It was on the latter basis that prominentOrthodox Rabbi Moshe Feinstein ruled thatdonor insemination would be permissible if thedonor were not Jewish, decreasing sharply thelikelihood that progeny would meet and marrybecause, in his community, intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews was rare. Those Orthodox Jews who will use donor inseminationwill therefore often require that the donor be anon-Jew. The Conservative Movement's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards has approved my rab- binic ruling, according to which donor insemina-tion is permissible if the identity of the donor ismade known or, lacking that, enough is knownabout him so that the child can avoid uninten-tional incest in his or her choice of sexual part- ners (married or not) and can know as much aspossible about his or her family traits, both med-ically and characterologically. In view of the psy-chological problems, however, that may ensue for the child, the donor, and the parents who raisethe child (the \"social parents\"), all parties to theinsemination should seek and receive appropri-ate counseling. 55 Some Orthodox rabbis have voiced concern about an entirely different matter\u2014namely, themorality of using someone else's body or semenin this way. Others worry that artificial insemina-tion will increase the prospects of widespreadlicentiousness. Rabbi Jakobovits, former ChiefRabbi of the British Commonwealth, voicesthese moral concerns in strong language: If Jewish law nevertheless opposes A.I.D. [artificial insemination by a donor] without reservation asutterly evil, it is mainly for moral reasons, notbecause of the intrinsic illegality of the act itself. The principal motives for the revulsion against the practice is the fear of the abuses to which its legal-ization would lead, however great the benefits maybe in individual cases. By reducing human genera- tion to stud-farming methods, A.I.D. severs the linkbetween the procreation of children and marriage, indispensable to the maintenance of the family asthe most basic and sacred unit of human society. Itwould enable women to satisfy their craving forchildren without the necessity to have homes or husbands. It would pave the way to a disastrousincrease of promiscuity, as a wife, guilty of adultery,could always claim that a pregnancy which her hus-band did not, or was unable to, cause was broughtabout by A.I.D., when in fact she had adulterousrelations with another man. Altogether, the genera-tion of children would become arbitrary andmechanical, robbed of those mystic and intimatelyhuman qualities which make man a partner withGod in the creative propagation of the race. 56 Needless to say, this was not the view of the morality of donor insemination embedded in myrabbinic ruling, primarily because the procedure 11 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERmost often is used for the sacred moral purpose of having a child when that is not possiblethrough the couple's sexual intercourse. Egg donation The considerations described above with regard to donor insemination apply as well to egg dona-tion. If the identity of the egg donor remainsconfidential, the same problems arise withregard to possible unintentional incest in thenext generation, and the same solutions by thevarious rabbinic authorities apply. Specifically,either the egg donor's identity should be sharedwith the couple who will raise the child and ulti-mately with the child herself, or the womanshould be a non-Jew, or enough about the bio-logical mother must be shared with the coupleand child to enable the child to avoid uninten-tional incest and to know about her biologicalroots. Moreover, psychological counseling isappropriate for all concerned before the proce-dure and if problems arise in its aftermath. Egg donation, though, raises some additional problems. Donor insemination poses virtually nomedical risks to the semen donor, but that is nottrue of the egg donor. In order to procure asmany eggs as possible during each attempt, thedonor must be hyperovulated with drugs, andthere is some evidence that repeated hyperovu-lation increases the risk of ovarian cancer. 57This is especially troubling since the donor herselfwill not, by hypothesis, be gaining a child of herown but will rather be helping another couple have a child. For as much as Jewish law prizesprocreation, it values the life and health of thosealready born even more. Consequently, whileotherwise healthy women may undergo the pro-cedure to donate eggs once or twice, they shouldnot do so much more than that, unless subse-quent studies allay the fear of increased cancerrisk. Normally, a child is defined as Jewish in tra- ditional Jewish law if born to a Jewish woman.In cases of egg donation, however, some rabbishave maintained that it is the donor of thegametes who is the legal mother. Most, though,have ruled that even if the egg comes from some other woman, as it does in egg donation, it is thebearing mother whose religion determines whether the child is Jewish or not, 58and this has been the stance adopted by the Conservative Movement's Committee on Jewish Law andStandards. 59 In vitro fertilization (IVF), gamete intrauterine fallopian transfer (GIFT),zygote intrauterine fallopian transfer (ZIFT) When a couple cannot conceive a fetus through sexual intercourse, even when assisted by timingtheir intercourse, by stimulating the ovaries, orby surgery to correct a problem in either theman or the woman, and when the couple prefersto use their own gametes to those of donors,they may try any of a number of new techniques,some of which are listed in the title of this sec-tion. Since the Jewish tradition does not frownupon the use of artificial means to enable peo-ple to attain permissible ends, much less sancti-fied ones like having a child, the mechanicalnature of these techniques is not an issue. Onthe contrary, the important thing to note inrecent Jewish rulings is that infertile couples arenot obligated to use these means to fulfill theman's duty to procreate, even though they maychoose to do so. 60 Surrogate motherhood Surrogate motherhood is really two different forms of overcoming infertility: traditional orovum-surrogacy, in which the surrogate mother's own egg is fertilized by the sperm of the man in the couple who are trying to have a baby (pre-sumably not the husband of the surrogate); andgestational surrogacy, in which both the egg andthe sperm are those of the couple, and the sur-rogate mother's womb is used to carry and deliv-er the baby. Since in ovum-surrogacy the surro-gate mother supplies her own gametes (geneticmaterials), her claim to the baby is greater thanthat of a gestational surrogate. Custody battles sofar in American law, although few, have there-fore given some consideration to the claim of an 12 THEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSovum-surrogate for custody of the child but vir- tually none to a gestational surrogate. From a Jewish perspective, this method of overcoming infertility, or at least something much akin to it, is among the oldest waysrecorded in the Jewish tradition. Sarai (laterSarah), after all, gives her handmaid Hagar toAbram (later Abraham) specifically to conceive ason who would be attributed to Sarai, andRachel and Leah likewise have their handmaidsconceive children with their husband Jacob. 61 These handmaids are all, in modern terminolo- gy, ovum-surrogates, and even so, because the handmaid belonged to the man's wife, the Bibleattributes the child to the wife. Unlike these biblical cases, modern surrogates choose to serve in that role, but surrogate moth- erhood nevertheless raises difficult emotionaland legal problems. These include the following:(1) What happens if the surrogate motherchanges her mind in the middle of the pregnan- cy and wants to keep the baby? (2) Can awoman make a binding contract to terminateher parental rights to a child not yet conceivedwith full intent and with no equivocation, asrequired by Jewish law? 62(3) In light of Jewish law's strong insistence on preserving one'shealth and life, may one legally bind oneself inJewish law to a course of action involving physi- cal danger? (4) Is surrogacy just another form ofbaby buying? (5) Should there be any relation-ship between the surrogate mother and the cou-ple, or should their identities be withheld fromeach other? Should there be any relationshipbetween the surrogate mother and the offspring? (6) Should the child undergo the rites of conver-sion to assure his or her Jewish identity? 63(7) If the woman who is to serve as the surrogatemother is married, does implanting anotherman's sperm in her (in traditional surrogacy) orthe gametes of both members of a couple (ingestational surrogacy) constitute adultery, and isit therefore prohibited? All of these issues, then, raise some concerns about the way in which a surrogacy arrangementshould be handled, but they do not ultimatelyprohibit it. Specifically, the couple must abide by civil law in their region and, in light of therecency of this matter in most systems of law,the couple must be informed of the possibility oflegal challenges. 64Furthermore, Jewish law would require that steps be taken to insure thatthe surrogate mother has full and informedintent to abide by the agreement\u2014perhaps, inovum-surrogacy, at least, by giving her a period of time (usually thirty days) after birth to cancelthe agreement. 65The surrogate mother must not have physical or other conditions that wouldmake pregnancy dangerous for her beyond therisks normally associated with pregnancy. In ovum-surrogacy, the child must either be told the identity of the woman whose gametes heinherited or at least be given enough informa-tion to be able to avoid incest and to knowabout his physical and characterological back-ground. Within these parameters, the few rabbis who have written on the subject have generallypermitted surrogacy. 66 There are undoubtedly other problems that will arise as reproductive medical proceduresbecome more sophisticated. On the other hand, as medicine learns more about how to helpinfertile couples, some of the new proceduresmay become unnecessary, and whatever moralproblems they raise will then become moot.While rabbis have sanctioned the new, artificial methods of conception in varying degrees, theyclearly prefer methods that will help the couplehave children through their own sexual inter-course\u2014as the couples undoubtedly prefer aswell. Then the emotional values of coitus andreproduction can be preserved, and the medicalintervention is solely to aid a natural process. Adoption When a couple cannot have children, adoption is an available and honored option. Rabbiniclaw did not have the institution of adoption assuch, but it provided for the approximate equiv-alent. The Rabbinic court, \"the father of allorphans,\" 67appoints guardians for orphans and children in need, and the guardians have the 13 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERTHEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSsame responsibilities as natural parents have. They are credited by the Talmud with doing right at all times: \"Happy are they who act justly, who do right at all times\" (Psalms 106:3). Is it possible to do right atall times? ...Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said: This refers to a person who brings up an orphan boy orgirl in his house and [ultimately] enables the orphan to marry. 68 Contrary to modern adoption, however, in Jewish law the natural parents continue to have the same obligations to the child as does theguardian, and the personal status of the child inmatters of Jewish identity, ritual, and marriagedepends upon the status of the natural parents. 69 One Rabbinic source, however, states that thepeople who raise the child, and not the naturalfather and mother, are called the parents, 70and the Conservative Movement's Committee onJewish Law and Standards has ruled that both the biological and the social parents are to beconsidered the child's parents, although in dif-ferent respects. 71 Prenatal diagnosis and treatment Both for their own good and for that of their fetuses, pregnant women should seek and getprenatal care. They should also take the preven-tive measures that modern medicine recom-mends to insure a healthy baby, by avoidingalcohol, smoking, and some prescription drugs;avoiding toxins (for example, in paints) and peo- ple with specific diseases (for example, Germanmeasles) that have been shown to cause fetaldamage; and adopting generally health-promot-ing habits of eating, hygiene, exercise, and sleep.Since women untrained in medicine may not beaware of the special risk factors for pregnancy inherent in certain conditions, women should besure to share with their obstetricians as muchinformation about their medical history andeveryday life as possible so that appropriatesteps can be taken to avoid problems for boththemselves and their fetuses.More on this whole topic will be discussed in the section on genetics below. Care of severely handicapped newborns Once children are born, they are full-fledgedhuman beings and must be treated in theirhealth care like all other human beings. That istrue for disabled newborns (or adults, for thatmatter) just as much as it is for those with nodisabilities. The image of God in each of us doesnot depend upon our abilities or skills; in thisrespect, the Jewish way of evaluating life is dis-tinctly at odds with the utilitarian way. Heroic measures need not be employed, how- ever, to keep alive children born with severe dis-abilities that threaten their lives. Here the samerules that govern the withholding and removalof life-support systems from any human beingapply to newborns, with all of the diversity ofopinion among rabbis noted in that sectionbelow (see \"Forgoing life-sustaining treatment\"). Some rabbis, however, are more lenient withrespect to the treatment of newborns than theyare regarding people dying later on in lifebecause of the possibility, noted in Jewish law, that the child was born prematurely. Specifically,until the child is thirty days old, she is not con-sidered to be a person whose life is confirmed (abar kayyama ). Therefore, while we certainly may not do anything actively to hasten the child'sdeath, we may, according to these authorities, doless to sustain it than we would be called uponto do with regard to individuals who livedbeyond thirty days. Thus even those who would insist on artificial nutrition and hydration formost dying people would not require it for life-imperiled infants less than thirty days old\u2014except, of course, if the intervention holds outsignificant promise of curing the infant of thedisease or condition. Some would require incu-bators, but most would not require surgery ormedications beyond those necessary to relievethe child of pain. 72 14THEPARKRIDGE CENTERAs explained above, the Jewish tradition assumes that God controls who lives or dies and who is healthy or sick, but God also com-mands us both to take preventive measures toward off illness and to seek to cure illness when itoccurs. These commands are part of our generalobligation to protect our bodies that remain God'sproperty throughout our lives and even in death. When applied to modern issues in genetics, these principles require us to balance that whichis a permitted human intervention in theprocess of curing illness or enhancing lifeagainst that which is an interdicted humanattempt to play God. As our ability to geneticallyalter people's lives increases, that balance isbecoming harder and harder to strike. GENETIC RESEARCH Because Ashkenazic Jews (those whose ances- tors lived in Eastern Europe) constituted a rela-tively small, inbred population, and becauseJews greatly respect medical research and there- fore volunteer to participate in studies, there area number of genetic diseases known to be moreprevalent among Ashkenazic Jews than the gen-eral population. This in and of itself has causeda problem, for Jews worry that they will be iden-tified as an especially sick population simplybecause scientists know more about the diseases to which they are prone. Such an identificationcould lead to discrimination in health insuranceand employment. Despite these dangers, Jews, in line with the great value that their tradition places on research and cure, may and do readily partici-pate in genetic research. We certainly want tohelp in the effort to find ways to cure geneticdiseases through new techniques of geneticengineering. At the same time, the Holocaustmakes Jews very wary of the possibility thatthose very same techniques will be used to cre-ate a master race, however that is defined. Thuswe as a society must simultaneously work to acquire the genetic engineering tools to curediseases while finding ways to ensure that thisnew technology will be used only for cure andnot for eugenics. CLINICAL I SSUES Genetic screening and counseling Descendants of the Jews of Eastern Europe have ten times the chance of inheriting Tay-Sachsdisease that members of the general populationhave, even though only 3 percent of Jews ofEastern European origin are carriers. Sincegenetic screening for Tay-Sachs became avail-able, repeated educational sessions and noticesin public media have reminded young Jews tohave genetic screening for the disease. There isa concerted call for Jewish couples, in particular,to undergo genetic testing for Tay-Sachs beforemarriage to determine whether either or bothare carriers. The disease is lethal within the firstfew years of life, and at present the only remedyfor a fetus with Tay-Sachs is abortion. Accordingto the vast majority of rabbis of all denomina-tions, abortion of a fetus with a genetic diseaselike Tay-Sachs is warranted. As a result, coupleswho are both carriers may choose to test eachfetus for the disease and abort those affected.Moreover, couples who are both carriers may actprophylactically by using in vitro fertilization,selecting to implant only those embryos that willnot suffer from the disease. A few rabbis in the Orthodox community object to genetic testing for Tay-Sachs becausethey object to abortion on any grounds not direct-ly relevant to the life or health of the mother.They also define her \"mental health\" more nar- rowly than do most rabbis, even most Orthodoxones. Presumably, when it becomes possible tocure such diseases in utero , even such rabbis would permit genetic screening, for then the testwould not potentially\u2014or, at least, would not nec- 15GENETICSTHEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSessarily\u2014be a motivation for abortion. While abortion of such fetuses is permitted, no active measures may be taken to hastendeath once the child is born, and both child andparents must wait out the ravages of the disease. Jews with a family history of any other less common but fatal genetic disease should betested for it as well. Where there is concernregarding non-lethal genetic diseases, geneticscreening may be done, and a decision maythen be made whether to abort the child. So,for example, familial dysautonomia or Riley-Day Syndrome is very debilitating and is fatalbefore age 30 in approximately half of all cases. Since familial dysautonomia afflicts AshkenazicJews at the same rate as Tay-Sachs, and since a genetic test for the disease has just recentlybeen created, Ashkenazic Jewish couples should be alerted to test for it, just as they do for Tay- Sachs. If the fetus will suffer from DownsSyndrome, some couples may choose to abort it on the grounds that the couple\u2014officially, themother\u2014cannot stand the thought of bearingsuch a child, let alone rearing it, while othersmay choose to bear and raise the child. It is aborderline case of maternal mental health for it presents the challenge of raising a child lovinglyand effectively despite disabilities. In addition,Ashkenazic Jews are largely unaware that theyare even more prone to Gaucher's Disease thanto familial dysautonomia. Gaucher's, however, isnot fatal, and so testing for it is not nearly ascritical. Sex selection When we analyze amniotic fluid for the pres- ence of diseases, we learn many other thingsabout the child, including gender, eye color,and so forth. It is not permissible, according toall interpreters of Jewish law, to abort a childjust because parents want a child of the oppo-site gender. On the other hand, since the Jewishmandate to procreate requires producing mini-mally a child of each gender, if a family haschildren of only one gender, some authorities would allow choosing an embryo in in vitro fer-tilization that will produce a child of the oppo- site gender. Selective reduction When a woman is impregnated with three or more fetuses, either naturally or artificially, anabortion is medically indicated in order to pre-serve both the life of the mother and the viabilityand health of the remaining fetuses. Thereforesuch abortions are permitted and possibly evenrequired. When it can be determined throughgenetic testing that some of the fetuses have agreater chance to survive and to be healthy than others, then it is permissible to abort those lesslikely to survive. This is the same criterion to beused for triage decisions made at the end of life.If all of the fetuses are equally viable, the abor-tions must be done on a random basis. Gene therapy While gene therapy is relatively new and is avail- able only in limited areas, some principles havealready emerged in Jewish discussions of thistopic. Techniques of genetic therapy, for exam-ple, can cure such conditions as hydrocephaluswhile the fetus is still within the womb of itsmother. Further research holds out the hopethat other diseases will also be amenable totreatment in utero. There is already generalagreement among rabbis that the legitimacy ofhuman intervention to effect cure extends toprocedures within the womb as well. 73When used in this therapeutic way, genetic engineeringis an unmitigated blessing. The same techniques may be used, however, to screen out traits that are deemed merelyundesirable by certain individuals or groups.How do we determine when we are using genet-ics appropriately to aid God in ongoing, divineacts of cure and creation, and when, on theother hand, we are usurping the proper preroga-tives of God to determine the nature of creation?When do we cease to act as the servants of God and pretend instead to be God? Our moral perplexity about genetic engineer- ing does not mean that research into it should 16GENERAL PRINCIPLES When considering the transplantation of an organ from a dead person, the overriding principles of honoring the dead ( kavod work in tandem. That is, saving a person's life is so sacreda value in Judaism that if a person's organ can beused to save someone else's life, it is actually anhonor to the deceased person. That is certainlythe case if the person completed an advancedirective, either orally or in writing, indicatingwillingness to have portions of her body transplant-ed;but even if not, the default assumption is that a person would be honored to help another live. In the case of living donors, the command to save lives ( pikkuah nefesh) requires all Jews who can donate blood with virtually no risk to them-selves to do so on a regular basis. Donatingblood is especially imperative now that new sur-gical procedures have increased the need for blood, thereby reducing blood supplies nation-wide and forcing some surgeries to be postponedor canceled. 74When the risk to the donor is greater, as in donating bone marrow and organs, Jews may undertake the risk to help others but are not required to do so because our duty topreserve our own life and health supersedes ourduty to help others. 75 CLINICAL I SSUES Living donors Since every organ donation from a living person involves surgery and therefore at least some risk,and since preserving one's own life takes prece-dence over helping someone else live, contem-porary rabbis have generally permitted, but not required, such donations when the donation canbe accomplished without a major risk to the life or health of the donor. Rabbi ImmanuelJakobovits, former Chief Rabbi of the BritishCommonwealth and author of the first compre-hensive book on Jewish medical ethics, is typi-cal. He ruled that a donor may endanger his orher life or health to supply a \"spare\" organ to arecipient whose life would thereby be saved aslong as the probability of saving the recipient'slife is substantially greater than the risk to thedonor's life or health. \"Since the mortality riskto kidney donors is estimated to be only 0.24percent and no greater than is involved in anyamputation, the generally prevailing view is topermit such donations as acts of supreme chari-ty but not as an obligation.\" 76 Cadaveric donors Although the default assumption is that a personwould be honored to help another live, there aresome restrictions. Rabbis have differed on thecircumstances under which organs may be trans-planted. The most restrictive opinion would limitdonations to cases in which there is a specificpatient before us ( lefaneinu ) for whom life or an entire physical faculty is at stake. So, for exam-ple, if the person can see out of one eye, acornea may not be removed from a dead person,according to this opinion, to restore vision in theother eye. Only if both eyes are failing, such thatthe potential recipient would lose all vision andtherefore incur increased danger to life and limb,may a transplant be performed. Moreover, thepatient for whom the organ is intended must beknown and present; donation to organ banks isnot permitted. 77 17 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERstop since the potential benefits to our life and health are enormous. It does mean, however,that we must take care in deciding how we useour new capabilities. The problem is not med- ical; it is moral. ORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATIONTHEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSThat view is definitely an extreme position. Most rabbis, including Orthodox ones, wouldexpand both the eligibility of potential recipientsand the causes for which an organ may be taken.For reasons I shall delineate in the next section, all authorities would insist that the family agreeto use their loved one's body for this purpose.Assuming such agreement, most rabbis wouldpermit the transplantation of a cornea into a per-son with vision in only one eye on the groundsthat impaired vision poses enough of a risk tothe potential recipient to justify surgical invasionof the corpse to obtain the cornea. Some wouldnot require that the recipient be nearby andready for transplantation, but only that he or shebe identified. In these days of organ banks, how- ever, most rabbis would be satisfied when thereis sufficient demand for the organ that it isknown that it will eventually, but definitely, beused for purposes of transplantation. So, forexample, the Rabbinical Assembly, the organiza-tion of Conservative rabbis, approved a resolu-tion in 1990 to \"encourage all Jews to becomeenrolled as organ and tissue donors by signingand carrying cards or drivers' licenses attesting totheir commitment of such organs and tissuesupon their deaths to those in need.\" 78 The traditional practice of waiting for twenty to thirty minutes after cessation of breath andheartbeat to declare death (described in\"Determining death,\" below) would generally betoo long for doctors to be able to use thedeceased person's heart. Consequently,Conservative Rabbis Daniel C. Goldfarb andSeymour Siegel suggested in 1976 that a flatelectroencephalogram, indicating cessation ofspontaneous brain activity, be sufficient on thegrounds that this would conform to the medical practice of our time just as our ancestors deter-mined Jewish law in light of the medical prac-tice of their time. 79In 1988, the Chief Rabbinate of the State of Israel approved heart transplanta-tion, effectively accepting that a flat electroen-cephalogram guarantees that the patient can nolonger independently breathe or produce heart-beat, and that ruling has become the acceptedopinion of virtually all Jews, with the exception of a few Orthodox rabbis. 80The same considera- tion would apply to transplanting any otherorgan from a dying person, namely, whether thedoctor is accelerating the death of the donor byremoving the organ. If a flat electroencephalo-gram is confirmed, however, that concern is allayed, and removal is permissible. According to the rulings of the vast majority of rabbis who have written on donation, then,cadaveric donations of skin, corneas, kidneys,lungs, colon, liver, pancreas, ovaries, testicles,the heart, bodily tissue, and, in general, anybodily part would be permissible, and even an act of special kindness ( hesed ), since using the body to enable someone else to live with full human faculties is not a desecration of the bodybut rather a consecration of it. At its meeting inDecember 1995, the Conservative Movement'sCommittee on Jewish Law and Standardsapproved a ruling by Rabbi Joseph Proussermaking cadaveric organ donation not only anact of special kindness ( hesed ), but a positive obligation ( hovah ). The chief considerations that motivated the committee to take that positionwere the lives that can be saved through organtransplantation and the importance of ensuringthat living relatives not be pressured into mak-ing risky donations of their own organs due to ashortage of organs from cadavers. The only concern is to make sure that the donor is indeed dead before the donation takesplace. For most rabbis, including the ChiefRabbinate of the State of Israel, that means, inthe age of modern technology, the cessation ofall brain wave activity; for a few, it still requirescessation of breath and heartbeat. In recenttimes, some want to return to the old criteria tojustify transplantation from \"non-heartbeatingdonors\" even when some brain wave activity isdetectable, while others worry that this will alltoo easily motivate physicians to curtail the treat-ment of the donor. At this stage, rabbinic opinionon this new procedure has not been settled. Whichever definition of death is used, though, once death has occurred, the prohibitions against 18The Bible describes in detail the paranoid psy- chopathia and perhaps the epilepsy of King Saul, and others in the Bible and Talmud sufferfrom visual and auditory hallucinations, insanity,and \"possession by demons or spirits.\" 83Because insanity has legal implications, the Rabbis of theTalmud tried to define it as specifically as possible: Our Rabbis taught: Who is deemed an insane per- son? He who goes out alone at night, and he whospends the night in a cemetery, and he who tearshis garments. It was taught: Rabbi Huna said: hemust do all of them [to considered said: Even if [he does insane]. taught: Whois deemed insane? One who destroys everythingwhich is given to him. 84Maimonides notes, however, that these are of course to be construed as examples, not as anexhaustive definition of insanity. 85Moshe Halevi Spero, a contemporary Orthodox psychologist,suggests specific criteria for determining mentaldisorders in the cases of a person who commitssuicide or a woman who seeks an abortion orpermission to use contraceptive devices for rea-sons of mental health. \"Generally speaking,\" hewrites, \" shtus [insanity] might denote one who has lost the ability to reason or make reality-based judgments. Shtus may also signify the loss of emotional control.\" 86 The Talmud permitted lighting a candle in vio- lation of the Sabbath rules for a woman in laborin order to spare her psychic anguish. 87 Citing that precedent, Nahmanides (thirteenth century) 19 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERdesecration of the dead, deriving benefit from the dead, and delaying the burial of the dead aresuspended for the greater consideration of savingthe recipient's life or restoring his health, thusgiving even greater honor to the deceased. 81 Animal or artificial organs Because donated organs are in short supply, physicians have recently tried to use animal orartificial organs. The use of such organs wouldafford a reliable, relatively inexpensive supplyfor transplant, and it would also obviate theneed to make precise determinations of themoment of death so that a vital organ might betransplanted. From a Jewish perspective, theseare certainly great advantages. Although some have raised questions about the use of animal parts for direct transplant or formaking artificial organs, such uses are not aproblem in Jewish law or ethics. Judaism, afterall, does not demand vegetarianism, and, if wemay eat the flesh of animals under Judaism'sdietary rules ( kashrut ), then we may certainly use animal parts for saving a life. Indeed, as we haveseen, Jewish sources go further; they hold that if the use of animal parts can save a human life, wehave a moral and religious obligation to usethem. They do not even have to be from a kosheranimal, for saving a human life takes precedenceover the dietary laws. Consequently, those Jews who choose to be vegetarians (and there is sup-port for this option within the tradition) wouldnevertheless be obliged to use animal parts formedical purposes if such therapy held the great-est promise for curing a person or saving a life. While porcine valves and other animal deriv- atives have been successfully used in surgery, tosay nothing of mechanical and other artificialdevices, at present the use of animal or artificialorgans is still in an early, experimental stage.Patients who have undergone such operations have not been cured, and sometimes they havegiven up what could have been several months of life. Even so, if there is no known cure for adisease, and if an experimental drug or surgicalprocedure offers any chance for cure, Jews maychoose to use the drug or undergo the opera- tion, although they are not obligated to do so. 82 MENTAL HEALTHTHEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSspecifically included mental illness life\" ( pikkuah nefesh that almost all obligations and prohibitions could belaid aside in order to save a person's mentalhealth as well as his physical health. 88 The important thing to note here is that the Jewish tradition sees mental illness as an ill-ness and not as a moral fault. Judaism there- fore does not treat mental illness as somethingfor which one should repent or be punished,but rather as something that one should seekto prevent or cure as part of the general Jewishobligations to take care of ourselves and toheal. Because of the strong imperative within theJewish tradition to heal, medical experimen- tation is not only condoned, but prized, and theartificial nature of the cures that researchersmight concoct was never an issue. What isrequired is that the new therapy offer the hopethat the person will be helped in a way, or to anextent, that any less dangerous therapy does not,and that due experimentation on animals beconducted before the new therapy is tried onhuman beings. If the patient\u2014whether adult orchild, born or unborn\u2014suffers from an incurable illness, experimental procedures or drugs maybe used in an attempt to cure the illness, even if they pose the risk of hastening the person'sdeath or fail to effect a cure. The intention of allconcerned, though, must be to try to heal theperson and not to commit active euthanasia. If a fetus has been aborted for reasons approved by Jewish law, it may be used for pur-poses of transplantation or research. If a familymember suffers from leukemia and no appropri-ate bone marrow match is available, a marriedcouple may seek to have another child in anattempt to find such a match, but only if theywill not abort the child even if it becomes clearthat the child is not the match they seek. Theymay also choose to have a child through in vitro fertilization so that they can choose an embryothat will be a match. Clearly, they must then treat the new child not simply as a means to anend, but as their full-fledged child. A person may volunteer to undergo an exper- imental procedure that holds out no hope toimprove his or her own health but may increasemedical knowledge only if it subjects the personto minimal or no risk. One's duty to preserveone's own life takes precedence over one's obli-gation to help other people preserve theirs. Animal life is respected in the Jewish tradi- tion: one may not subject animals to unneces-sary pain. One must not, for example, yoketogether a donkey and an ox for plowing(Deuteronomy 22:10) since the much greaterstrength of the ox would inevitably cause thedonkey much pain. Animals to be used for foodmust be slaughtered according to Jewish law,which seeks to make the slaughter as quick andas humane as possible. Animals, however, occu-py a lower place on the ladder of life than human beings do. Consequently, they may andshould be used to test new drugs or proceduresintended to help human beings maintain orregain their health. It would be irresponsible, infact, not to do so. Only if a person were dyinganyway would he or she be allowed to use anexperimental drug or procedure without priortesting on animals. 20MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION AND RESEARCHGENERAL CON CEPTS AND CATEGORIES When we consider issues at the end of life, a few definitions will set the stage for the discussion. Murder is the malicious taking ofanother's life without a legal excuse such as selfdefense. Active euthanasia is a positive act withthe intention of taking another's life, but for abenign purpose, for example, to relieve the per- son from agonizing and incurable pain. Passiveeuthanasia is a refusal to intervene in theprocess of a person's natural demise. Judaism prohibits murder in all circumstances, and it views all forms of active euthanasia as theequivalent of murder. 89That is true even if the patient asks to be killed. Because each person'sbody belongs to God, the patient does not have the right either to commit suicide or to enlist theaid of others in the act, and anybody who doesaid in this plan commits murder. No humanbeing has the right to destroy or even damage God's property. 90 The patient does have the right, however, to pray to God to permit death to come,91for God, unlike human beings, has the right to destroyhis own property. Moreover, Judaism does per-mit passive euthanasia in specific circumstances,and in our day it is those circumstances that areof extreme medical interest. Unfortunately the sources in this area are sparse, for until the advent of antibiotics in 1938,physicians could do very little to prevent deathunless the problem could be cut out of thepatient surgically. Since physicians can now do agreat deal for the dying, Jews seeking moral guid- ance from the Jewish tradition must place a heavylegal burden on the few circumstances in the pastin which people thought they had an effectivechoice about whether to delay death or not. The dearth of such cases leads to considerable dis-agreement on specific clinical issues; it also posessignificant methodological questions as to howthe tradition can be legitimately accessed andapplied to contemporary circumstances so verydifferent from the past. 92CLINICAL I SSUES Determining death Classical Jewish sources use two criteria for death. One is the breath test, in which a featheris placed beneath the nostrils of the patient tosee if it moves. The exegetical bases for this testare the verses in Genesis according to which\"God breathed life into Adam\" (2:6) and theFlood killed \"all in whose nostrils is the breathof the spirit of life\" (7:22), 93but there clearly is also a cogent, practical reason for using thebreath test\u2014namely, that it is easy to administer. Later codifiers insisted on both respiratory and cardiac manifestations of death. Some evenheld that the Talmud sanctioned the breath testonly because it normally is a good indication ofthe existence of heartbeat, but actually it is thecessation of heartbeat that forms the core of theJewish definition of death. 94Moreover, in the sixteenth century Rabbi Moses Isserles ruledthat \"nowadays\" we do not know how to distin-guish death with accuracy from a fainting spell,and consequently even after the cessation ofbreath and heartbeat we should wait a period oftime before assuming that the person is dead.Some contemporary rabbis claim that we shouldstill wait twenty or thirty minutes after observingthese signs, but others claim that the availabilityof the sphygmomanometer and electrocardio-gram permit us to revert to the traditional mode of defining death as cessation of breath andheartbeat. 95 Forgoing life-sustaining treatment When does the Jewish obligation to cure end, and when does the permission\u2014according tosome, the obligation\u2014to let nature take itscourse begin? Authorities differ. All agree that one may allow nature to take its course once the personbecomes a goses , a moribund person. But when does that state begin? The most restrictive posi-tion is that of Rabbi J. David Bleich, who limitsit to situations when all possible medical means 21 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERDEATH AND DYINGare being used in an effort to save the patient, and nevertheless the physicians assume that heor she will die within seventy-two hours. 96 Others define the state of goses more flexibly as up to a year or more or in terms of symptomsrather than time, and they then apply the per-mission to withhold or withdraw machines andmedications more broadly. 97 In a rabbinic ruling approved by the Conservative Movement's Committee on JewishLaw and Standards, I noted that Jewish sourcesdescribe a goses as if the person were \"a flickering candle,\" so that he or she may not even be movedfor fear of inducing death. 98That applies only to people within the last hours of life. Consequently,I argued, the appropriate Jewish legal category todescribe people with terminal, incurable diseases,who may live for months and even years, is,instead, terefah . Permission to withhold or with- draw medications and machines would then applyto people as soon as they are in the state of beinga terefah , that is, as soon as they are diagnosed with a terminal, incurable illness. One important operating principle in these matters is this: since Jewish law does not pre-sume that human beings are omniscient, onlythe best judgment of the attending physicianscounts in these decisions. Even if some cure isjust around the corner, we are not responsiblefor knowing that. We must proceed on the bestknowledge available at the time and place athand. If the person is currently deemed incur-able, then machines and medications may bewithdrawn and palliative care administered. Artificial nutrition and hydration In our own day, people in comas are fed through tubes. All available forms of intubation areuncomfortable and pose some risk of infection,but they do give comatose patients the fluidsand nutrients they need while their bodies havea chance to recover from the coma. If the person has been comatose for a num- ber of months, however, and there seems to be little, if any, hope of recovery, may one removesuch tubes? On the one hand, just as all of usneed food and liquids, the patient needs the artificial nutrition and hydration that flowthrough the tubes. Those who see it this waymaintain that while we may withhold or with-draw medications and machines, we may notwithhold or withdraw artificial nutrition andhydration. 99 On the other hand, the nutrients that enter the body through tubes look exactly like med-ications administered that way and, more to thepoint, the Talmud specifically defines \"food\" asthat which is ingested through the mouth andswallowed. 100Consequently, in the ruling I wrote for the Conservative Movement's Committee onJewish Law and Standards, I ruled that while we must go through the motions of bringing in anormal food tray at regular meal times to a com-atose patient, we need not administer nutritionand hydration artificially. We may, of course, andwe should do so as long as there is a reasonablechance that the patient may recover. When that outcome can no longer be reasonably expected,however, so that the artificial nutrition andhydration are just prolonging the dying process, they may be removed. 101 Curing the patient, not the disease The important thing to note, however, is that there is general agreement that a Jew need notuse heroic measures to maintain her life butonly those medicines and procedures that arecommonly available in the person's time andplace. We are, after all, commanded to curebased on the verse in Exodus 21:19, \"and heshall surely cure him.\" We are not commandedto sustain life per se. 102Thus, on the one hand, as long as there is some hope of cure, heroicmeasures and untested drugs may be employed,even though this involves an elevated level ofrisk. On the other hand, though, physicians, patients, and families who are making such criti-cal care decisions are not duty-bound by Jewishlaw to invoke such therapies. This should help us deal with a common phe- nomenon. A person is suffering from multiple,incurable illnesses, one of which is bound to 22 THEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONScause death soon. It often happens that such a person develops pneumonia, and doctors arethen in a quandary. A generally healthy personwho contracts pneumonia would be treated withantibiotics, and often the drugs would bringcure. In those situations both the physician andthe patient would be required to use antibioticsaccording to Jewish law, and few would needJewish law to convince them to do so. But what happens in the case referred to above? Thephysician can probably cure the pneumonia, butthat would only restore the patient to the painand suffering caused by his or her other termi-nal maladies. The alternative would be to let thepatient die of the pneumonia so that deathwould come more quickly. From the perspective of Jewish law, the ques- tion is whether our inability totally to cure theperson gives us the right to refrain from curingwhat we can. Normally we do not have thisright. So, for example, we must try to cure the pneumonia of a child who has Down'sSyndrome, even though we cannot cure the Down's Syndrome. If a person has a terminal ill-ness, however, we would not need to intervene;we may rather let nature take its course. Wemust view the person as a whole rather thanconsider each individual disease separately.Therefore even though we could probably cure the pneumonia, and even though the means fordoing so are not unusual at all, nevertheless theperson cannot be cured, and therefore we mayrefrain from treating the pneumonia if that willenable the patient to die less painfully. This is inline with the strain in Jewish law that does notautomatically and mechanically assume thatpreservation of life trumps all other considera-tions, but rather judges according to the bestinterests of the patient. 103 Pain control and palliative care The fact that Jewish law does not require the use of heroic measures means that a Jew mayenroll in a hospice program in good conscienceand that rabbis may suggest this in equally goodconscience. While there are some buildingscalled \"hospices,\" hospice care typically does not take place in a special facility. Rather thepatient lives at home as long as possible, doingwhatever he can do. The word \"hospice\" thusdesignates not so much a building, but a form ofcare. The goal of hospice care is not to cure thedisease, but to make the patient as comfortableas possible. In doing so, it is permissible to pre-scribe a dosage of pain medication that mayactually hasten the patient's death, as long asthe intent is not to kill the person but rather toalleviate his or her pain. 104 Hospice care also crucially includes all the non-medical ways in which people are supportedwhen they go through crises. First on that listare the forms of care provided by family andfriends who keep the patient company and makethe patient feel that she is still part of theirworld and not simply a locus of illness and pain.Nurses, social workers, and rabbis may also beinvolved at various points in the patient's care. Moreover, if the doctors can use extraordinary means but only at great cost or by inflictinggreat pain, and even then with only a slight pos- sibility of cure, Jewish law would permit suchaction but would not require it. Consequently, aJew may legitimately refuse supererogatory med- ical ministrations and may sign an advancedirective for health care (sometimes called a\"living will\") indicating his desire to declinesuch care, choosing instead only to alleviatewhatever pain is involved in dying. When cure isnot possible, both the patient and the physiciancease to have an obligation to do more medical-ly than ease pain. Similarly, family and friendsshould not pressure the patient or physician toemploy extraordinary or futile measures; theyshould instead focus on their continuing dutiesto visit the sick and provide all forms of non-physical comfort. All four movements inAmerican Judaism have produced their own ver-sions of a Jewish advance directive, each accord-ing to its own understanding of Jewish law, andwhile they differ in tone and substance on anumber of matters, they all permit hospice care. 23 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERCAREOFTHEDECEASED General principles The treatment of these topics in Jewish law depends on two primary principles. The generaltenet that governs treatment of the body afterdeath is kavod ha-met , that is, we should render honor to the dead body. This is not onlydemanded by respect for the deceased person; italso derives from the theological tenet that thebody, even in death, remains God's property. The other principle which affects the topics of this section is that of pikkuah nefesh , the obliga- tion to save people's lives. That tenet is so deeplyembedded in Jewish law that, according to therabbis, it takes precedence over all other com-mandments except those forbidding murder, idol-atry, and incestuous or adulterous sexual inter-course. 105That is, for example, if one's choice is to murder someone else or give up one's own life,one must give up one's own life. If, however, oneneeded to violate the Sabbath laws or steal some-thing to save one's own life, then one is not onlypermitted, but commanded to violate the laws inquestion to save a life. Jews are commanded notonly to do virtually anything necessary to savetheir own lives; they are also bound by the posi-tive obligation to take steps to save the lives ofothers. This imperative is derived from the biblicalcommand, \"Do not stand idly by the blood of yourneighbor\" (Leviticus 19:16). Thus, for example, ifyou see someone drowning, you may not ignoreher but must do what you can to save her life. 106 What happens, though, when you can only save your life or someone else's? Whose life takesprecedence? The opinion that ultimately wins theday in Jewish legal literature is that of RabbiAkiba. 107Under morally impossible circum- stances, when an untoward result will happen nomatter what one does, Rabbi Akiba directs us toremain passive and let nature take its course. With these underlying principles in mind, we are now prepared to address the subjects of thissection.Cremation Jewish law prohibits cremation as the ultimate form of dishonor of the dead. Cremation alsorepresents the active destruction of God's prop-erty, and it is improper for that reason as well.In the generations after Hitler's gas chambers,burning the bodies of our own deceased seemsespecially inappropriate. Autopsies The two procedures that are permitted to inter- rupt the normal Jewish burial process are autop-sies and organ transplants (see \"Organ and tissuetransplantation,\" above). Autopsies were knownin the ancient world, but Jewish sources indicatethat they were largely looked upon as violationsof human dignity. As the prospect of gainingmedical knowledge from autopsies has improved,many rabbis have come to view them morefavorably. Israeli Chief Rabbi Isaac Herzog enunciated a definitive position in his 1949agreement with Hadassah Hospital. Under thatagreement, autopsies would be sanctioned onlywhen one of the following conditions occurred: a. The autopsy is legally required. b. In the opinion of three physicians, the cause of death cannot otherwise be ascertained. c. Three physicians attest that the autopsy might help save the lives of others suffering from a similar illness. d. Where a hereditary illness was involved, an autopsy might safeguard surviving relatives. In each case, those who perform the autopsy must do so with due reverence for the dead and,upon completion of the autopsy, they mustdeliver the corpse and all of its parts to the bur-ial society for interment. This agreement wasincorporated into Israeli law four years later. When an autopsy is justified for legal or med- ical reasons, it is construed not as a dishonor ofthe body, but, on the contrary, as an honorableuse of the body to help the living. New proce-dures, such as a needle biopsy of a palpable 24 THEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSmass, or a peritoneoscopy with biopsy, may soon accomplish most of the same medical objectivesin a less invasive way that would clearly bepreferable from a Jewish point of view. 108 Donating one's body to science May one donate one's entire body to science fordissection by medical students as part of theirmedical education? Objections to this practicefocus on the desecration of the body involved intearing it apart and the delay in its burial untilafter the dissection. Rabbi Bleich and others takea very hard line on this issue, claiming that anyinvasion of the corpse for purposes of autopsy ortransplant is warranted only if there is a holeh lefaneinu , a patient who will benefit immediately thereby. 109In contrast, Israeli Chief Rabbi Herzog issued the following statement in 1949: The Plenary Council of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel ...do not object to the use of bodies of per- sons who gave their consent in writing of their ownfree will during their lifetime for anatomical dissec-tions as required for medical studies, provided thedissected parts are carefully preserved so as to beeventually buried with due respect according toJewish law. 110 This seems to me a much more sensible reading of the sources and the process of medical researchthan that of Rabbi Bleich. Dissection is crucial tothe preparation of physicians. Consequently, partic- ipating in medical education in this way is an honortothe deceased and a real kindness in that it helps the living. The levity that sometimes accom-panies dissection does not mean that medical stu-dents find dissection funny; it is perhaps a way forthem to dissipate their discomfort in handling acorpse. No disrespect is intended, and thereforedissection is not objectionable on that ground. Rabbi Isaac Klein cites yet another argument to permit the donation of one's body to science: In a country where the Jews enjoy freedom, if the rabbis should refuse to allow the Jewish dead to beused for medical study, their action will result inhillul ha-shem [a desecration of God's Name], for it will be said that the Jews are not interested in sav-ing lives; there is (therefore) reason to permit it. 111 This argument would not apply, however, if there are ample bodies available for dissection.Then the donor would be giving no special gift to future physicians and their patients, and therewould be no particular taint involved if Jews donot generally donate their bodies for this purpose.Since medical schools currently have more thanenough bodies from county morgues, largely bod-ies of unknown people that have been abandoned,Jews need not and therefore should not offer to have their bodies dissected, for there is no med-ical necessity to set aside the honor due a corpseaccording to the Jewish concept of kavod ha-met . In sum, then, most Jewish authorities would not only permit, but would encourage people toarrange to donate their organs to others upontheir demise, and some would even permit donat-ing one's entire body to medical science. The onlyconditions are that the remains should ultimatelybe buried according to Jewish law and custom, and that the family of the deceased agree todonate. 112By graphically indicating that the per- son has died, burial helps people gain the emo-tional catharsis and closure that they need.Therefore the permission of the family is neces- sary not only to accord with American law, butalso to assure that, even without immediate burial, relatives of the deceased in the particular case at hand can effectively carry out the mourningprocess and thus have psychological closure andreturn to their lives in full. If they feel that closurewould not be possible under these conditions,families may refuse to give permission for organdonation or dissection, and they should not feelguilty for doing so. SOCIALSUPPORT OF THE SICK Caring for a person is not a matter of physical ministrations alone. The Jewish tradition is wellaware that recovery is often dependent upon the 25 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERsocial and psychological support\u2014or lack there- of\u2014that family and friends provide. Indeed, incases where people ask to die, it is often becausenobody is around to pay any attention to them. To combat that, the Jewish tradition imposes the obligation on us of biqqur holim , visiting the sick. That is a mitzvah , a commanded act and an expected behavior, not only for rabbis, but forall Jews. Each synagogue and Jewish socialgroup should have an active biqqur holim socie- ty. Rabbis, psychologists, and social workersmight train the members of the society on howto visit a bedridden person. This should includesimple techniques like not standing over the bedbut rather sitting down next to the patient so that the two of you are on the same plane, and itshould also include more complex matters, likehow to engage the patient in conversation aboutmatters beyond the food served for lunch thatday. The Jewish tradition, then, not only obli-gates us to cure, but to care. Our medical facili-ties and our residence homes need to be notonly medically sound, but warm, caring places.Moreover, our communities must consist of car-ing people who know that the Torah is seriouswhen it says, \"Love your neighbor as yourself\"(Leviticus 19:18). JEWISH DIETARY LAWS Traditional Jews observe the Jewish dietary laws(kashrut ); they \"keep kosher.\" The Hebrew word means \"ritually fit\" (in this case, for eating).The rules of kashrut restrict permitted foods to meat that comes from animals that have splithooves and that chew their cud (primarily cowsand sheep), domestic fowl (primarily chicken,turkey, and duck), and to fish with scales and fins(trout, cod, whitefish, salmon, pike, etc.; notshell- fish like shrimp, mussels, lobster, etc.). (SeeLeviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14 for these rules.)The animals and fowl must then be slaughtered in a specific way ( shehitah) to minimize pain to the animal, and the blood must be drained from themeat through a washing and salting process orthrough broiling. Finally, meat and dairy productsmay not be prepared or eaten together. In the hospital setting, some Jews want to order kosher meals. If medical concerns pre-clude that (if, for example, the patient may nothave salt), kosher meals prepared with suchrestrictions in mind may be available. If not,fruits, vegetables, and many dairy products maybe eaten without rabbinic certification of their kashrut . If the physician asserts that the patient's med- ical condition requires non-kosher food of a par-ticular sort, the patient both may and must obey,for saving life and health takes precedence overthe dietary laws. Such instances, however, arerare, for it must be a true medical necessity forthat concern to override the dietary laws.Generally, even if the patient may not eat some particular foods, other kosher foods that supplythe patient's nutritional needs are available. RELIGIOUS OBSERVA NCES BASED ON THE TORAH In the Jewish calendar, days begin and end at sunset. Sabbaths begin eighteen minutes beforesunset on Friday night and end forty minutesafter sunset on Saturday night to make sure thatthe Sabbath is not violated. The Sabbath During the Sabbath (in Hebrew, shabbat , or, in Yiddish, shabbes ), thirty-nine types of activity are prohibited. These include writing, doingbusiness, washing clothes, cooking, carryingfrom one person's domain to another's or to the 26 THEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSSPECIAL CONCERNSpublic thoroughfare, and lighting or extinguish- ing a fire. Some Jews understand that last inter-diction to prohibit the use of electricity (exceptthat which has been turned on before theSabbath begins or that which is turned on by anon-Jew who does it on his or her own), whileothers distinguish between lighting a fire andusing electricity, prohibiting the former but per-mitting the latter. Even those who use electricitymay or may not use the television or radio onthe Sabbath; those who do not permit listeningto radio or watching television on the Sabbathrefrain from this because of the commercialnature of the advertisements every few minutes.Shaving, using electricity or not, is prohibited onthe Sabbath. In addition to these prohibitions, the Sabbath involves positive commandments. In preparationfor the Sabbath, one is supposed to clean one'shome, shower, wear clean clothes, make festivemeals. These are all part of the honor due to theday and the joy that is to accompany it. The dayshould include prayer and study of the Torah. All of these rules are observed, albeit in some- what different ways, by Jews in the Orthodox orConservative movements who take seriously theirmovements' commitment to Jewish law. Membersof those movements who nevertheless do not liveby that commitment, and Jews in the Reform orReconstructionist movements, which ideological-ly assert that contemporary Jews are not boundby Jewish law, and secular Jews whose Jewishaffiliation is solely ethnic and not religious, mayabide by some of these restrictions and may per-form some of the positive acts associated withthe Sabbath and the other holy days, but willprobably not practice all of them. Such Jews\u2014and they are the vast majority\u2014will instead pickthose traditional practices that are meaningful tothem, observing them in their own way. Non-Jews caring for Jews, then, must be keenly aware of the wide variation among Jews vis-\u00e0-vis all ofthe traditional practices described here and inthe following sections. As Jews are wont to say,\"Where there are two Jews there are at leastthree opinions!\" Rosh Hashanah, Sukkot, Shemini Atzeret, Simhat Torah, Passover, Shavuot Because the Jewish calendar is lunar, the days on which the seasonal holy days occur do notalways coincide with the same day in the solarcalendar generally in use. A yearly Jewish calen-dar, available from synagogues and other Jewishinstitutions, must be consulted. The laws governing these biblical holy days are exactly the same as those governing the Sabbath,except that one is permitted to carry and to cookon a fire that was lit before the holiday began orwas transferred from such a fire. Each has its ownspecial character, message, and observances.Passover, in particular, involves special dietary restrictions, and even Jews who are otherwise laxin their religious observances may want to orderkosher-for-Passover food during the holiday. Yom Kippur Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement) is the holi- est day of the year. Jews fast throughout the day,and they spend most of the day in the synagoguepraying, meditating, listening to the Torah read-ing and the rabbi's sermons, and trying toachieve the moral and spiritual cleansing towhich the day is devoted. A memorial prayer forthe dead ( Yizkor) is said on this day as part of the liturgy, and Jewish hospital patients maywant to gather together at least to hear thatprayer. (It is also recited on Shemini Atzeret andon the last days of Passover and Shavuot.) All of the other restrictions of the Sabbath apply on Yom Kippur as well. With regard to thefast, though, if a physician instructs a Jew thathe or she must eat on Yom Kippur because hisor her physical condition cannot tolerate thefast, the Jew is bound by Jewish law to followthe doctor's instructions. HISTORICAL HOLIDAYS AND DAYS OF MOURNING In addition to the holy days mandated in the Torah, Jews observe a number of holidays and 27 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERdays of mourning that commemorate events in Jewish history. None of the legal restrictions of the Torah's holy days applies to these days, butthey do have special requirements and customsof their own. Hanukkah Near the time of the winter solstice, Jews cele-brate Hanukkah, the festival of lights and of reli-gious freedom. Jews light a menorah (or hanukkiah ), beginning with one candle on the first night (in addition to the one used to light allthe rest) and lighting one additional candle oneach succeeding night. This is preceded by bless-ings and followed by songs. It is customary to eatfoods made with oil on or doughnuts. Purim Purim takes place about a month before Passover, usually in March. The biblical Book of Esther is read, and Hamentaschen , three-cor- nered baked goods shaped that way to resemblethe hat of Haman, are eaten. Yom Ha-Shoah Holocaust Remembrance Day is a relatively new observance within the Jewish community. It takesplace about a week after Passover, and it general-ly includes commemorative worship services andlectures and study sessions about the Holocaust. Israel's Day of Independence (Yom Ha- Atzma'ut) Jews the world over celebrate the reestablish- ment of a Jewish state in the homeland on thefifth of the Hebrew month of Iyyar, which usual-ly falls sometime in May. Jews celebrate the dayin a variety of ways, often with walks to raisemoney for Israel, Israeli dancing, the eating oftypically Israeli foods, study sessions aboutIsrael, and the like. Tisha B' Av and the minor fasts In late July or early August, the Fast of the Ninth of the Hebrew month Av occurs. Alongwith Yom Kippur, it is the only full fast day (from sunset to sunset). It commemorates thedestruction of the first Jewish commonwealth in586 B.C.E., as well as the fall of the secondJewish commonwealth in 70 C.E. In later times, it also became the national day of mourning forother tragedies that befell the Jewish peopleduring the Crusades and Inquisition. Four other \"minor\" fast days (that is, from sunrise to sunset) occur during the year and areobserved by some Jews. PRAYE R Traditional Jews pray three times a day, morning, afternoon, and evening. For the morning prayers,men (and now sometimes women) wear a prayer-shawl ( tallit) and phylacteries ( tefillin ), black boxes black leather straps that are bound to the biceps and the forehead. The boxes containthe four passages in the Torah where Jews arecommanded to wear such symbols, and they helpto dedicate worshipers to God and God's com-mandments. Whenever praying or studying Jewishtexts, Jewish men (and now some Jewish women)traditionally wear a head covering ( kippah in Hebrew, yarmulke in Yiddish) or hat as a mark of reverence for God. If one can, one is supposed topray with a prayer quorum ( minyan ) of ten Jews, but if that is not possible, one should pray onone's own. All of the American Jewish movementshave published their own prayer books, all ofwhich come in versions with English translationsaccompanying the traditional Hebrew prayers. Arabbi is not needed to lead a community inprayer; any Jew who knows how may do so. In addition to the daily prayers, Jews may pray to God at any time. Those in distress oftenuse selections from the Book of Psalms as asource of comfort and hope. Prayers are tradi-tionally offered in the synagogue on behalf ofthose who are ill, for Jews believe that physi-cians are God's partners in the ongoing act ofhealing but that ultimately life and death andsickness and health are in God's hands. 28 THEJEWISH TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSIn all of the following, M. = Mishnah (edited c. 200 C.E.); T. = Tosefta (edited c. 200 C.E.); J. =Jerusalem Talmud (edited c. 400 C.E.); B. \"World Jewish Population, 1997,\" 549, 578. 2.

Nahmanides bases himself on similar 84b. 20. S.A. York, 1915), II, 580-581. Cf. alsoB. Avodah Zarah 40b, a story in which Rabbi expresses appreciation for foods that can cure. Although circum-cision is not justified in the Jewish tradition on medicalgrounds, it is instructive that the rabbis maintained that Jewish boys were not born circumcised specifically because God created the world such that it would need human fixing, a similar idea to the one articulated hereon behalf of In the first of those passages, it is the judge who judges justly who is called God's partner;in the second, it is anyone who recites Genesis 2:1-3(about God resting on the seventh day) on Friday night,thereby participating in God's ongoing act of creation.The Talmud, in B. Sanhedrin 38a, specifically wanted the Sadducees notto be able to say that angels or any being other than humans participates with God in creation. 23. See Dorff and Rosett, A Living Tree , for more on the sources, methods, and guiding beliefs of Jewish law. 24. For a thorough discussion of these methodological issues, including why and how Judaism uses law to dis-cern moral duties and the relationship of law to dutiesbeyond the law, see Dorff, Life and Death , 395-417. 25. B. Bava 2:6; Exodus 23:7; in context, that passage, like Exodus20:13 in the Ten Commandments, may be talkingspecifically about the legal setting, warning that one notallege a false charge, but the later Jewish traditionunderstood it more broadly to forbid all falsehood. See,for example, B. Ketubbot 17a; B. Shevuot 30b, 31a. Moreover, other verses in the Bible itself, such asPsalms 101:7, Psalms 119:163, and Proverbs 13:5, con- 16b-17a; cf. M.T. Laws of Ethics (De'ot) 7:1. 28. On this entire matter, the Rabbinical Assembly, the rab- binic body of the Conservative Movement withinJudaism, has created a rabbinic letter designed for usewith adults and with teenagers discussing the concepts,values, and laws of Judaism governing intimate rela-tions, marriage, non-marital sex, and homosexuality.See Dorff, Yevamot 63a, cites Genesis 5:2 to prove that \"An unmar-ried man is not a man in the full sense,\" and B. Kiddushin 29b, where a prominent rabbi (Rabbi Huna) turns his back on a single man of great learning, tellinghim to return only after he has married. 31. B. Megillah 27a. 32. B.

Genesis 16:2 uses a play on words in Hebrew when Sarai says to Abram, \"Look, the Lord has kept me frombearing. Consort with my maid [Hagar]; perhaps I shall have a son [also, I shall be built up] through her.\" Thisindicates that Ishmael, the son who resulted from thisunion, was not only to be considered Abram's son, butSarai's as well. Similarly, Rachel tells Jacob, \"Here ismy maid Bilhah. Consort with her, that she may bear on my knees and that through her I too may have chil-dren\" (Genesis 30:3). At that time, Rachel was infertile(she gave birth to Joseph and Benjamin only later), butLeah, who had already had four sons, also gave herhandmaid, Zilpah, to Jacob, and when sons were ascribed to Leah as well. ThatLeah had stopped bearing and therefore resorted to theuse of her handmaid Zilpah: Genesis 30:9. That differences among the denominations of Judaism on defining Jewish identity come into play here as wellas various rabbis' application of their own criteria tosurrogacy. The Conservative movement's position is thatthe bearing mother determines Jewish identity; seeMackler, Life and Death , 108-110, 174-187. For a description of some of the Orthodox positions, seeBleich, Judaism and Healing , 93-95. For the Reform position on the criteria for conferring Jewish status onchildren of mixed marriage and on surrogacy, see Jacob, American Reform Responsa , 505-507, Contemporary esp. 70-71 (dated February 1984). 64.\"The law of the land is the law\": andRosett, A Living Tree , 515-23, 527, 539-45. That Jewish law would never permit to Jews what is forbid- den to non-Jews: B. Sanhedrin 59a. 65. Gold, And Hannah W ept , 123. 66.See, for example, Bleich, Judaism and Healing , 92-95. While Rabbi Bleich generally prohibits or limits the use of new medical procedures, here he specifically arguesagainst Rabbi Jakobovits' claim that surrogacy is inher-ently immoral and spends most of his discussion on thequestion of the Jewish identity of the child. See alsoGold, And Hannah W ept , 120-127, and, especially, a new, detailed paper on the subject by Rabbi Elie Spitz,approved by the Conservative Movement's Committeeon Jewish Law and Standards (in Mackler, Life and Death , 129-161)\u2014although another ruling approved by the Committee, by Rabbi Aaron Mackler, takes a decid-edly less liberal stance for a summary of Jewish laws on adoption. 70.Exodus Rabbah 46:5; cf. also B.

Niddah 5:3, however, states that from 31 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERthe moment of birth a child is, to his or her parents and relatives, \"like a bridegroom [or bride]\"\u2014that is, thatthe parents and relatives, if not the rest of society,assume that the child is alive and well and will ulti-mately marry. Based upon that opinion, and ouradvanced scientific knowledge that enables us to deter-mine the gestational age of a child more accurately, theConservative Movement's Committee on Jewish Lawand Standards endorsed a responsum by Rabbi Stephanie Dickstein, \"Mourning Practices for InfantsWho Die Prior to the Thirty-First Day of Life,\" requir- ing that full mourning rites be used for a child who dieswithin the first thirty days of life\u2014contrary to the tradi-tional practice of simply burying the child privatelywithout communal participation and without the tradi-tional rites of the seven days of mourning followingburial. 73.Bleich, Judaism and Healing , 106. 74.Ornstein and Dire Shortage.\" Medical Ethics , 291; see also 96-98. That this is the generally held opinion regarding living donors is true not only for Orthodox rabbis, some ofwhom he references, but also for Conservative andReform rabbis. For Orthodox opinions, see MosheFeinstein, Igrot Waldenberg, Tzitz Eliezer , vol. 9, no. 45, and vol. 10, no. 25 (Hebrew); Obadiah Yosef, Dinei Yisrael, vol. 7 (Hebrew).

Although somewhat dated, a good summary of the positions of all three movements,with relevant quotations from responsa and other offi- cial position statements, can be found in Goldman,Judaism Confronts , 211-237. That source includes quo- tations from two responsa approved by the Conservative Movement's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards.A similar stance can be found in the work of two otherConservative rabbis, namely, Klein, Responsa , chap. 5, and Feldman, Health and Medicine , 103-108.

In a March 1986 responsum , the Central Conference of American Rabbis as a body officially affirmed the practice of organ dona-tion, and the synagogue arm of the Reform Movement,through its Committee on The Synagogue as a CaringCommunity and Bio-Medical Ethics, published a manu-al on preparing for death that specifically includes pro-vision for donation of one's entire body or of particularorgans to a specified person, hospital, or organ bank fortransplantation and/or for research, medical education,therapy of another person, or any purpose authorizedby law.

The Reform Movement officially adopted the Harvard criteria (presumably as modified by the medical com-munity) in 1980 (Jacob, American Reform , 273-274). 81. Feldman and Rosner, Compendium , 67-71; Confronts , Medical 263, and Healing De'ah 339:2, and the comments of the Shakh and Rama there. The prohibition of murder, though, asin the sixth of the Ten Commandments, does not inter-dict all killing of humans. On the contrary, Judaismrequires self-defense, even to the extent of killing one'sattacker, both for individuals (Exodus 22:1; B. Berakhot B. . 90.This includes even inanimate property that \"belongs\" to us, for God is the ultimate owner. Cf. and B. Ta'anit 23a. Note that this is not a form of passive euthanasia, for there people refrain from acting, buthere God is asked to act. 92.For a discussion of the methodological issues involved in deriving legal guidance from such stories, see thearticles by David Ellenson, Louis Newman, Elliot Dorff,and Aaron Mackler , 141-42. esp. 316-325]; cf. also Dorff, Matters of Life Life and Death , 208-217. 102. Thus the Talmud specifically says, \"We do not worry about mere hours of life\" (B. Avodah Zarah 27b). The Talmud also says, however, that we may desecrate the Sabbath even if the chances are that it will only savemere hours of life (B. Yoma85a). The latter source has led some Orthodox rabbis to insist in medical situationsthat every moment of life is holy and that thereforeevery medical therapy must be used to save evenmoments of life; see, for example, Bleich, Judaism and Healing , 118-19, 134-45. The only exception is when a person is a goses , which Rabbi Bleich defines as within seventy-two hours of death, at which time passive, butnot active, euthanasia may be practiced. He then usesthe source in Avodah Zarah only to permit hazardous therapies that may hasten death if they do not succeedin lengthening life. Rabbi Bleich's position is not, how-ever, necessitated by the sources. On the contrary, theyspecifically allow us\u2014or, on some readings, commandus\u2014not to inhibit the process of dying when we can nolonger cure, even long before seventy-two hours beforedeath, however that , 311-14]. For a con- trasting interpretation of this source, see Reisner,\"Halakhic Ethic,\" 56-57 and 72, n. 21 [in , 245-47 and 255-57, n. 104. Rabbi Reisner does not accept this \"double effect\" argument, but he would agree that pain should be alle-viated as much as possible up to, but not including, thedosage that would have the inevitable effect of hasten-ing the person's death, even if not intended for Ethic,\" notes 12-14]; and see, in contrast, Dorff,Matters of Life and Death 7-10].

Permission of the donor or his family must be procured so that the transplant does not constitute a theft,according to Chief Rabbi Unterman's responsum in Goldman, Judaism Confronts , 226. Feldman and Rosner, Compendium , 68, say that the family's permis- sion is only advisable in Jewish law, but it is mandatoryin American law; that, however, would make it reli-giously required of American Jews as well under the Jewish legal principle of \"the law of the land is the law.\" See note 28 above.

Tzitz Eliezer RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ANDHEALTHCARE DECISIONSReligious beliefs provide meaning for people confronting illness and seeking health, par- ticularly during times of crisis. Increasingly,healthcare workers face the challenge of provid-ing appropriate care and services to people of dif-ferent religious backgrounds. Unfortunately,many healthcare workers are unfamiliar with thereligious beliefs and moral positions of traditionsother than their own. This booklet is one of aseries that aims to provide accessible and practi-cal information about the values and beliefs ofdifferent religious traditions. It should assistnurses, physicians, chaplains, social workers, andadministrators in their decision making and caregiving. It can also serve as a reference for believ- ers who desire to learn more about their own tra-ditions. Each booklet gives an introduction to the his- tory of the tradition, including its perspectives onhealth and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Final-ly, each booklet offers information on specialconcerns relevant to the particular tradition. The editors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated by authorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The editors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral deci-sions about clinical issues to individualconscience. We would therefore caution the read-er against generalizing too readily. The guidelines in these booklets should notsubstitute for discussion of patients' own reli- gious views on clinical issues. Rather, they should be used to supplement information com-ing directly from patients and families, and usedas a primary source only when such firsthandinformation is not available. We hope that these booklets will help practi- tioners see that religious backgrounds and beliefsplay a part in the way patients deal with pain, ill-ness, and the decisions that arise in the course oftreatment. Greater understanding of religious tra-ditions on the part of care providers, we believe,will increase the quality of care received by thepatient.
