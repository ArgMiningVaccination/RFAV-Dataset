Shana Spence, @thenutritiontea [Here's a pro tip if it sounds too good to be true it is. I guess it's boring to say that spicy foods are delicious (for those that can take the heat ) and have vitamins and minerals that are good for us. Or that green tea and blueberries and grapefruit all have a bunch of health benefits that we need also. No we have to throw in some nonsense words like \"fat burning\". Can you imagine the people putting out these lists trying to explain to people \"yes these foods just burn the fat up!\" . I mean really. These foods are healthy, no one is arguing with that. And they do have a bunch of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Great . It's the wording that we need to be mindful of and we should be aware when something is purely a marketing helpful tips and inspirational quotes to help people establish healthier relationships with food.

Toral Shah, @theurbankitchen [IT'S PICNIC SEASON and the weather is actually playing ball! I'm a big fan of salad platters, especially ones that travel well when packed. I love freekah, a roasted green wheat which is packed with protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals. This ancient, nutrient dense grain has double the iron of farro and quinoa, and rich is in minerals such as calcium, magnesium, zinc and B vitamins. Wholegrains such as fibre help to reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering LDL cholesterol and blood pressure and this may be why the Mediterranean, DASH and MIND diets are heart healthy. Freekah also supports our gut microbiome as it is packed with prebiotics and insoluble fibre. This fibre slows the absorption of glucose into the blood , lowering the glycaemic load making it suitable for diabetics. I made this one with lots of green vegetables that needed using up for a nutrient packed meal. *** ALL THE GREENS FREEKAH AND ZA'ATAR SALAD 150g freekah 4 spring onions, finely sliced 150g of broccoli, cut into florets 1 bulb of fennel, sliced 100g peas Handful of flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped 2 tbsp of @zaytoun_cic za'atar 2 tbsp olive oil 60ml extra virgin olive oil Juice of 1 lemon 1 clove of garlic, crushed 75g feta cheese *** 1. Preheat the oven to 180c/ 350F/ Gas mark 4. 2. Arrange the sliced fennel on a lined oven tray, drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil and roast for 20 - 25 minutes. 3. Meanwhile, cook the freekah according to directions. When cooked, drain and rinse with cold water. 4. Heat a frying and add the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil. When hot, add the broccoli florets and the frozen peas and cook for about 3 minutes. 5. When the peas are defrosted and broccoli almost al dente, add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute. 6. Remove from the heat and cool. 7. Prepare the dressing by mixing the extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, za'atar and season well. 8. Mix the cooked vegetables, freekah, roughly chopped parsley and toss through the dressing. 9.

Khrys Speed, @kdotspeed [Low Hang Clean and Jerk Doubles 135 for 2 dubs. Well thicc boi doubles (where it's pretty much a cluster set because you rest too much between the reps). I thought clean and jerk doubles were bad, these are much much harder . Low hang cleans are probably one of the best things you can do to build strength in your legs and back for the pull from floor to above the knee. Low hang tends to give you a better \"feel\" for where your body and the bar should be as you come off the floor. This is probably the movement I notice correlates closest to my snatch and clean, or low hang goes well and it goes up. The lifts from floor get better too. @mehmed_fikretov] [Khrys Speed](https://www.instagram.com/kdotspeed/) is a weightlifting and performance coach who posts motivating messages and videos to help lifters perfect their form and technique.

Chrissy King, @iamchrissyking [When I struggled the most with my relationship with food and my body, it's because I lived in the extremes. \"All or nothing\" \"Good lazy\" You can't find peace in the extremes, and I judged myself and others by these metrics. But in order to actually find peace with your relationship with food and your body, you have to be able to let go of ideas of what you think your body *should* look like. You have to let go of your \"personal preferences\", which I would argue are all learned and conditioned. We are conditioned to believe that smaller bodies are better bodies. Society taught us early on which bodies deserve respect, praise, and validation, and which bodies are unworthy and disposable. We have to give our bodies permission to just be. To eat when it's hungry without judging ourselves for being hungry again. To take the shape that it wants to take without wishing it were something else or continuously imagining the 'ideal' body for ourselves. To remember that the 'ideal' body is just an illusion. Bodies were never meant to look the same. They were designed to be all different shapes, sizes, and colors. Most of us struggle with food guilt and shame because deep down we are afraid to allow our bodies to get too far away from what we believe to be the culturally 'acceptable' body. We can gain a little bit of weight, but not too much because secretly we enjoy the benefits that come with residing in a smaller body. In the midst of a pandemic when everything feels out of control, trying to control our bodies is like grasping for certainty. When everything else is spiraling, we can try to control what we look like, what we eat, and how we move. But here's the reality, life is going to keep happening. This won't be the first or last time we find ourselves in an unexpected reality. It may not be another pandemic but there will always be another thing. That's the guarantee of the human experience. The constant in every situation is you. You are the only person you have to spend every moment of your life with. Everyone else is optional. You are not.

Tiffany Ima, @tiffanyima [When you are recovering from an eating disorder or hearing disordered eating patterns, its normal to be anxious about your food choices. This anxiety can be heightened by spending more time at home, especially if you are not moving as much as you'd like. I get it. And it's ok. When you start feeling anxious, remember that you deserve to eat, and you do not have to restrict your food. Eat foods that make your body feel energized. Eat foods that make you feel happy. Eat food that nourish you. Eat intuitively and learn to understand what that means for your body.
