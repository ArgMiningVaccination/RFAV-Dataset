METHODS:Using test-negative case-control design, on [vaccination]status of cases with Covid-19 among [healthcare workers]in our institution in Puducherry, [India], and an equal number of controls matched for age and date of testing, was obtained. The groups were compared using multivariable conditional [logistic regression]to calculate ratio])%. RESULTS:Using data from 360 case-control pairs, VE of one [dose]and of two doses, in providing [protection]against Covid-19 was 49% (95% CI 17%-68%) and 54% (27%-71%), Among cases with moderately severe [disease]that required [oxygen] [therapy], VE [Covishield] [vaccine]protected significantly against Covid-19, with a ...
