It has been and will continue to be updated to provide specific information about the storage and preparation of each newly introduced vaccine and changes to the programme as detailed in the Green Book chapter 14a. As COVID -19 is an evolving disease, much is still being learned about both the disease and the vaccines which have been devel oped to prevent it , the information in this document was correct at the time of publication. Please only access this document online to ensure that you are using the latest version. This document does not replace the Green Book COVID -19 chapter nor the PGDs and national protocols for COVID -19 vaccines, all of which should be available and actively consulted by those delivering this programme. Background to the COVID -19 vaccination programme COVID -19 disease first emerged as a presentation of severe respiratory infection in Wuhan, China in late 2019 . In January 2020 a novel coronavirus , SARS -CoV-2, was identified as the cause , and in March the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID -19 as a pandemic . On 8 December 2020, a COVID -19 vaccination programme began in the UK. The Coronavirus (COVID -19) in the UK dashboard shows the UK summary of the number of cases and deaths from COVID -19 as well as : the number of virus tests processed ; healthcare figures including the number of patients admitted to hospital, patients in hospital and patients in ventilator beds ; and the number of people vaccinated . Information on the effectiveness of COVID -19 vaccination , which is being monitored by UKHSA , can be found on the GOV.UK websit e. Further information on COVID -19 disease, epidemiology and the vaccination programme can be found in the Green Book COVID -19 chapter. Further information on the latest vaccine eligibility is described in the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation ( JCVI ) advice , Green the UKHSA COVID -19 PGD s and Protocols . COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 9 Patient information leaflets and resources can be ordered from the Health Publications website. The NHS Specialist Pharmacy Service ( SPS) publishes comprehensive guidance regarding storage, transportation and all aspects of medicines management relating to the vaccines . NHS England publishes a regularly updated Current Cohort Eligibility Operational Status document. COVID -19 Clinical symptoms Common symptoms include headache, fatigue, cough and myalgia (aching muscles). Compared to previous variants, Omicron is less likely to cause loss of sense of smell (anosmia) and more likely to cause a sore throat. In severe cases, COVID -19 can lead to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. The long -term consequences of COVID -19 infection, known as Long COVID or Post -Acute Sequelae of SARS -CoV-2 (PASC) infection, are an area of ongoing study. Report ed long-term symptoms (12-16 weeks after the initial infection ) are varied, involving most organ systems and affecting both physical and mental health. In general, children remain asymptomatic or develop mild disease , often with upper respiratory symptoms, but symptoms may be non -specific and atypical, affecting other organ systems. The majority of children recover completely and any persistent sy mpto ms improve with time and serious long -term complications are rare . Transmission SARS -CoV-2 virus is primarily transmitted between people through small respiratory droplets expelled from the nose and mouth through coughing, sneezing or speaking . These droplets can also survive on objects and surfaces. People can become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth, although this route appears to play only a minor ro le in transmission. Secondary attack rates within households are high and each strain has been more infectious than its predecessor. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 10 Groups affected by COVID -19 The risk of poorer outcomes from COVID -19 infection increases dramatically with age in both healthy adults and in adults with underlying health conditions. Those over the age of 65 years have by far the highest risk, and the risk increases steeply with age. Residents in care homes for older adults have been disproportionately affected by the COVI D-19 pandemic . Pregnant women with COVID -19 infection are more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit and the maternal mortality ratio, stillbirth rate and the number of neonatal deaths amongst pregnant women with COVID -19 infection all increased between the wildtype SARS -CoV-2 dominant period to the Delta strain dominant period. Although the likelihood of these events has decreased sinc e the Omicron strain achieved dominance , severity of COVID -19 infection remains higher in unvaccinated than vacc inated pregnant women. Severe COVID -19 requiring hospitalisation is rare in children and deaths even more so but for a small proportion of children with pre -existing health conditions, the risk of severe illness is greater. Longitudinal follow -up studies are ongoing to assess risks and outcomes in children. The incidence of the rare temporally associated presentation of paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PIMS -TS) has declined as the virus has mutated and natural and vaccine -induced immunity has increased. COVID -19 vaccination programme Phases and aims of the programme Primary immunisation The primary immunisation programme was introduced in 2 phases. Its main aim was to protect those who were at highest risk from serious illness or death . In Phase 1, individuals were ranked based on the risk of COVID -19 specific mortality (priority groups 1 -9) and this included occupational immunisation of health and social care staff . In Phase 2 the offer of primary vaccination was extended (in descending order of age) to all adults, and then incrementally further extended to children aged 5 and above , to protect those at risk from serious illness or death, and to protect the NHS by reducing the risks of hospi talisation and critical care admission, against a background of newly emerging variants. Reinforcing doses A completed primary course of vaccine was found to greatly reduce the risk of severe illness and hospitalisation but was less effective at preventin g infection due to the heavily mutated Omicron variant and protection declined to very low levels 6 months after the primary course. Reinforcing ('first booster') doses were therefore offered to individuals in priority groups 1 -9 COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 11 from autumn 2021. However, protection again declined during the following months and additional booster doses were advised for the groups at most risk of severe illness , resulting in a number of booster dose campaigns and, from 2022, a recommendation by the JCVI that regular, plann ed and targeted boosting is the most important control strategy. The ' Living with COVID -19' programme During 2023 there will be a transition towards a proportionate, focussed, and sustainable programme which aims to reduce severe disease (hospitalisation and mortality) and thus also to protect NHS capacity, with a particular focus on winter preparedness (a utumn campaigns) but with additional (spring) campaigns for those at the highest risk , who will be especially vulnerable over the later summer months as their immunity wanes . The primary course of vaccination will become a targeted offer available only to those at higher risk of severe COVID -19 and only during the planned seasonal booster campaigns. Exceptionally, based on clinical judgement, individuals who develop severe immunosuppression ( Boxes 1 and 2 of the Green Book COVID -19 chapter ) may be at high risk of severe COVID -19 and less able to sustain any protection from previous vaccination or exposure and should be considered for catch -up primary vaccination or additional dose(s) of vaccination before the next seasonal campaign. COVID -19 vaccination eligibility The JCVI consider s the available epidemiological, microbiological and clinical information on the impact of COVID -19 in the UK and provide s the gover nment with advice to support the development of the COVID -19 vaccine strategy. The programme therefore has changed and will continue to change over time in response to the most up to date information. All staff involved in delivering the programme need to understand who is eligible to receive COVID -19 vaccination, which vaccine they should receive, and the reasons why. Full details on vaccine eligibility, with detail o f the at -risk conditions, are included in the Green Book COVID -19 chapter and have therefore not been detailed in this document. Knowledge of the progression of the programme from its commencement will assist staff when deciding u pon the requirements for every individual in their care. This is covered in the training materials and the Green Book chapter 14a . COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 12 COVID -19 vaccines Vaccine development In response to the emergence of a new virus, scientists across the world worked collaboratively and rapidly to accelerate the development of safe and effective vaccines, using both existing vaccine technologies and new approaches. Some of the clinical tria l steps were conducted in parallel rather than sequentially in order to make these vaccines more quickly available without compromising vaccine safety. The vaccine trials and vaccine licensing have been subject to all of the usual strict regulatory require ments. This document discuss es the COVID -19 vaccines which have been authorised for administration in the UK to date and that are current ly being supplied. As each vaccine is presented, stored and prepared differently, immunisers must ensure they are fam iliar with the specific details of the vaccine with which they are working. UK v accine s The following COVID -19 vaccines are both licensed and currently supplied for use in the UK national COVID -19 vaccination programme (click on the hyperlinks to view their Summary of Product Characteristics documents (SPCs) or search for these in the Electronic Medicines Compendium ). Additional details about each vac cine are provided in Comirnaty vaccine. It's a bivalent vaccine licensed and recommended for primary and booster doses for eligible individuals aged 12 years and above. It is also referred to in this document is the 'paediatric' Comirnaty vaccine. It is a monovalent vaccine licensed and recommended for primary and booster doses for eligible individuals from 5 to 11 years of age, and for completing primary doses for eligible individuals aged 12 years old who commenced primary vaccination when aged 11. It is also referred to in this document as Comirnaty 10 Concentrate . Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose is It is a mono valent vaccine licensed for primary doses for eligible individuals from 6 months to 4 years of age . In certain circumstances it may be administered as a primary dose to children aged 5 years old . It is also referred to in this document as Comirnaty 3 (thre e) Concentrate . COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for is licensed for booster doses for individuals aged 12 years and above but is recommended for primary and booster doses , however only for eligible individuals aged 18 years and above. It is also referred to in this document vaccine Nuvaxovid is a monovalent recombinant, adjuvanted vaccine licensed for primary doses from age 12 years and for booster doses from aged 18 years but may be used for boosting from aged 12 years . It is available at selected sites to individuals for whom an mRNA vaccine is clinically unsuitable (only). The current stock has been granted a shelf -life extension until 31 May 2023. Sanofi COVID -19 vaccine VidPrev tyn Beta is a monovalent recombinant adjuvanted vaccine licensed for booster doses for individuals aged 18 years and above . It is recommended for booster doses for eligible individuals aged 75 years and above and , in defined operational circumstances , for some eligible individuals aged 65 years and above and for primary doses from that age. Other licensed vaccines The following vaccine is licensed by the MHRA but not currently being supplied bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 (5/5micrograms)/dose licensed for 5 to 11 years of age The following vaccines are no longer being supplied : Vaxevria ( Astra (Moderna) All the currently UK -authorised vaccines in use are supplied in multi -dose vials . Using multi - dose vials can improve the efficiency of vaccine manufacture and distribution, enabling vaccine availability at the earliest opportunity. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 14 Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna mRNA COVID -19 vaccines The Pfizer Moderna COVID -19 vaccines are mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccines. They contain the genetic sequence (mRNA) for the spike protein which is found on the surface of the SARS -CoV-2 virus, wrapped in a lipid envelope (referred to as a nanoparticle) to enable it to be transported into the cells in the body. When injected, the mRNA is taken up by the host's cells which translate the genetic information and produce the spike proteins. These are then dis played on the surface of the cell. This stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies and activate T -cells which prepare the immune system to respond to any future exposure to the SARS -CoV-2 virus by binding to and disabling any virus encountered. Comirnaty 3 (three) Concentrate and Comirnaty 10 Concentrate are monovalent ; they contain only the mRNA that encodes for the spike protein of the spike protein of the original (wi ldtype) virus and mRNA that encodes for the spike protein of the BA. 4-5 (or BA.1 ) sub-lineage of the Omicron variant. As there is no whole or live virus involved, the se vaccine s cannot cause disease. The mRNA naturally degrades after a few days. Sanofi C OVID -19 vaccine (VidPrevtyn Beta) VidPrevtyn Beta is recombinant adjuvanted vaccine . The genes (DNA) that encode for the spike (S) surface protein on the Beta variant (B.1.351 strain) of the SARS -CoV-2 virus are inserted into bacterial cells in the laborat ory. These cells then produce ('express') the S protein , which is then purified to produce the antigen component of the vaccine . The vaccine uses the AS03 adjuvant system. The role of the adjuvant is to hold the antigen at the injection site for longer so that the immune system can better recognise the antigen and to produce a stronger response by stimulating certain components of the innate immune system. There is no whole or live virus involved so the vaccine cannot cause disease . COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare COVID vaccine ( Nuvaxovid ) Nuvaxovid is a recombinant, adjuvanted vaccine for individuals aged 12 years or older when mRNA vaccines are considered clinically unsuitable . Very few individuals will require a dose of Nuvaxovid, and it will theref ore only be made available at a limited number of designated , accessible sites throughout the country , with locally agreed referral and assessment pathways developed and put in place. It is not therefore available to individuals who prefer not to receive one of the other suitable vaccines , only to those who are contraindicated. Nuvaxovid contains a laboratory produced form of the SARS -Cov-2 spike protein which stimulates the immune response, and an adjuvant to help strengthen that response. Either a prescription or a Patient Specific Direction is required for legal administration; the prescriber sho uld be familiar with the information in the product's summary o f product charac teristics and in the Green Book COVID -19 chapter . Training materials have been produced by the manufacturer. COVID -19 vaccine indications and schedule s Primary doses Eligibility Individuals aged 5 years and above Anyone who i s eligible for a spring 2023 booster dose but has not yet commenced or completed a primary course should first receive their outstanding primary dose(s). The 'evergreen' offer of primary immunisation remains in place during the spring 2023 campaign for all individuals aged 5 years and above who have yet to start or complete a primary course , including those in a clinical risk group from their 5th birthday. Note, however, that healthy children aged 5 (not in any clinical risk group) are only eligible if their 5th birthday occurred on or before 31st August 2022. The offer of primary immunisation is expected to cease at the end of this campaign for healthy individuals, whilst those in clinical risk groups (except those who are severely immunosuppressed) will not be able to receive any outstanding primary doses until the next seasonal campaign. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 16 Children aged 6 months to 4 years of age The offer of primary i mmunisation for children aged 6 months to 4 years of age in recognised clinical risk groups (as defined in Table 4 of the Green Book COVID -19 chapter ) will be implemented during the spring and summer 2023. Third primary doses for those aged 6 months and over with severe immunosuppression Individuals aged 6 months and above who were severely immunosuppressed (as defined in Boxes 1 and 2 of the Green Book COVID -19 chapter ) at or around the time of their primary immunisation should be offered a n age -appropriate third primary dose a minimum of 8 weeks after receiving their second dose . See additional information about third primary doses in the immunosuppression section under 'Specific population groups'. Vaccines for primary doses all primary doses . The Sanofi Pasteur COVID -19 vaccine VidPrevtyn Beta may be used off -label as a primary dose in those aged 65 years and over if there would otherwise be a delay in vaccination and when an mRNA vaccine is clinically unsuitable. For young people aged 12 years and above (but not yet 18 years of age) only t he Pfizer BioNTech Comirnaty bivalent Original/Omicron 15/15 used. Comirnaty 10 micrograms/ dose is recommended for all 5 to 11 year olds and for 12 year olds who, having commenced primary immunisation with this vaccine , had their 12th birthday between doses . Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose is licensed for primary doses for eligible individuals from 6 months to 4 years of age. Children below 6 years of age, including those who commenced immunisation with the 3 microgram infant dose before turning 5, may commence and complete primary vaccination with the 3 microgram s/dose vaccine if that is the only vaccine readily available in the clinic. Nuvaxovid is licensed for primary doses from age 12 years and may be used for individuals in whom an mRNA vaccine is clinically unsuitable. Once Nuvaxovid is no longer being supplied, an individual clinical judgement will be required regarding vaccination of individuals under 65 years of age for whom an mRNA vaccine is clinically unsuitable: expert advice should be obtained and , if a decision is made to administer an mRNA vaccine, it should be given in hospital under medical supervision. Vaccination of those aged 6 months to 11 years in whom mRNA vaccines are unsuitable requires an individual clinical judgement . COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 17 Schedules There is evidence of a better immune res ponse and /or protection where longer intervals between doses in the primary schedule are used . JCVI is therefore currently recommending an interval of 8 weeks between doses of all the available COVID -19 vaccines where a 2-dose primary schedule is used for adults and children from aged 6 months at high risk. Operationally, using the same minimum interval for all the COVID -19 vaccines simplif ies supply and booking and help s to ens ure a good balance between achieving rapid and long -lasting protection . Although Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose is licensed as a 3 dose primary course, the JCVI has recommended a 2 -dose schedule for eligible children aged 6 months to 4 years of age. The minimum interval is 8 weeks. The main exception to the 8 -week lower interval is for those about to commence immunosuppressive treatment. In these individuals, the minimal intervals (21 days for Pfizer BioNTech or Novavax vaccine s or 28 days for Moderna Spike vax vaccines ) may be followed to ensure that the vaccine is given whil e their immune system is better able to respond ; see: 'Timing of administration of COVID -19 vaccine to individuals who are or who are about to become immunosuppressed'. Individuals commencing their primary course during the present vaccination campaign Many eligible individuals who receive their first primary dose 8 weeks or less before the end of the present campaign will not be able to complete their primary course before this campaign ends. The only exception is individuals about to start immunosuppressive therapy who may be considered for a second dose at a shorter interval and those who develop severe immunosuppression who may be considered for an additiona l dose of vaccination between seasonal campaign (see the Green Book COVID -19 chapter ). All approved COVID -19 vaccines produce high short term antibody response s. Antibody responses are substantially higher in vaccinated individuals with evidence of natural infection, even after a single dose of vaccine. Seroprevalence studies indicate that most of the adult and childhood population have now been naturally infect ed, and therefore response to a single dose of vaccine is likely to be as good or better than a full primary course in a na\u00efve individual. It is therefore not recommended to shorten the minimum intervals in order to complete the course. Unvaccinated indivi duals who are eligible for a booster should be encouraged to receive their first dose during the campaign. Clinicians should, as part of the consent process, explain why they do not need a second dose at this time. Individuals in a clinical risk group may be able to receive a 2nd dose with the latest recommended vaccine during the next campaign (anticipated to be in the autumn of 2023) if COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 18 they remain eligible. JCVI will be reviewing the disease epidemiology, the prevalent variants and the expected vaccine effectiveness and announce details of who needs protection and will therefore be eligible during that campaign later this year. The primary offer to healthy individuals (not in a clinical risk group) will end when the spring 2023 campaign is completed. As above, those who develop severe immunosuppression may, on the basis of individual assessment, be considered for vaccination between campaigns, to accommodate optimal timing and ensure that they are best protected. Previous incomplete vaccination If the vaccine course is interrupted or delayed, it should be resumed preferably using the same vaccine, but any previous primary dose (s) should not be repeated. Circumstances in which different vaccines may be given for the first and second primary doses Evidence suggests that those who receive mixed schedules, including mRNA and adenovirus vectored vaccines (for example, Astra Zeneca Covid -19 vaccine Vaxevria) , make a good immune response, although rates of side effects with a heterologous second dose are higher. Accumulating evidence now supports the use of heterologous schedules for primary immunisation and any mRNA vaccine can be used to complete a primary co urse. For individuals who started the schedule and who attend for vaccination where the same vaccine is not available or suitable, or if the first product received is unknown or not available, one dose of the locally available product should be given to co mplete the primary course. Individuals who experienced severe expected reactions after a first dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer BioNTech vaccines should be informed about the higher rate of such reactions when they receive a second dose of an alternate vacci ne. Children aged 5 to 12 years who have commenced immunisation with the paediatric dose of Pfizer BioNTech Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose vaccine should ideally complete vaccination with the paediatric dose but a n adult/adolescent dose of a Comirnaty bival ent 15/15 micrograms/dose vaccine is an alternative in those who turn 12 years of age between doses. Those who present for the second dose over the age of 12 years should be given an adult/ adolescent dose of vaccine. Children below 6 years of age, includ ing those who commenced immunisation with the infant dose of Pfizer BioNTech Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose vaccine before turning 5, may commence and complete primary vaccination with the 3 microgram product if that is the only vaccine readily available in the clinic. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 19 Age-specific recommendations on vaccine type as set out in the Green Book COVID -19 chapter should be followed. Individuals who received COVID -19 vaccination overseas Emerging evidence on a wide range of COVID -19 vaccines, based on a range of different platforms and including the vaccines licensed in the UK, suggest that protection against mild disease declines rapidly - particularly against more recently emerged varian ts. Although protection against severe disease is maintained for longer, individuals at higher risk of severe COVID -19 are offered boosting at regular intervals. There is also clear evidence that many different heterologous primary schedules and/or differe nt heterologous boosters tend to provide higher or equivalent immune responses to homologous courses. Most vaccines in use, including those approved under the WHO EUL and others undergoing approval, are based either on the spike protein or whole inactiva ted vaccine, and this wealth of evidence suggests that, regardless of vaccine received, most individuals who have received at least one dose of vaccine will be primed for a spike antibody response. Based on first principles, this implies that administratio n of a single dose of any UK approved vaccine is likely to boost immunity in all of those individuals who received a previous vaccin ation abroad. Similarly, this also means that re -vaccination may result in a higher rate of known side effects . The overall balance of risk and benefit is not therefore in favour of routinely repeating a full course. Therefore, the guidance for immunocompetent individuals who move to the UK has been simplified . This is presented in a table as Appendix 1. In order to use the table, it is important to first establish whether the individual is eligible for vaccination according to UK recommendations and , whenever possible, ascertain which vaccines - if any - they have previou sly receive d. COVID -19 vaccine clinical trial participants Individuals who have participated in a clinical trial of either primary or booster COVID -19 vaccination should be provided with written advice on whether and when they should be safely vaccinat ed in the routine programme. Trial participants who are eligible for boosters should be offered vaccination in line with the general population, at least 3 months after the dose considered as the final primary dose or the final revaccination (if the latter is required for certification purposes). COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 20 Booster doses Spring 2023 booster campaign To provide additional protection for the most vulnerable over the spring and summer months, the JCVI has recommended that a booster dose should be given to: adults aged 75 years and over residents in a care home for older adults individuals aged 5 years and over who are immunosuppressed (defined as immunosuppressed in the Green Book COVID -19 chapter Tables 3 and 4) Further information about the booster programme s is available in the JCVI statements and also in the COVID -19 chapter of the Green Book . As primary vaccination of children aged 6 months to 4 years a t high clinical risk was only advised in early 2023, severely immunosuppressed children under 5 years of age will not be eligible for a booster in spring 2023. These children may be considered for additional doses at a later time point . Limits to vaccination offers and 'm issed' booster doses Booster doses offer time -limited protection (protection increases after each dose but then wanes over the following few months). Individuals who have not taken up the offer of additional doses therefore cannot be 'caught -up' as the dose(s) they missed were intended to protect them during a period of time that has now elapsed. If eligible they should be vaccinated during the current campaign and encouraged to take up any future offers that apply. Booster doses a re recommended on the basis of the current epidemiology of the disease and the specific risks to individuals and , therefore , may not be required for all individuals during every campaign. Sub-groups of individuals at highest risk may be selected for additi onal doses that are not offered to everyone in a clinical risk group. Only those individuals who are eligible for a spring 2023 booster should now receive a booster dose. The routine 'first booster' offer for all other eligible cohorts formally ended on 12th February 2023 with the closure of the Autumn 2022 booster campaign. The JCVI will announce its recommendations for booster doses for autumn 2023 in due course. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 21 Vaccine s to be used for spring 2023 booster doses Full details of the recommended vaccines for each cohort for the spring 2023 campaign are set out in the Green Book COVID -19 chapter . The evidence is that heterologous schedules are non -inferior, or in some cases superior, to single vaccine schedules, tha t mRNA vaccines provide a strong booster effect regardless of which vaccine was used for the primary course and that any mRNA vaccine can be used as a booster. The bivalent mRNA COVID -19 vaccines are licensed for boosting. The Pfizer BioNTech Comirnaty bivalent Original/Omicron 15/15 vaccines may be given to anyone aged 12 years and above. The Moderna Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 25/25 vaccines may be given to anyone aged 18 years and above. Sanofi COVID -19 vaccine VidPrevtyn Beta is an a dditional option for those aged 75 years and above . It is anticipated that the inclusion of an adjuvant in this vaccine will strengthen the immune response in these older individuals , who are at greatest risk of serious illness if they have a COVID -19 infe ction. In defined operational circumstances, this vaccine may also be administered to some eligible individuals aged 65 years and above. Nuvaxovid is licensed for booster doses from aged 18 years but is recommended from age 12 years as a booster dose when an mRNA vaccine is clinically unsuitable (contraindicated) . Access to this vaccine will be at designated sites, via locally agreed referral and assessment pathways. It is not therefore available to individuals who prefer not to receive one of the othe r suitable vaccines. When Nuvaxovid is no longer available, a dose of VidPrevtyn Beta may be considered for individuals aged 65 years and above. V accination of individuals of less than 65 years in whom mRNA vaccines are unsuitable will require an individu al clinical judgement : expert advice should be obtained and if a decision is made to administer an mRNA vaccine this should be given in hospital under medical supervision. Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose is licensed for boosting for individuals aged 5 to 11 years. Vaccination of those aged 5 to 11 years in whom mRNA vaccines are unsuitable requires an individual clinical judgement . Timeliness of vaccination is more important than the type of booster vaccine used. For those aged 12 and above, if the age appropriate bivalent mRNA vaccine containing the latest variant (currently Omicron BA.4 -5) is not available, a bivalent with a previo us variant (such as Omicron BA.1) may be used if there would otherwise be a delay in vaccination. The key priority of the programme should be for eligible individuals to be offered a booster vaccine dose to increase their immunity against severe COVID -19 (hospitalisation and death). Individuals offered vaccination should be advised that timely boosting is desirable to reinforce COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 22 their waning protection over the spring and summer months , and therefore to accept whichever booster vaccine is offered. Unknown vaccination history If the primary immunisation history of an individual eligible for a booster dose during the spring 2023 is unknown, it is preferable, rather than delay vaccination, to administer a dose of any suitable vaccine. If upon further investig ation this is discovered to have been their first primary dose then a second dose can be given, within the same vaccination campaign, after a minimum 8 week interval. If the campaign ends before these 8 weeks have elapsed and they remain eligible , they can receive this dose during the next campaign. If they are severely immunosuppressed clinical judgment should be used to determine the timing of this second dose, which may, if necessary, be administered between campaigns. Specific population g roups Immuno suppression Timing of administration of COVID -19 vaccine to individuals who are or are about to become immunosuppressed Individuals who have immunosuppression and HIV infection (regardless of CD4 count) should be given COVID -19 vaccine in accordance with the recommendations and contraindications stated in the COVID -19 vaccine PGDs and Protocols and Green Book COVID -19 chapter . Individuals with immunosuppression may not make a full immune response to vaccination. As there is limited evidence on response in im munosuppressed individuals there is also very little evidence upon which to base advice on the optimal timing of delivery. However, one study suggested immune responses were bett er in patients with cancer who received their chemotherapy at least 2 weeks earlier. Specialists may advise their patients based on their knowledge and understanding of their immune status and likely immune response to vaccination but should also consider the risk from COVID -19 and the patient's likelihood of exposure. Individuals aged 6 months and above who are about to receive planned immunosuppressive therapy should be considered for vaccination prior to commencing therapy (ideally at least 2 weeks before), when their immune system is better able to make a response. Where possible, it would also be preferable for the 2 -dose primary schedule to be completed prior to commencing immunosuppression. This would entail offering the second dose at the recom mended minimum for that vaccine (3 or 4 weeks from the first dose) to provide maximum COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 23 benefit that may not be received if the second dose was given during the period of immunosuppression. Any decision to defer immunosuppressive therapy or to delay possible benefit from vaccination until after therapy should not be taken without due consideration of the risks from COVID -19 and from their underlying condition. Third primary doses As some individuals who are immunosuppressed due to underlying health conditio ns or medical treatment may not mount a full immune response to COVID -19 vaccination, a third primary dose is recommended for individuals aged 6 months and over who were severely immunosuppressed at or around the time of their first or second primary COVID -19 vaccination (Boxes 1 and 2 in the Green Book chapter 14a ). Most individuals whose immunosuppression commenced at least 2 weeks after the second dose of vacci nation do not require an additional primary vaccination at this stage. Individuals who had received brief immunosuppression (40mg prednisolone per day) for an acute episode (for example, asthma , COPD or COVID -19) and individuals on replacement corticoster oids for adrenal insufficiency are not considered severely immunosuppressed sufficient to have prevented response to the primary vaccination. The specialist involved in the care of patients with immunosuppression should be involved in advising on the timin g of a third dose. If a third primary dose is required, ideally, it should be given at least 8 weeks after the second dose with special attention paid to the timing of any planned or current immunosuppressive therapy as vaccines administered during period s of minimum immunosuppression are more likely to generate better immune responses. Where possible the third dose should be delayed until 2 weeks after the period of immunosuppression, in addition to the time period for clearance of the therapeutic agent. If not possible, consideration should be given to vaccination during a treatment 'holiday' or when the degree of immunosuppression is at a minimum. Advice for patients on chemotherapy is avail able. The general p rinciples for the administration of a third dose and the criteria for a third primary dose are described in the JCVI advice and the Green Book C OVID -19 chapter . The JCVI advises a preference for an age -appropriate mRNA vaccine for the third primary dose. When mRNA vaccines are not considered clinically suitable, COVID -19 vaccine Nuvaxovid may be given as a primary dose to those aged 12 years and above. Individual clinical assessment is required for children aged 6 months to 11 years who are contraindicated to receiving an mRNA vaccine. Reinforcing doses Emerging evidence suggests that many patients with immunosuppression do derive protection after 2 doses of vaccination. However, just a s it does for immunocompetent individuals , protection from primary vaccination does decline over time. As those with immu nosuppression remain at higher risk of serious complications from COVID -19 infection, this group of individuals COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 24 have been eligible for a booster in the spring and autumn 2022 campaigns and are expected to be eligible for future seasonal campaigns. Those ag ed 5 years and above in this group will also require booster doses to extend protection from their primary course . A reinforcing (booster) dose should be offered from 3 months after the third primary dose (or last booster dose), ideally during a designat ed/seasonal vaccination campaign. Those who have not yet received their third dose should be given their third dose immediately to avoid further delay (at least 8 weeks after the second primary dose). A booster dose should then be given at least 3 months l ater, in line with the clinical advice on optimal timing in relation to the degree of immune suppression. If they have completed their primary course but not yet received any booster doses, they will require just one booster during the spring 2023 programm e. Some children with immunosuppression who turned 5 years of age after August 2022 may have been offered a booster during the autumn 2022 programme (provided there was at least 3 months since their final primary dose); they are eligible for a spring 2023 booster dose after a further minimum interval of 3 months has elapsed. Pregnant women COVID -19 vaccines can be given to pregnant women . Pregnancy is clinical risk group (see 'Groups affected by COVID -19'). Covid -19 vaccines can be administered at any sta ge of pregnancy to those who are eligible . Studies following the use of the COVID -19 vaccines in pregnant women have shown the vaccines to be safe and highly effective in preventing serious complications. Vaccination against COVID -19 can take place at the same time as, or at any interval before or after, other vaccines offered in pregnancy (pertussis, influenza). During the spring 2023 campaign, pregnant women may be offered primary vaccination as part of the 'Evergreen' offer as this remains in place for everyone already eligible who has yet to start or complete a primary course. Pregnant women who have already received a dose of AstraZeneca or Moderna vaccine can complete with any mRNA vaccine (provided there are no contraindications). If a woman finds out she is pregnant after she has started a course of COVID -19 vaccine, she should complete vaccination during pregnancy using th e same vaccine product (unless contraindicated). Although pregnancy is a clinical risk group, not all clinical risk groups are being offered a spring 2023 booster. Therefore, if they have previously completed their primary course, pregnant women are only eligible for a spring 2023 booster if they are also immunosuppressed , as defined in Tables 3 and 4 of the Green Book COVID -19 chapter . COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 25 Routine questioning abou t last menstrual period and/or pregnancy testing is not required before offering the COVID -19 vaccine. Eligible women who are planning pregnancy or are in the immediate postpartum can be vaccinated. Resources for pregnant and breastfeeding women are avail able from the UKHSA and on the RCM website . Professional resources are available from the RCM and the RCOG . Breastfeeding women COVID -19 vaccines can be given to eligible breastfeeding women . Those eligible for the spring 2023 campaign are women who require a primary dose as part of the 'Evergreen' offer or who are immunosuppressed - as defined in Tables 3 and 4 of the Green Book COVID -19 chapter - and require a spring 2023 booster dose. There is no known risk associated with giving non -live vaccines whilst breastfeeding. JCVI advises that eligible breastfeeding women should be offered vacci nation with any suitable COVID -19 vaccine. Emerging safety data is reassuring: mRNA was not detected in the breast milk of recently vaccinated women and protective antibodies have been detected in breast milk . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding are clear and should be discussed with the woman, along with h er clinical need for immunisation against COVID -19. Children and young people Interval between doses for 5 to 17 year olds who are not in a clinical risk group For those aged 5 to 17 who are not in a high -risk group, a 12 -week interval is preferred but an 8 week interval is acceptable and may be necessary for operational reasons or in order to complete the course during the campaign. As the programme is moving to only offer vaccination to children and young people at clinical risk an eight -week interval will now be the most common schedule in all age groups. Previous guidance recommended a 12 week interval in healthy children, which reflected the balance of risk -benefit in these individuals. Emerging evidence suggested that countries with longer schedules (8 to 12 weeks) may have a lower rate of myocarditis and high levels of protection against severe disease were seen after the first dose . JCVI took a precaution ary approach to mitigate the very rare risk of post -vaccine myocarditis , but the benefits in those at clinical risk were deemed more in favour of completing primary vaccination earlier . COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 26 Vaccination of children and young people who have recently had COV ID-19 infection There is no longer any requirement for vaccination to be deferred for a prescribed interval following COVID -19 infection . Follow the guidance provided under ' Vaccination of individuals with a current or previous history of COVID -19 disease '. For eligible children who have developed Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS -CoV-2 infection (PIMS -TS) the advice of the paediatrician treating them should be sought with regard to the timing of their COVID -19 vaccination(s). Administration of COVID -19 vaccine Infection prevention and control All those attending for vaccination and those delivering vaccination should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) as described in the infection prevention and control (IPC) advice current at the time of administering the vaccine. Wearing gloves is not recommended . Hand hygiene is critical to prevent the spread of infection and hands should be cleaned with alcohol -based gel or soap and water before vaccine preparation, between patients, and so on. Those preparing and administering the vaccine should maintain good hand hygiene throughout and should take care not to touch the vial bung with their fingers. Injection technique COVID -19 vaccines should b e administered by intramuscular (IM) injection, preferably into the densest part of the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Individuals who have minimal muscle mass in the deltoid area of the upper arm, or a particular reason to avoid immunisation in the del toid muscle, can be given their vaccine in the vastus lateralis muscle in the thigh if necessary. The area for injection should be clearly visible and accessible. Garments with long or tight sleeves may need to be removed. The injection site does not need to be cleaned unless visibly dirty. If cleaning is required, water should be used and the area dried with a gauze swab. It is not necessary to disinfect the skin. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 27 Insert the needle into the injection site far enough to ensure it will deliver the vacc ine into the muscle and depress the plunger. There is no need to pull back on the plunger (aspirate) before the plunger is depressed to release the vaccine into the muscle because there are no large blood vessels at the recommended injection sites. Ensure the full dose is administered as a partial dose may not evoke a full immune response. Remove the needle and if there is any visible blood at the injection site, the patient can apply pressure to the site with a piece of gauze or cotton wool. Administer ing COVID -19 vaccine to individuals with a bleeding disorder Individuals with bleeding disorders may be vaccinated intramuscularly if, in the opinion of a doctor familiar with the individual's bleeding risk, vaccines or similar small volume intramuscular injections can be administered with reasonable safety by this route. If the individual receives medication or treatment to reduce bleeding, for example treatment for haemophilia, intramuscular vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such medication or treatment is administered. A fine needle (23 or 25 gauge) should be used for the vaccination, followed by firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes (ACIP , 2021). The individual or carer should be informed about the risk of haematoma from the injection. Administering COVID -19 vaccine to individuals taking anticoagulants Individuals on stable anticoagulation therapy, including individuals on warfarin who are up to date with their scheduled INR testing and whose latest INR was below the upper threshold of their therapeutic range, can receive intramuscular vaccination. If in any doubt, consult with the clinician responsible for prescribing or monitoring the individual's a nticoagulant therapy. The separate needles and syringes and the fixed -needle dose -sparing syringes being supplied for administration of the COVID -19 vaccines are suitable for use for vaccination of people with bleeding disorders or anticoagulation therapi es. Period of observation following immunisation with COVID -19 vaccine Following COVID -19 vaccine administration, vaccinated individuals should be observed for any immediate reactions whilst they are receiving any verbal post vaccination information (such as COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 28 possible reactions and what, if anything, to do about these) and exiting the vaccination centre . They, or their parent/ carer, should also be informed where they can obtain further advice if they require it following vaccination. According to the Summa ries of Product Characteristics, it is recommended that all recipients of any COVID -19 vaccine are kept for observation and monitored for a minimum of 15 minutes , however the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) has suspended this requirement in individuals without a history of allergy . The advice to suspend the routine 15 minute observation period therefore applies to all currently available COVID -19 vaccines in all age groups. Reporting of adverse events including anaphylaxis via the Yellow Card Scheme is strongly encouraged and the MHRA will continue to monitor and report on these. Vaccinated individuals should be informed about how to access immediate healthcare advice in the eve nt of displaying any symptoms . In some settings, for example domiciliary vaccination, this may require a responsible adult to be present for at least 15 minutes after vaccination. Patients with a personal history of allergy will require a period of observation following vaccination (either 15 or 30 minutes depending on their clinical history). These individuals should be managed as described in Table 5 of the Green Book COVID -19 chapter . No specific management is required for patients with a family history of allergies. As fainting can occur following vaccination, all those vaccinated with any of the COVID -19 vaccines should either be driven by someone else or should not drive for 15 minutes after vaccination. Advice to vaccine recipients following immunisation with COVID -19 vaccine Following COVID -19 vaccine administration, vaccine recipients should be given information about possible reactions to the vaccine (see adverse reactions section below), how to treat these, and when and from whom to seek further advice if required. Vaccinators should offer t he manufacturer's patient information leaflet for the vaccine that they have received and an age appropriate UKHSA information leaflet in an accessible format. Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) A rare condition involving seri ous thromboembolic events accompanied by thrombocytopenia, has been reported after vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine , which has not been supplied since September 2022 . Guidance about subsequent dosing is covered in the cautions and precauti ons section of this document. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 29 Myocarditis and pericarditis Cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium) have been reported rarely in people who have received COVID -19 vaccine. The reported rate appears to be highest in those under 25 years of age and in males, and after the second dose. Onset is within a few days of vaccination and most cases are mild, recovering within a short time following standard treatment and rest without any sequalae . Vaccinated individuals should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they experience new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or arrhythmias. As the mechanism of action and risk of recurrence of myocarditis and peric arditis are being investigated, the current advice is that an individual's second or subsequent doses should be deferred pending further investigation and careful consideration of the risks and benefits . Details of antibody testing and how to proceed with further doses is de scribed in the Green Book COVID -19 chapter . Further detailed information for healthcare professionals on myocarditis and peric arditis following COVID -19 vaccination is also available . Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) Very rare reports have been received of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) following COVID -19 vaccination , so healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of GBS to ensure correct diagnosis , in order to initiate adequate supportive care and treatment and to rule out other causes. Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a very rare and seriou s condition that affects the nerves. It mainly affects the feet, hands and limbs, causing problems such as numbness, weakness and pain. In severe cases, GBS can cause difficulty moving, walking, breathing and or swallowing. Individuals who have a history of GBS should be vaccinated as recommended for their age and underlying risk status. Cases of GBS that occur following vaccination may occur by chance (the background rate of GBS is 2 per 100 000 per year in the population) and no causal mechanism with vac cination has been proven. There is evidence to suggest that having had a prior diagnosis of GBS does not predispose an individual to further episodes of GBS when immunised with other vaccines and for the Pfizer BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine. I n those who are d iagnosed with GBS after the first dose of vaccine, the balance of risk /benefit is in favour of completing a full COVID -19 vaccination schedule. On a precautionary basis, however, where GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of an AstraZeneca vaccine, the Pfizer B ioNTech or Moderna mRNA COVID -19 vaccines are preferred for any future doses. Where GBS occurs following either of the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna) , further vaccination can proceed as normal, once recovered. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 30 Further information on GBS following COVI D-19 vaccination is available. Thrombocytopenia Cases of thrombocytopenia (without thrombosis) have been reported rarely following receipt of Astra Zeneca and other COVID -19 vaccines. Some of these cases have occurred in individuals with a history of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) (a condition where the immune system does not function correctly and attacks and destroys platelets in the blood; platelets help the blood to clot so this can lead to bruising and bleeding). Previous ITP is not a c ontraindication for vaccination but guidance produced by the UK ITP Forum Working Party advises discussing the potential for a fall in platelet count in patients with a history of ITP receiving any COVID -19 vaccine and recommends a platelet count check 2 t o 5 days after vaccination ( British Society for Haematology COVID -19 updates ). Individuals who experience d ITP in the 4 weeks after the first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine should be assess ed by a haematologist and the risk benefit of further vaccination and with which product should be considered on an individual basis. If receiving further vaccination, the platelet count should be monitored. Additional advice for vaccine recipients Vacci ne recipients should also be advised that it may take a few days for protection from their COVID -19 booster vaccination to develop (longer if they have received a primary dose) and that they should continue to follow advice current at the time regarding infection prevention and control measures such as washing their hands thoroughly and frequently. If a vaccine recipient experiences any symptoms or there is any other reason that makes them or their parent/carer think that may have COVID -19, they stay at home and avoid contact with other people, especially with anyone who is at higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID - 19.The latest advice is available on the NHS website . Some individuals are still e ligible for testing. The COVID -19 vaccine will not interfere with testing for COVID -19 infection should this be required. The lateral flow device (LFD) test detects a different protein of the virus than the one encoded in the vaccine, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test detects different genes of the virus than the one included in the vaccine. As no vaccine is completely effective, some people may still become infected with coronavirus despite having been vaccinated (although this should be less s evere). The vaccine cannot cause COVID -19 infection. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 31 Adverse reactions following vaccination Possible adverse reactions following vaccination The types and rates of local and systemic reactions va ry by vaccine product , dose number and the age of the recipient. The Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for the vaccine being administered should therefore always be consulted. However, commonly reported reactions following COVID -19 vaccination include : Local reactions: injection si te pain, redness and localised swelling; these usually occur - and resolve - within a few days of the injection . Systemic reactions: tiredness , headache , mus cle aches , chills , joint pain , and a raised temperature (pyrexia) ; nausea or vomiting and axillary lymph gland swelling or tenderness are also reported. Symptoms are usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolve within a few days after vaccination. Rates of reactions are higher in people when mixed ( heterologous ) vac cine schedules are received. Reporting adverse reactions Suspected adverse reactions following administration of COVID -19 vaccine should be reported to the MHRA . Both vaccine recipients and healthcare providers can report any possible adverse reactions o bserved with these vaccines using the Yellow Card scheme. As new vaccine products, the MHRA have a specific interest in the reporting of adverse drug reactions for COVID -19 vaccines. Any adverse reaction to a vaccine should be documented in the individual's record and the individual's GP should be informed. The MHRA publishes details of yellow card reports following the receipt of the UK -approved COVID -19 vaccines . COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 32 Differentiating between a reaction to the vaccine and symptoms of COVID -19 disease Vaccinated individuals should be advised that the COVID -19 vaccine may cause a mild fever which usually resolves within 48 hours. This and other 'f lu-like' symptoms are common, expected reactions and will generally resolve within a few days without treatment, but if required, symptomatic treatment with analgesic and or anti -pyretic medicinal products (for example paracetamol -containing products) may be used. Commonly reported COVID -19 symptoms include headache, fatigue, cough myalgia (aching muscles), Omicron is less likely to cause loss of sense of smell (anosmia) and more likely to cause a sore throat. If someone experiences any of these or any ot her symptoms or any other reason that makes them think they may have COVID -19, they should try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people, especially with anyone who is at higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID -19. The latest advice is av ailable on the NHS website . Some individuals are still eligible for testing. The COVID -19 vaccine will not interfere with testing for COVID -19 infection should this be required. As has always been re commended, any fever after vaccination should be monitored and if individuals are concerned about their health at any time, they should seek advice from their GP or NHS 111. COVID -19 vaccine contraindications and precautions Relative contraindications to receiving a COVID -19 vaccine are: individuals who have had a previous systemic anaphylaxis reaction to a COVID - 19 vaccine individuals with a prior allergic reaction to any component (excipient) of the COVID -19 vaccine , for example polyethylene glycol The Green Book C OVID -19 chapter provides full details about the contraindications and precautions to COVID -19 vacc ine. Everyone involved in the COVID -19 vaccination programme should ensure they have read the latest online version of this Green Book chapter so that they are familiar with all the contraindications and precautions to the COVID -19 vaccines. Where there is any doubt as to whether the vaccine can be given, appropriate advice should be sought from the relevant specialist, or from the local immunisation team or health protection team . COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 33 Thrombosis and thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) A condition involving serio us thromboembolic events accompanied by thrombocytopenia, has been reported after AstraZeneca vaccination. There is no evidence of any underlying risk factors in the individuals affected by this condition who have mainly been previously healthy. The condit ion is rare, tends to present with unusual forms of clotting and the mechanism is believed to be an idiosyncratic reaction related to an immune response to the AstraZeneca vaccine . Because of this likely immune mechanism, there is no reason to believe tha t individuals with a past history of clots or of certain thrombophilic conditions (inc luding pregnancy or taking the contraceptive pill) would be at increased risk of this very rare condition. There have been no confirmed cases reported in pregnant women t o date. Individuals with past clotting episodes and those diagnosed with thrombophilia, whether or not they are on long term anti -coagulation, remain at risk of COVID -19 disease. Individuals who experience d a clotting episode with concomitant thrombocyt openia following the first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine should be properly assessed. If they are considered to have had the reported condition, further vaccination should be deferred until their clotting has completely stabilised . Current evidence supports a decision to complete the primary course or boost patients with a history of TTS with an mRNA vaccine, provided at least 12 weeks has elapsed from the implicated dose. Individuals who ha d received the first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine without developing this rare condition were advised to receive the second dose of the same vaccine as there is no signal of an increased risk of this condition after the second dose . Eligible individuals who did not take up the offer of a second primary dose of Astra Zeneca vaccine, and now wish to complete their prior course, should be offered an mRNA vaccine. Although the Astra Zeneca vaccine is no longer supplied, individuals may still have questions and c oncerns that relate to thi s. It is therefore helpful for staff to have some knowledge about TTS - see Information for healthcare professionals on blood clotting following COVID -19 vaccination . Capillary Leak Syndrome Extremely rare reports of capillary leak syndrome have been reporte d after AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines in individuals with a prior history of this condition. Individuals with a history of capillary leak syndrome, should be carefully counselled about the risks and benefits of vaccination and advice from a specialist s hould be sought. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 34 Capillary leak syndrome causes fluid and proteins to leak out of the capillaries into surrounding tissues. This may lead to very low blood pressure, low blood albumin levels and thickened blood due to a decrease in plasma volume. Initial symptoms may include tiredness, nausea, abdominal pain, extreme thirst and sudden increase in body weight. Complications can include general swelling, compartment syndrome, kidney failure and stroke. Minor illness at time vaccination due Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation may be postponed until they have fully recovered. This is to avoid confus ing the differential diagnosis of any acute illness (including COVID -19) by wrongly attributing any signs or symptoms of the illness as being possible reactions to the vaccine. Vaccination of individuals with a current or previous history of COVID -19 di sease Vaccination of individuals who may be infected or asymptomatic or incubating COVID -19 infection is unlikely to have a detrimental effect on the illness , but anyone currently experiencing symptoms of COVID -19 disease should not attend for vaccination until they have recovered , to avoid infecting others at the vaccination clinic. Although it was previously advised to wait a certain period of time following confirmed or suspected COVID infection, this is no longer the case, however, as some individual s with COVID -19 disease can continue to develop new symptoms or experience worsening of their symptoms for up to 2 weeks after infection, vaccination should ideally be deferred until clinical recovery. Individuals with a previous history of COVID -19 disea se (confirmed or suspected) These people can - and should - still receive COVID -19 vaccine. Vaccination in these circumstances would be expected to boost any pre -existing antibodies. It is not known how long antibodies made in response to natural infectio n persist and it is known that hybrid immunity - a combination of natural immunity and vaccine -induced immunity - enhances protection against severe disease (which is the aim of the booster programme). There is no evidence of any safety concerns from receiving a COVID -19 vaccine if antibodies have already been made to the disease following natural infection. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 35 During care home outbreaks, vaccination of residents with confirmed COVID -19 may go ahead, provided the residents are clinically stable and infection control procedures can be maintained. These populations are likely to be highly vulnerable and this policy should help to maximise vaccination coverage without the need for multiple visits. There is n o minimum interval between COVID -19 infection and receipt of any vaccination as long as the individual is recovered. Recent vaccination with other vaccines does not affect testing for COVID -19 infection in the event that this is required. Vaccination of people experiencing prolonged COVID -19 symptoms ('Long COVID') Having prolonged COVID -19 symptoms is not a contraindication to receiving COVID -19 vaccine but if the patient is seriously debilitated, still under active investigation, or has e vidence of recent deterioration, deferral of vaccination may be considered to avoid incorrect attribution of any change in the person's underlying condition to the vaccine. Treatments for COVID -19 disease (for example monoclonal antibody , steroids or ant iviral medicines) and vaccine administration Monoclonal antibody preparations containing specific man -made antibodies which bind to the surface of the SARS -CoV-2 virus and stop it from attaching to the body's cells and replicating further have recently bee n licensed for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID -19 infection. No specific interval is required between receipt of these products and COVID -19 vaccination. As the use of these products is likely to be prioritised to those who are less able to respond to vaccination, for example immunosuppressed individuals, additional doses of vaccine may be required (see section on administration of COVID -19 vaccine to individuals who are immunosuppressed ). Steroid treatments such as dexamethasone may be given to patients experiencing severe COVID -19 symptoms to suppress the immune response and reduce inflammation. As the currently authorised COVID -19 vaccines are non -live vaccines, the response to these vaccines should not be affected by short -term steroid treatment. In addition, by the time a person who has received steroid treatment for COVID -19 infection is well enough to receive a COVID -19 vaccination, the suppressant effect of the steroid treatment should be gone. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 36 Antiviral medic ines prevent further replication of viruses. As none of the currently authorised COVID -19 vaccines contain live replicating virus, response to COVID -19 vaccine will not be affected by prior or recent receipt of anti -viral medication. Therefore, none of th ese treatments would contraindicate COVID -19 vaccine . Co-administration of COVID -19 vaccine with other inactivated or live vaccines This is not a reason to defer any COVID -19 vaccination but should be taken into account when providing advice. Based on what is known about how vaccines and the immune system work, it was thought when any COVID -19 vaccine was co -administered with another vaccine there would be limited interference and that any potential interference was most likely to result in a slightly a ttenuated (weaker) immune response to one of the vaccines. A few studies have more recently been conducted and indicate that co -administration does not clinically diminish vaccine effectiveness. There is no evidence of any safety concerns, although co -admi nistration may make the attribution of any adverse events more difficult. Based on the available evidence, therefore: where individuals in an eligible cohort present having recently received one or more vaccines, whether inactivated or live, COVID -19 va ccination should still be given the same applies for other live and inactivated vaccines where COVID -19 vaccination has been received first or where a patient presents requiring 2 or more vaccines It is generally better for vaccination to proceed to avoid any further delay in protection and to avoid the risk of the patient not returning for a later appointment. This includes but is not limited to all vaccines commonly administered around the same time or in the same settings to anyone who is eligible to receive a Comirnaty 10 Concentrate COVID -19 vaccine. Where co -administration does occur, children/parents/carers should be informed about the likely timing of potential adverse events relating to each vaccine. If the vaccines are not given together, they can be administered at any interval . If more than one vaccine is given at the same time, they should preferably be given in different limbs. Where this is not possible, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart and the site at which each vaccine was given should be clearly documented in the patient's records. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 37 Legal aspects of vaccine administration All vaccines are classified as prescription only medicines (POMS). This means that they are subject to legal restrictions and in order to give them, there needs to be an appropri ate legal framework in place before they can be supplied and or administered to eligible people. Additionally, any person who supplies and administers a vaccine must have a legal authority to do so. This legal authority may be in the form of a written pati ent specific prescription, a Patient Specific Direction (PSD), a Patient Group Direction (PGD) or another process such as a Written Instruction or a Protocol The MHRA's guidance Patient group directions: who can use them is a good overview and includes links to additional resources from the Specialist Pharmacy Service (SPS) and the National Institute for health and Care Excelle nce (NICE). The UKHSA are developing and updating PGDs (and protocols - see below) for the COVID -19 vaccines as they are authorised. See 'Protocols and patient group directions (PGDs) '. Protocols for the supply and or administration of COVID -19 vaccine In order to ensure that the UK has a sufficiently sized workforce to deliver a COVID -19 vaccine programme, the change s to the Human Medicines Regulations (The Human Medicines (Coronavirus and Influenza) (Amendment) Regulations 2020), also brought about a new regulation (247A). While a disease is pandemic, Regulation 247A permits the supply or administration of a medicina l product used for vaccination or immunisation against coronavirus in accordance with a protocol that is approved by ministers. The national protocol s allow specified classes of people, which need not be limited to registered healthcare professionals, to administer COVID -19 vaccine. In accordance with regulation 247A, the protocol specifies: the characteristics of and training required for health care workers permitted to administer vaccine under the protocol, the requirement for individuals to be designated and authorised to administer medicines under the protocol by an appropriate manager (in th e employing organisation), record keeping requirements (including the requirement to record the name of the person who administers the vaccine) and requirements for the supervision, where appropriate, of the people administering the vaccine. The protocol also includes information similar to that commonly found in PGDs, for example, who is eligible for vaccination under the protocol and who is not, actions to be taken if the COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 38 patient is excluded or declines the vaccine, a description of the vaccine, route of administration, dose, frequency, reporting of adverse reactions, recording, storage and disposal. The protocol may be followed wholly from patient assessment through to post -vaccination by a single person. Alternatively, multiple health care workers may undertake stages in the patient vaccination pathway in accordance with the protocol. Where multiple person models are used, the service provider or contractor must ensure that all elements of the protocol are complied with in the provision of vaccination t o each individual. The service provider or contractor is responsible for ensuring that health care workers are trained and competent to safely deliver the activity they are employed to provide under the protocol. See also: The legal mechanisms available for giving COVID -19 vaccines and their application on the Specialist Pharmacy Service website. Accountability When working to some or all of the protocol, registered healthcare workers are responsible and accountable for their practice. They are accountable to their regulatory body and to their employer. When administering vaccines under the proto col, non -registered healthcare workers are accountable to their employer. Their employer is responsible for ensuring they are suitably trained, have completed the necessary competency assessment and are provided with an appropriate level of supervision when carrying out their duties under the protocol. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 39 Inadvertent vaccine administration errors : dosing Administration of a larger than recommended dose For example: a full dose of is administered instead of the recommended Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose vaccine to indiv iduals aged less than 12 years a vial of Pfizer BioNTech Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose vaccine is first diluted, and the entire contents of the multi -dose vial are then drawn up and administered to one individual the entire contents of a vial of a 'ready drawn up and administered to one individual a full vial of corre ctly mixed Sanofi VidPrevtyn Beta is administered to one individual a dose of Comirnaty 10 micrograms/ dose vaccine is given to a child aged 6 months to less than 5 years instead of the recommended Comirnaty 3 micrograms/ dose vaccine In this situation th e individual will have received additional antigen. Studies have indicated that they may be more likely to experience pain in their injected arm but that this is not generally otherwise harmful. If an individual is given more than the recommended dose: they should be monitored and treated for any symptoms as required. They should be reassured that this is not generally harmful but that they may be more likely to experience pain in their injected arm all individuals in receipt of vaccination should be pro vided with the advice within the leaflet What to expect after your COVID -19 vaccination , and it is important that the advice it contains about heart inflammation is brought to their and, if applicable, their parents' or carers' attention any subsequent doses due should still be given as per the recommended schedule COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 40 Moderna Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4 - 5 or BA.1 vaccine given in error to a person of less than 18 years of age Moderna Spikevax bivalent vaccines although licensed (from age 12 years for Spikevax Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 and 6 years for Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1) are not recommended for use in individuals of les s than 18 years of age because of the slightly higher risk of myocarditis/pericarditis compared to Pfizer vaccines. All individuals in receipt of vaccination should be provided with the advice within the leaflet 'What to expect after your administered to a child or young person, it is important that the advice it contains about heart inflammation is brought to their and their parents' or c arers' attention. The dose will be effective and does not need repeating. If further doses are indicated an age- appropriate vaccine should be administered. Sanofi VidPrevtyn Beta vaccine given in error to a person of less than 65 years of age Although th is use is not recommended by the JCVI, Sanofi VidPrevtyn Beta vaccine is licensed from age 18 years. The dose does not need repeating. Inadvertent administration of Sanofi VidPrevtyn Beta vaccine as a primary dose VidPrevtyn Beta is licensed for individu als 18 years of age and older. Provided the individual does not have any underlying health conditions that would contraindicate receiving the vaccine, or an allergy to any of the excipients, any immediate issues will relate to the adverse effects for routine administration as detailed in the SPC. VidPrevtyn Beta is licensed only for booster doses. Although the study data provided to support its authorisation by the MHRA relate to its use as a booster following a primary course, in the initial clinical tria ls it was found to generate antibodies when given as a primary dose. Therefore, although not licensed for priming this dose does not need to be repeated. If this was a first primary dose a vaccine recommended for priming should be used to complete the prim ary course, after the recommended minimum interval of 8 weeks, and in line with current operational arrangements. There is strong evidence that individuals receiving a mixed COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 41 primary schedule make a good immune response, although rates of side effects with a heterologous second dose are higher. Local reporting procedures should be followed and, in order to minimise the risk of this occurring again, operational processes should be in place to ensure that prior vaccination history is reviewed before vaccine a dministration. Pfizer Comirnaty bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 or BA.1 vaccine given in error to a child aged 5 to 11 years This is not a licensed use of this vaccine. A child of this age requires just a 10 microgram dose to produce effective immunity. A dose of 30 micrograms (15 micrograms of each of 2 COVID -19 strains). This dose does not need repeating. Follow up should be as per 'Administration of a larger than recommended dose'. Pfizer Comirnaty 10 micrograms/ dose given in error to a child aged 6 months to 4 years of age Follow the advice for 'administration of a larger than recommended dose'. Pfizer Comirnaty 3 micrograms/ dose given in error to a child aged 7 years or older Follow the advice for inadvertent administration of an incomplete dose Inadvertent administration of an incomplete do se This may be noticed immediately: the vaccine and/or dose selected and administered are incorrect, but the amount of vaccine given is known less than the full dose of COVID -19 vaccine is inadvertently given, for example, if some vaccine leaks out as it is being administered, and the quantity administered is uncertain COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 42 Other common scenarios occur where a number of people are vaccinated before it is noticed that some vaccine remains, or where a lower dose is recorded but it is not clear whether this is a true under -dosing or a recording error. In these scenarios, where individuals have experienced a possible under -dosing, an overall assessment of the risks and benefits of re - vaccination for the population need to be considered alongside an assessment of th e feasibility and operational complexity of a lookback. Risk assessment Where less than the recommended dose vaccine has been administered a risk assessment should be undertaken. This risk assessment should consider: the level of certainty around the do sing error (is the amount that has been given known or estimated?) the suspected level of underdosing (how much of the recommended dose was given?) the risk profile of the individual (for example: their age, whether they are immunosuppressed or have an und erlying clinical risk condition, whether they have previously had a confirmed COVID -19 infection) type of dose (primary or booster dose; previous COVID -19 vaccination history) This risk assessment is recommended because there is a possibility of increased reactogenicity following receipt of an additional dose. In addition, following mRNA re -vaccination, there is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following mRNA re -vaccination, notably in younger age groups. These factors should be weighed ag ainst the risk of a lower immune response to less than the recommended dose of vaccine. In many cases a duty of candour exists to inform the individual of the dose error. However, if the dosing error is not considered to be of clinical significance - for example, if the response is expected to be equivalent to another approved vaccine , or if it is unclear whether there was a genuine error, then a local decision may be made regarding whether to inform those exposed. The UKHSA publication Vaccine incident guidance: Responding to errors in vaccine storage, handling and administration includes sections about Duty of Candour and incident management. Effectiveness of COVID -19 vaccin es All approved COVID -19 vaccines produce high short term antibody responses. Antibody responses are substantially higher in vaccinated individuals with evidence of natural infection, even after a single dose of vaccine. Seroprevalence studies indicate tha t most of the adult and childhood population have been naturally infected. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 43 The strong evidence of a prime -boost response, including with heterologous schedules with other vaccines, means that a single episode of under -dosing with an mRNA product is unlike ly to be clinically significant in virtually all individuals. There is less information to support decisions about under -dosing with VidPrevtyn, but as the vaccine includes an adjuvant, and those receiving it are likely to have been primed by vaccine, natu ral infection or both, smaller doses may well lead to an effective boost. Note that there is no longer a different dose recommendation for primary and reinforcing doses for any of the available mRNA vaccines. Repeat doses Where, following a risk assessme nt, the risk of under -dosing is considered substantial, and it is recommended that a full additional dose should be given, it is preferable to do this immediately. If the error is only realised after the individual leaves the vaccination clinic, i t is rec ommended that the repeat dose should be offered from 48 hours after the possible partial dose was given. The 48 hour wait period is to allow for any reactions experienced following the incomplete dose to resolve before the repeat dose is given. It is recommended that the repeat dose should be given within 7 days of the incomplete dose to minimise the time the individual may be left susceptible to infection. If more than 7 days have elapsed, a further assessment will be required to decide on the optimal timing for a repeat dose, considering the individual risk and epidemiological context (for example, time of year), plus the risk of side -effects. If the dose is repeated, the recipient should be advised of possible side effects. The interval required bef ore the next scheduled dose should be calculated from the date of the additional dose. Inadvertent administration of a dose of vaccine whose potency may have been adversely affected by an inadvertent storage or preparation error For example: inadvertent administration of incorrectly diluted Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose vaccine or Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose vaccine In these scenarios expert advice should be sought as it is it is important to include, as part of the assessment, a calculation of the dose administered and what the available potency data indicate for that dose. The guidance for risk assessment and repeat doses for 'Underdosing' also applies and should be followed. The UKHSA publication Vacc ine incident guidance: COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 44 Responding to errors in vaccine storage, handling and administration includes guidance for the management of these incidents. Staff vaccinating children should be aware of the differences between the concentrate and diluent volumes for the infant and paediatric Pfizer products as mixing these up will result in either giving too much or too little antigen: Comirnaty 3 Concentrate Comirnaty 10 Concentrate Concentrate for dispersion in each vial 0.4ml 1.3ml Volume of diluent (0.9% sodium chloride) to be added to each vial 2.2ml 1.3ml Volume of each dose 0.2ml 0.2ml Number of doses per vial 10 10 Strength of each dose 3 micrograms 10 micrograms If 2.2ml of diluent is incorrectly added to the Comirnaty 10 Concentrate vial, in each 0.2ml dose will contain too small a dose . Follow the guidance in the 'Inadvertent administration of an incomplete dose' section regarding risk assessment and, if then indicated, repeat dosing. If 1.3ml of diluent is incorrectly added to the Comirnaty 3 (three) Concentrate vial, each 0.2ml dose will contain too large a dose. Follow the advice for 'administration of a larger than recommended dose' regarding advice, monitoring and management of post -vaccination symptoms . Administration of a dose of VidP revtyn Beta that has not been refrigerated after mixing Once mixed, VidPrevtyn Beta can be kept for a maximum of 6 hours, after which it must be discarded. Ideally, the vaccine should be returned to storage (vaccine fridge or cool box) between doses at a temperature of + 2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C. If for some reason it has remained at room temperature but is used within 6 hours of mixing then no action will need to be taken in respect of any doses that have already been given, nor would we advise that the unused vaccine is discarded before 6 hours have elapsed. There is no requirement to remove the mixed vaccine from the fridge for a specific period of time before administration. The product will quickly come up to a comfortable temperature for administration whilst the dose is being drawn up. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 45 Inadvertent administration of the Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose or Comirnaty 1 0 micrograms/dose diluent and Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose v accines is sodium chloride, which is purified water with a very small amount of salt in it. This diluent is commonly used to dilute other medicines and no adverse reactions would be expected if it was inadvertently administered alone. However, the diluent alone will not evoke an immune response so the person should be given a properly reconstituted dose as soon as the error is realised. Inadvertent administration of a ready to use vaccine that has been diluted COVID -19 vaccines to use and do not require dilution. If they are in error diluted prior to admin istration the amount of antigen in each dose will be less. I n the event that these vaccines are diluted and administered in error the dose should be repeated as soon as the error is realised using a correctly reconstituted vaccine (or from 48 hours later i f not repeated on the same day). Inadvertent administration of the Sanofi VidPrevtyn Beta antigen (only) For example: a full vial of antigen has been administered 0.5ml of antigen has been administered Sanofi's trial data indicates that without the add ition of the adjuvant, the antigen is unlikely to stimulate a sufficiently strong immune response, even when a larger than recommended amount of antigen has been administered. The recipient and/or their carer(s) should be advised about possible local and s ystemic reactions and they should be monitored and treated for any symptoms as required. They should be reassured that this is not generally harmful . A dose of correctly prepared vaccine should be administered following the 'repeat dose' guidance in the 'Inadvertent administration of an incomplete dose ' section above. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 46 Inadvertent administration of Sanofi VidPrevtyn Beta adjuvant (only) The advice is the same whether a full vial or 0.5ml of adjuvant has been administered . The role of the adjuvant is to hold the antigen at the injection site for longer so that the immune system can better recognise the antigen and to produce a stronger response by stimulating certain components of the innate immune system. In the absence of the antigen any reactions should be minimal, however, as with any injected substance, the adjuvant may cause some local inflammation, and particularly if a large volume (the full vial) has been injected. However, the adjuvant alone will not evoke an immune response so the person should be given a dose of any suitable vaccine as soon as the error is realised. If VidPrevtyn Beta is administered it must be correctly prepared (adjuvant + antigen). It would be preferable (if possible) to use a different administ ration site to avoid additional discomfort. Inadvertent vaccine administration errors: scheduling Longer than recommended interval left between primary doses If the vaccine is inadvertently or unavoidably delayed beyond the recommended interval, for example because an individual is unable to attend their vaccination appointment, it is unlikely that their response to this second dose and their longer term protection will be adversely affected. There is no need to restart the course and the second dose should be given as soon as it can be arranged using any age -suitable mRNA vaccine (unless contraindicated) to complete the course. If the second dose is given during a seasonal booster campaign this counts as the booster and an additional booster is not r equired. Vaccination of an individual who has not received a primary course If an individual is given a booster dose but is then discovered not to have a received a primary course the booster dose should be counted as a primary dose. If the dose is given during a seasonal booster campaign this counts as the booster and an additional booster is not required. If this was their first primary dose then a second dose can be given, within the same vaccination campaign, after a minimum 8 week interval. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 47 However, as the programme has moved to a pattern of lime -limited campaigns, individuals in a clinical risk group may not be able to receive their 2nd dose until the next campaign period during which they are eligible (with the exception of severely immunosuppresse d individuals who may, on the basis of individual assessment, be considered for vaccination between campaigns). The primary offer to healthy individuals (not in a clinical risk group) will end when the spring 2023 campaign is completed. Administration o f a booster dose less than 3 months after a previous dose The JCVI recommend that booster vaccination should not be given within 3 months of completion of the primary course or of a previous booster dose. This is to maximise the benefit from extending the period of protection on top of that remaining from the previous doses. Where the booster dose is inadvertently given earlier than 3 months (12 weeks) from the final primary dose, but within the seasonal campaign period up to the end of June 2023, it can s till count as a seasonal 2023 booster. Longer than recommended interval left between previous dose and currently recommended booster dose As long as the interval since completion of the primary course, or since a previous booster dose was received has ex ceeded 3 months, the booster should be offered within the current booster campaign. The purpose of booster doses is to extend protection for those at greatest risk of serious disease and hospitalisation during periods of known or anticipated high infection rates, and the offer may therefore be time -limited - that is, no longer available once the risk has lessened. Individuals who are longer from their previous dose may be at higher risk and should therefore be encouraged to promptly take up the offer of vac cination. COVID -19 vaccination programme: Information for healthcare practitioners 48 Reporting vaccine errors Errors or incidents in vaccine storage, preparation or administration should be reported to the vaccination session team leader or the local Screening and Immunisation team.
