Dr. Barrie R. Cassileth, director of human resources research at the center, said that people were being lured from orthodox medical therapy toward what she described as treatments ''reminiscent of religious purification rituals.'' These involve a variety of often expensive special diets, spiritual counseling and supposedly cleansing enemas administered by nonmedical practitioners, she said. Dr. Cassileth distinguishes this ritualistic approach from the studies under way to determine the scientific causes of cancer, such as the role of a person's diet reported on yesterday by the National Academy of Sciences. Cult-Like Therapies In the cult-like therapies, she said, proponents often attribute magical qualities to particular foods that they assert will not only prevent cancer but also help the body cure it. Writing in the current issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Cassileth said that these unorthodox treatments were far more widespread than the medical profession realized. She asserted that they posed ''a critical challenge to traditional medical science'' because they were often accompanied by spiritual and political factors that were ''antimedicine.'' As a result, she said, some of the 400,000 patients a year who die of cancer are lured from modern medical therapies that could help prolong or save their lives. She said further research was needed to determine accurately how many people were seeking the unorthodox treatment. Remedies Called 'Antimedicine' ''Today's alternative remedies explicitly reject association with standard treatments, environments and paraphernalia,'' Dr. Cassileth wrote. ''These are antimedicines, emphasizing purification through dietary regiments, detoxification and internal cleansing, or mind control.'' In a telephone interview, she said that while ''bits and pieces'' of these approaches might be of some benefit, many ''are not only useless, but they are harmful.'' It is not only desperate people with incurable forms of cancer or patients who have unsuccessfully undergone standard therapies who are turning to these treatments, she said. From interviews with cancer patients she found that many were undergoing both conventional and ritualistic treatments. The treatments are rooted in beliefs in the curative power of nature, various Indian and Oriental philosophies, and even 19th century theories on intestinal putrefaction. Some have been in use in other countries a long time, she said, and are starting to build a following in the United States. 18 to 20 Organizations ''There are a minimum of 18 to 20 major national organizations involved,'' said Dr. Cassileth, ''and they have hundreds of local chapters.'' Like health food stores, these groups fall outside of Federal regulations governing medical practice. She cited the Hippocrates Health Institute, based in Boston, as asserting: ''No disease can exist when the blood is cleaned and when the cells are rebuilt. Constipation is the greatest crime against health, and the cause of cancer in some instances.'' Other groups advocate, for example, eating only avocados, she said, and one says it can diagnose cancer or the risks of getting the disease simply by examining a drop of blood from a finger. Dr. Cassileth said one reason the treatments appealed to many people was that patients were given a role in their therapy, in contrast to modern treatments such as "}
