Kitchari is considered the most healing food in [ayurveda](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/ayurveda-for-beginners-how-to-balance-your-doshas), the world's oldest health system and sister science of yoga. Kitchari is given to all ayurvedic patients because it's so easy to digest, giving their systems a break to restore and heal themselves. Think about it\u2014if a car is always on, eventually it's going to crash. Well, our digestive systems are the same way. If we're constantly stuffing hard-to-digest food in it (even things seemingly easy like a salad), we can actually burn out our digestive fire over time. Kitchari is like a reset for your gut, and best of all\u2014it's delicious. It is considered the most sattvic (pure) meal in the yogic tradition, and you will find it in ayurvedic Panchakarma centers and ashrams around the world. Advertisement A kitchari cleanse is the perfect January cleanse because it is warming for your digestive fire and keeps your body nourished (unlike a juice cleanse). It's affordable, delectable, and very easy to make! In this recipe, which is from my book, [Eat Feel Fresh](https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Feel-Fresh-Contemporary-Plant-Based/dp/1465475621/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=mind0a3-20), I've updated the traditional kitchari recipe by making it 100 percent plant-based and replacing white with brown rice for further fiber. How to kitchari cleanse. To do the kitchari cleanse, enjoy a warm bowl of kitchari for two to three meals a day for three to 21 days. If it's your first time, I recommend just starting with two meals a day (lunch and dinner) for a weekend and having warm tea and fruit or oatmeal for breakfast. The great thing about kitchari is because it's an actual balanced meal with all three macronutrients, you can actually have it as long as you want (my teachers in India have had it every day for their entire lives! It's an Indian staple.) Always listen to your body and pay attention to how you feel. The kitchari cleanse should be enjoyable and you shouldn't feel like you're cleansing. Drink warm spiced tea (I recommend CCF tea\u2014cumin, coriander, and fennel seeds steeped in water\u2014recipe for that below also) before and after each meal to keep the [digestive fire active](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/heal-your-gut-ayurveda-dosha-jasmine-hemsley). Rest as much as possible, detox from social media, and connect with nature for best results. Happy kitchari cleansing!
