See their reviews & get quotes today.", "sitename": "Thumbtack", "date": "2021-03-23", "cleaned_text": "been learning & practicing several forms of spiritual practices since 2010. My work is all about empowering one to see/release the root cause of an issue, see the lesson/gift and guide them forward with a new set of eyes. I utilize shamanic practices and coaching modules to get the most out of the experience. Each client actively participates in their healing/releasing with breath work, hand motions & intuition. As the Shaman I hold them in a safe and loving sacred space. During a session an \"issue\" is presented and is looked at through the physical, emotional, mindset & spiritual aspects or layers. All of this is taken to search for/heal events from past life/generational lines. I bring the healing forward through all that follows into now and to the future. Curses/contracts or programs and beliefs are then tracked and cancelled out. If any entities, past selves, ancestors or shadow parts are around they are now worked with and released. Next is supportive energy which can come through as a whole soul part, gift, spirit animal or all three. The chakras and Aura are then cleared, any activations/upgrades given and any techniques needed are taught. Additional instructions for self care complete the session! Issues can stem from several different places. When not processed and healed the energy signature remains within the energy bodies. This can then create pain, patters, blocks and more. They can even be passed down in the DNA codes (from family members) or soul codes (to future lives). So you could imagine the possibilities of the destinations of the root. It is because of this that each session is very unique to the individual and cannot be mapped out prior to the session taking place. However, some things that may take place or are relieved are: Physical pain Emotional pain Trauma Patterns/cycles Blocks Entity extractions Spirit animal retrieval Soul retrieval Past life/Ancestral healing Cord cutting Divine Inspiration & much much more Price per session: $175 Consultations/Intake Call-30 mins/free Sessions typically run an hour long but at times they do go over. Sessions can be done remotely on zoom if you prefer, I am available to travel to you locally or you may come to me as well. There is a lot that takes place during these sessions! I do not skimp on anything. I do as much as I can in the given time and do go over a bit if need be. In some cases the issue is only on the surface or in this realm and can be easily resolved in one session. While other's are deeply seeded and have many layers to uncover. Be patient and compassionate with your selves during this process. I provide notes from the sessions with details from it and action steps for moving forward. I follow up with clients afterwards as well as provide supports for continued progress. This can include daily steps for them to make as well as guided techniques, workshops, ect.
