The CH NA was developed in accordance with all federal rules and statues, specifically, PL 111 -148 (the Affordable Care Act) which added Section 501(r) to the Internal Revenue Code and, in accordance with New Jersey regulations N.J.A.C. 8.52 10.1 -10.3 governing lo cal boards of health. The CHNA was undertaken in this context and developed for the purpose of enhancing the health and quality of life throughout the community. It builds upon the CHNA conducted in 2015. The 2015 CHNA Implementation Plan results are revie wed in Appendix A. The CHNA uses detailed secondary public health data at state, county, and community levels, a community health survey, focus groups, and a World Caf\u00e9 meeting. RWJUH Hamilton is a member of RWJ Barnabas Health, which convenes a multi -disciplinary, multi -facility Steering Committee that provides additional support and leadership to the process. Also, insight and expertise from the RWJUH Hamilton CH NA Oversight Committee helps identify health assets, gaps, disparities, trends, and priorities. The Methodology section details the data collection process and analysis. Service Area The CH NA focuses primarily on the health needs of RWJUH Hamilton primary service area (PSA) residents. Much of the data are provided at the county level ; but, where available , city or zip code level data are provided to enhance the understanding of specific regions or populations. Mercer County , which comprises a large portion of the PSA, encompasses approximately 229 square miles and is comprised of 11 to wnships and boroughs, and one city. The county and its subdivisions are largely suburban. The county is bordered by Somerset County to the north, Hunterdon on the northwest Monmouth County to the east, Middlesex on the northeast, Burlington County on the s outh, and Bucks County, Pennsylvania to the west. RWJUH Hamilton is located in Hamilton, New Jersey. The Hospital's PSA consists of the following zip codes: Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page ES-2 RWJUH Hamilton Primary Service Area The service area is determined by taking into consideration three factors: patient origin, market share, and geographic continuity/proximity. Zips representing approximately 50% of the RWJUH Hamilton patient origin form the initial PSA. Added to this list is any zip code in which the Hospital has a high market share presence, any zip code with low market share is deleted from the PSA definition and becomes part of the secondary service area (SSA). Geographic proximity to create a contiguous area completes the service area determination. This area contains some zip codes from the contiguous counties of Burlington and Monmouth. For purposes of this CHNA, Mercer County statistics were deemed to be most relevant for review. While a suburban middle income service area, wealth is not uniform across all communities within the RWJUH Hamilton service area , and w ide disparities exist within some communities. The high cost of living and a lack of affordable housing has led to concerns over a dwindling middle class. The following exemplifies a few social and economic differences identified in this review. Mercer County has a slightly lower proportion of whites than residents of New Jersey. Mercer County's Asian population grew by 29% between 2010 and 2018, and Hispanic and Latino populations grew 20% during the same timeframe. Trenton zip code 08611 has the highest concentration of Hispanics at 59.5%. Princeton has the largest Asian population, 29.8%. Mercer County's population grew 1.3% compared to 2% for New Jersey. The County's population distribution by age is similar to that of the State. The County's median household income was over $88,125 in 2018 compared to $87,916 in New Jersey. Hamilton zip code 0869 0 had the highest median household income in the service area at over $123,000. ZIP Code ZIP Name 08608 Trenton Windsor 08629 Hamilton Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page ES-3 Trenton/Hamilton zip code 08610 ($38,687 ) and Robbinsville ($49,833), had amongst the lowest median household income in the service area. Mercer County's unemployment rate for 2016 was 5.6%, above the statewide rate of 5.2%. Trenton/Hamilton zip code 08690 had the lowest unemployment rate, (2.5%) Trenton zip code 08611 had an unemployment rate of 8.8% , higher than that of New Jersey. Poverty rates in Mercer County for families, people, and children, were higher than the State. Children in Trenton zip codes 08611 and 08608 had among the highest rat e of poverty, 25% and 26% respectively. The percent of Mercer County residents with a graduate or professional degree was 19.5% compared to 14.4% of New Jersey residents. 50.4% of Princeton residents had a graduate or professional degree compared to only 2.0% of Trenton zip code 08608 residents. 30% of Trenton zip code 08611 residents failed to complete high school. Less than 12% of Mercer County residents have limited English proficiency in the County. Residents of Trenton zip code 08611 had a rate of limited English proficiency that was over 34%. 41% of Mercer County children were eligible for free school lunches. In addition to social and demographic differences, disparities in Mercer County and RWJUH Hamilton PSA residents' incidence and prevalence of illness identified in this CH NA include: The age -adjusted mortality rate for heart disease among Whites was higher than the rate for Blacks. The rate of low birth rate babies is, and has been, higher among Blacks than for both White or Hispa nic residents since 2011. The Mercer County Black infant mortality rate was more than double that of Hispanics in 2016. The inpatient use rate in Mercer County (171.7 per 100,000) is higher than that of the State, and Trenton/Ewing zip code 08618, Mercervi lle zip code 08619, Trenton/Hamilton zip code 08609 , Hamilton zip code 08610, and Trenton zip code 08611 all have hospital use rates well above the statewide rate. ED use rates for Mercer County are also above those of the State and residents of Trenton zip code 08609 have an ED use rate nearly 5 times that of the County. Trenton zip codes 08608 and 08609 CNI scores that are among the highest in the County while Trenton/Hamilton zip code 08690 has among the lowest CNI score in the County. The rate of persons hospitalized with a heart attack was highest in Trenton zip code 08638 in 2016. Among patients who used a hospital, the rate for stroke was highest among residents of Trenton zip code 08638 , and Mercerville . The highest rate of diabetes , renal disease, asthma, and hypertension were seen in patients hospitalized from Trenton zip code 08638. TOP HEALTH ISSUE The RWJUH Hamilton Internal Oversight Steering Committee in conjunction with the Greater Mercer County Public Health Partnership co nsidered primary and secondary data to determine the top health issues. Prioritization was based on capacity, resources, competencies, and needs specific to the populations served . The selected issue is within the Partnership's and Hospital's purview, comp etency and Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page ES-4 resources to impact in a meaningful manner and is believed to be a root cause of many of the chronic health issues facing residents of the county. For these reasons, \"to help Mercer County residents achieve a healthy weight and lifestyle throughout their lives \" was selected as the main priority issue for the 2018 - 2021 CHNA. Assist RWJUH Hamilton Residents Achieve a Healthy Weight and Lifestyle Throughout Their Lives Maintaining a healthy weight is important for health. In addition to lowering the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and high blood pressure , it can also lower the risk of several different cancers. An individual's weight, waist size and the amount of weight gained since one's mid -20's can have serious heal th implications. These factors can strongly influence an individual's chances of developing the following diseases and conditions: Cardiovascular be in a healthy range, your weight isn't more than ten pounds over what you weighed since your mid - 20's. Because most adults between the ages of 18 -49 gain one to two pounds each year, stopping and preventing weight gain should be a priority. Gaining weight as you age increases the likelihood of developing one or more chronic diseases. The key to achieving and maintain ing a healthy weight isn't about short -term dieting changes. It's about a lifestyle that includes healthy eating, regular physical activity and balancing the number of calories you consume with the number of calories your body uses. Genetics affect the amoun t of body fat stored, where fat is distributed, and how efficiently the body converts food into energy. Family eating and physical activity habits play a role in the development of obesity. Prolonged inactivity results in calorie imbalance, the intake of c alories is higher than the burning of calories. Often, inactivity is a result of other medical problems like arthritis or injuries. An unhealthy diet, high in calories and lacking in fruits and vegetables, is a significant contributor to weight gain. Resea rch has linked social and economic factors to obesity. Socioeconomic factors include: not having safe areas to exercise, cultural traditions of unhealthy eating and obese family members. Approximately 39.8% of the U.S. population, or 93.3 million adults, are affected by obesity according to the 2015 -2016 National Center for Health Statistics data brief. But some groups are disproportionately impacted. For example, Hispanics (47%) and non-Hispanic Blacks (46.85) had the highest age -adjusted prevalence of o besity followed by non -Hispanic Whites (37.9%) and non -Hispanic Asians (12.7%). The association between obesity and income or education level is complex and differs by age, sex and ethnicity. Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page ES-5 Overall, men and women with college degrees had lower obesity prevalence compared to those with less education. 2 By race/ethnicity, the same obesity and education pattern was seen among non -Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic women, and also among non-Hispanic White men, although the differences were not all statistically significant. Although the difference was not statistically significant among non -Hispanic Black men, obesity prevalence increased with educational attainment. Among non -Hispanic Asian women and men, and Hispanic men t here were no differences in obesity prevalence by education level. Among men, obesity prevalence was lower in the lowest and highest income groups compared with the middle -income group. This pattern was seen among non -Hispanic White and Hispanic men. Obesi ty prevalence was higher in the highest income group than in the lowest income group among non -Hispanic Black men. Among women, obesity prevalence was lower in the highest income group than in the middle and lowest -income groups. This pattern was observed among non -Hispanic White, non -Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic women. Among non -Hispanic Black women, there was no difference in obesity prevalence by income. Obesity can occur at any age, even among young children. Hormonal changes and physical inac tivity in older individuals also increase risk. The amount of body muscle decreases with age, leading to a decrease in metabolism. Quitting smoking is also associated with weight gain, sometimes resulting in obesity. Structured smoking cessation programs c an help mitigate the effects of weight gain associated with quitting. Not getting enough sleep or conversely getting too much sleep can cause changes in the hormones that increase appetite and contribute to weight gain. Poor nutrition and a lack of a healt hy diet pattern, and regular physical activity, are health behaviors that contribute to obesity. A healthy diet pattern is one that emphasizes eating whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, low fat and fat-free dairy products, and drinking water. Healthy activity patterns include 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity or a combination of both, along with two days of weight training per week. Nearly 34% of Mercer residents reported a BMI >=30 in 2016. 15.2/1,000 Mercer County residents who used a hospital service in Mercer County had a diagnosis of obesity compared to 14.1/1,000 New Jersey residents. Obesity rates were found to be amongst the highest in Hamilton zip code 08610 (19.34/1,000 ) and Mercerville (18.58/1,000). Between 2014 and 2016 the percent of Mercer County residents reporting no leisure time activity trended upwards from 19.5% in 2014 to 29.1% in 2016. More than 40% of all survey respondents claimed to have hypertension, high chole sterol or a weight problem. Obesity was the number 1 concern among survey respondents from Mercer County and the RWJUH Hamilton Service Area. 44% of RWJUH Hamilton service area residents indicating an obesity problem said they were under a physician's care for the issue, while 32% were monitoring it on their own. 2 https ://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page ES-6 Healthy weight programs are available in Mercer County in both inpatient and outpatient clinic settings and include Bariatrics wellness programs, and the RWJUH Bariatric surgery program offering both surgical and non -surgical weight. A bariatric surgery and medically supervised weight loss program is also available at Capital Health at the Capital Health Metabolic and Weight Loss Center. St. Francis Medical Center in Trenton also offers Bariatric surgery with a multi -disciplinary approach to the care of patients. Interfaith Caregivers of Mercer County offer s a free 24 -week session for seniors at risk of osteoporosis to teach the benefits of exercise, nutrition and safety, drug the rapy and lifestyle factors. The program was developed by New Jersey Department of Health and the North Jersey Regional Arthritis Center. The Mercer County nutrition project for older adults offers meals in s ettings that bring seniors together for activitie s and social interaction. Lunch is provided Monday -Friday at 12 sites throughout the county. The program also arranges services including nutrition education/nutrition counseling and other health, educational and recreational programs. The nutrition projec t for older adults also participates in the senior Farmer's Market program, which was developed to provide low income seniors with checks they can use to purchase fresh produce grown by New Jersey farmers. In 2015, the Hamilton YMCA launched a series of h ealthy living programs in an effort to combat a variety of chronic diseases. Three programs, ACT Youth Weight Management and Healthy Ways Adult Weight Management and YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program , are closely related to this year's goal of assisting Mer cer County residents achieve and maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle throughout their lives . Mercer Street Friends Food Bank leads the community response to hunger in Mercer County, channeling 2.7 million pounds of food and groceries to a network of 80 local food partners, shelters, soup kitchens, meal sites, schools, senior and disabled programs and low -income housing sites. In addition to the prioritized needs discussed above, this CHNA identifies the following as additional health needs for the communities: Mental health and substance abuse; Chronic disease; Access to diabetes; Hypertension; Food security; Safe recreational spaces; and Health concerns related to aging. Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 1 1. INTRODUCTION In 2018, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton (RWJUH Hamilton) in conjunction with the Greater Mercer County Public Health Partnership (GHPHP) undertook develop ment of its third Community Health Needs Assessment (CH NA). The CH NA was designed to ensure that the Hospital and other Mercer County public, private, and community -based organizations continue to effectively and efficiently serve the needs of their commun ities. The CH NA was developed in accordance with all federal rules and statutes, specifically PL 111 -148 (The Affordable Care Act) which added Section 501(c) to the internal revenue code and, in accordance with New Jersey regulations N.J.A.C. 8:52 10.1 -10.3 governing local boards of health. The latter regulations govern: the collection, computation, interpretation, and communication of vital statistics and health status measures within one or more New Jersey counties; the identification of threats to health ; the assessment of health service needs; and the analysis, communication, and publication of access, utilization, quality, and outcome of personal health issues. This needs assessment was undertaken in this context and developed for the purpose of enhanci ng the quality of life throughout Mercer County and the communities served by RWJUH Mercer. This assessment builds upon the CH NAs conducted in 2012 and 2015. In accordance with rules established in 2015, the 2015 Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), a lso referred to as the Implementation Plan, results are reviewed in Appendix A of this document. The CH NA uses detailed secondary public health and demographic data at state, county and municipality or zip code levels, as well as primary data collected th rough a community health survey, focus groups , and a World Caf\u00e9 meeting . In addition to the input provided by the Greater Mercer Public Health Partnership County Coalition, a consortium of public, private and community - based organizations, RWJUH Mercer is a member of RWJBH, which convenes a multidisciplinary, multi - facility Steering Committee that provides additional support and leadership. Also, insight and expertise from the RWJUH Mercer CH NA Oversight Committee helps identify health assets, gaps, dispa rities, trends, and priorities. The Methodology Section of this CH NA details the data collection process and analysis. The CH NA data sources includ ed Healthy People 2020 and the County Health Rankings, Census Bureau, and CDC, to name a few. Healthy Peopl e 2020 and County Health Rankings, which are described below, also provide benchmarks for county -specific indicators . Healthy People 2020 is a 10 -year agenda to improve the nation's health that encompasses the entire continuum of prevention and care. For over three decades Healthy People has established benchmarks and monitored progress over time to measure the impact of prevention activitie s. Healthy People 2020 benchmarks are used throughout the report to assess the health status of residents. County Health Rankings , published by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, rank the health of nearly all counties in the United States. The rankings look at a variety of measures that affect health such as high school graduation rates, air pollution levels, income, rates of obesity and smoking, etc. These rankings are also used throughout the report to measure the overall health of Mercer County residents. County rates are also compared to statewide rates. The RWJUH Hamilton needs assessment was undertaken and developed for the purpose of enhancing the health and quality of life throughou t the community. To this end, a broad array of information both internal and external was used to understand recent health indicators and the opportunities to provide a positive impact on health and wellness. In addition to the priority area mentioned belo w, other significant Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 2 needs determined through this process include: Mental Health and Substance Abuse; Chronic Disease; Access to care/transportation; Coordination disease/stroke; Underserved Chronic diseases; Hypertension; Food Security; Safe Recreational Spaces; and Health Concerns related to Aging. Top Health Issue The Greater Mercer Public Health Partnership County Coalition, in its review of both primary and secondary source data, determined to work on one global priority if felt had impacts on several health issues of concern to its membership's overall goals. The priority area was selected using criteria that considered population health impact and whether the selected priority area would be within its purview, competency and resources to implement in a meaningful manner. The top priority area chosen was to assist Mercer County residents achieve and maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle throughout their lives . Reaching and maintai n a healthy weight is important to overall health and can help individuals prevent and control many diseases and conditions. Individuals who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of developing serious health problems including heart disease, high bloo d pressure, type 2 diabetes, arthritis and some cancers. Poor nutrition, unhealthy eating habits, and lack of physical activity are behaviors that contribute to overweight and obesity. Assist RWJUH Hamilton Residents Achieve a Healthy Weight and Lifestyle Throughout Their Lives Maintaining a healthy weight is important for health. In addition to lowering the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and high blood pressure it can also lower the risk of several different cancers. An individual's weight, wais t size and the amount of weight gained since one's mid -20's can have serious health implications. These factors can strongly influence an individual's chances of developing the following diseases and conditions: Cardiovascular heart attack, strok e; Diabetes; Cancer; Arthritis; Gallstones; Asthma; Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 3 Cataracts; Infertility; Snoring; Sleep apnea. To be in a healthy range, your weight isn't more than ten pounds over what you weighed when you were in your mid -20's.

METHODOLOGY GMPHP , in conjunction with RWJUH Hamilton, developed an evidenced -based process to determine the health needs of Mercer County residents. CH NA data sources include both primary and secondary data to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the communities. Data from these sources were reviewed the GMPHP Steering Committee to identify and prioritize the top issues facing residents in the service area (see Top Health Issues section). The flow chart below identifies the CH NA and CHIP process employed. Prioritization Process Following GMPHP's review of quantitative and qualitative data on August 6th, a list of 12 issues were identified by consultants as common themes of the research. Through discussion, this list was expanded to 15. These issues became the suggested priority i ssues and included: Mental Health and Substance Abuse Chronic Disease Overweight and Obesity, Nutrition Health Concerns Related to Aging Chronic Respiratory Diseases and Asthma Coordination and Communication Access to Care/Transportation Cardiovascular Disease/Stroke Underserved Populations/Health Equity Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 7 Diabetes Hypertension Maternal Child Health Cancer Food Security Safe Recreational Spaces A ballot was developed, and a survey sent on August 14, 2018 to the GMPHP mem bership asking them to rank each issue based on the following criteria. Number of people impacted Risk of mortality and morbidity associated with the problem Impact of the problem on vulnerable populations Meaningful progress can be made within a three -year timeframe Community's capability and competency to impact A tally of the 48 ballots cast resulted in the following five issues to be ranked highest overall. Underserved Populations Mental Health and Substance Abuse Food Security Chronic Diseases Access to Transportation Rankings were also developed and weighted for each prioritization criterion. On September 5th, members of the GMPHP Board met to discuss and determine the priority/priorities it would undertake for the next three years. The Board reviewed the top five priority areas and weighted ranking, reviewed root cause analysis and evidence -based programs that met the group's priority goals and agreed that for the next three years the Partnership would work to help Mercer County res idents achieve a healthy weight and lifestyle throughout their lives . Secondary Data Sources Over 100 secondary data sources are compiled in this CH NA, presenting data by indicator by county and state. Sources include: The United States Census Bureau, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH), and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). See Appendix B for a detailed list of sources. Appendix C contains a detailed report of cancer incidence and mortality by cancer site for Mercer County for the years 2010 -2017. In addition, hospital tumor registry data is utilized to understand stage of can cer at time of diagnosis. Health Profile Section 5 provides a comprehensive presentation of health outcomes as well as the social determinants of health and other health factors that contribute to the health and well -being of Mercer County residents. Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 8 Color Indicator Tables Throughout the Health Profile Section of this CH NA, the color indicator tables compare county level data to Healthy People 2020 targets, County Health Rankings benchmarks, and New Jersey State data. Data by race/ethnicity are compared to data for all races in the county, unless otherwise indicated. Mercer County was the midpoint value compared to a range 20% higher than the value for New Jersey, Healthy People 2020 , or County Health Rankings Benchmarks, or 20% lower than the value for New Jersey, Healthy People 2020 , or County Health Rankings Benchmarks. If the county value was within the range 20% lower or 20% higher than the comparison indicato r, or considered within reasonable range, the indicator will be yellow. The table will be red if the Mercer County value is more than 20% worse or lower than the indicator value. If the Mercer County value is 20% better or higher than the indicator value, the table will be green. Comparative counties are also presented providing additional context for select health indicators. Primary Data Sources Community Health Needs Surveys In order to obtain a service area -specific analysis for the RWJUH Hamilton service area, separate o n-line survey Interviews were conducted among 1,368 residents of the Hospital's PSA . Interviews were conducted online and by telephone. A link to the online survey was displayed on hospital web pages and social media site s. Additionally, postcards were handed out at area businesses and libraries, directing residents to the online survey link. A telephone augment was conducted to capture additional interviews in specific areas and among specific ethnic groups. For the te lephone portion, a representative sample of households was generated from a database of residential telephone numbers. Bruno and Ridgway Research Associates, Inc. administered the on -line and telephone surveys from April 2 to June 18, 2018. Survey result s are incorporated into this CH NA. (See Section 3) Focus Group Discussions Five focus groups were undertaken to uncover additional information from key community groups and individuals with respect to health needs, challenges and barriers, and suggestio ns for improving access to health care services. Focus groups were located in each of the five major geographic areas. Mercer County Focus Group Report is found in Section 4. (See Section 4) Focus group meetings were conducted in March 2018 by Curtis An alytical Partners. World Caf\u00e9 Meeting The World Caf\u00e9 meeting was held on April 25 , 2018, and brought together community representatives to discuss four issues including: 1. What Does a Healthy Community Look Life? 2. What Do You View as a Barrier to Good Health in Mercer County? 3. Whose Voice Do We Still Need to Hear ? 4. Which parts are most relevant to our community health assessment? The World Caf\u00e9 Exercise Report is found Section 4. (See Section 4) Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 9 Assets and Gaps Section 6, Assets and Gaps, summarizes the preceding components of the CH NA. Assets highlight county information indicating improvement over time, in comparison to other counties and the State, or in comparison to other races or genders. Gaps focus on disparities in Mercer County o r the RWJUH Hamilton service area that have a negative trend, in comparison to other counties in the State or to other races or genders. Resource Inventory A service area -specific resource inventory is included as Appendix D , which details health and social service resources available to residents in Mercer County. Providers' names, addresses, and phone numbers and type of services provided are contained in the inventory. B. SERVICE AREA The CH NA focuses primarily on the h ealth needs of residents of RWJUH Hamilton's Service Area . Much of the data are provided at the county level, but where available city or zip code level data are provided to enhance understanding of specific regions or populations. The Service Area consi sts of the following zip codes: Mercer County The service area is determined by taking into consideration three factors: patient origin, market share, and geographic continuity/proximity. Zips representing approximately 50% of the RWJUH Hamilton patie nt origin form the initial PSA. Added to this list is any zip code in which the Hospital has a high market share presence, any zip code with low market share is deleted from the PSA definition and becomes part of the secondary service area (SSA). Geographic proximity to create a contiguous area completes the service area determination. This area contains some zip codes from the contiguous counties of Burlington and Monmouth. For purposes of this CHNA, Mercer County statistics were deemed to be most relevant for review.

RWJUH HAMILTON COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS SURVEY Research Objective The primary objective of this research was to obtain opinions of residents within the RWJUH Hamilton service area in order to meet government CH NA requi rements. Areas of focus included: Health issues and concerns that impact the community. Barriers to accessing health care. Strengths and weaknesses of community services offered. Personal health attitudes, conditions and behaviors. Methodology Interviews were conducted among residents of RWJUH Hamilton's service area (PSA) . Interviews were conducted on -line and by telephone. A link to the on -line survey was displayed on hospital web pages and social media sites. Additionally, pos tcards were handed out at area businesses and libraries, directing residents to the on -line survey link. A telephone augment was conducted to capture additional interviews in specific areas and among specific ethnic groups. For the telephone portion, a r epresentative sample of households was generated from a database of residential telephone numbers. The interview averaged 15-20 minutes in length and was conducted April 2 - June 18, 2018. Sample Composition Highlights A total of 1, 368 interviews were c onducted in the RWJUH Hamilton PSA among adults aged 21+. These interviews broke down among gender, age and ethnicity as follows: 992 (73%) Females, 296 (22%) Males; 542 (40%) 21 -49 years of age, 390 (29%) 50 -64 years of age, 353 (26%) 65+ years of age; 754 (55%) Caucasian, 2 (12%) Hispanic, 82 (6%) Asian.4 A. RWJUH HAMILTON RESIDENT SURVEY SUMMARY This Community Health Assessment survey generated learnings and insights that can be used to effectively serve the health care needs of the community. Obesity is the #1 health concern of area residents. High levels of concern were also cited for chronic illnesses such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease. Obesity is a leading contributor to chronic illnes ses and a major cause of death in the U.S. More than one -half of respondents claim to have high blood pressure, high cholesterol and/or a weight problem. Increasing outreach and developing educational programs that address nutrition and wellness, with focus on preventative lifestyle behaviors, could improve the health and overall well -being of area residents. Healthy eating and exercise programs in schools could aid in lowering childhood obesity and the risks associated with chronic conditions. 4 Not shown are \"other\" mentions and \"no answer\". Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 11 Additio nally, high levels of concern were cited regarding mental health, substance use/abuse, health concerns related to aging and high stress lifestyles. The rising opioid epidemic and increased concern about mental health issues present opportunit ies to increa se education to both community residents and to health care professionals in an effort to help reduce the growing trend of opioid/Rx drug abuse and the stigma associated with mental health. Regardless of age, income level or ethnicity, the key barriers t o seeking medical care are insurance issues and related cost concerns. Addressing the economic challenges associated with access to care, including insurance issues, will serve to improve access and affordability of care to a greater proportion of the comm unity. RWJUH Hamilton PSA is regarded highly by most residents, with many positive services offered to the community. However, specific needs for improvement are cited in the areas of transportation services, healthy food choices in schools, safe/afford able housing and interpersonal violence. Since access to services can be challenging for some, expanding transportation services, particularly for seniors and persons with disabilities, can improve access to care for these population groups. RWJUH Hamilton PSA residents describe their overall health as being good/very good and exhibit many positive health -related behaviors (healthy eating, physical activity, annual physicals and recommended screening tests). They report their children eat breakfast daily and are physically active. However, a substantial portion of residents (Hispanics, lower income, older residents) do not eat healthy, lead a sedentary lifestyle, do not get recommended screening tests and/or suffer chronic medical conditions. Diagnostic screenings are crucial in the early detection, treatment and management of chronic diseases. The availability of these preventative services should be expanded to ensure they are reaching and serving minority and lower income populations in a cost - efficient manner. In summary, survey data suggest that wellness initiatives, programs and services addressing the availability, accessibility and affordability of care would meet a significant portion of the communities' needs.

FOCUS GROUP S Five focus groups were held with 55 participants across five Mercer County geographic areas: Hamilton/Robbinsville Pennington/Hopewell Borough and Township East and West Windsor/Hightstown City of Trenton Lawrenceville/Ewing/Princeton Participants were community leaders representative of the following organizations ; government, health and wellness, chronic disease, behavioral health, non -profits, education, faith -based, business/employers, public safety, v eterans, and transportation. Areas discussed included service needs and challenges, resource availability, family and patient support; stigma; challenges and barriers; underserved consumers; and integrated care. Overall Findings Each community noted imp rovement over the past few years. Better service and/or overall increase in services in the areas identified below were most commonly mentioned. Each community had a few notable differences , with Trenton identifying the greatest number of concerns : Hamilton/Robbinsville : Hunger/Food insecurity Pennington/Hopewell : Loss of Planned Parenthood East/West Windsor/Hightstown : Immigrant population, hospital emergency room wait times (no specific hospital identified) Lawrenceville/Ewing/Princeton : Access to health y food in Ewing Area Definite Improvements 'Some' Improvement Hamilton/Robbinsville Clinics for uninsured families Support for those disabled Veterans programsChildhood obesity Senior services availabilityOpioid addiction Pennington/Hopewell Hospital access Anti -smoking campaignParental support in various areas -medical and emotionalInformation flow Broader drug/alcohol reach Mental health support Windsor/Hightstown Senior transportation Wkly BP screening Improved coordination with police Closer hospital and EMT closer to policeNew leadership Lock boxes for elderly Politicians more in touch with communityVision/hearing screener availability City of Trenton Employment improved Young adults doing more in community More small businesses openingFood pantry availability Heightened community activism/collaborationn/a Lawrenceville/Ewing/ PrincetonImproved partnership with law enforcement General outreach improved Health services for undocumented populationHospitals engaging more Availability of more physical space Heightened health focusn/a Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 54 City of Trenton : hunger/ food insecurity; sexually transmitted disease; lead poisoning . While discuss ing community improvement , there was a singular commonly voiced theme regarding coordination/communication. All gr oups mentioned the need for better coordination/communication across the various volunteer/governmental service organizations. \"There's no coordination of services and I don't know exactly where to point/send people. As a result, services go underutilized .\" \"Communities and senior centers need to work together - there's no oversight.\" \"Currently we are in silo's that don't communicate.\" \"We need a central communication port, connecting all of the services together.\" \"We have so much need in this area, and often volunteers don't know what is available or how to connect people to what they know is available.\" Although occasional improvements were noted, respondents characterized access to care as \"not good \" or \"in need of improvement \"; this was true across a ll groups. Access was often intertwined with lack of a broader communication network. There were eight common concerns/needs that were consistently mentioned across the five groups. Community/network connecte dness/communication Access to care Mental hea lth: opioid addiction, stress/anxiety management, suicide prevention Transportation barriers Language barriers/immigrant populations Senior adult needs - veterans' services in some areas Education : health, parenting, social media, tutoring programs, bullyi ng Medical conditions : Alzheimer's/dementia, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, childhood obesity, chronic pain. When asked to prioritize their common areas, similarities and differences among communities were noted . Common to all geographies were five main needs : Coordination and communication of information/services between agencies Access to care as broadly defined Greater focus on mental health issues and health education in general Senior Services Transportation Priority area s that differed by community included: Hopewell/Robbinsville: Preventative medical conditions, parenting classes Pennington/Hopewell: Elderly, safe drinking water Windsor/Hightstown: Domestic violence, veterans' services Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 55 Trenton: Institutional racism, employment, gang violence, chronic poverty, nighttime safety, nutrition, emergency services, employment/lack of opportunity Lawrence/Ewing/Princeton: Access to nutritional food, access for low income/no insurance, affordable housing, sexually transmitted disease, parent education, chronic disease focus (cancer, Alzheimer's) The following describes specific discussions at each of the five locations. Hamilton/Robbinsville Areas of Improvement Regardless of some perceived improvement , most indicated there was still more to be done in each of the areas identified. Opioid awareness More programs are initiated at the hospital at the time of intervention. More clinics available for uninsured families to receive healthcare Narcan availability and opioid training now in high school at Hamilton Clinics for wellness visits, unvaccinated children who are uninsured, STD's in adults (Hamilton). Many families with special needs (mental emotional) - Ability Tree now in Robbinsville. Helps families with a variety of issues for those with disabilities (e .g., transfer from school to adult life etc.) Various veteran programs via Office of Veteran Affairs (e .g., resource room for vets, vet mentors, etc.) In other areas some improvements were no ted. Also identified was an increased demand, which made it hard to keep up with needs. Childhood obesity has diminished. More aging senior services are available than previously. Increased demand for mental health services for aging seniors. While many services were available it was very hard to know who provided, what was provided and where services were located. Strong need for communication among all services and lack of appropriate networking between providers. Access Needs Insurance Linkage to appropriate care Access to physicians Hospital access Affordable medical services Access to medication Affordable housing Transportation needs Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 56 Over population causes lack of resources (e .g., vaccines, well care) Overall access to care was seen as the single, key factor in maintaining community health. Greatest Health Concerns 1. Mental health Opioid addiction (resources in the community) Viewed as a family disease that needs to involve educators, spiritual leaders and prosecutors Lack of insur ance Lack of rehab space for time sensitive conditions Loved ones who are not supportive No recovery housing Increased crime Marijuana use (Robbinsville) Difficult to sustain sobriety in the addiction community Stressful culture How to manage the environment: life culture pressure: over -scheduled kids, adults, home life, finances, college, etc. Generalized anxiety Suicide prevention Breakdown of the family unit Leads to anxiety and substance abuse Counseling availability for emotional issues Social media/bully concerns 2. Seniors Education Transportation for elderly and disabled growing - have waiting lists; vets also have transportation needs. \"much space taken up for dialysis patients, doesn't leave much room for senior transport\". \"Many are frigh tened to drive - others can't drive\" \"Need for senior friendly Uber\" Medication compliance and education Connections between support system and compliance. Affordability of care Concerns re: those still driving 3. Education (Health and Wellness) How to live with health concerns/conditions Educating people about eating and living healthily Special needs populations (autistic training) Diabetic care education Limited access for some populations Nutrition education and understanding Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 57 4. Food Insecurity Children and adults \"1 in 5 kids are food deprived .\" Lack of healthy food requires education to eat healthy \"It's easier to go with fast food or corner bodegas .\" 5. General Increase in Violence Dating violence Gun violence (in parts of Hamilton) Domestic violence Impact on students Support of those abused 6. Language Barriers Limited English proficiency/education (residents from Haiti, Ghana, Mexico) Decrease in ESL enrollment down 33% \"no one wants to come forward given the political environment today, ESL enrollment is a way down due to the federal crackdown via ICE.\" 7. Veterans Need more attention: WWII and Vietnam veterans all different (PTSD) Not enough services locally 8. Parenting Classes Focusing on: coping skills, entitlement, helicopter ing, addressing the desire for instant gratification/quick fix. 9. Therapy Dogs for PTSD, seizures and dementia 10. Pedestrian and bike safety 11. Medication compliance 12. Physician specialists lacking Endocrinologists, dermatologists, and rheumatologists Medical Concerns and Problems Alcoholism - increase in the number of persons found passed out Alzheimer's Money and care worries Stress for caregivers Cancer Childhood obesity Chronic pain management Dementia Aging problems 70% of residents in facility have some form of dementia . Lack of nurses to spend time with patients in once/month Diabetes: diabetic care follow -up Hep C increases STD's in young teens Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 58 Areas Prioritized for Attention Overall the county itself is overgrown and the current i nfrastructure falls short in meeting all needs. Coordination of information and services across communities Diabetic care Access to care specifically focused on: Hospitals and doctors - particularly specialists (e .g. Endocrinologists) Coordinated information Knowledge of available resources Insurance coverage Mental health - specifically opioid addiction and stress management Opioid addiction \"We need to do more/deal with it now; focus on prevention and diminishing over - prescribing of d rugs; need to have something like linkage to care.\" \"it's an epidemic - We are trying to educate schools, spiritual leaders, etc. We are frustrated because there are no beds immediately available for the uninsured...not enough beds available - We are constan tly begging nonprofit groups for help...it becomes a family disease .\" More community focus on certain prevalent medical conditions that are underserved: diabetes, cancer, childhood obesity and alcoholism (prevention, management, and treatment) Parenting cla sses that focus on the concerns identified. Pennington, Hopewell Borough, Hopewell Township Areas of Improvement Hospital access Support for parents of children (medical and emotional) Anti-smoking efforts Areas in Need of Further Improvement Flow of information Broader reach with drugs and alcohol Mental health Access Needs Grant applications \"We can only have better access to care if we receive more money than we get from grant applications and right now the money is running out. \" Insurance needs Transportation Lack of cabs Transport for those living alone that goes beyond Meals on Wheels Access, so the elderly are able to function independently Better, faster identification and support of people in need Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 59 Greatest Health Concerns 1. Mental health Stress/Pressure Especially those going to college Parental education about stress Reduction of stigma associated with mental health Lack of resources for mental health issues Suicide/Cutting 2. Connectedness of Community Communic ation needs to improve Review/ address community financial resources Cultural competence Providers/Organizations need to more effectively deliver health care services that meet the social, cultural and linguistic needs of patients. 3. Drug use was viewed as increased. Some believed use was increasing because the stigma associated with drug use was down. Opioid addiction Narcan in schools and uncertain if that is good or bad Heroin, vaping more common Lack of insurance to cover treatment Schools tak ing a therapeutic approach Random drug testing in some places 4. Loss of Plan ned Parenthood viewed as critical. Additional Concerns 5. Seniors Need better information on community resources Focus on senior falls Transportation (seniors and disabled) Housing 6. Poverty in certain areas needs to be addressed. 7. Housing Need for more affordable housing Project Freedom, of some help, but more is needed. 8. Immigration Integration Other vulnerable populations 9. Education Need for tutoring progr ams Violence and Bullying Gender and Fluidity training Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 60 Medical Conditions and Problems Hypertension Sexually transmitted diseases Under -age drinking Concussions Nutrition Alcoholism Sleep Disturbances Four Areas Prioritized for Immediate Attention 1. Communication needs to improve from the municipality/community perspective Need to encompass and focus on: Better community health School districts Social media 2. Elderly Population Identification of resources and adequate care for elderly 3. Education and Tutoring Tutoring programs Violence/Bullying Sexual consent Gender and sexual fluidity 4. Ensuring Safe Drinking Water Older system - need to evaluate water access as well as water lead levels East Windsor, West Windsor, Hightstown Areas of Improvement Availability of RISE (a community service partnership) Senior transportation has improved Availability of weekly blood pressure screenings Penn Medical providing closer hospital services 24 hr. EMT now near the police stat ion Politicians more in tune with community needs Blue Angel lock box for elderly Congregation works with police chief re: drugs/Rx drugs New leadership and health screening Greater trust in/use of social media Vision and hearing screening availability - in progress Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 61 Access Needs Participants viewed access as hindered because of a lack of a broader communication network that would aid connections and collaborations. General concept of volunteers, chairperson and Network not always apparent. Government involvement was thought necessary. \"There is a sense of provincialism - we're all trying to solve the same problems.\" Access to care was considered problematic in terms of both services and specific populations. Reaching appropriate doctors Training Lack of cancer screening Medicaid cutbacks Adult/Senior care Uninsured populations Undocumented populations Language barriers (need more bi -lingual support) Health programs Areas of Need Mental health Substance abuse Domestic violence Any crisis Stress (school -aged children) Psychological barriers Differences between East and West Windsor Adult population needs Uninsured adults Homelessness Access to doctors Domestic violence Schools - schools should be safe haven Suicide concern - middle o r high school Loneliness of students Stress over academics Backpack Food Program - not utilized in middle school - children thought to be embarrassed Bullying Immigrant concerns - ICE Undocumented - trickle down problems Language barriers Need for clothing and food Availability of non -English tutors Summer programs for children Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 62 In assuming needs in these communities, a few commented that there were no measurable results for any of the initiatives put into place. Other Needs Drug abuse Prescriptio n drug use HIV/AIDS o Hyacinth Foundation helpful Marijuana (edible and liquid) Emergency Room of hospital Basically, a holding pen RISE - Tremendous service group Always looking for more volunteers Sexual orientation LGBTQ numbers are less - but still a problem Better public transportation 24/7 mobile response neede d Lack of Veterans' services Medical Conditions of Concern Alcoholism Asthma Cardiovascular problems Dental health HIV Obesity Pregnancy Sexually transmitted diseases The need for community networks and adequate communication between those networks was consistent in both Windsor/Hightstown. Areas Prioritized for Attention Mental health Stress relief for students, parents and teachers Teachers specifically noted feeling the stress of school shootings Medical transport Cardiac issues and falls Domestic violence Related to alcoholism Recurring stress Translators needed No translators available; currently young children are translators for parents Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 63 Transportation issues Veterans' Services No VA hospital/clinics City of Trenton Focus group members felt there had been a \"climate change\" for the better over the past two years (hope for change with new leadership but not enough accomplished). Also noted was a desire to do more , especially among young adults who want to affect change and contribute back to the community. Positive changes were noted, \"more small business and restaurants showing up (i.e., Starbucks), leading to more hiring of locals and workers around the com munity\" and more outreach from existing institutions. It was noted that \"even with all the budget cuts at the libraries, they are doing many free programs for people. Social workers come in to help the homeless, mentor programs, partner ing with other gro ups.\" All were seen as positive moves. Additional positive changes noted were: More community awareness - better collaboration among groups More people coming together Food Pantry Demand greater but amount and quality of food better Improved leadership communication with suppliers Trentonians are better served because of heightened community awareness, activism and better collaboration Employment is a bit better Access was considered a HUGE issue in Trenton, particularly as related to medical care. Medical Care Erosion - maternal/child care is missing issue, maternity departments closed left and right, and the nearest is very far \"Through grants they are improving access to care, free pregnancy testing, WIC. Grants allow grassroots knocking on doors to see who needs care, bus tickets allow access to care.\" No pre -natal care No OB GYNs in Trenton, only 1 free clinic Most OBs do not accept Medicaid Doctor time limitation because of insurance Infant mortality rate of Blacks vs Whites is 3X more Babies are being born addicted to drugs Diminishing nursing care/doctors Lack of Patient Advocates Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 64 Transportation issues - no bus service to Capital Health Clinic sees 1,400 patients each month. 120 new pregnancies a month - it still takes 3 -5 weeks to get an appointment. Pre -natal Clinic has a shuttle to Capital Health. Additional concerns that fall under the umbrella of access included: Health literacy The need to teach patients how to interact with physicians The need for better explanation of c onditions, medications, lab work, billing to patients by physicians and pharmacists \"Very confusing, even if they get it they can't find doctors or can't figure it out, so they end up not using it. The system is not set up to help them - too many barriers . Policies change all the time. Unsure of what is covered, labs, appointments, etc. It's hard enough for professionals to navigate the System, much less the everyday people.\" Insurance changes Coverage problems in general and need for broader range of coverage options to support health care choices Have to teach them what to ask for Language barriers \"In the communities there are lots of single moms. They don't have coverage, but the kids do. However, there are language barriers for quite a few.\" Racial barriers Closure of services Opioid addiction services but not crack cocaine Services in general Mental health Trenton Psychiatric Hospital closed \"Now there is an influx of mentally ill at libraries since they are a safe haven with a roof. ODs in bath rooms. This is the only place to possibly find access to information about care. Their needs are not being met; the Police Department monitors the library and tries to help with tips on the System, suggest other resources, clinics. However, the librarie s worry about their own employees and visit ors with the mentally ill.\" Ill-equipped, lacking resources for employees and patients with mental health problems Public health services are diminishing or closing \"Once you figure it out, things change or there are closures.\" Underlying the areas of concern was the \"negative perception of people who live in Trenton, which creates an internal powerlessness, a living the perception stigma.\" Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 65 Areas of Concern Mental health Anxiety, depression/other psychiatric illnesses Students disempowered/disenfranchised Suicide prevention needed Cyber bullying (fed by Social Media) Hunger/Food insecurity Corner stores only - high sodium, poor quality, etc. \"Food stamps have been cut back due to t he lack of redemption rates but there is no access to food. There is still a huge need.\" Lack of supermarket in the area WIC offering some fresh food No place to red eem vouchers: County cutbacks Lack of access to fresh foods/cost o Farmers' Market only open May -October Medical issues Maternal and pediatric service concerns Infant prematurity Preventative health care including support for alternative health care approaches (i.e., support for immune system and enhance good health) Immigrant population issu es (Haitian, Egyptian, Nigerian, Spanish, Polish) \"Is the library safe from ICE? Parents don't even take their own kids to school out of fear. ESL is available but not for disabled groups, ADD, autism, etc. If there has been an ICE issue you see a huge drop within the next days/weeks of immigrants coming in for services.\" School environment School -to-prison pipeline Narcan in bathroom Need for leadership development In discussing other areas of concern/need, participants talked about a generalized disa ppointment because so much is stacked against the City and the County. The issues cited included: Poverty: chronic and concentrated \"Outside investors come in and buy buildings, turn them into Section 8 housing. People don't work, don't contribute to the community.\" Violence Sexual assault and abuse Drug use/opioid addiction Racial disparity Mothers addicted Homelessness Lack of affordable housing Veterans' Services Lack of services for Trenton Vets - have to go to other areas for care Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 66 Racism Apparent in closure of services Women Low status of women No Women's professional representative Institutional racism Racial disparity Seniors: General Elder Care Suicide prevention \"Of 15 kids in a youth group, 4 personally knew someone who committe d suicide.\" Sexual assault by adults on young people Family members or those in the community Transportation Inefficient public transportation Transportation systems difficult to navigate Smoking cessation Employment Job readiness/education Teen pregnancy Teen pregnancy rates are the same as they were 4 to 5 years ago, approximately one - third of 100 kids under 17 College graduates \"They do n't come back; were not raising in-house leaders.\" Health education Health literacy How proper food and nutrition can prevent and reverse disease With few exceptions, similar medical conditions were noted for Trenton that were identified in other communities. Asthma in the young Cancer Depression Diabetes Heart disease HIV Infant mortalit y Lead poisoning rampant (leads to misdiagnosis) Obesity/childhood obesity Pre-natal care Sexually transmitted diseases Trenton participants had the longest list of priority needs compared to the other communications. The list included: Mental health Access to services Education on mental health Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 67 Preventative health care Substance abuse Mental health Patients' Bill of rights o Felt to work against families and caregivers Health care Access to maternity and pediatric services Health literacy Prevent ative health care Institutionalized racism School -to-prison pipeline Treatment in health care system Transportation services Lack of public transportation; need Medicaid for Mercer County T.R.A.D.E. Employment Job readiness - high school education Outside perceptions of Trenton creates internal powerlessness Gang violence Chronic poverty Nighttime safety Nutrition - children and elderly Emergency services Overall lack of services Employment/job readiness There were several other issues and concerns raised by participants including a lack of leaders from Trenton. \"Civic association volunteers are residents, but most other leaders are from outside of Trenton.\" Also highlighted were safety concerns and a sense that between 5:30 -6:00 PM the City shuts down. \"Even for meetings, people say they can't come out in the dark.\" Participants were also concerned about budget cuts impacting mentoring programs and about outsiders (Pipeline) building a City of concentrated poverty. Lawrence, Ewing and Princeton Among the improvements noted in the Lawrence, Ewing and Princeton area was a heightened awareness about what is available and what is being done was considered a good change over the past few years. Other improvements included: Law Enforcement Improved partnership/relationship Undocumented high school population Well Baby does exams to help Moms stay in high school Hospitals are engaging more with the community Outreach has improved Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 68 More vans available, allowing greater spread of health informa tion Facility Increase Improved/larger physical spaces Greater access to families Health focus heightened Health Fairs - block parties Health coaches: diabetic/cardiac - although not enough use of them Access issues were focused on five areas, with suppo rt for mental health most dominant. Mental health Adolescent/child psychiatry Sibling relationships 'Telemental' health Transportation Provided by private groups - but more publicity is needed to heighten awareness e.g., disability buses Access to broader medical care Currently insufficient for low income families Insurance issues The dental or vision plans for all Participants saw a greater need for more information in many areas. Mental health Depression/anxiety/suicide - middle school, high sc hool and adults Healthy coping skills Prevention program in the high school Anxiety and pressure/stress for trivial matters Generational change Post 911: greater stress, more threatening environment Education Behavioral health Alzheimer's Bullying Access to healthy food (Ewing) Boxed dinners/garden -to-table Send Hunger Packing, but there is a stigma with that Food Pantry General food insecurity Immigrant populations (Asian -Seniors - more well -to-do; Latinos - younger) Undocumented minors and childre n of undocumented parents No vision/dental - limited to no access to health care Children worry about parents Afraid to go to WIC services - will be denied seen as a 'public burden'.

WORLD CAF\u00c9 MEETING The Greater Mercer Public Hea lth Partnership, in cooperation with Community Advisory Board , held a World Caf\u00e9 Listening Session on April 25, 2018. A World Caf\u00e9 , or Knowledge Caf\u00e9 , is a structured conversation held with groups of people who discuss a topic area at several tables, with individuals switching tables periodically and being introduced to the previous discussion at their new table by a table host. Among the topics were, \"What Does a Healthy Community Look Life?\"; \"Whose Voice Do We Still Need to Hear?\"; and \"What One Thing Do You Wish We Could All Work Together On Over The Next Three Years To Make Our Towns Healthier?\" A summary of the perspectives provided by World Caf\u00e9 participants is presented below.

RWJUH HAMILTON HEALTH PROFILE The RWJUH Hamilton Health Profile provides comparative analysis of health outcomes and health factors across the region, neighboring counties, New Jersey, Healthy Pe ople 2020 targets and County Health Rankings benchmarks. Health outcomes depict the health of a region. Health factors represent health influences within a geographic area; an evaluation of health behaviors, access to care, social, economic and cultural specific issues and behavioral health are provided. Included also are social determinants of health, factors that influence health outcomes, disparities in health, and equity in health care. Whenever possible, the Health Profile represents the RWJUH Hamilt on service area; however, Mercer County data are provided when local data were unavailable. A. RWJUH HAMILTON SERVICE AREA OVERVIEW RWJUH Hamilton is located in Mercer County in west central New Jersey, bordering Somerset and Hunterdon counties to the north and Middlesex, Monmouth and Burlington counties to the east and south. The Delaware River and Pennsylvania are on the western edge of the county . The county encompasses a land mass of 226.1 square miles with seven townships, three boroughs, 34 zip codes , and 371,183 residents . The county and its subdivisions are now largely suburban with Trenton as its principal urban center. The RWJUH Hamilton service area ( SA) is home t o 307,091 residents . Trenton is the capital of the U.S. state of New Jersey and the county seat of Mercer County. Trenton and Hamilton are two of the most populated communities in the State of New Jersey. Trenton sits on the banks of the Delaware River and features four distinct wards with many neighborhoods. Its distinct architecture and new residential spaces that were once industrial buildings reflect emerging urban renewal. In contrast, small boroughs such as Pennington, Hightstown and Hopewell feature parks, recreational areas, a living history farm and wildlife center s, local business establishments and reside ntial neighborhoods. Five colleges and universities are located in Mercer County; Princeton is internationally recognized for its outstanding Princeton University.5 RWJUH Hamilton's service area population is growing slower than the State overall. Betwe en 2010 and 2018, the population increased 0.9% compared to the statewide growth of 2.0%. Princeton saw the greatest population growth (5.4%) during this time. While the county's population is 49.1 % white, the greatest racial/ethnic increase occurred amo ng Asians (29%), Hispanic/Latinos (20.4%) and persons of two or more races (24.8%).6 The service area age distribution consists of a large percentage under age 17 (21.8 %), particularly in Trenton. Areas with high concentrations of seniors are found in Hop ewell (18.3%) and Trenton zip code 08690 (20.4%) and exceed the statewide average of 16%. B. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH Social determinants of health include socioeconomic and environmental factors which influence health outcomes, disparities in heal th, equity in health care, and are important tools to assess health at the local level. Healthy People 2020 provides a framework for assessing social determinants of health across five topic areas: economic stability; education; social and community conte xt; health and health care; and, 5 http://www.mercercounty.org/explore 6 All demographic data are from Claritas 2019 population estimates. Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 74 neighborhood and built environment. While a relatively affluent county, there are residents of RWJUH Hamilton 's service area that face many socioeconomic challenges that may have consequences for health and health care in the region.7 In particular, the Trenton area differs from much of the suburban parts of the county in that its population is more racially and ethnically diverse, economically challenged and least favorable with regard to most health status indicators. 1. Economic Stability Poverty Many believe that the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) understates true poverty and is prejudicial to New Jersey as it fails to adjust for differences in the cost of living across states. Mercer County is comparable to New Jers ey with 11.2 % of residents sustaining an income below poverty. Overall, Mercer County families, people, and children had a higher or equal percentage of an income below federal poverty level than the Statewide rate. Fewer Mercer County seniors had income below poverty compared to seniors statewide. Trenton zip code 08611 poverty rate s among individuals (25.3%) and families (25.6%) are higher than RWJUH Hamilton PSA and New Jersey. Individuals in Trenton zip code 08608 had the highest poverty rate (25.3%) in the service area.

Municipal -level data often relies on 5 -year averages and is not available for the smallest towns tha t do not report income. Unemployment Those who are unemployed face greater challenges to health and well -being, including lost income and health insurance. Unemployed individuals are 54% more likely to be in poor or fair health as compared to employed individuals. According to CHR, racial and ethnic minorities and those with less education, often already at -risk for poor health outcomes, are most likely to be unemployed. Labor statistics indicate unemployment rates peaked at the height of the recession in 2010 , and began to show some improvement by 2014. Between 201 4 and 2016, the unemployment rate for Mercer County declined from 6.9% to 5.6%. Individual zip codes also declined except for Hopewell and Trenton zip code 08608. The 2016 Mercer C ounty unemployment rate is higher than the state and all comparison counties other than Camden. Trenton zip code 08611 had the highest unemployment rate in 2016, 8.8%.

While the starkest difference in health is between those with the highest and lowest incomes, this relationship persists throughout all income brackets.10 In 2016, Mercer County's median household income was slightly higher than the median household income statewide. Mercer County's median household income declined from 2014 to 2016.

Social and Community Context Social Associations Social isolation can negatively impact health outcomes. Having a strong social network is associated with healthy lifestyle choices, positive health status, and reduced morbidity and mortality. Participation in community organizations can enhance social trust and a sense of belonging.15 Social associations include structured membership organizations such as civic organizations, bowling centers, golf clubs, fitness centers, sports organizations, religious organizations, political organizations, business and professional associations. Mercer County's rate of association per 10,000 population (11.3) is higher than the State and comparison counties. The rate of association per 10,000 has remained consistent from 2013 -2016. 15 http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/new -jersey/2015/measure/factors/140/description 2014 2016 New Jersey Burlington Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 89 8.28 8.34 8.3211.66 11.14 11.258.47 8.47 2014 2015RATE PER 10,000New Jersey Mercer County Burlington County Camden County Middlesex County Rate of Membership Organizations per 10,000 Population Source: County Health Rankings, CDC Wonder Mortality Data, 201 3 - 2016 4. Health and Health Care Access to affordable quality health care is important to physical, social, and mental health. Health insurance helps individuals and families access needed primary care, specialists, and emergency care, but does not ensure access. It is also necessary for providers to offer affordable care, be available to treat patients and be near patien ts.16 Health Insurance The expansion of Medicaid coverage and the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) coverage provisions, which began taking effect in 2010, helped decrease the nation's uninsured rate by 7.2 percentage points, from 16 percent in 2016. That translates into 20.4 million fewer people who lacked health insurance in 2016 compared to 2010. The uninsured rate is estimated to have increased to 15.5% in the first quarter of 2018, meaning another 4 million lost coverage since 2016 due to changes in health policy and insurance 16 http://www.county healthrankings.org/our -approach/health -factors/access -care Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 90 Jersey Mercer County Burlington County Camden County Middlesex Countyofferings. The uninsured are less likely to have primary care providers than the insured; they also receive less preventive care, dental care, chronic disease management, and behavioral health counseling. Those without insurance are often diagnosed at later , less treatable disease stages than those with insurance and, overall, have worse health outcomes, lower quality of life, and higher mortality rates. Neighborhoods with low health insurance rates often have fewer providers, hospital beds and emergency resources than areas with higher rates. Even the insured have more difficulty getting care in these areas. Cost can be a barrier to care even for those who have insurance. Lack of insurance creates barriers to timely access to care for patients and financ ial burdens to the providers who care for them. Since 2013, the nonelderly population without health insurance in Mercer County has trended downward, decreasing from 14.56 percent to 9.88 percent in 2015. From 2013 through 2015, Mercer County had consiste ntly lower rates of nonelderly population without health insurance than statewide. The 2015 percent of the nonelderly population without health insurance (9.88%) is higher than the Healthy People 2020 target of 0% and the County Health Rankings benchmark o f 6% .

Health insurance assists individuals and families to obtain primary care, specialists, and emergency care, but does not ensure access. Access to ca re goes beyond just insurance, it is also necessary for providers to offer affordable care, be available to treat patients and be near patients.17 Primary Care Physicians Nationally, many areas lack sufficient providers to meet patient needs; as of June 2 014, there are about 7,200 primary care, 5,000 mental health and 5,900 dental federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas in the US. Having a usual primary care provider is associated with a higher likelihood of appropriate care and better outc omes. In 2017, 88% of Americans had a usual source of care, but those with low incomes are less likely to than those with higher incomes, and the uninsured are twice as likely as the insured to lack a usual care source.18, 19 Within Mercer County, the ratio of population to primary care physicians dec lined slightly from 947:1 to 938:1. From 2013 through 2015, the ratio of population to primary care physicians in Mercer County was lower than statewide. The 2015 Mercer County ratio of population to prima ry care physicians (938:1) compares favorably to the County Health Rankings benchmark of 1,030:1 and performs in the highest quartile in comparison to the state.

Based on a wide array of demogra phic and economic statistics, the CNI provides a score for every populated ZIP Code in the United States. A score of 1.0 indicates a ZIP Code with the least need and a score of 5.0 represents a ZIP Code with the most need. The CNI is useful as part of a la rger community health needs assessment to pinpoint specific areas with greater need than others. The CNI score is an average of five barrier scores that measure socio -economic indicators of each community using 2017 source data : 1. Income Barrier Percentage of households below poverty line, with head of household age 65 or older Percentage of families with children under 18 below poverty line Percentage of single female -headed families with children under 18 below poverty line 20 Truven Health Analytics, 2017; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2017; Claritas and Community Need Index, 2017. http://cni.chw - interactive.org/ COMMUNITY NEED INDEX (Dignity Health) Darker Red Areas Indicate A Higher CNIScore (Higher Need) Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 93 2. Cultural Barrier Percentage of population that is minority (including Hispanic ethnicity) Percentage of population over age 5 that speaks English poorly or not at all 3. Education Barrier Percentage of population over 25 without a high school diploma 4. Insurance Barrier Percentag e of population in the labor force, aged 16 or more, without employment Percentage of population without health insurance 5. Housing Barrier Percentage of households renting their home A comparison of CNI scores and hospital utilization reveals a strong correlation between need and use. Communities with low CNI scores can be expected to have high hospital utilization. There is a causal relationship between CNI scores and preventable hospitalizations and ED visits for manageable conditions. Commu nities with high CNI scores may have more hospitalization and ED visits that could have been avoided with improved healthy community structures and appropriate outpatient and primary care. Trenton zip codes 08608 and 08609 CNI score ( 5.0) indicates highes t need in the County, followed by Trenton zip codes 08611 (4.8), 08618/Ewing (4.4) and 08629/Hamilton (4.4). Conversely, Trenton zip code 08690/Hamilton Square's score (1. 4) represents the lowest CNI score in the County followed by Hopewell, Pennington and Trenton zip code 08691/Robbinsville (1.6) and Trenton zip code 08620/Hamilton (1.8).

Timeliness of Service A key indicator of the timeliness of service is emergency department (ED) utilization for conditions that could have been treated in a primary care setting.

Trenton and Ewing areas have nearly nine percent of households without a vehicle. Eight percent of Mercer County residents use public transit to commute for work. 21 ED Utilization for Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC) are potentially preventable medical conditions that are treated in the ED although more appropriate care should have been provided in a non -emergent outpatient primary care setting. ED utilization rates may be re duced by addressing primary care access issues. Higher rates of ACSC conditions in Emergency Departments may indicate primary care access issues poor(er) preventative care among the population and in some instances health barriers related to socio -economic status.

A main source of lead exposure is found in household dust with lead -based paint. Children are highly vulnerable to exposure to lead because of its adverse effects on the developing brain and nervous system.25 In 2016, 30.5% of the Mercer County housing stock was built before 1950 and had possible lead - based paint hazards.

Young children can be exposed by swallowing lead dust or soil that gets on their hands or objects they put into their mouths such as toys; swallowing leaded paint chips; breathing leaded dust or lead contaminated air and eating food or drinking water that is contaminated with lead. Very high levels of lead can cause seizures, brain damage, developmental or intellectual disabilities, coma and even death. Exposure to lead, even at low levels, has been associated with decrease hearing, lower intelligence, hyperact ivity, attention deficit, and developmental problems.26 County level analysis cannot reveal individual town disparities in blood lead levels particularly in towns with housing stock built before 1950. In 2016, 0.80% of children in Mercer County had elevated blood levels.

HEALTH FACTORS Health factors represent the influences that impact one's health. These include demographic, social, environmental, economic, and individual behaviors as well as clinical care and access to services. Social determinants were described in Section B above , and along with the following health factors have a significant impact on health . 1. Demographics Age Health disparities exist in all age groups. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that , although life expectancy and overall health has improved for most Americans, older adults are not benefitting equally due to economic status, race and gender. The overall proportion of the older adult population in Mercer County is less than New Jersey. From 2018 to 2023, the population aged over 65 in Mercer County is projected to increase at a lower rate (2. 2%) than the statewide increase (2.4% ). Between 2018 and 2023, New Jersey is projected to have a 1 .9% decline among (0-17) year old. The greatest decline will be in Robbinsville zip code 08691, with 4.6% decline . The overall projected population growth for Robbinsville (2.9%), between 2018 and 2023 is more than double that of the State (1.3%). The largest change is among those 65+. This cohort wil l increase across all geographic areas, the largest occurring in, Robbinsville zip code 0869 1 (24%), Hamilton zip code 08620 ( 14.3 %) and Hamilton zip code 086 20 (15.8 %). Women of child -bearing age (15 -44) comprise 20% of Mercer County's 2018 population and are projected to decrease 1.8% by 2022. Hamilton zip code 0861 0 and Trenton zip code 08628 will decline between 4.3 and 4. 9% respectively , far more than the county and statewide averages .

The population cohorts which historically have experienced poorer health st atus are anticipated to grow; therefore, the future health of America can be influenced by improving the health of these select groups. In Mercer County, the percentage of Black, Asian and Hispanic populations increased while the percentage of White reside nts has declined, heightening the vital need for addressing disparities in health and care among more vulnerable minority groups.29 RWJUH Hamilton service area has the highest percentage of African Americans (2 2.3%).

Clinical Care Measures Inpatient and ED Utilization Factors impacting hospital utilization may include policy change, advances in technology, practice patterns and demographics. Many federal and state health care payment reforms, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA), were designed to improve care transitions, coordination of care, enhance ambulatory care and improve access to primary care. The anticipatory resul ts would include improved coordinated care and declines in inpatient and ED utilization. Inpatient Zip codes 08618, 08609, and 08619 recorded the highest inpatient use rate s in the county .

Recently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists developed clinical guidelines for reducing the occurrence of non - medically indicated cesarean delivery and labor induction prior to 39 weeks. Efforts to reduce such births include initiatives to improve perinatal care quality, and changes in hospital policy to disallow elective delivery prior to 39 weeks and education of the public.31 The percent of Mercer County women with a primary C -section trended downward from 2013 - 2015 and then increased to 23.3% in 2016 .

Health y Behaviors Maternal / Fetal Health Prenatal Care The medical care a woman receives during pregnancy monitors her health and the developing fetus. Low - risk pregnancies should visit a prenatal provider every four or six weeks through 28 weeks, then every two or three weeks from weeks 28 -36, and finally every week in the ninth month until delivery. A high -risk pregnancy requires additional visits.32 Pregnant women who do not receive adequate prenatal care risk undetected complications and an increased possibility of adverse outcomes. Early and regular prenata l care is a strategy to improve health outcomes for mothers and infants. Two significant benefits are improved birth weight and decreased preterm delivery. Infants born to mothers who receive no prenatal care have an infant mortality rate five times higher than mothers who receive appropriate prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy. Enrollment in care during the first trimester of pregnancy reflects timely initiation of prenatal care.33 In 2016, only 67. 8% of live births to Mercer County moms rece ived first trimester care compared to a high of 86.1% in 2010. This percentage showed an unfavorable increase from 2015 to 2016. Mercer County had the lowest percentage of live births with first trimester prenatal care in all comparative counties.

The national teen birth rate has trended downward over the past 20 years. In 1991, the U.S. teen birth rate was 61.8 births/1,000 adolescent females. However, the U.S. teen birth rate remains higher than that of many other developed countries, including C anada and the United Kingdom.34 Pregnant teens are less likely than older women to receive recommended prenatal care and are more likely to have pre - term or low birth weight babies. Teen mothers are often at increased risk for STIs and repeat pregnancies, are less likely than their peers to complete high school and more likely to live below the poverty level and rely on public assistance. Risky sexual behaviors can have high economic costs for communities and individuals.35 Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 132 23.6 15.325.4 16.918.2 11.738.1 26.716.6 11.2 2004 -2010 2010 -2016RATE PER 1,000New Jersey Mercer County Burlington County Camden County Middlesex County The percent of Mercer County b irths to teens aged 15 -17 trended downward from 2007 through 2016.

People who engage in all of these behaviors are 66 percent les s likely to die early from cancer, 65 percent less likely to die early from cardiovascular disease and 57 percent less likely to die early from other causes compared to those who do not engage in any of these behaviors.38 Tobacco Use Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking leads to disease and disability, and harms nearly every organ in the body, and causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and lung diseases such as emphysema, bronchi tis, and chronic airway obstruction. Exposure to secondhand smoke can lead to lung cancer and heart disease. Each year, smoking kills approximately 480,000 Americans, including 41,000 from secondhand smoke. On average, smokers die 10 years earlier than no nsmokers. About 15% of U.S. adults smoke. Each day, nearly 3,200 youth smoke their first cigarette, and 2,100 people transition from occasional to daily smokers. Smokeless tobacco also leads to various cancers, gum and teeth problems, and nicotine addiction. Almost 6% of young adults use smokeless tobacco and half of new users are younger than 18.39,40 In 2016, Mercer County had the lowest percentage of adults in the four -county area who reported smoking (10.8%).

Excessive consumption considers both the amount and the frequency of drinking. Short -term, excessive drinking is linked to alcohol poisoning, intimate partner violence, risky sexual behaviors, failure to fulfill responsibilities and motor vehicle crashes. Over time , excessive alcohol consumption is a risk factor for hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, fetal alcohol syndrome, liver disease and certain cancers.41 The binge drinking rate in Mercer County has decreased since 2012, from a rate of 15.6% to 12.1%.

As of 2016, 41 million Americans struggled with hunger in the U.S. A household that is food insecure has limited or uncertain access to enough food to support a healthy life. Obesity among food insecure people, as well as low income individuals, occurs in part because they are often subject to the same challenges as other Americans (more sedentary lifestyles, increased portion size) and because they face unique challeng es in adopting and maintaining healthy behaviors, including limited resources and lack of access to affordable healthy food, cycles of food deprivation and overeating, high levels of stress and anxiety, fewer opportunities for physical activity, greater ex posure to marketing of obesity promoting products, and limited access to health care.44 Over 33% of Mercer County adults reported a BMI at or over 30 in 2016.

Women between the ages of 21 and 29 should have a Pap test done every 3 years. Women between the ages of 30 and 65 should have a Pap test plus an HPV test (calle d \"co -testing\") done every 5 years. Women over age 65 who have regular cervical cancer testing in the past 10 years with normal results should not be tested for cervical cancer. Women with a history of a serious cervical pre -cancer should continue to be tested for at least 20 years after that diagnosis, even if testing goes past age 65. Some women - because of their health history (HIV infection, organ transplant, DES exposure, etc.) - may need a different screening schedule for cervical cancer. As of 201 6, 64.4% of Mercer County women received pap tests, decreasing from 71.2% in 2014.

Vaccines introduce the antigens that cause diseases. Immunity, the body's means to preventing disease, recognizes germs and produces antibodies to fight them. Even after many years, the immune system continues to produce antibodie s to thwart disease from recurring. Through vaccination we can develop immunity without suffering from disease.46 Evidenced -based; CDC guidelines, public health benefit - individual and herd . 46 http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac -gen/howvpd.htm#why Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 154 Childhood Immunizations: DPT, polio, MMR & Hib (aged 19-35 months) 47 Young children are readily susceptible to disease and the consequences can be serious or life -threatening. Childhood immunizations minimize impact of vaccine preventable diseases. The incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of many communicable diseases have significantly declined in Western countries largely because of national immunization strategies aimed at infants and children. It has been estimated that for each U.S. birth cohort receiving recommended childhood immunizations, around 20 million illnesses and more than 40,000 deaths are prevented, resulting in $70 billion in savings. Vaccinations are effective, primarily due to two factors. First, once a person is immu nized against a specific pathogen, the rate of that disease, as well as its associated asymptomatic carrier state, is decreased.6 Second, when a large population is immunized, unvaccinated individuals benefit from \"herd immunity,\" which is a reduced risk of exposure to pathogens.6 Consequently, children's health has improved, and the quality and length of their lives have increased. Conflicting information in the news and on the internet about children's immunizations may cause vaccine hesitancy among select parents. In an effort to reduce childhood morbidity and m ortality, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issues annual recommendations and guidelines for childhood and adolescent immunizations. However, some parents refuse or delay vaccinating th eir children or follow alternative immunization schedules because of medical, religious, philosophical, or socioeconomic reasons. Health care provider -based interventions have been suggested to overcome such vaccine noncompliance, including patient counse ling; improving access to vaccinations; maximizing patient office visits; offering combination vaccines; and using electronic medical records (EMRs) and practice alerts. Community - and government - based interventions to improve parent and patient adherence include public education and reminder/recall strategies, financial incentives, and providing alternative venues for vaccination.48 In 2016, 92.9 % of first grade students in Mercer County had received all required immunizations compared to 92.7 % statewide. 93.9% of all Mercer County students received all required immunizations --- .5 percentage point lower than statewide. 47 Combined 4 vaccine series (4:3:1:3) refers to 4 or more doses of DTP/DT, 3 or more doses of poliovirus vaccine, 1 or more doses of MCV and 3 or more doses of Hib .http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz -managers/coverage/nis/child/tech -notes.html) 48 http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac -gen/howvpd.htm#why Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page -K K I N D E R G AR T E N F I R S T G R AD E S I X T H G R AD E T O T ALNew Jersey Mercer County Burlington County Camden County Middlesex County Childhood Immunization: Percent of Children Meeting All Immunization Requirements State and County Comparisons, 2016 Source: NJDOH Annual Immunization Status Report http://www.nj.gov/health/cd/documents/status_report/2016/all_schools_vac.pdf Data are the most current County -Level figures available.

Mortality - Leading Cause of Death According to the CDC, mortality statistics are one of few data sets comparable for small geographic areas , available for long time periods and appropriate as a primary sou rce for public health planning. Between 2013 and 2016, 5 of the top 10 age -adjusted mortality rates declined, with greatest decreases in Stroke ( Diabetes mellitus ( -3.7%) and Alzheimer's disease ( -3.2%). Since 2008, the top COD (Heart Disease), experienced a decrease of -2.3%. Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis increased 39.3% from 2013, the largest percent increase, Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis increased 30.1% between 2013 -2016.

The disease involves parts of the brain that control thought, memory and language. In 2013, an estimated 5 million people living in the U.S. were living with Alzheimer's disease. By 2050, this number i s projected to increase to 14 million people.55 Between 20 08 and 2016, age adjusted mortality rates for Alzheimer's disease increased from 19.4/100,000 to 25 to 24/100 ,000.

Premature Deaths An alternate method to reviewing crude or age -adjusted death rates as a measure of premature mortality is assessing Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL).

Behavioral Health -Related Deaths Mental health is a state of well -being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, copes with normal life stresses, works productively, and is able to contribute to his or her community. Mental illness includes diagnosable mental disorders or health condi tions characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning. Depression, the most common type of mental illness, is associated with higher rates of chronic disease, increased health care utilization, and impaired functioning. However, rates of mental illness treatment remain low, and often the treatment received is inadequate. The Mercer County suicide rate has ranged from a low of 5.7/100,000 in 2016 to a high of 10.6/100,000 in 2010. The current rate 5.7/100,000 is lower than the statewide rate of 7.7/100,000. The suicide rate of 5.7/100,000 is lower than the Healthy People 2020 target of 10.2/100,000.

Infant Mortality Infant mortality, the death of a baby prior to his or her first birthday, is t raditionally used as an indicator of the health and well -being of a nation. Infant mortality is calculated as the number of infant deaths under age 1 per 1,000 live births. Great disparities exist in infant mortality by age, race, and e thnicity. Most frequent causes are s erious birth defect , preterm birth/low birth weight, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), m aternal complications of pregnancy , and i njury .56 Infant mortality has been decreasing in Mercer County from 8.5 /100,000 in 2004 -2006 to 7.0/100,000 in 2013 -2015. The infant mortality rate for 2013 -2015 was higher than the Statewide; and the Burlington and Middlesex County rates. The 2013 -2015 infant mortality rate of 7.0 /100,000 is higher than the Healthy People 2020 target of 6.0/1,000 and the County Health rankings benchmark of 5/1,000. 56 http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/infantmortality.htm RED: Poorest Performing Quartile Yellow: Middle Quartiles Green: Best Performing Quartile Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 187 8.58.67.57.0 0 2 4 6 8 102004-20062007-20092010-20122013-2015Infant Mortality Rate: Rate of Infant (Under 1 Year) Deaths/1,000 Live Births State and County Comparisons 2007 -2015 Mercer County Source: NJDOH Center for Health Statistics NJ State Health Assessment Data - 2015 is most recent year available. 5.2 4.70 4.608.6 -2015RATE PER 1000New Jersey Mercer County Burlington County Camden County Middlesex County National Benchmark: 4.0 Mercer County: 7.0 Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 188 5.8#N/A#N/A 17.015.015.5 7.0#N/A6.4 -2 3 8 13 182007-20092010-20122013-2015 Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic The Black infant mortality rate decreased between 2007 -2009 from 17.0/100,000 to 15.5/100,000 in 2013 -2015.

Low and Very Low Birth Weight Infants Birth weight is the most important factor affecting neonatal mortality and a significant determinant of post neonatal mortality. Low birth weight infants (less than 2,500 grams) are at an increased risk for health problems ranging from neurodevelopmental disabilities to respiratory disorders.57 Racial disparities in low birth weight babies persist; nationally, non -Hispanic Black infants continue to die at nearly twice the rate of non -Hispan ic Whites. Low Birth Weight Mercer County had the second highest percentage of low birth weight infants among the comparative counties . The 2016, low birth weight rate of 8.10% is higher than the Healthy People 2020 target of 7.8% .

Health Status and Behavioral Health Status Health status and behavioral health status are broad multidimensional concepts including self -report measures of physical and mental health. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the nation's premier system of health -related telephone surv eys, collects data about U.S. residents regarding health -related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions and use of preventive services. In 1984, the survey began collecting data in 15 states and is currently conducted in all states including Washington D.C. and three United States territories. The most recent data available are for the year 2016. General Health Status Only 14.8% of Mercer County residents report their health as being fair or poor compared to 17.5% of New Jersians.

The three most common types of diabetes are Type 1, Type 2 and Gestational. Individuals with diabetes may develop serious health complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, amputation and premature death. Type 1 develops when insulin producing cells located in the pancreas are destroyed. There is no known way to prevent Type 1 diabetes. In order to survive, Type 1 diabetics must have insulin delivered by injection or pump. Type 2 primarily onsets with insulin resistance disorder in which cells within the muscles, liver, and fat tissue are unable to properly use insulin. Higher risk for d eveloping Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age, obesity, family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose metabolism, physical inactivity, and race/ethnicity. African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians, some Asians, and Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for Type 2. Gestational diabetes is a form of glucose intolerance diagnosed during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The risk factors for gestational Diabetes are similar to those for type 2 diabetes.60 12.2% of Mercer County residents report being told they had diabetes in 2016, greater than the Statewide rate.

Naomi provided an overview and brief report on preliminary CHA findings. Community Health Assessment is a process that: - Determines and evaluates the state of health and health needs of a local population - Enables the identification of major risk factors and causes of ill health; and - Identifies action needed to address these factors Why do a CHA? - To provide data for decision -making - To promote awareness and action - To satisfy a mandate A CHA provides valuable information regarding why and how to improve the community's health status. A comprehensive CHA gathers information using sound data collection m ethods and reflects the behaviors, beliefs, and demographics of community residents. The process consists of development of a community advisory board, primary research, review of secondary source data, priority setting and plan development, communication plan (all constituents), implementation and evaluation. Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 285 Mercer County was split into 5 pie pieces to ensure that each part of the county is well represented. Out of 5 focus groups held between March 5 - 14, 55 people from diverse backgrounds share d their experiences and opinions. Results are broken down by \"Definite Improvement\" and \"Some Improvement\". The improvement categories are broken down by municipality in the following table: Area Definite Improvement Some Improvement Hamilton/Robbinsville Clinics for uninsured Support for disabled Veterans programs Childhood obesity Senior services availability Opioid addiction Pennington/Hopewell Hospital access Anti-smoking campaign Parental support in various areas - medical and emotional Information flow Broader drug/alcohol reach Mental health support West Windsor/Hightstown Senior transportation Weekly BP screening Improved coordination w/ Police Closer hospital and EMT closer to police New leadership Lock boxes for elderly Politicians more in touch with community Vision/hearing screener availability City of Trenton Employment improved Young adults doing more in community More small businesses opening Food pantry availability Heightened community activism/collaboration n/a Lawrenceville/Ewing/Princeton Improved partnership with law enforcement General outreach improved Health services for undocumented population Hospitals engaging more Availability of more physical space Heightened heal th focus n/a Eight themes were reported in all groups: 1) Community/Network Connectedness/Communication 2) Access to care 3) Mental health -the single greates t concern area that was broadly defined - Opioid addiction, Stress/Anxiety management, Suicide prevention 4) Transportation 5) Language barriers/Immigrant population 6) Senior/Adult Needs -Also Veterans Services in some areas Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 286 7) Education -Health, Parenting, Social Media, tutoring programs, bullying 8) Medical Conditions - Alzheimer's/Deme ntia, Asthma, Cancer, Cardiovascular, Diabetes, Hypertension, Childhood Obesity, Chronic Pain Management Although occasional improvements were noted, respondents characterized access as 'not good' or 'in need' of improvement': this was true across all grou ps Access was often intertwined with lack of a broader communication network - Insurance (lack of expense, cutbacks, poor understanding) - Appropriate medical care (HCPs, Hospitals, Medication, Mental Health - particularly for low income families, dental/visi on) - Transportation (to reach appropriate medical services) - Lack of resources (training, public health programs/services, health literacy, etc.) - Identification of people in need (seniors, undocumented, immigrant population, etc.) - Other (affordable housing, language barriers, racial barriers) Using the Tools of Community Engagement in Your Organization - Stephanie Carey, Health Officer (Montgomery/Hopewell Borough/Pennington Borough) The goal is to engage community members and partners to better address public health issues. Stephanie provided a demonstration to the coalition partners present on how to use the World Caf\u00e9 exercise. What is a World Caf\u00e9? A World Caf\u00e9 or Knowledge Caf\u00e9 is a structured conversational process for knowledge sharing in which groups of people discuss a topic at several tables, with individuals switching tables periodically and getting introduced to the previous discussion at their new table by a \"table host\". World Caf\u00e9 Etiquette and Facilitator Introductions - Carol Nicholas, Director of GMPHP World Caf\u00e9 Etiquette Focus on what really matters Contribute your ideas and thinking Speak your mind and heart with humility. Listen to understand. Connect your ideas with others. Play, doodle and draw Have fun! Tools of Community Engagement These are tools you can take back to your organization to assure your communities' voices are heard! World Caf\u00e9 -Collaborative Dialogue Strengths/ Weaknesses/Opportunities/ Threats Appreciative Inquiry -Asking what's best about your organization helps identify its values. Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 287 Affinity Model --gathering comments on a key question without judgment, then identifyi ng common themes Table Hosts spend 10 minutes gathering feedback (on post -its) and 2 minutes clarifying and identifying themes.

What les sons did we learn implementing the 2015 CHIP that we can use to do better next time? (CHIP Evaluation) Questions: Participants start ed at the table matching the number given to them at Registration. Participants wrote their answers to the questions on post -it notes in 3 -5 word phrases. A person could write as many post -its as they want, 1 idea per post -it., and stick on flip chart paper. After 10 minutes (or sooner if they are done), facilitator encouraged the group to spend two minutes clustering t he post -its along similar themes, asking questions to clarify, build consensus, and name the theme. A total of 12 minutes per small group, with 2 minute changeovers. (A new flip chart page for each changeover) There were a total of 4 rotations to the 4 tables. Final answers were compiled into a table along with identified themes for each of the four questions: Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 288 What does a heath y community look like?

Missing: Primary Care issues/strategies (prevention of...) (x2) Multiple agencies are conducting the same survey process at the same time - duplication Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 295 For our 2015 -2018 Community Health Improvement Plan Implementation, what worked well? Collaboration Resources Data Commitment to keep on track Improved Communication Suggestions General Comments The collaborative effort/shared data (x2) GMPHP resources such as transportation Worked well - collected large amount of data leading to CHIP (x2) CHIP - the priority groups had some vigorous members that accomplished many goals, others were not as committed Permitted access to focus groups. Permitted t o participate in focus groups Narrow down focus group areas CHIP - used the report to justify prevention of childhood obesity program for grant applications CHIP - county wide involvement, good process to get to goals Mental health group creating mental health directory We were able to do comparative analysis between county and Trenton City Was centralized. Kept things limited and focused Well -coordinated. Was some time ago Make goals more achievable CHIP 2016 Report - used to justify integrated tr eatment program for pregnant women and new mothers Many people and organizations were involved w/ GMPHP Worksite wellness program went well but not sure about impact Includes transportation/cancer and previously unrepresented groups Commitment to keep moving on schedule, time - awareness Improved agency communication CHIP -CHA outcomes: WIC/Cornerstone, Health Screenings, Emergency Preparedness Survey = Focus on Prevention Process is important - thanks for mixing it up Sharing resources Transportat ion grant Good CHIP - Refocus us on issues, data Target to measure Increased awareness Full day prioritizing meeting I wasn't part of the development of the plan so I can't speak to the process. The plan looked good. Data paralleled the state (x2) CHIP process good. Focus on problems urgent but no panic. CHA = good focus on data Report to the community Helped break down silos Identifying partners Carol is a plus Community Health Needs Assessment Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Page 296 For our 2015 -2018 Community Health Improvement Plan Implementation, what didn't go so well? Data Awareness Reporting Tracking Suggestions General Comments Lack of drill down data for specific towns Not familiar or confused with CHA/CHIP (x7) Have a \"website\" page for tracking accomplishments or reporting the data Too many goals (x3) List accomplishments a report requirement CHA - I was less familiar with the process than I am in 2018. Therefore , I was not as \"invested' in pushing it out. Needed more external participation Partners were not aware of results of CHIP I'm not aware of outcomes so far Partners didn't assist with implementation Keeping partners engaged in the process There has to be value to the meetings Survey was too long; many people refused to participate especially if language skill were low Transportation is such a large issues that it is so overwhelming to make progress in a meaningful way. Maybe address the issue depending on the town. Smaller groups within a specific identified problem Municipality specific selection of strategies and goals. Not every place can do or wants the same - tie back to focus groups and surveys per town \"Not Working\" Barriers to Health = example: no rain cover over the Penn/Princeton Emergency Room Entrance Exit Lofty goals but difficult to measure The CHA could have been more widely distributed to many different groups Not actively driving change at Health Systems Unrepresented portions of mercer county CHIP implementation tracking.
