COVID -19 Vaccin ation Requirement (Proclamation 21-14.1) for health care providers , workers and settings Link to proclamation : 21-14.1 - COVID -19 Vax Washington General Procl amation Questions What does Proclamation 21 -14.1 do? Proclamation 21 -14.1, issued by Governor Inslee on August 20, 2021, made numerous changes to Proclamation 21 -14, issued by Governor Inslee on August 9, 2021, but left the same core requirements in place. As before, the proclamation requires health care providers, defined broad ly to include not only licensed health care providers but also all employees, contractors, and volunteers who work in a health care setting , to be fully vaccinated against COVID -19 by October 18, 2021. It also requires o perators of health care settings to verify the vaccination status of : a) Every employee, volunteer, and contractor who works in the health care setting , whether or not they are licensed or providing health care services, and b) Every employee, volunteer, and contractor who provides health care services for the health care setting operator . On what legal grounds can this be imposed? In response to the emerging COVID -19 threat, Governor Inslee declared a state of emergency on Febru ary 29, 2020, using his broad emergency authority under chapter 43.06 RCW. More specifically, under RCW 43.06.220, after a state of emergency has been declared, the governor may prohibit any activity that they believe should be prohibited to help preserve and maintain life, health, property or the public peace. Under an emergency such as this, the governor's paramount duty is to protect the health and safety of our communities. Staff have been successful in keeping infection rates low with safety precautio ns such as social distancing, hand washing, and mask wearing ; why is this needed? While those practices are important, vaccines are the strongest tool in our toolbox to fight COVID -19. Frontline workers across the private sector have continued working since the initial \"Stay home, Stay Healthy\" order. They, rightfully, are becoming wear y of the day -to-day stress 2 of high and dangerous caseloads. Significant efforts have been made to address workplace safety in the face of COVID -19, a new workplace hazard. Even with all of those safety efforts , we did not curtail all outbreaks. The threat of COVID -19 is evolving as new more easily transmitted and aggressive variants become prevalent in our state. We now have the tool of COVID -19 vaccine s, which is the single most effective resource to combat spr ead and prevent illness and death. When will this be in effect? The first version of the order was effective as of August 9 . The deadline to become fully vaccinated is October 18, 2021. In order to be con sidered fully vaccinated by October 18, you must r eceive your second dose in a two -dose COVID -19 vaccine series or a dose of a single -dose vaccine approved or authorized for emergency use by the FDA or WHO on or before October 4, 2021. If you do not meet th ese deadline s, including by providing proof to th e operator of health care setting where you work, then you are not permitted to work there, unless the operator has provided you a disability or religious accommodation. To whom does the proclamation apply? The proclamation requires \" health care providers \" to get vaccinated. This term is defined broadly to include more than just licensed health care providers. It includes : Individuals holding a license, certification or registration from the Washington State Department of Health, listed here , who are actively practicing or providing services to people . Individuals who are permitted by law to provide heal th care services in a professional capacity without holding a credential from the Department of Health and are actively providing services to people . Long -term care workers, with limited exceptions described below . On-site workers in any health care settin g, regardless of whether they are licensed or providing health care services (for example administrative support staff who work in person in a clinic or cleaning service workers) . On-site workers include employees, contractors, and volunteers engaged in wo rk in a health care setting. If a health care provider is author ized to practice in Washington under a temporary workforce recognition, or volunteer registry, does the vaccine mandate apply to them ? Yes. Individuals such as these who are permitted by law to provide health care services in a professional capacity without holding a credential are health care providers subject to the proclamation . Is a therapist in a child advocacy center covered by the mandate? Yes, because a therap ist is a health care provider, and all actively practicing health care providers are required to be vaccinated. The operator of the child advocacy center is required to verify the vaccination status of a therapist who provides services there only if the ch ild advocacy center is primarily used for delivering in -person health care services to people, making it a health care setting. 3 To whom does the proclamation not apply? Health care providers /workers working only in the following settings are not required to be vaccinated under the proclamation: o Settings where sports and spectator events or other gatherings are held (including when credentialed athletic trainers are providing care to players), excluding areas primarily used for the delivery of health care services, such as designated first aid areas (are Health Care Settings) o Department of Children, Youth & Families (DCYF) -licensed foster homes that do not primarily provide health care services o Research facilities where no health care is delivered to people o Veterinary health care settings o Animal control agencies o Non -profit humane societies Health care providers who are not actively practicing or providing services are not required to be vaccinate d under the proclamation. Additionally, the proclamation does not apply to individuals who provide only personal care services, as defined in RCW 74.39A.009(24) , in people's homes. Personal care services are defined as physical or verbal assistance with activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living provided because of a person's functional disability (RCW 74.39A.009(24) . How is health care setting defined? For the purposes of the proclamation, a health care setting is any publ ic or private place that is primarily used for the delivery of in -person health care services to people , unless specifically exempted by the proclamation. If the location is primarily used for the delivery of health care services, such as a hospital, then the entire facility is a health care setting. Other businesses and facilities may have a section of their location that is considered a health care setting , such as a pharm acy within a grocery store, school nurse's office, massage treatment area within a spa, or vaccination clinic within a business establishment . In this situation , the health care setting includes only the areas that are primarily used for the delivery of health care . Other areas of the facility are not considered health care settings. Health care settings include , but are not limited to: Acute care facilities, including, but not limited to, hospitals Long -term acute care facilities Inpatient rehabilitation facilities Inpatient behavioral health facilities, including, but not limited to, evaluation and treatment facilities, residential treatment facilities, and secure detox facilit ies Residential long -term care facilities, including, but not limited to, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, adult family homes, settings where certified community residential services and supports are provided, and enhanced services facilities Mob ile clinics or other vehicles where health care is delivered , such as ground and air ambulances 4 Outpatient facilities, including, but not limited to, dialysis centers, physician offices, behavioral health facilities, behavioral health agencies and private /group practice behavioral health settings (including offices of psychiatrists, mental health counselors, and substance use disorder professionals ) Dental and dental specialty facilities Pharmacies (not including the retail areas ) Massage therapy offices (this includes designated areas where massage is administered within non -health care settings like spas and wellness/fitness centers ) Chiropractic offices Midwifery practices and stand -alone birth centers Isolation and/or quarantine facilities Ambu latory surgical facilities Urgent care centers Hospice care centers Blood collection facilities Is a local health jurisdiction/department a health care setting? All licensed health care providers or people authorized to provide health care without a credential who work for these entities must meet the requirement regardless of whether they work in a health care setting operated by the local health jurisdiction. Other staff would need to be vaccinated if they are working in a location that is operated by the local health jurisdiction primarily for health care delivery, and therefore, would be considered a health care setting under the proclamation. Does the proclamation apply to tribal health care settings? No. The proclamation extends to Washington -licensed health care providers wherever they practice since they hold a state -issued credential. But the obligation for a health care setting operator to verify the vaccination status of health care provider s engaged in work for them doesn't apply to tribal h ealth care settings. If an entity employs or contracts with health care providers to provide health care services in other locations but does not itself operate a health care setting, is the entity required to verify the vaccination status of those health care providers? No, only an entit y that operates a setting where health care is delivered in person is required to verify the vaccination status of the workers in that setting and of health care providers who work for them. However, those health care providers are themselves required to p rovide proof of vaccination to the entity. Does this apply to licensed health care providers who only provide telehealth services? Yes. All individuals who hold a health care profession credential on this list and are actively practicing or providing services to people are subject to the vaccination requirement regardless of where they work . 5 Does this apply to domestic violence or sexual assault advocates accompanying survivors to the hospital? If an advocate contract s with the hospital to provide services in the hospital , they are subject to the vaccination requirement because they are a worker in a health ca re setting, and thus a health care provider. Otherwise, they would not be subject to the requirement unless they hold a credential listed in the Health care Professional Credentialing Requirements list or are permitted by law to provide health care services in a professional capacity without holding a credential . Does this apply to staff or contractors of health care setting operators who work only remotely and do work like billing, medical records, or IT? An employee, contractor, or volunteer of a health care setting operator is not subject to the proclamation if they do not work in the health care setting , do not hold a credential listed in the Health care Professional Credentialing Requirements list, and are not otherwise permitted by law to provide health care services in a professional capacity without holding a credential. For example, a non -credentialed employee doing billing or IT support work exclusively from a remote location outside of a health care setting would not be subject to the vaccination requirement. If that employee works remotely and sometimes enters the heath care setting for work , they w ould be subject to the vaccine requirement. Health Care Providers/Workers FAQs Proof of Vaccination Status: What documentation do I need to provide to prove my vaccination status? If you work in a health care setting, you must provide proof of full vacci nation against COVID -19 to the operator of that health care setting.

I am a self -employed health care provider . How do I show I have complied with this requirement ? If you perform work in a health care setting , you are required to provide proof of your vaccination to the operator of that setting to continue working there after October 18, 2021 .

The proclamation does not provide an exemption for individuals who have previously been infected with COVID -19. Experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID -19 and recommend getting vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID -19. People are able to get sick with COVID -19 again after they've already had it. Studies have shown that vaccination provides a strong boost in protection in people who have recovered from COVID -19.

After October 18 , 2021, if you are covered by this proclamation and you have not provided the operator of the health care setting where you work with acceptable proof of full vaccination against COVID -19 or been approved for an accommodation , then the health care setting operator can no longer legally allow you to perform work for them . Failure to comply with the proclamation is a gross misdemeanor subject to the jurisdiction of law enforcement agencies. Violations may also result in civil enforcement action. Will the Department of Health verify I am vaccinated when I apply for or renew my health care credential? No. The operator of any health care setting where you work as an employee, volunteer, or contractor is responsible for verifying your vaccination status. Will my credential be suspended or revoked if I do not receive the vaccine?
