Once you know the cause and remove th e cause the illness will naturally go into remission. Don't believe that degenerative disease s and tumor activity or any other chronic illness you have is some kind of alien growth from planet Mars. It's normal body tissue that has changed and started to do something else. It's not a strange alien virus from outer space that landed in your body! Nature is not a fool and therefore if she switches on a mechanism, she has a reason for it. The approach at BUDWIG CE NTER is much like that of a wise gardener who does not cut off the weeds at the top but \"pull s them out by the roots\", because he knows that unless he gets the \"roots\" the weed will grow back. The same is true of degenerative diseases and tumor activity. We must remove the \"root\" cause otherwise a year or so later, sad to say it comes back. If you do d ecide to go down the road of chemotherapy, radiation and other traditional therapies, you will still need to do the complimentary, natural therapy, to truly remove the cause of the degenerat ive diseases and tumor activity and other diseases. Let's look at the three main causes of di sease and how to effectively remove it from the body and not just put a \"bandage\" on it: Cause No 1 - Virus/Fungus - Dr. Royal Rife was a microbiologist who knew that d egenerative diseases and tumor activity was caused by very uniq ue viral microbes which were inside of diseased cells. Dr.Rife called them BX and BY virus es. The area of the diseased cells favors an ideal environment for hosting fungus and once degen erative diseases and tumor activity reaches Stage III and IV there is usually both viru ses and fungi together. That is why some anti-degenerative diseases and tumor activity proto cols work on certain levels and not on others. Therefore the BUDWIG CENTER includes in all its progr ams the RIFE TIME device that will effectively de-vitalizes pathogens (parasites, fungi, bacteria, and viruses)... More on this later Cause No 2 - Toxins - The second major contributing factor of all dise ases are toxins. Toxins come from dangerous chemicals (in the workplace, ho me or garden). The late Dr. Hulda Clark who examined and treated thousands of patients with degenerative diseases and tumor activity stated that \"all degenerative disease pati ents have both isopropyl alcohol (which is a type of industrial wood alcohol found in many body care and household cleaning products) and the intestinal fluke (parasites, worms) in thei r liver\". Toxins are everywhere, in fact in just 1 cigarette that are some 3200 toxins! Heavy metal poisoning is common as is infection from root canals. If you have a root canal you would be wise to get the dentist to X-ray that area to see if there is any infection there. If for example the tooth is infected and corresponds to the breast (each tooth corresponds to a part of the bod y) this could be a contributing factor to breast cancer. Prolonger stress and negative emoti onal trauma is also toxic to the body. A whole chapter is devoted to this subject as researc h indicates up to 85% of chronic illnesses have a link to past or present negative emotional e xperiences. Hormone Replacement therapy and hormonal imbalance also is 'toxic' to t he body and there are several natural and totally effective alternatives solutions that are a vailable. www.BudwigCenter.com 3 Why do some people get degenerative diseases and tu mors or another major illnesses and others do not? We may all be exposed to parasites, viruses, fungus, as well as harmful toxins. However if we have good nutrition and a strong immu ne system, the body fights these intruders off. Our immune system is weakened by suc h things as chemotherapy, radiation, severe negative emotional shock (death in the famil y, divorce, family problems, financial setbacks, etc.) being overworked and run down over an extended period of time, pessimistic negative thinking most of the time, lack of rest, a nd improper nutrition that weakens the immune system. Ed Sopcak a Cancer researcher in Un ited States consulted with over 30,000 patients with degenerative diseases. He concluded \"most all the patients I have spoken with had a major stress in their life six months to 3 ye ars before they were diagnosed with the cancer\". Cause No. 3 Nutritional Imbalance - Consuming foods that are YIN (cold) is what most people are consuming today. Studies show that when a pers on is ill their 'inner temperature' is cool/cold and a YANG (warm) food choice is needed a ccording to Chinese Medicine (see YIN/YANG food chart later on in this Guide). Also refined vegetable oils like Trans fats (margarine, refined vegetable oils) used in deep fr ied foods (French fries, fried chicken, pastries) and processed foods (mayonnaise, refined vegetable oils) actually suffocate the cells when ingested, depriving the body of life giving ox ygen. When you see vegetable oils in the grocery store that are labeled 100% pure Corn Oil o r Sunflower seed oil, etc.; that is very misleading because it sounds good and healthy, but they are not. Why? Because the method of extraction that was used. Most commercial oil manufacturers use high heat and chemicals to extract the oils from the plants. Chemically processed fats and oils are not water- soluble and when bound to protein; they end up blocking circulation, damage heart action, inhibit the cell renewal process and impede the free flow of bl ood and lymph fluids. The bio-electrical action of the se areas slows down and may become completely paralyzed according to Dr. Budwig. Caustic corrosi ve chemicals such as sodium hydroxide (better known as Draino ) are used in the refining process. The vegetable oil is basically 'killed' by submitting it to extre mely high temperatures of up to 518 degrees F for as long as an hour. Removing these harmful pseudo (fake) fats from the diet and introducing true nutrition such as flaxseed oil and other cold pressed oils is a gi ant step forward in overcoming cancer and other common illnesses. Consume only cold pressed oils, such as flaxseed, o live, sunflower, virgin coconut (this is the best oil for cooking as it can take higher heat and does not break down) safflower, etc that are 'cold pressed' and/or 'virgin' or 'extra virgin'. www.BudwigCenter.com 4 Believe it or not many people living the western af fluent world suffer from malnutrition. Research and countless testimonials indicate that a ll illnesses including cancers are linked to nutritional deficiency, especially to the nervous s ystem; the result is a neurological deficiency. If a person has a degenerative disease virus/fungus in his body and at the same time consumes unhealthy foods (mostly acidic forming ins tead of alkaline forming), that creates an ideal environment for the virus/fungus to grow and spread. This nutritional deficiency causes structural changes in the amino acid, hormones, bio feedback communication, all cellular nutritional mechanisms, DNA instructions and replic ation, causing a change in cellular manufacturing instructions and supply. A regular consumption of white refined sugar, as in fizzy (soft) drinks (1 soft drink contains up to 10 teaspoons of white refined sugar), chips (crisps), store bought pastries, deep fried foods (French fries, donuts) are dangerous fake foods tha t cause severe damage to your health. Also prepared meats (hot dogs, sausages, bacon, ham ) fast foods, food additives, etc. need to be replaced with healthier choices. Most foods are cooked at 350 to 400 F, but whenever we cook our food over 105 F (40 Celsius) instead of st eaming our foods, we destroy many of the important enzymes. The BUDWIG CENTER protocol is correcting the proport ions of all the minerals so that they cause the correct electromagnetism in the body and provide the right material for the reactions to take place. Some patients are mystified as they have eate n healthy all their lives, exercised, never smoked or abused alcohol but are now with a deadly d isease. This could be due to other factors like; undue stress, excessive toxins in their environme nt and/or their digestive systems were not working properly to process the healthy foods they we re eating, etc. Welcome to the Budwig program The one or two-week healing session at the BUDWIG CENT ER gives you all the information you need to take control of your own healing and an opp ortunity to experience the protocol and receive first-hand answers to your questions, as well a s giving your body a powerful kick-start to initiate the healing process. Throughout your healin g process, remember that your greatest healer is yourself. The 1 or 2-week program at the BUDWIG CENTER does no t mean that the program only lasts 1 or 2 weeks! No from the day you enrol and right up to the day you recover your good health we are there to support you with emails, Newsletters, future VEGA tests and remedies and suggestions! The Budwig healing program consists of various aspects (explained in detail in this GUIDE) which are designed to detoxify the body and stimulate the immune system to help the body heal itself: When you arrive at the Budwig Center apartments whi ch are right next door to our Center, you will find the kitchen stocked with the basic healthy foods, such as the flaxseed oil, cottage cheese (Quark), whole grain rice, oat milk, Spelt pasta, St evia, cereals, honey, Tahini, Spelt bread, organic eggs, cold pressed oils, etc, etc. This saves you se arching for these basic foods in the nearby stores. All you will need to purchase are fresh vege tables, fruit and fish, etc., at the local markets. www.BudwigCenter.com 5 All the rooms are equipped with a blender (to make t he FSOCCheese mixture), rebounder (mini- trampoline) a blanket type sauna that you put on the bed and do a 20 minute session daily .. .instructions on how to use these a given later in this GUIDE BUDWIG CENTER is located about 15 minutes from the be ach and you are encouraged to walk there and back on a regular basis if your health per mits. Right from day one you will have the full body VEGA test and personalised remedies will be prescribed to aid your recovery. With our associating with BioMedic clinic, additional therapies are tailored to your individual circumstances after a co nsultation with Dr Marie Lopez MD (who is a medical as well as a naturopathic doctor). Each day at the clinic, you will receive various the rapies such as: sessions of Hyperthermia, Par biomagnetic acid/alkaline balancing, cold laser, IV infusions of homeopathic remedies, emotional healing therapies, a teaching session on the full Budw ig protocol, E Power belt cell energy restoration, PAPIMI ultra high magnetic machine ther apy, Reflexology machine therapy, Oxygen production by breathing in pine needle oil extract distillate, RIFE TIME sessions, etc. *************************************************** **************************** DR BUDWIG'S WORLD-FAMOUS (Budwig Muesli) The flaxseed oil and cottage cheese (quark) mixture - also known as Budwig Muesli - (together with the anti-degenerative disease diet) is the mainstay of Dr Budwig's protocol. Step 1 Blend 3 US Tbs (UK dessert spoons) of flaxseed oi l with 6 US Tbs low-fat Cottage cheese or Quark. (Maximum 2% fat. If there is too h igh a fat content the oil will not mix in and the muesli will not bring the oxygen to the cells.) Do not mix by hand. Use ONLY a hand-held immersion electric blender for up to a minute on low speed. If the oil does not disappear you may ne ed to add 2 or 3 US Tbs of milk or natural yogurt. The mixture should be like rich whipped cre am with no separated oil. Do not add anything else until the 'whipped cream' stage has b een reached. If you have a reaction to the dairy in the cottage cheese this might indicate a problem with your duodenum. Replace the cottage cheese wit h Soy yogurt or Soy milk for about 2 or 3 weeks and then the problem should clea r up. (Soy products are not recommended other than in this temporary situation. ) You might also try Kefir cottage cheese as an alternative. Dairy contains 'casein' w hich can cause inflammation and some people have a lactose intolerance which may be aggravated by consuming the FSOCC. And although Dr. Budwig'sprogram has severa l favorable testimonials from people with brain, breast, ovarian, lymphatic and p rostate cancer, because of these issues some prefer not to consume the FSOCC but to rely on all the other BUDWIG CENTER remedies and/or use an alternative to the FS OCC called Celltramax sold at: www.celltramax.com Or substitute with: 2 US Tbs of whey protein (Solgar cold processed brand) in water, or almond or oat milk , together with 3 capsules of Cod Liver or Krill Oil www.BudwigCenter.com 6 Step 2 Separately grind 2 US Tbs of whole flaxseeds in a coffee grinder and stir into the creamy flaxseed oil and cottage cheese mixture. NB Ground flax seeds become rancid within 20 minut es, so eat the recipe immediately and do not grind or store seeds ahead of when they are nee ded. Step 3 Add 1 teaspoon of honey (best is raw, unpasteurize d honey as it contains all the health- giving enzymes). You can also add organic raw nuts such as ground hemp seed, ground almonds, sunflowe r seed, pumpkin seed and brazil nuts (but not peanuts ). For variety try vanilla, cinnamon, or shredded coconut. Some people enjoy it with a dash of cayenne pepper ... be creative! /square4 Flaxseed oil must always be kept in the refrigerato r or it will keep for 12 months in the freezer. Arrange to purchase as directly as possib le from a manufacturer (like Barlean's who offer a discount for people with canc er so tell them you are using the Budwig Center protocol) or arrange with the local h ealth shop to keep a supply in the refrigerator. /square4 IMPORTANT The Budwig Muesli should NOT be made ahe ad of time and stored. Eat it within 20 minutes of preparation. The flaxseeds sho uld not be ground in advance. /square4 When following the BUDWIG CENTER protocol which inc ludes TRICAN, it is recommended you eat flaxseed oil and cottage cheese no more than ONCE a day , and at a separate time (at least 1 \u00bd hours apart). Sinc e dairy can cause inflammation, we do not recommend more dairy than absolutely necessa ry. /square4 Some people who find it hard to eat have half a por tion once a day. /square4 Occasionally people can feel nauseous after eating Budwig muesli in the morning. In this case try having it at lunchtime or in the even ing - of try some of the solutions to overcome nausea recommended in the FAQs in this boo k. /square4 Cottage cheese/quark can be frozen if necessary. Two appliances are needed with the Budwig Protocol (we provide th ese during your stay) 1 A coffee bean grinder to grind the whole brown f laxseeds 2 An immersion hand-held mixer (a stick-shaped mix er) to blend and bond the flaxseed oil and cottage cheese together Note Whenever Tablespoons (Tbs) are mentioned it is the standard US tablespoon (= 15 ml) which is the equivalent of the British dessert spoo n. (1 British Tablespoon is 18 ml). 16 US Tbs = 1 cup. REMEDIES AND THERAPIES THAT NULLIFY THE BUDWIG PROT OCOL Please do not add to the Budwig Center protocol any product on this list: Do NOT take Cesium chloride, Borax (except for a short time to overcome an infection), Coral Calcium, or other alkaline products or supplements (TRICAN is a lready properly pH balanced and these protocols would push TRICAN out of balance!) Do NOT take Protocel, Cantron, Entlev or Cancell, Eniva Vibe liquid (registered trademarks), no more than 12 apricot seeds per day. No Laetrile (Vitamin B17 injections), If you decide to do several sessions of infusions of Vitamin C stop consuming the Flaxseed oil and cottage cheese at the same time as they cancel each www.BudwigCenter.com 7 other out. If you take Protandim, wait for two hours after you have completed the Bud wig Diet for the day. *************************************************** **************** THE COMPLETE BUDWIG DIET Our program is not so much about doing without, or eating terrible tasting food, but adopting a wide variety of alternatives which are practical and often delicious (see recipes at the end of this Guide). Some basic guidelines for food preparation are: Steam your vegetables . Raw vegetables are good for you, but can be hard to eat and often hard to digest. Steaming vegetables is the best option as steamed vegetables release 5 times more vitamins than most raw vegetables. Add some YANG foods with it, such as curry, onions, garlic, ginger, cayenne, etc However, cooking food at temperatures of more than 105 F (41 Celsius) destroys important enzymes in the food. Most people put their ovens at 350 F so very little real food value is left. Boiling food is not much better as the water you th row down the drain has most of the vitamins in it. Invest in your health by investing in a Food Steamer http://www.amazon.co.uk/Steamers-Cookware-Kitchen-H ome Skins on most vegetables hold most of the vitamins and nu trients. Try to include them as part of your meal instead of discarding them . Just to illustrate that, an earthquake cut off a wealthy family from the rest of the popul ation and by the time the rescue workers arrived they had all died except the maid. They asked the maid how it was that she was still alive. The maid did not know bu t she said all we had to eat was potatoes, so they had me peel the potatoes and cook them. They would not give me any. I ate the peelings and they ate the potatoes! Fruit - instead of consuming fruit juices (which removes t he pulp), its better to simply eat the whole fruit with the pulp. All fruits are acceptable NO microwaving - Microwaving destroys many of the health-giving bene fits of food NO Teflon - When Teflon pans start to peel and the Teflon disap pears, it has gone into your food and therefore into your body. It is espec ially bad for the reproductive system. NO aluminium cooking ware or aluminium foil . We recommend and provide during your stay at Budwig Center enamel cooking ware. Sta inless steel, ceramic, cast iron, glass and corning cookware are fine. www.BudwigCenter.com 8 Avoid leftovers Food should be prepared fresh and eaten soon after preparation to maximize intake of health-giving electrons and enzy mes. You are more at risk with food poisoning from leftovers, which is something y ou especially don't want if you already weak and fighting a serious illness. (If ho wever it does happen, 6 drops of Lugol's iodine in the morning and then in the after noon should correct it swiftly.) AVOID THESE UNHEALTHY FOODS according to Dr Budwig NO pork - Pigs are toxic animals by nature of their diges tive system. The food they eats stays in the stomach for hours, ferments and becomes high ly toxic . Processed pork in such things as ham, sausages, hot dogs and bacon, are not only loaded with toxins but have additional harmful chemical food ad ditives (eg nitrates which are damaging to the prostate). We know that these foods taste good - 'toxins are indeed tasty ' - but they are dangerous and should be avoided espe cially if you have a serious illness. It is reported that Je ws and other cultures that avoid pork products for religious rea sons have very little arthritis which is connected to toxins and parasites, especially the roundworm Trichinella spiralis. We don't know how true this YouTube presentation is (may be pork from an third world country) but it shows someone pouring a cola drink over a pork chop and tapeworms start to come out af ter 2 minutes http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDBAG0KPLcs NO seafood - Fish with fins and scales are recommended, but no l obsters, clams, shrimp or any other fish with a hard shell. Just as pigs (like flies and vultures) are the cleaners of the earth, shell fish are cleaners of t he sea and retain a high quantity of toxins in their system. Eat fresh wild fish, not fa rmed fish. Limit consumption of Red Meats. Poultry (chicken, d uck, turkey) could be eaten once a week as they are very YANG (warm according to Chi nese medicine). Make sure its free range and organic. Avoid red meat that contains artificial hormones an d anti- biotics. Processed meats have several harmful pres ervatives. Obtain your protein mostly from plant sources (nuts and seeds and plant oils), organic free-range eggs and fresh wild fish with fins and scales. Hemp oil and hemp seeds (cold pressed) are particularly recommended because as well as contain ing all the essential amino acids and essential fatty acids necessary for human life, they also contain a rare protein known as globule edestins that is very similar to t he globulin found in human blood plasma. Once or twice a month some red meat (lamb is a good choice) from organic grass feed source would be acceptable. NO hydrogenated oils, NO trans-fats - Instead, cold-pressed sunflower seed oil or almost any cold pressed oils (including olive oil) are acceptable. Virgin coconut oil is a good choice when cooking because it is one of the f ew oils that does not break down under higher heat (although if you aim to steam mos t of your food there is very little need to heat food at higher temperatures or to cons ume too much fat). Those with pancreatic and liver issues may find coconut diffic ult to digest. (Coconut oil is also helpful as skin protection when sunbathing.) www.BudwigCenter.com 9 NO chips (crisps), deep fried foods (French fries, donuts ) NO store-bought pastries (make your own with our recipes) NO fizzy soft drinks A fizzy (soft) drink can contain up to 10 teaspoon s of white refined sugar. Similarly avoid fruit juices from concentrat e which also has a high sugar content and no remaining vitamins (also all fruit is YIN (c old). Avoid white bread and white pasta - Spelt bread and whole grain Spelt pasta are a better choice than wheat as many ill people have in tolerance to wheat or gluten. Our VEGA test can determine which foods you have intole rance to. Look for 'sprouted' Spelt or Rye bread, as the gluten is digested in th e sprouting process making the bread easier for you to digest. You can also eat whole R ye, Oat, and Multigrain bread that does not contain sugar. Sour dough breads are also a good alternative, but 'sprouted' bread is the first choice. Corn is discouraged because of mold and genetic mod ification issues. NO dairy products - other than the cottage cheese in the Budwig Muesl i. Occasionally some high quality cheese (such Gesha , Gouda, Herb Cheese, Sbrinz, Camembert, Gervais, Brie) or goat cheese (2 oz) is allowed as a treat - but if you can cut it out altogether, so much the better. (For the most enzymes and nutrients, don't heat the cheese and be sure not to buy processed ch eese.) Butter should be avoided, but is allowed in very small amo unts on a special occasion - and on that basis it is included in some of the Bud wig recipes. Instead make your own Oleolux (see Recipes at the end of this book) NO ice cream Make your own healthy Budwig Ice Cream instead (see recipe at the end of this booklet). Many commercial ice creams to day are simply chemical concoctions presented in appealing packaging design ed to sell a product that is not fit for human consumption. Everything from hydrogenated oils, high fructose corn syrup, and dry milk solids are used to produce something s till allowed to be called ice cream. Some pretty frightening sounding chemicals like car oxymethyl cellulose, butyraldehyde, and amyl acetate are additives in so me commercial ice creams. Diethyl glycol - a cheap chemical used in place of eggs - i s also used in anti-freeze and paint removers. Aldehyde C-17, flavoring for cherry ice cream, is a n inflammable liquid used in dyes, plastics, and rubber. Piperonal, used in p lace of vanilla, is a lice killer. Ethyl Acetate, a pineapple flavor, can also clean leather and textiles and its vapor has been known to cause chronic lung, liver, and heart damag e. Other unsavory ingredients contained in many of the most famous grocery store ice creams include: mono and diglicerides, disodium phosphate, glycol, sodium benzoate, polysorbate 80, potassium sorbate, starch and soy lecithin. Learn more: http://www.naturalnews.com/023849_ice_cream_ingredi ents NO sugar or molasses - It does not take very long for the tastebuds to st op craving sugar, but if you must have something sweet, Xylito l (only use Xylitol made from birch tress) or liquid Stevia are good options. (Stevia in powder form is sometimes mixed with other artificial sweeteners, so be careful). Cocoa and Chocolate - avoid all chocolate with refined sugar. Ideally make homemade chocolate fudge Tea - Black tea is YIN(cold according to Chinese medicine) and bes t to limit its consumption and favor Chai tea, Ginger and Jasmine tea www.BudwigCenter.com 10 Coffee - Although some reports show that coffee has some h ealth benefits there is an issue of toxins. Best to avoid or reduce to 1 cup per day NO soy milk or soy products (except for a little natural fermented soy sauce, or as a temporary solution if you are intolerant of cottage cheese in the Budwig Muesli). Many of the soy products available in the West have been treated with harsh shortcuts and are genetically modified. They can ha ve suppressive effects on the thyroid and, by extension, the immune system. They contain significant amounts of glutamate and have effects similar to MSG. Even tr aditionally-fermented soy products have a downside and are linked to various forms of neurological atrophy. Broad based population studies in China have indicated increase d incidence of Alzheimer-related syndromes in populations with the greatest consumpt ion of soy. In addition the phytic acid in soy can chelate (remove) calcium from the s ystem. Soy is also a thyroid inhibitor. NO processed foods - they contain unhealthy quantities of salt, sugar and preservatives. The Five Absolute Worst Foods Anyone Can Eat 1. Doughnuts 2. Soda 3. French fries 4. Chips (crisps) 5. Fried non-fish seafood Vegetarian diet? Dr Armin Grunewald, the nephew of Dr J Budwig, is c ontinuing her research with the Budwig Foundation and has introduced some updates. He does not agree that patients should have a wholly vegetarian diet. Raw vegetables are also ver y YIN (cold) but steam cooked Vegetables are much better for your health. He encourages the consumption of protein as the body is rebuilding and needs the energy and enzymes. Good sources of additional protein are fish (with fins and scales - which Dr Johanna Budwig als o recommended), organic free range (not antibiotic) eggs everyday is fine. There are also m any vegetarian sources of protein such as lentils, nuts and seeds. A vegetarian diet is often too YIN (cold) and ill patients need a YANG (warm) diet FOODS THAT PROMOTE HEALTH (allowed)... Nothing replaces natural food sources, and Dr Budwi g was in favor or letting 'food be your medicine and medicine be your food' (to quote the F ather of Medicine, Hippocrates). Everything included in the Budwig Daily Schedule is allowed and is positively good for you, such as asparagus and all fresh fruit and vegetable s (especially if organic). See below for positive information about some of these products. Start by favoring foods that are YANG. As per the YIN/YANG FOOD CHART, eat mostly food that are in the category of Neutral, Warm and Hot, especially if you are in an advanced stage of illness www.BudwigCenter.com 11 Herbs and Herbal teas - that are YANG are: Chai tea, Jasmine tea, Basil , cinnamon bark, clove, fennel seed, dandelion, fenugreek seed , ginger, spearmint, star anise, turmeric and thyme, Nuts and Seeds (raw unroasted) are fine. Favor those which are YA NG, ie. Chestnuts, pinenuts, pistachio nuts, walnuts (no peanuts becau se of fungus issues). Spelt pasta and sprouted grains in bread , such as Ezekiel or other sprouted bread products (the sprouting creates amino acids which b reak down the gluten). Potato bread, rye, pumpernickel, oatmeal are other choices . Most patients do better if they avoid wheat products. If you are gluten intolerant avoid rye and barley too. If you can tolerate wheat, make sure the flour is whole grain and unprocessed. In Europe you can purchase sprouted breads in health shops or at: http://www.auravita.com/search/Grain- SproutedBread.html?RefId=200&Adid =SRCH241314&kwid=241314 Unsweetened coconut - shredded --------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------- SUPPLEMENTS - THE MOST EFFECTIVE ONES TO TAKE Often our patients ask us which supplements are the most effective. Here is a list of the supplements we would recommend to all patients besi de the ones recommended by the VEGA test STEM CELL and TELEMERE SUPPORT Today, there is a quiet revolution in full swing al l around us that some are calling the \"greatest discovery of our time\"! In a University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine st udy, scientist found that mice injected with stem cells appeared to have 'sipped from the fountain of youth\". Using two groups of mice, the ones injected with stem cells in comparison, sh owed improved health and saw a three- fold increase in their life span! NOW YOU CAN TURN BACK THE CLOCK - ON DISEASE AND AGING Underneath, I According to Johnny Huard, a stem-cell expert at th e McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Pittsburgh, finding this \"cellular cont rol switch\" inside our cells and understanding how I can influence it to extend our \"health span\" and reverse disease is the greatest discovery of our time. Researchers from the Univers ity of California at San Francisco to Harvard University all agree that this breakthrough will change life as we know it. www.BudwigCenter.com 12 Did you know that inside every one of your cells, t here are hibernating bits of DNA that can replace old, disea sed cells with new, healthy cells? Many scientists believe that ab ility allows you to reverse virtually all chronic diseases, as w ell as allow you to reach 100-years-old without showing any signs of aging. Maybe you watched Diane Sawyer reading the nightly news on ABC , announcing to the world the results of a breakthr ough Harvard study that made old mice young again. At the beginning of this experiment the mice were o ld in every measurable feature. These mice had lost their intelligence. Every one of them had performed poorly on the standard memory tests like remembering their way out of a ma ze or where their food or water was. And tests showed that they all had atrophied or shr unken brains. As with humans when we get old, they had lost their desire for sexual activity and had become infertile. Their hair had changed from glossy and y outhful to dull and gray (sound familiar?). Their vision was dimming, with the same kind of los s of peripheral vision that we see in humans with age. Not surprising considering the mice were the equiva lent of humans in their 80s and 90s. They were injected with stem cells and then, as if by miracle, each and every one of these signs of aging was completely reversed. They became sexually potent again, and the females actually became fertile and produced healthy offspr ing again \u2014 at the equivalent of a very old age, which is totally unheard of. Not only did their intelligence come back, it rever ted them back to their youth. Yes, and even the atrophy of the brain \u2014 the shrinkage \u2014 reversed and even their hair became shiny and thick again. And their eyesight was restored. According to the tests, their shrunken organs, like their spleens and even their testes and brain, grew in size. Key organs functioned better, and the mice got their sense of smell back. The males also produced new sperm cells, and their mates gave birth to larger litters. With all these incredible improvements the mice went on to l ive long, healthy lives.1 All these 'miracles' happened because Dr. Ronald De Pinho, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and director of applied cancer scien ce at the Boston-based Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, \"flipped a switch\" inside their c ells. Institutions like Harvard, the University of Califo rnia at Berkeley and dozens of others have revealed the details of how it all works in prestig ious journals like the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and Nature. They've even recognized the researchers who made the discovery. But it has not become 'mainstream' knowledge as of yet. www.BudwigCenter.com 13 The theory is that the shorter your telomeres, the \"older\" your cells and therefore your body act, regardless of your actual age. Now by slowing the loss of your telomeres, you may be able to extend your lifespan and feel younger longer... and most importantly wipe out disease in the process. But slowing the loss of your telomeres is just the first step. To get the results Dr. DePinho achieved with the mice, you need to go one step further. There's a \"switch\" in your cells that actually triggers your telomeres to regrow and get longer. And that's how Dr. DePinho worked his magic. This switch is an enzyme called telomerase, and it programs your telomeres to get longer. You see from the chart that at the end of each stra nd of DNA is a little bit of genetic material called a te lomere (TEE-loh-meer). The Telomere are the \"caps\" at the end of each chromosome. As you well know your chromosomes are the blueprint s of life and are packed together in the nucleus, or center, of every one of your cells. The length of these telomeres determines how old or young your cells act. As your cells divide, the bad news is that the telomeres get shorter, and your body produces cells that are olde r, weaker, and more decrepit. Now cheer up because regardless of your family hist ory or current state of health, these bits of DNA \u2014 whe n turned on \u2014 can replace any sick cells with younger , disease-free cells. After Dr. DePinho and his coll eagues had taken mice and made them young again, he said the study produced results that were the equivalent of finding the famed \" fountain of youth\" that Ponce de L\u00e9on searched and never found. The \"switch\" Dr. DePinho turned on, is a gene inside your cells' DNA . The discovery that made this new therapy possible w as the very discovery that won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2009. Three Year Clinical Trial Turns Back the Clock on D isease and Aging Dr. Al Sears M.D. who operates a clinic in Royal Pa lm Beach, Florida has been testing these very same techniques with a select group of his own patients for three years. Here is what Dr. Sears had to report: \"With the first \"activator\" de signed to turn on your \"fountain of youth\" gene, we've helped an elite group of patients \"grow younger\" as they age. I call them \"elite\" because the cost of this therapy was VERY expensive when it first became available. I had www.BudwigCenter.com 14 high-level politicians, Hollywood stars, real estat e tycoons and famous doctors coming to my clinic for this first-ever, age-reversing therapy. During the course of their treatment, we saw remarkable changes. Changes like: Incredibly fast and longer-lasting fat loss... Sharper eyesight and improved vision... Thin, graying hair turning black and lustrous... Increased muscle mass and increased testosterone... Bigger lung volume, with increased endurance and ox ygen delivery... Elimination of joint pain and improved flexibility. ..

J. Crary, who states, \"Selenium is the most potent broad-spectrum anticarcinogenic agent that has yet been discovered.\" That's right. The trace mineral, selenium, has been shown in multiple studies to be an effective tool i n warding off various types of cancer, including breast, esophageal, stomach, prostate, li ver, and bladder cancers. The scientific and medical literature is filled with studies that demo nstrate selenium's anticancer effects in humans. For example, in an epidemiological study, D r. Raymond Shamberger categorized the states and cities in the USA according to whether t here was high, medium, or low selenium availability in the diet. He demonstrated an invers e association between selenium availability and age-adjusted mortality for all types of cancer. To put it simply, the more selenium available, the lower the levels of cancer. In a worldwide study Dr. Gerhard Schrauzer, M.D., P h.D. (professor of medical chemistry at the University of California at San Diego) analyzed the blood-bank data from 27 countries around the world. He compiled a list in order of th eir blood selenium levels disclosing an inverse proportional relationship to cancer inciden ce, reporting specifically that areas with low levels of selenium in the diet had higher level s of leukemia and cancers of the breast, colon, rectum, prostate, ovary, and lung. In other words, the number one nation in blood selenium level (Japan) had the lowest cancer level (and consistently has rated highest in longevity) while the number two selenium level nati on had the second lowest cancer rate, etc. etc. It is an essential component of a powerful antioxid ant manufactured by the body. This antioxidant, called glutathione peroxidase, defends specifically against peroxides, a type of free radical that attacks fats. Like other antioxid ants, glutathione peroxidase also reduces the risk of developing cancer and heart diseases and st imulates the immune system's response to infections. This important enzyme is selenium depen dent, with each molecule of the enzyme containing four atoms of selenium. www.BudwigCenter.com 15 \"It contributes towards the death of cancerous and pre-cancer cells. Their death appears to occur before they replicate, thus helping stop canc er before it gets started,\" according to the late Dr. James Howenstine in A Physician's Guide to Natural Health Products That Work. Selenium research over the past 20 years has focuse d heavily on a novel form of selenium: methylselenocysteine (MSC). A relatively simple org anic selenium compound, MSC is formed naturally in various plants, including garlic, broc coli, wild leeks, and onions grown on high selenium soil. A new compound for chemoprevention of breast cancer ,\" Nutrition & Cancer 2001, 40:12-17) Methylselenol is also known to inhibit angiogenesis (creation of new blood vessels) in beginning cancer tumors and represents the safest a nd most effective anti-cancer form of selenium available today. One of the most important blind studies on selenium and cancer was a double-blind intervention trial conducted by Dr. L.C. Clark (and colleagues) at the University of Arizona Cancer Center. When all the r esults were tabulated, it became clear that the selenium-treated group developed almost 66% few er prostate cancers, 50% fewer colorectal cancers, and about 40% fewer lung cancer s as compared with the placebo group. Only 200 mcg daily supplementation of selenium has been documented to dramatically reduce cancer incidence, when in a grown, food-form ed variety. A daily intake of 400 mcg was recommended by Dr. Schrauzer, mentioned earlier in this article. A daily intake of 600 mcg has been documented for residents of Japan on a traditi onal Japanese diet where cancer incidence is lowest and longevity is the greatest i n the world. If every man, woman, and child supplemented with 200 mcg of selenium, we could alm ost wipe out the cancer epidemic over night! Some of the best natural sources of selenium are Br azil nuts, garlic, broccoli sprouts, and brussel sprouts. All of these foods contain seleniu m in the form of MSC. Although garlic has the greatest concentration of MSC, you are not like ly to eat enough of it to produce the desired results, so Brazil nuts, broccoli sprouts, and brussel sprouts are your best choices.

Also a very good remedy when the patient is experiencing Cachexia . (this is a condition where the liver is not work ing properly and the person just gets very thin and wastes away) This le ads to the body correcting the DNA instructions which then start to produce undamaged (healthy) cells. When the body's environmental factors are balanced, the body no lon ger manufactures diseased cells; existing diseased cells are no longer able to exist in the c orrected environment and die in a natural manner and are eventually replaced by normal cells. The BUDWIG CENTER protocol uses natural food-based r emedies such as TRICAN that shocks the body's autonomous nervous system with high doses of minerals and Vitamins E and D. This blast of ultra-high nutrition corrects the cell DNA which will now start producing healthy cells instead of distorted and diseased cells. www.BudwigCenter.com 16 Take TRICAN. immediately before, during or after midday and evenin g meals - or with some (non- citrus) fruit. Do not consume on an empty stomach. Do not consume with citrus fruit or citrus juices. Make up the TRICAN by putting \u00bd scoop or more (scoop supplied in the TRICAN tub) into a drinking glass, mixing it to make a paste with a small amount o f pure water, and then adding enough pure water (approx 1 cup) t o make a drinkable consistency. (You can also try using a Protein shaker or Cocktail mixer.) Making the TRICAN in advance and keeping i t in the fridge can help soften the minerals in the powder. Xylitol or Stevia can be added to tast e. Drink the TRICAN mixture slowly (if you drink it fa st it can cause gas and pain). If initially TRICAN is not to your taste, then immediately after taking it you can eat something or drink some of your cider vinegar and honey mixture or something to mask the flavour. You can also take TRICAN with a small amount of home-blended fresh fruit juice, mad e with a banana and a few grapes or berries, or any thin-skinned fruit ('if the skin is thin, leave it in') such as kiwi, apple, apricots, peaches, grapes, berries, nectarines and pears. Man y enjoy TRICAN with cold water, ice and a banana (pre-blend the banana in water then add to t he TRICAN mixture).

It has been shown that light exposure at night suppresses your production of melatonin. This, in turn, can lead to increased risk of cancer. Your b edroom should be 'totally dark'. Melatonin is a hormone which modulates our neurotra nsmitters. It is produced from the amino acid tryptophan by the pineal gland (a pea-si zed gland in the brain) when the lights go out at night. It's the reason you get sleepy when i t's dark. Melatonin also is produced by the retina and, in vastly greater amounts, by the gastr ointestinal system. Melatonin levels peak during the night but also increase after eating, wh ich explains why you get sleepy after a meal. Melatonin is highly fat soluble and also water solu ble, thus enabling it to easily penetrate the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. According to Dr. Eileen Lynch, \"Melatonin's amphiph ilicity, or ability to both absorb and repel water - in conjunction with its ability to act as a weak preventive antioxidant, a weak metal ion chelator, and in certain circumstances, a direct fr ee radical scavenger - enables it to counteract oxidative stress within the chaotic tumo r microenvironment.\" www.lef.org/magazine/mag2004/jan2004_report_melaton in_01.htm Due to the fact that over 75% of cancer cells exhib it oxidated DNA damage, the statement by Dr. Lynch above is very important. As a free radica l scavenger, melatonin rivals vitamin C in its ability to counteract the oxidating effects of toxi ns. Not only does melatonin act as a free radical scavenger; it also is a hormone that kills cancer cells! www.BudwigCenter.com 17 According to Dr. Lynch, \"Melatonin plays a critical role in the host defense system against cancer's progression by activating the cytokine sys tem, which exerts growth-inhibiting properties, and by stimulating the cytotoxic activi ty of macrophages and monocytes.\" Multiple studies have indicated the cytotoxic effec ts of melatonin, including a 2002 article in Tumor Biology published by Dr. K. Winczyk and colle agues entitled \"Possible involvement of the nuclear RZR/RORalpha receptor in the antitumor action of melatonin on murine Colon 38 cancer.\" In another article by Dr. P. Lissoni and c olleagues in the 1989 European Journal of Cancer & Clinical Oncology, melatonin has also been shown to boost the immune system. In his 2004 report to the American Association for Can cer Research, Dr. David E. Blask reported that melatonin puts breast cancer cells to sleep, a nd it also slows breast cancer growth by 70%. Breast cancers get \"turned on\" by fats); however, melatonin interacts with linoleic acid. At a news conference, Dr. Blast stated, \"This breast cancer rev-up mechanism gets revved down by melatonin. Nighttime melatonin is a relevant anticancer signal to human breast cancers. Ninety percent of h uman breast cancers have specific receptors for this signal.\" Blask's team exposed lab mice with human breast can cers to constant light. Guess what happened: tumor growth skyrocketed. Dr. Blask asser ts, \"With constant light, tumors grow seven times faster and soak up incredible amounts o f linoleic acid. During the day, the cancer cells are awake and linoleic acid stimulates their growth. At night cancer cells go to sleep. When we turn on lights at night for a long time, we suppress melatonin and revert back to the daytime condition.\" www.webmd.com/content/article/7 1/81159.htm Additional research corroborates the fact that mela tonin can kill many different types of human tumor cells, including a groundbreaking 2000 study performed by three Russian physicians, Riabykh, Nikolaeva, and Bodrova. A repo rt by Dr. R.M. Sainz et al in the 2003 issue of Cellular Molecular Life Science indicates that m elatonin is a naturally produced cytotoxin which can induce tumor cell death (apoptosis). Inte restingly, Dr. Lissoni also discovered that melatonin inhibits angiogenesis, which is the devel opment of new tumor blood vessels. (Dr. P. Lissoni, et al, Neuroendocrinology Letter, 2001) A growing body of evidence linking increased light at night (LAN) to certain types of cancer has led researchers to suspect it could be connected to the steady increase in cases of childhood leukemia. Scientists presenting research at the Fir st International Scientific Conference on Childhood Leukemia said that light at night and wor king night shifts (which disrupts the body's circadian rhythm, or internal clock) have both been associated with an increased risk of breast and colorectal cancer. You have to wonder if the rapid growth of televisio n and video games over the last 30 years has contributed to the growth in childhood leukemia . Children are staying up later and later, and this LAN may be suppressing the natural product ion of melatonin that would otherwise fight the free radicals that damage DNA and lead to cancer. Is it just a coincidence that www.BudwigCenter.com 18 childhood leukemia has literally exploded at the sa me time as the escalation of television and video games? \"Compared with other working women, female night-sh ift workers have about a 50% greater risk of developing breast cancer,\" says William Hru shesky of Dorn Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Columbia, S.C. That presumably explains w hy the original Harvard study of nurses, which was led by Eva S. Schernhammer, found that sh ift workers had an elevated risk of breast cancer. (Science News, 1/17/01, p. 317) More recently, Schernhammer and her Harvard colleague Susan E. Hankinson found that women who h appen to have above-average melatonin concentrations are relatively unlikely to develop breast cancer. \"Those with higher levels seem to have lower breast cancer risk,\" said Schernhammer. Melatonin should probably be taken 30-45 minutes be fore sleeping. You can find melatonin in any health food store. Ch erries are a good natural source of melatonin, thus they are a great bedtime snack. - Source Chapter 12 - Fantastic Foods & Super Supplements Cancer - Step Outside the Box pag e 326 CHLOROPHYLL One of the best health benefits we gain from followin g a raw, living foods diet are the numerous health benefits fro m chlorophyll. We recommend you add some to your leafy green drinks, carrot juice or simply drink with water. Or if you do not have time to make vegetable juices, \u00bd glass of pure c hlorophyll in water or juice is an excellent daily option What is Chlorophyll? Chlorophyll is a naturally occu rring molecule that gives plants their green color. Chlorophyll is also the molecule that is respon sible for facilitating one of the most incredibly miraculous processes on earth - the process of photosynt hesis. Photosynthesis is the process that converts sunlight energy, water and carbon dioxide i nto our primary source of fuel - glucose. All animals and humans obtain their life-sustaining energy supply form plants, making photosynthesis to be (one of) the sources of all life. Without plan ts there would be no life. Chlorophyll - The Green Blood of Plants One of the most interesting aspects of chlorophyll is how closely it resembles our red blood cells, known as hemoglobin, the pigment that gives our blood its red color as well as oxygen- carrying capacity. We had a patient at the BUDWIG C ENTER that needed an operation but the doctors told her that they would not be able to do so unless she accepted a blood transfusion, being her hemoglobin count was too low. The patien t did not want a blood transfusion due to the high risks involved. Instead she drank \u00bd glass of chlorophyll and in three days her red blood count was normal and the operation went ahead without the blood transfusion. The hemoglobin of the red blood cell and the chlorophyl l of the plant are virtually identical in molecular structure. Chlorophyll is a Blood Cleans er, Blood Builder and Oxygen Booster. Chlorophyll delivers a continuous energy transfusio n into our bloodstream, replenishing and increasing red blood cell count. And since hemoglob in carries oxygen to our cells, increasing www.BudwigCenter.com 19 hemoglobin thereby increases the ability of red blo od cells to carry oxygen and delivers us increased levels of oxygen - and this is a very goo d thing. All these benefits direct effects on strengthening our immune system and enhancing overa ll energy levels and wellbeing. Healthy blood flow and an abundance of oxygen also help the body to cleanse itself of toxic impurities, lending to chlorophylls detoxification properties. Chlorophyll has also been shown to improve the detrimental effects of radiation, an d has also been linked to disease prevention. Chlorophyll binds with toxins like heav y metals and helps remove them from the body. Chlorophyll can also stimulate bowel movement s and is a great aid in colon cleansing. IODINE (Lugol's) Dr. Brownstein specializes in thyroid issues (energy, we ight loss or gain) and tests his patients and found that over 95% of them were deficient in iodin e. Many of his patients have seen 3, 4 or more specialists (endocrinologists) who cannot figure out th eir health issues, specifically the thyroid. All cells in the body need iodine for proper functioning . Dr. Brownstein believes that iodine deficiency is a major cause of breast cancer and other diseases of the reproductive organs such as ovarian, uterus and prostrate cysts and cancers. Accord ing to many researchers, including eye doctor and nutritional expert Dr. Gary Price Todd, at least three eye diseases are associated with hypothyroidism (under-functioning thyroid): macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. Along with the effect it has on the eyes, it can also contribute to many other physical ailments and diseases. Most people who suffer from cold hands and feet are iodine deficient. Put 3 drops of Lugol's iodine in water or tea and o nce a week paint Lugo's iodine over any area of the skin the size of about 5 cm. If it get s itchy more to another areas for a few days. Check 24 hours later before you shower to see if th e iodine has disappeared or not. Once the iodine no longer disappears you can stop painting. It means your iodine level is okay. If you are putting 3 drops of iodine in water or tea each day then stop that as well. Two months later start up again. Stomach pains, Urine Infections, Salmonella, e-coli ( which often causes stomach pain) - Drink a glass of water to which 6 drops of Lugos Iodine has been added in the morning and 6 drops again in the evening. Usually in one or two days the problem is solved. GINGER People with chronic illnesses, indicates that their body is too Yin (cold) from a yin and yang Chinese Medicine balance perspective says Dr. Chang of Taiwan. It also means that the best results of healing will often occur with the use of more yang therapies, diets and healing methods. In sum, then, by assigning a food a value as hot or cold, we mean that a heating food has the capacity to increase the metabolism of the body (wh atever they may be). Conversely, a cold food slows down metabolism. GINGER - Chinese Medicine recommends high doses of fresh gin ger root and ginger root powder . Aromatic, pungent and spicy, ginger adds a specia l flavor and zest to stir fries and www.BudwigCenter.com 20 many fruit and vegetable dishes. Ginger's benefits as a healing food are well-known in Asia where it is frequently called \"the universal medici ne.\" Ginger is regarded as an excellent \"carminative\" (a substance which promotes the elimi nation of intestinal gas) and \"intestinal spasmolytic\" (a substance which relaxes and soothes the intestinal tract). Ginger's anti- vomiting action has been shown to be very useful in reducing the nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Ginger's effectiveness as a digestive ai d is due largely to its active phytonutrient ingredients: \"gingerols\" and \"shogaols.\" These subs tances help to neutralize stomach acids, enhance the secretion of digestive juices (stimulat ing the appetite), and tone the muscles of the digestive tract. But that's not all. Both ginge rols and shogaols have been shown to fight cancer as well. Gingerols are phytonutrients respon sible for ginger's distinctive flavor. Scientific research has been shown that gingerols h ave antibacterial properties to inhibit the growth of \"helicobacter pylori,\" involved in the de velopment of gastric and colon cancer and suppress the growth of human colorectal carcinomas. Lab experiments presented by Dr. Rebecca Lui (and colleagues from the University of Michigan) at the 97th Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer showed that gin gerols kill ovarian cancer cells by inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) and phag ocytosis (self-digestion). In a 2007 study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food C hemistry, Dr. Chung-Yi Chen (and colleagues in the American Chemical Society) presen ted compelling evidence that ginger's shogaols effectively induce apoptosis in cancer cel ls. A 2007 Rutgers University study supported the cancer-fighting properties of both sh ogaols and gingerols. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf0624594 Ginger has been shown to reduce the stickiness of b lood platelets and may thereby reduce the risk of atherosclerosis. It is an outstanding s ource of manganese, magnesium, potassium, copper, and vitamin B6. Ginger is one of world's he althiest foods to be consumed freshly grated, dried ground, or as a tea. Remember that th e phytonutrients in ginger are heat sensitive, so for maximum effectiveness, you should eat fresh ginger root and/or take a ginger supplement (such as ginger root powder or ginger ex tract). In 2010, a man named Bill, a former Stage IV cancer patient who believes he cured his cancer with ginger. For a 150 pound person, Bill recommend s taking between four and six grams of ginger root powder per day. The ginger root should be taken for one to three days. His exact words are, \"I had previously been using ginger root powder in 500mg capsules for stomach upset. But then tried it successfully at a higher t han label dosage instead of antibiotic. When prostate cancer spread to and blocked my colon, I t ried ginger. I took up to six capsules, four times a day . I was very lucky. It worked!\" Adults - start off with 2 capsules with each meal a nd work up to 6 or 8 capsules of Ginger root per meal for a total of 18 to 24 per day. It would also be good to consume some fresh cut Ginger root raw, unheated with your food. Instead of capsules you can mix ginger powder directly into your food (try different combinations to see what suits you best, such as mixing in with the FSOCCheese or guacamole, etc) 1 teaspoon o f fresh Ginger powder equals 3 capsules Children and light weight people - reduce this dos age by half. Always work up slowly giving the body time to adjust.

Let us also assume that the patient's temperature is 97.6\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Most people know that the \"average\" body temperature in healthy adults is given as 98.6\u00b0 (37 \u00ba Celsius) www.BudwigCenter.com 22 We may assume that 98.6\u00b0 is the actual optimum temp erature for healthy functioning of the body. Lesser or higher temperatures are signs that the metabolism is disordered. So, if the reading was 96.6 o, it would mean that the person's temperature was two degrees below the normal average. So what? We realize that life is carried on within rather narrow limits of temperature--95\u00b0 to 105\u00b0, that if the temperature goes outside those li mits for any extended time, life will end. Therefore, a temperature two degrees below normal m eans one that is two degrees deficient within the ten degrees that sustains life--or that the body is operating at 20 percent lowered efficiency. If you tried to operate any machine wit h 20 percent of its power source gone, the other parts would become stressed and overheated, a nd the machine would break down and wear out much sooner than if it were operating at 1 00 percent of its energy levels. http://www.origin-point-medicine.org/#!psoriasis-for -42-years/c1j93 Among healing methods, the most yang are those invo lving heat and dryness . Dry Infrared saunas, hyperthermia, fever therapy, sweating, heating herbs like ginger and burdock, coffee enemas, hot baths, exposure to the sun, Far Infrared he at lamps (do not use regular infrared lamps ....only use FAR Infrared lamps) and 1 day fasting are examples. Other are chiropractic manipulation, biofeedback, acupuncture, acupressure, some psychotherapy such as 'Tapping' or also called EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), and s ome color therapy with reddish, orange or yellow light. At the BUDWIG CENTER you will benefit from Hyperthermia, the Therapeutic Healing blanket and sauna therapy as well as Red light therapy which assists the first chakra and organs such as the liver, kidneys and adrenal glands. We rec ommend herbs that are more yang, such as ginger, burdock, dandelion, milk thistle, skullcap, n ettles and black radish. This is exactly what most people need. Since most bod ies today are yin, most illness has a yin cause at its basis. For example, a friend is a cancer counselor who has observed the results of many alternative cancer therapies. She reports poor er results with the Gerson therapy and related approaches that rely on raw foods and juices . This therapy used to offer excellent results. Most likely, this is because more bodies were more yang at the time Dr. Gerson developed the therapy in the 1920s and 1930s. Yin therapy may ge t rid of tumors which are yang, but cannot fully rebuild a body that is more yin as does VITAMIN D3 An ever growing number of studies show that vitamin D has tremendous protective effects against a variety of different cancers, including p ancreatic, lung, ovarian, breast, prostate, and skin cancers. For example, a 2007 study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine12 concluded that a serum 25(OH)D level of more than 33 ng/mL was associated with a 50 percent lower risk of colorectal cancer. Another 2007 study published in the American Journa l of Clinical Nutrition found that after four years of follow up, cancer-free survival was 7 7 percent higher in women who received 1,100 IU vitamin D and 1,450 mg calcium per day, co mpared to those who received either a placebo or calcium by itself. According to Carole B aggerly, founder of GrassrootsHealth, as much as 90 percent of ordinary breast cancer may in fact be related to vitamin D deficiency. Breast cancer has even been described as a \"vitamin D deficiency syndrome,\" much like the commoncold and seasonal flu. www.BudwigCenter.com 23 Getting enough Vitamin D is vital, providing energy and enhancing the immune system. Many who lack energy are low on Vitamin D and a lack of it may contribute to degenerative diseases and tumors. There are more degenerative diseases and tumors (and MS) in the hi gher latitudes of the North because weaker sunlight prod uces less vitamin D. Most people don't get enough vitamin D from the sun, even in the south. V itamin D has been used to treat breast, prostate and other degenerative diseases and tumors . Vitamin D is really not a vitamin it is a steroid hormone, with a wide array of bioactive pro perties. Some health practitioners recommend 4000 to 10,000 units a day on an ongoing basis and others suggest 50,000 units a day for short periods of time. Be sure to take a little Vitamin K as well (see dosage on the bottle) which, according to studies, is essential for the proper absorption of high doses of Vitamin D. BEE POLLEN Bee pollen contains trace amounts of minerals and vita mins, is very high in protein and carbohydrates, and contains all the ingredients necessa ry for a balanced diet. Twenty-two nutrients required by the human body are found in th is \"perfect\" food, including all of the Bcomplex vitamins, vitamin C, D, E, K, and Beta Caro tene (vitamin A), plus numerous minerals, enzymes and coenzymes, plant-source fatty acids, car bohydrates, proteins, and 22 amino acids (including all eight \"essential\" amino acids that the body cannot manufacture for itself). Needless to say, bee pollen is one of the most complete foods a vailable. According to researchers at the Institute of Apicultu re, Taranov, Russia, \"Honeybee pollen is the richest source of vitamins found in Nature in a singl e food. Even if bee pollen had none of its other vital ingredients, its content of rutin alone would j ustify taking at least a teaspoon daily, if for no other reason than strengthening the capillaries. Poll en is extremely rich in rutin and may have the highest content of any source, plus it provides a high content of the nucleics RNA and DNA.\" www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com/bee.htm NOTE: Do not give bee pollen to infants under 18 mon ths old. ASTRAGALUS Astragalus is excellent for the following reasons: boosts the immune system Doubled survival rate of patients undergoing radiot herapy treatment according to MD Anderson benefits liver function and used for hepatitis reduces side-effects of chemotherapy reduces metastic spread and increases survival time s. Helps with heart disease, high blood pressure, diab etes and respiratory infections Is a general tonic and to treat burns and abscesses Original Chinese studies dated back to 1981, when a study by Hou et al showed that Astragalus taken orally induced greater quantities of interferon and leukocytes in the blood stream. With cancer you have a two-fold problem, t he immune system is weak, BUT .......the cancer evades the immune system because of the low immune system response capacity. But, www.BudwigCenter.com 24 not only does it increase the number of various whi te cells and in particular the \u00b4hunter\u00b4 T- cells it also helps identify the viruses, bacteria and other rogue cells. The University of Texas has shown that Astragalus seems to be an adaptogeni c herb \u00b4offering up\u00b4 viruses, bacteria and even cancer cells to be seen by the immune system. In a 1994 Italian study (Morazzoni, Bombardelli) br east cancer patients were given a combination of Iigustrum and Astragalus. Patients g iven this mix showed a decline in mortality from 50% to 10%. In another study of patients with advanced non-smal l-cell lung cancer all undergoing chemotherapy, the group taking the dual herb mix sh owed an average life span increase of 130%. In China, Astragalus is widely used in the treatmen t of hepatitis. It seems to reduce toxin levels significantly, boost interferon levels and i nhibit viral protein expression whilst having little or no effect on normal DNA. (Zhang 1995, Fan 1996) One extremely important conclusion from several US studies is that Astragalus seems to help the immune system differentiate between healthy cel ls and rogue cells, thereby boosting the body\u00b4s total \u00b4cancer fighting system\u00b4. One effect o f this is the added benefit of improving the effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy trea tments. In Chinese hospitals Astragalus is now routinely used to help people recover from t he negative effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.There are no known conflicting effects with drugs. Astragalus should be taken with meals at a total intake of 2,000 to 3,000 mgs per day. Other immune boasting supplements that could be tak en after chemotherapy and radiation are: Cat\u00b4s claw, Donald's tumors gone in just 4 weeks! Diane with stage IV breast tumor goes into remission Carol with unsightly, massive open, and oozing cance r in her whole left breast explored nearly every option she could for two years, then she started an artemesia derivative and one month later showed exceptional healing. Has been able to kill 98% of breast degenerative cell s in 16 hours. Artemisinin is a natural chinese herb that aggressivel y fights tumors. In a recent study published by Life Sciences, they reported \" it was found that a rtemisinin (the derivative), coupled with Iron, can kill 98% of breast cancer cells in 16 hours\". Donald, a 47-year-old mechanic who is in great shape had a newly diagnosed lymphoma and came to see Dr. Rowen just after his oncologist had biopsied the tumor. There was an ugly egg-sized mass on the left side of his head with a gaping hole from the biopsy and an angry redness from inflammation. www.BudwigCenter.com 25 Here is what By Robert Jay Rowen M.D. reported: \"Imm ediately put him on a derivative of this Chinese herb, and he took it for two weeks. At the end of that time, the lump developed a little depression in the center, but the perimeter had grow n just slightly. Dejected that it didn't significantly regress, he elected to stop further use of the product and take a \"wait and see\" approach. Four weeks later, I received a call from D onald. The tumor was gone! Returning with his wife and a big smile a few days later, I couldn't bel ieve my eyes. The skin was smooth, no mass was present, and the angry redness was fading fast. At about the same time, I continued to follow a lon g-term patient, a delightful 47-year-old female with stage-4 breast cancer. Diane was diagnosed only tw o years before with the promise of \"we got it all\" at her mastectomy. When she came to me, s he had developed metastases in her spine, which caused her to limp. ....After a short course of ar temisinin derivatives, she reported back to me that physically she couldn't tell she had ever had cancer. She felt totally well. The CT scan showed regression, but there was no way to tell if th e remaining lesion was a tumor or healing scar tissue. Results like this with absolutely no toxicit y are simply amazing by any standards, convention or unconventional. Carol came to see me with an unsightly, massive open, and oozing cancer engulfing what had been her whole left breast. She had been fighting the can cer for two years and, convinced on her own that doing conventional therapy was a death sentence , she explored nearly every option she could. She started an artemesia derivative and sent me photos one month later showing exceptional healing.\" To date, with the exception of patients very near d eath, taking artemisinin or derivatives have stabilized, improved, or remitted every cancer patie nt that followed my suggestions\" says Dr. Rowen. Artemisinin also has remarkable anti-inflammat ory and anti-parasitic properties. They also found that artemisinin cures malaria almost 100 p ercent of the time. What is Artemisinin? Artemesia or Artemisinin is a simple plant that gro ws in Southeast Asia and it goes by different names, such as has been used it for years to treat intestinal parasites. The World Health Organization lauds it as a safe malaria treatment. D rs. Henry Lai and Narenda Singh, bio-engineering profess ors at the University of Washington, reported on the act ive agent of this Asian herb, artemisinin and reported: it \"might provide a safe, non-toxic, and inexpensive alternative for cancer patients.\" How Artemisinin destroys tumors? www.BudwigCenter.com 26 Some seven years ago, Dr. Lai, reported the following \" I was aware of the high accumulation of iron in cancer cells and my colleague, Dr. Singh, co nducted experiments in laboratory cancer cells documenting a 100% kill rate of breast-cancer cells in just hours. More importantly, it left normal breast cells and white blood cells unscathed. It has an intermediate half-life, is very safe, and also can cross the blood-brain barrier which is very import ant in treating Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and most aggressive malignant p rimary brain tumor\" Dr. Lai and Dr. Singh both observed: \"Cancer cells h ave an unusual high level of iron and in order to reproduce cancer cells need more iron than normal healthy cells. Artemisinin works well in an iron rich environment. Artemisinin works by releasi ng an avalanche of free radicals when exposed to an oxidizing agent like iron. The free radicals a ttack and kill iron-rich cells. Since cancer cells tend to contain much more iron than normal cells do, they are particularly attractive to artemisinin. When exposed to cancer cells artemisini n gets activated and sends out free radicals that attack those cells, destroying the cancer in the process. When the artemisinin products contact the iron - boom! A huge burst of free radica ls is unleashed, virtually blowing up the cell harboring the free iron and destroying the malaria p arasite and cancer virus. \" The International Journal of Oncology 18; 767-773, 2001 by Efferth, et al. reported \"Cancer's resistance to common chemotherapy drugs shows no such r esistance to artemisinin. It does not have the chemical structure a cancer cell requires to develop resistance! \" Dr. Hoang of Hanoi of Vietnam, whose family of physi cians has been using artemisinin reported \"for about 10 years in treating cancer we have 50 t o 60 percent of 400 cancer patients that have achieved long-term remission utilizing artemisinin t ogether with a comprehensive integrative cancer strategy.\" Dr. Singh is currently following many cancer patient s. While not reporting remissions or apparent cures, he says \"all patients are responding and have a t least stabilized and I have found no type of cancer unresponsive to Artemisia derivatives in his stu dies. \" And the beauty of this treatment is that it is non-tox ic, so you can continue taking it indefinitely with no expected sided effects. 3 Things to Keep in Mind 1) Artemisinin cannot be taken simply on its own. You n eed to combine it with certain specific foods for it to absorb properly 2) Not all Artemisinin supplements are 'created equal' and therefore only the ones that have been tested and approved will give the proper resul ts 3) No artesminin should be taken within 30 days of radia tion therapy because of possible free iron leaks to the surrounding tissues after radiat ion therapy. Full Instructions on How to take Artemesia comes wi th every order TUMERIC (Curcumin) www.BudwigCenter.com 27 \"Curcumin, along with several other nutrients, is re markable in that it can actually tell the difference between a healthy cell and a cancer cell \" reports the Wellness Resources. Here is how the researchers explained their interest in cur cumin: \"' ... Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) ... is one of the most powerful and promising chemo preventive and anticancer agents ... How curcumin exerts its powerful anticancer activities has been thoroughly investigated, and several mechanisms of action have been discovered . .. curcumin exerts its biological activities through epigenetic modulation.'\" In other words, c urcumin changes the regulation of DNA to help kill cancer. In fact, curcumin not only influe nces epigenetic settings, it also manages the downstream consequences, helping to guide multiple steps in the way gene orders are implemented. More specifically, curcumin has been f ound to: Inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, decrease inflammation, inhibit the tra nsformation of cells from normal to tumor, inhibit the synthesis of a protein thought to be in strumental in tumor formation, help your body destroy mutated cancer cells so they cannot sp read throughout your body, help prevent the development of additional blood supply necessar y for cancer cell growth (angiogenesis). Take 3 capsules per day with food ESSENTIAL OILS (Pure 100% Therapeutic Grade) Essential oils are essential in the battle against degene rative diseases and tumor activity! Everything has an electri cal frequency or vibration, including food, our bodies, and even d isease that can be measured in Megahertz (MHz). Frequency is defined as a measurable rate of electrical flow that is constant be tween any two points. Interestingly enough, the frequency of essential oils are actually some of the highest frequencies known to man. They create an environment in which disease, bacteri a, virus, fungus, etc., cannot live and are several times greater than the frequencies of herbs a nd foods. Therefore no anti- degenerative diseases and tumor ac tivity program would be complete without the introduction of the appropriate essential oils A healthy body, from head to foot, typically has a f requency ranging from 62 to 78 MHz, while disease begins at 58Hz. During some testing with freque ncy and the frequency of essential oils it was measured that: Holding a cup of coffee dropped o ne man's frequency from 66 Hz to 58 MHz in just 3 seconds. It took three days for his frequenc y to return to normal. Another man drank the coffee and his frequency dropp ed from 66 MHz to 52 MHz. After inhaling the pure therapeutic grade essential oil, his frequenc y returned to 66 MHz in just 21 seconds. In another case: A man's frequency dropped from 65 M Hz to 48 MHz when he simply held a cigarette. When he smoked the cigarette, his frequen cy dropped to 42 MHz, the same frequency as cancer Other studies show that: Negative thoughts lower our f requency on average 12 MHz. Positive thoughts raises our frequency on average 10 MHz. www.BudwigCenter.com 28 Bruce Tanio, of Tainio Technology and head of the D epartment of Agriculture at Eastern Washington University, has developed a Calibrated Fr equency Monitor (CFM) that has been used to measure the frequencies of essential oils and their e ffect on human frequencies when applied to the body. ------ Essential Oils laboratory uses a CFM, and another is located at Johns Hopkins University where it is used to study frequency in rela tionship to disease. Frequency Of Foods: Fresh foods and herbs can actually be a bit higher if grown organically and eaten freshly picked): Fresh Foods 20 - 27 MHz, Fresh Herbs 20 -27 MHz, Dried Herbs 15 - 22 MHz, Processed/Canned Foods 0 MHz Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils begin at 52 and go as high as 320 MHz! For example: Rose 320 MHz, Helichrysum 181 MHz, MHz, sara Camomile 105 Juniper 98 Sandalwood Angelica MHz, Peppermint 78 MHz Essential oils...part of the BUDWIG CENTER Protocol There are plenty of essential oils being sold in He alth Shops and on the Internet, however most are of poor quality, synthetically produced and gre atly diluted with alcohol and other additives. To be effective only 100% pure therapeutic grade qu ality essential oils must be used, otherwise you will not obtain the health benefits. Also you need to rotate the oils on a weekly basis so that the cells get a fresh potent frequency and do not get used to the frequency. The BUDWIG CENTER uses specially formulated mixes of only the purest of essential oils that come with Certified Purity Recognition Seal of Inspection Robert 0. Becker, M.D., the author of the book, The Body Electric validates that the human body has an electrical frequency and that much about a pe rson's health can be determined by it. Nikola Tesla said that if you could eliminate certain outsi de frequencies that interfered in our bodies, we would have greater resistance toward disease. Dr. Ot to Warburg was a two-time Nobel Laureate and winner of the Nobel Prize for Cancer research, f or discovering that human cells have an electrical voltage. Beyond a doubt, certain freque ncies can prevent the development of disease and other frequencies would destroy diseases. Substan ces of higher frequency will destroy diseases of lower frequency. RESULTS OF USING ESSENTIAL OILS Over the past few months, we have been collecting po werful stories of individuals with degenerative diseases and tumor activity and their e xperiences with using essential oils. Here are their comments: Terminal liver degeneration A woman in Long Beach, said her husband was told to pu t his affairs in order. His liver tumors had progressed so much so that the tumors were far too lar ge for surgical removal. He was given six months to live. She was introduced to the power of 10 0% pure frankincense oil shortly following the diagnosis. He applied it topically over his live r and under his tongue daily. On their next visit with his physician, they discovered his tumors were miraculously shrinking. They continued using frankincense. In April, his tumors had shrunk so much so that his physician agreed to surgery. The tumors were removed, taking 3/4 of his liver. Today, he is in good health and enjoying life with his beautiful wife and family. www.BudwigCenter.com 29 Lung Stage 4 - metastasis to bones, spine, ribs, h ips, pelvis Bebe's mom had malignant tumors in her lungs, and it spread to her spine, her bones, her ribs, her shoulders, her hips and her pelvis. After starting doi ng the essential oils, four months later, she was thriving and her diseases cells were rapidly dyin g. She was back home and gardening and planning on going on vacation. Seven months after be ing told by the doctors that she was would die from her stage 4, the doctors say that she in good health and no more tumors. Bebe recommends: Frankincense : take liberally every 2-3 hours, both topically over affected areas and the bottom of the feet. If you can put numerous drop s under the tongue, even better. (BUDWIG CENTER will provide the full protocol) For pain she used the wintergreen oil diluted with coconut oil topically over the painful area. Five year old with brain tumors A five year old with brain tumors used just one drop of frankincense , alternated with one drop of sandalwood applied to the bottom of her feet, along with laven der applied to her wrist helped. Now totally in perfect health..!! Bone Marrow Degeneration Ellen was diagnosed with bone marrow degeneration an d polyscithemiarubravera. \"After 3 months my blood tests are showing massive improvements placing most markers into the normal range! I have not had to do 2 of the last 3 phleboto mies that I was having every 2 weeks and are now every month or longer! I am feeling like a mill ion dollars and no longer look like I am at death's door! Do these oils and have faith that this will work. It does.\" Breast Tumors I used frankincense to shrink a breast tumor. When I went for surgery, they couldn't find any trace of diseased cells or tumors! I had a breast tumors in F eb. and just had it removed and am doing the oils. I put frankincense and lemongrass on my breast every day and herbal supplements. I ha d my 6 month check up last month and he said everythin g looked great. No more degeneration or tumors! For me I will never do chemo or radiation th e side effects are way to bad. He was very surprised I looked so good cause I didn't have the trea tments. - Marilyn, October 2013 Cervical Tumors My good friend just called to tell me that she found out that her sister's cervical tumors came back for the 2nd time. She was scheduled today to have he r uterus removed. When she found out, she sent her sister wintergreen and frankincense. She instructed her mother to make sure she applied the wintergreen and frankincense on the bottoms of f eet every 3 to 4 hours for the pain along with applying directly on her abdomen.. A week ago, the diseased cells were still showing up in her blood work. Today [less than a month after first start ing the oils] was her surgery to remove her uterus removed and they couldn't find any diseased cel ls or tumors. Hallelujah! Praise God for these amazing products!- Bernie Leukemia www.BudwigCenter.com 30 My brother's son, who had a second reoccurrence of le ukemia... was taking essential oils as well as the chemo & went into remission much quicker than th e doctor had advised, and didn't have any of the nasty side-effects. - Jacqui Throat My mom's dear friend has been battling throat degener ation that was spreading to other areas of his body. Last October, he started using the oils! Fran kincense and natural remedies. Today he went from an MRI and he was given a true miracle... He is in perfect health! Thank you, God ~ Amen! - Lorie Pancreatic A friend had pancreatic degeneration and was given 3-4 weeks. He did the following, 3 drops frankincense, 1 drop each lemongrass, lavender, pepper mint, sandalwood and natural remedies. He is now in great health... It's been 8 months now. - Marilyn Prostate This morning I got a call from a good friend of our s who has been battling prostate tumors. For the last 3-4 months, he has been taking the essential oils. Today he called to say that at his doctor appointment yesterday, he was told that he is totally clear! Basal cell My friends dad had Basal cell growths on his nose. It h ad gone through the thickness of his nostril and the oncologist wanted to remove a big section of the nostril, down to his upper lip and over a finger width into his cheek, by the time he contacte d me. I hadn't worked with tumors before with the oils and wanted to help as much as possible. He a lso eliminated sugar from his diet, increased water intake, ate more raw foods and believed he cou ld beat this. Within a couple weeks it appeared closed, another week and the weeping stopped completely and the redness around the area started lightening. After six weeks, that side o f his nose looked healthier than the other unaffected side!! That was 15 months ago and he has ha d no signs of it coming back. Skin \"I went for a routine eye exam in Feb 2013. The Dr told me the growth over my eye is what I had suspected a form of skin degeneration: basil cell tumo rs. Yikes! One year prior to that eye exam I was at the Dermatologist office to have a few suspiciou s spots removed from my face, neck and back. Having gone through that invasive experience lead me to ask is there a safer way to remove this spot (mind you this spot is right above my eye). I did a bit of reading about essential oil use for skin tumors and it seemed less invasive than dermatolog ist plus I did not have to miss time from work. So I got a bottle of Frankincense and applied it as recommended topically 3 times a day and did 2 drops under my tongue morning and night. The f irst week no real significant change just a tingling sensation in that area after applying topica lly and taking it internally. The second week I did notice it getting smaller. During the third wee k the spot started to ooze a bit but it was getting smaller. The fourth week is when it seemed to IMPLODE on itself and oozed more but still it was getting smaller. The fifth week it was much, much sm aller and formed a scab. Week six the scab fell off while washing my face and was the size of a tiny whitehead. In 6 weeks a gigantic spot was www.BudwigCenter.com 31 reduced to the size of a pin head all from applying and ingesting an essential oil - Frankincense. I was ASTOUNDED, AMAZED & THRILLED!!!! Essential oils wo rked for me!!!\"- Dan Melanoma I applied frankincense morning and night and covered with a band aid. In 3 days the mole had shrunk. Day 5 it bled a little and half fell off. Da y 7, gone! I had a little bit of pink skin and I wo rried it was a scar. A few days later, totally gone! - Amb er My husband had a stage 4 malignant melanoma removed l ast year from his back...another melanoma came up on his nose...before we started usi ng essential oils we did radiation on that one. It has since grown back...and we have since bec ome educated using essential oils. He started using lavender frankincense, and Immortelle on the me lanoma and it is SHRINKING!-Jennifer HOW TO USE THE ESSENTIAL OILS It is important to change the combination of oils you consume every week otherwise the diseased cells build up a resistance to the same 'frequency' of the oils and they are less effective. We have chosen the best combinations of anti-cancer oils such a s Clove, Frankincense, Myrtle, Sandalwood, Lemon, Lavender, Pine and Balsamic Idaho, etc., and prepared four (4) different weekly portions. These combinations are carefully selected in the righ t proportions to give the most effective results. Each week you rotate from Formula 1 to 4 and then start over again back to Formula 1 changing to a new formula each week (4 week cycle) INSTRUCTIONS: /checkbld Always take the pure essential oils with a little cold pressed (or extra virgin) oil or a little honey for proper absorption and at meal time /checkbld Put 3 drops (do not exceed this amount) of essential o ils, (starting with Formula 1 for 7 days and then switch to Formula 2 for the next 7 days and then Formula 3 for 7 days and then rest for 7 days. /checkbld After a 7 day rest start up on Formula 4 for 7 days and then start back on Formula 1 for 7 days, then Formula 2 for 7 days. This makes 3 weeks so you need to stop and give a 1 week rest. Then start up with Formula 3 and repeat the same instructions of rotating the Formula every week for 3 weeks and 1 week rest. /checkbld Always put the drops directly into your mouth or on t o a plastic or wooden spoon (never use metal) and then put the oils into your mouth and swallow with a little oil or honey. /checkbld (Optional) Next mix a few drops of the Formula you are using that week to a ratio of 50/50 with cold pressed oil such as grape seed, sunflowe r, olive oil, etc and apply a thin amount of this mixture over the affected area (i.e. breast, lymph glands, abdomen for colon cancer) topically once a day and/or apply few drops of the oil mixture onto the bottom of your feet in the area that corresponds to t he area of your body affected. (as per reflexology chart) If the skin becomes irritate apply some pure cold pressed olive oil and reduce the applications. As you will be changing to a different Formula each week, mix www.BudwigCenter.com 32 the Formula you are currently using with the cold p ressed oils to apply to the affected area of the body /checkbld Next mix Lemongrass oil 50/50 with cold pressed oil such as grape seed, sunfl ower, olive oil, etc and apply some Lemongrass essential oil over t he affected area topically once a day. (Do not apply oils under the arm pit or in the groin area as the skin is very sensitive there and it could cause a rash) When someone has high blood pressure they would NOT take the following essential oils: thyme, clavo, oregano, black pepper, carrot seeds, ro mero) Not indicated for pregnancy and breast feeding woma n /square4 Bone - consume Formula 1, 2, 3 and 4 as indicated above, using a different formula each week and in addition mix a few drops of FORMULA 5 w ith cold pressed olive oil, sunflower seed oil or any other cold pressed oil 50-50 (half For mula 5 and half the other cold pressed oil) and massage it over the area of the tumor as wel l as up and down the spinal column three (3) times per day /square4 Brain Tumor - consume Formula 1, 2, 3 and 4 as indicated above , using a different formula each week and in addition mix a few drops of Formula 1 and 4 together into any cold pressed oil (olive, sunflower, etc) and apply 2 - 4 drops to the temps, the forehead, the mastoid, top of the head and the neck 2 to 6 tim es per day, massaging the neck area to increase blood flow to the brain /square4 Prostate (Enlarged, Prostatitis or cancer preventio n) 1. In addition to taking the oils orally as outlined abo ve, dilute anyone of the aforementioned essential oils in base oil (cold pressed almond oil, cold pressed sesame seed oil, Olive oil, hypericum, etc.) In a ratio of 50-50 and applying o ne to three drops between the rectum and the scrotum, 1 or 3 times a day. 2. Also put 1-3 drops of the oils mentioned, pure, undilu ted, on the bottom of the feet corresponding to the prostate (look at a reflexology chart) with the oil remaining on your hand gently massage the scrotum and around the prostat e area ( Prostate is N\u00ba 43 on this chart) www.BudwigCenter.com 33 www.BudwigCenter.com 34 PORTABLE RIFE MACHINE - \"RIFE TIME\" De-vitalizes pathogens (parasites, fungi, bacteria, and viruses) Dr. Royal Rife was a microbiologist who knew that degenerative diseases and tumor activity was caused b y very unique viral microbes which were inside of dise ased cells. Dr Rife called them BX and BY viruses. No degenerative diseases and tumor activity protocol is complete unless you destroy the viruses and fungi As already mentioned all diseases (except those cau sed by an accident or from birth) have the three same common causes. (1) Parasites, fungus, harmful bact eria and viruses (2) Toxins (3) Nutritional Imbalance Degenerative disease and tumor activity can be from b oth a virus and a fungus. When degenerative diseases and tumor activity are in the beginning stages its caused by a virus but as it spreads these cells are an ideal environment for fungus. At stage III and IV are both viral and fungi related. Diabetes is caused by a parasite (liver flu kes) in the gallbladder/pancreas area. Parkinsons is triggered by high level of toxins. And the list g oes on. Therefore to win the battle over any illnesses both these two main causes must be addressed. www.BudwigCenter.com 35 The Portable RIFE TIME effectively destroys all parasites, fungus, harmful ba cteria and viruses as well as it provokes detoxification. RIFE TIME is the most versatile, most portable, and perhaps the most potent of all Rife instruments. It is like having a machine that costs 10 times as mu ch, that is precisely hand tuned by an expert. Lifetime replacement warranty 6 times as powerful as Dr. Rife's originals. Twice the power of his most potent devices. Rife Time is a solid-state equivalent to the legendary vacuum tube-based instrument Easy to use - as easy as operating a CD player! Rife Time strengthens the body's natural immune response and impr oved circulatory function, enhanced enzyme catalysis, and ATP synthesis. Most r egular users report that they no longer get colds or flu. And they seem to be more resistant to e ven the most exotic of infections. A natural consequence of adding frequency to the bod y is the improvement of circulation - both cardiovascular and lymphatic. This benefit alone can improve other functions in your body. As we age and become less active, these issues become more imp ortant. These effects and more, coupled with the detoxificati on effect and the devitalizing of microbes, make for a potent approach to protecting our greate st wealth - our health. How Does the RIFE TIME Frequency Generator Destroy Dangerous Viruses? Researchers have discovered that when viruses are bomba rded with laser pulses of the right frequency, they shake apart. This arises from an inher ent characteristic of all objects called a \"resonant frequency,\" which is the frequency at whic h an object naturally vibrates. Ella Fitzgerald sang a note at the exact same frequen cy of a wine glass causing it to shatter. Dr. Royal Rife discovered that he could destroy viruses by sending a frequency that matched their frequency. Since then Physicists at Arizona State Un iversity say they have developed a method to calculate the exact frequency that it would take to shake a virus to death. Resonant frequencies are the key to stringed instrume nts, in which a string of a certain material, thickness and length has a resonant frequency that prod uces a specific musical note. But resonant frequencies can also cause objects to shake so uncontrol lably that their stability is undermined, as when a wind shook the Tacoma Narrows Bridge at its reso nant frequency in 1940, causing it to collapse. www.BudwigCenter.com 36 As Easy as a CD Player to use! Unlike many of the big non portable and more expensi ve Rife type machines that are often hard to operate, if you know how to operate your CD player, you will easily be able to use RIFE TIME. We will have you up and running in just a few minutes. We have taught a blind person over the phone. We have taught elderly people. We have worked with people who are on so much medication and/or with so much neurological compromise from disea se that their thinking was impaired. Is this one of those devices I can go to sleep with or wear on my body during the day? A resounding.... NO! RIFE TIME is much more powerful than those devices yo u strap to your body and wear for hours. You will put small little electrode sticky conductive patches right nea r the area to be treated. Significant reactions are more likely in the beginni ng days, as the toxic load is likely to be higher. Please trust the wisdom of our coaching. Sad to say some think that if \"some is better - than more is better\". This is a powe rful device and it's so important to start with short sessio ns only and gently work up to longer sessions. We have spent countless hours researching ALL the Rife machines on the market. We contacted many suppliers and asked them several important questio ns and compared the specs on all the different makes. Finally it became very clear to u s that the very best and most effective was the RIFE TIME machine. Therefore with full confidence we can recommend the RIFE TIME machine and we would not recommend any other brand or make as one cannot play with \"life\" in using other devices that may or may not destroy these deadl y viruses. Several patients have reported their comments on oth er RIFE machines. Most are very disappointed. A lady from France used the GB4000 for several months with no tangible improvement. She said the instructions were to use it all night long. The noise, the bright light and the need to get up in the middle of the night to ad just the frequencies is simply not acceptable. Many of the cheaper \"RIFE\" machines simply glorified \"zappers\" like the Dr. Hulda Clark zapper. Not potent enough to destroy the deadly virus/fungus. The RIFE TIME comes with a life time guarantee, full support and at a price that is very affordable. RIFE TIME delivers as much in five minutes as some mach ines do in an hour or more! Contact the Budwig Center for more details and hear t-warming Testimonials How to Set up and operate the RIFE TIME machine www.BudwigCenter.com 37 Step 1 - Place the CD of frequencies into the CD player. Mak e sure the volume is turned to the maximum high volume setting Step 2 - Plug in one end the cable into the RIFE TIME machin e where it is labelled \"input\" and the other end of the cable to the \"headphone\" jack of your CD player and turn volume to maximum level Step 3 - Plug in the cable for the electrodes into the RIFE T IME machine in the jack labelled \"electrodes 1\" and put the sticky electrode patches on the other en d of the cable designed for that (after 30 days you could use both cables and plug into \"electrode 2\" using 4 patches) Step 4 - It is most effective when you place the sticky electro des directly on the skin near the area that needs to be treated or where there is pain, or place on palms of your hands and soles of feet for total coverage Step 5 - activate the CD player and choose track number 2 (fo r beginners). Turn on the RIFE machine. A bright red indicator light should come o n. Then turn clockwise, the black adjustable knob on the bottom right hand corner until you feel some slight tingling. This is the comfortable level needed. If it becomes painful or uncomfortab le, simple turn it down by turning the knob counter clockwise. Note: The green indicator light should be totally gr een and flashing which means the batteries are good. If the green light is weak and not totally g reen please replace the batteries Note: the jack labelled \"ear phone\" on the RIFE TIME mach ine is an optional jack that can be used in conjunction with listening to music. For clinica l purposes we do not use this jack CD/DVD Player, Mobile (cell) phone, Computers, Ster eo Players can all be used to play the frequencies. You can place the CD player into comp uter and open the Windows Media Program and copy the tracks onto a USB flash drive or into y our Mobile (cell) phone, etc., for total portability. HOW TO USE THE CD's that come with the RIFE TIME WEEK 1 - New users begin using the CD \" General Alignment \" on track N\u00ba 2 for ten minutes only once a day. Being careful to observe any other chang es, such as headache or light-headedness, change in elimination or sleep pattern, fatigue or i ncreased energy, pain relief or new pain appearing. This session is repeated for a total of five days, foll owed by two days off. We encourage drinking plenty of water to flush out released toxins. WEEK 2 - Beginners will progress the following week completi ng all of Track N\u00ba 2 and then do 10 minutes of Track N\u00ba 3 once a day. (Because we have moved into another frequency range here, it is possible to see more of a reaction). www.BudwigCenter.com 38 WEEK 3 - If you have accomplished all of track 2 and 3 withou t dramatic changes on Week 3 - do 1 session of all of Track N\u00ba 2 and then 4 hours later d o another sessions of all of Track N\u00ba 3 and 4 hours later do a session of the entire Track N\u00ba 4 and N\u00ba 5 WEEK 4 - If you have accomplished all of tracks 2 - 5 without any problems then do a full sessions of Track N\u00ba 1 and repeat Track N\u00ba 1 four hours later and then once again four hours later at the end of the day, making it 3 times per day all of Tr ack N\u00ba 1 repeated 3 times doing the full length of Track N\u00ba 1. Do this every day. If you feel any ne gative reaction then take 2 days off, if not do the entire Track N\u00ba 1 three (3) times a day for the full 7 days. When doing longer sessions its best to put the electrode sticky pads on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands. You have 2 sets of cables to use 2 sets (total of 4 sticky pads) at the sa me time. When used on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands there is no danger of burn ing of the skin WEEK 5 - Now you can put in BUDWIG CENTER CD N\u00ba 1 and do a full 30 minute session on Track N\u00ba 1 and if you have no negative reaction do anothe r session 4 or more hours later on Track N\u00ba 2 for 30 minutes. When doing longer sessions its best to put the electrode sticky pads on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands. WEEK 6 - Now you can put in BUDWIG CENTER CD N\u00ba 2 and do a full 30 minute session on Track N\u00ba 3 and if you have no negative reaction do anothe r session 4 or more hours later on Track N\u00ba 4 for 30 minutes. If adverse reaction reduce to 1 sessi on per day. WEEK 7 and hereafter - Do three (3) sessions of CD N\u00ba 1 going through all the tracks completely one after the other doing 30 minute sessions three t imes a day for a total of 90 minutes daily - Tracks 1 - 2 all week long. The following week put in CD N\u00ba 2 and do exactly the same as you did with CD N\u00ba 1. You simply keep alternating each wee k now between CD N\u00ba 1 and N\u00ba 2 until you are declared in the 'safe zone'. Afterwhich you would d o well to do a 30 minute session once a day progressively working through all the tracks on CD N\u00ba 1 and N\u00ba 2 When doing longer sessions (30 minutes of more) its best to put the electrode sticky pads on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands. Please Note: If you have High Blood Pressure Track N\u00ba 5 of the GEN ERAL ALIGNEMENT would be very helpful. However avoid Track N\u00ba 1 of GENERAL ALIGNEMENT as it helps with Low Blood pressure but it can raise your blood pressure and theref ore when doing Track N\u00ba 1 monitor your blood pressure if you have High Blood Pressure. If it gets too high stop using Track N\u00ba 1 of General Alignment People with serious health issues may have a reaction f rom even the shortest of sessions. For this reason, we have established a gentle routine wherein the subject moves carefully and systematically through the tracks of with close observa tion of the notable effects. Test pH strips are provided. Break off a piece and put in on you r tongue and hold for 30 seconds, then verify the color. It should be green. See ind icator on the side of the pH strip container. Increase your pH by consuming pH foods (such as the hone y and Apple Cider Vinegar mixture). Eventually eating the BUDWIG food program and doing the RIFE TIME the body will naturally adjust the pH to 7.0 and for the moment do not conce rn yourself too much with the pH but www.BudwigCenter.com 39 continue doing the RIFE sessions and only stop if you have headaches, nausea, vomiting, etc and give it a 2 day rest and reduce to 1 session a day fo r a week then slowly increase to 2 times a day and then eventually 3 sessions per day LUNG - Start with both electrodes on the bottom of each foot. After a week put 2 Postive electrodes around the lung area and then two Negati ve electrodes on the soles of the feets (4 both cables - 4 sticky patches). Another combination is 2 Negative electrodes on the back of the lungs and 2 Positive on the front of the lungs PROSTATE - (main issues is toxins) Put the Positive patc h (electrode) around the prostate area (be careful as this is a very sensitive area so 10 minute ma ximum) and negative on the soles of the foot BREAST - (treat like an abscess) General rule Positive patch on the Right breast and Negative Patch on the Left breast. Another option is the positive patch on the affected breast and the negative patch on sole of foot. If you use 4 patches then put Positive on palms of hand and Negative soles of feet. ABDOMEN -Start with the Negative patch on the botto m of the foot and the positive over the stomach. If you put both electrodes (patches) over th e stomach at first it could clog up worse. Over a 3 week period slowly move the negative patch from the foot, up the leg and eventually on the stomach beside the positive patch BRAIN - Positive over the area of the head where t he tumor is (you may have to thin the hair in that area and help hold the patch in place with a h at during the sessions) but the negative on the bottom of a foot. Do another session with the positiv e cable and the carbon / rubber patch in your mouth and the negative patch on the palm of th e hand EYES - Positive carbon/rubber patch over the orbit (exterior) area of the eye and slide around the outside of the eye (not on the eye) and the negative on the bottom of a foot BLOOD CLOTS and STOKES - Apply Positive patch on the hip and Negative on sole of foot and then in another session lubricate the carbon/rubber patch and move in an up and down pattern over the inner part of the legs with positive cable and N egative on sold of foot. In another session Track No 3 using lubricate (aloe vera gel) slide t he rubber positive on one side of the spine and and negative patchs on the other side. Slide up and down the spine. If spine has been injured use Track No 1 LOW BLOOD PRESSURE - Put patches on soles of feet and do Track No 1 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE - Put patches on palms of hands an d do Track No 5 DIABETES - Start with Positive on palm of hand and N egative on sole of foot. Start slow with short 10 min sessions on Track No 2 otherwise you could ha ve an insulin shock PREGNANT and BABIES - Pregnant woman can use the RIF E and for children under 3 years old the adult will put the patches on the palm of their hand s and then touch baby with your fingers. 3 Years and older you can put the patches on the soles o f feet and palms of the hands www.BudwigCenter.com 40 COLDS/INFLUENZA/FLU -If you feel a cold or flu comi ng on RIFE sessions would be good to do and would probably prevent you from getting sick. Howev er once you had the cold or flu it is advisable that subjects not use the machine if they are already symptomatic with opportunistic infections like colds/influenza. In such cases, we must anticipate that symptoms will become aggravated. Generally, the cycle is accelerated, and subjects bec ome more intensely ill. People who use the RIFE daily often find they no longer get colds and t he flu and other infections LYME/HERPES, etc - Likewise, in cases where there is k nown chronic infection such as Lyme, Herpes, etc. we advise users to prepare for the possibi lity that symptoms may temporarily increase. This, in part, is due to the immune system b eing stimulated to address the infection. *************************************************** *************************** PAIN CONTROL The Pain Master\u00ae is a technological breakthrough in advanced pain relief.

Studies indicate an average of 83% reduction in tumors using hyperthermia. Hippocrat es noted that \"illness not cured by heat is incurable.\" I n 1927, Julius Wagner-Jauregg received the Nobel Priz e in medicine for work involving the therapeutic applica tion of hyperthermia. Fever has long been a misunderstood and mistreated symptom. Most orthodox doctors try to combat and suppress fever, with drugs. However, the fa ct is that fever is a constructive, health-promoting symp tom, initiated and created by the body in its own effort to fight infections and other conditions of disease and to resto re health. Fever speeds up metabolism, inhibits the growth of in vading virus or bacteria, and accelerates the healing processes. Hyperthermia is a therapeutic pro cedure used to raise the temperature of cancerous tumor to at least 108\u00baF for one hour. It is based on a simple and easily verifiable scientific fact that a temperature of 108\u00baF kills ca ncer cells but not normal human tissue cells. In normal tissues, blood vessels open up (dilate) when heat is applied, dissipating the heat and cooling down the cell environment. Unlike healthy c ells, a tumor is a tightly packed group of cells, and circulation is restricted and sluggish. When heat is applied to the tumor, vital nutrients and oxygen are cut off from the tumor cells. This result s in a collapse of the tumor's vascular system and destruction of the cancer cells. All we need is s ome way to raise the body's temperature, and we create a selectively negative environment for th e renegade cancer cells, which can be mopped up by the immune system. There are several other methods used to induce hypert hermia, such as full-body submersion in hot water, ultrasound, and saunas, to name a few. Th ere are few side effects and the body has the ability to recover from the low dose radiation i n most cases. Dr. A. Lwoff, a famous French bacteriologist, has dem onstrated in repeated scientific experiments that fever is indeed a \"great medicine,\" and that it can help to cure many \"incurable\" diseases. Renowned oncologist, Dr. Josef Issels, stated: \"Artificia lly induced fever has the greatest potential in the treatment of many diseases, including cancer.\" Keep in mind that this remark was made by one of the leading cancer specialists in the world! Hyperthermia gives tumors a \"triple whammy\" by: 1. Removing accumulations of toxic chemicals that cau se tumors and disease www.BudwigCenter.com 42 2. Improving circulation so that tissues are both nouri shed with oxygen and flushed of acidic wastes 3. Weakening or even killing tumor cells that have a lower tolerance for heat than healthy cells. Over 2,000 years ago, the famous Greek physician, Pa rmenides, stated \"Give me a chance to create fever, and I will cure any disease.\" This tradi tional wisdom has certainly stood the test of time.

In today's world, we spend very little time in cont act with the Earth. The premise of 'Earthing' or 'Grounding' is that, i f one is not grounded, one's body has a shortage of free electrons with wh ich to quench the chronic inflammatory response. Your immune system i s out of control, and you are on the way to chronic illness. Why is this important? Inflammation is a recognized major underlying problem of many diseases including cardiovascular d isease, arthritis, lupus, MS, eczema, fibromyalgia, and diabetes, etc. Heavy metals, pesticides, chemicals, and solvents contribute to t he inflammation. Being disconnected from the Earth also contributes to the inflammatory process. www.BudwigCenter.com 43 Body Grounding - The Earth's Antioxidant - Just How Do We Ground Ourselves? Walking barefoot on grass Swimming in the ocean, sea, river or lake Walking on a wet sand at the beach Walking outdoors with leather soled shoes If you can't regularly walk on the grass or beach, there are various other ways to ground yourself. There are special bed sheets, bed pads, e lectrode patches, and sandals, pads to sit on while at work or home, and foot pads to use when seated. These are grounded directly into the earth outside a window by a wire and metal rod or by connecting into the ground part of a grounded outlet. Here are two useful links: UK http://www.groundology.com/products.php USA https://shop.earthing.com/shopdisplayproducts.asp?c ategory=ALL DEEP BREATHING and HEALTH RESTORATION In his ground-breaking research, Dr Samuel West dis covered the importance of activating the lymphatic system for b etter health and pain control. He found that 'trapped proteins' in the lymph system produces conditions that cause loss of energ y, disease and death at the cellular level. He has had outstan ding results by simply getting people to pump out the toxins from t he 'garbage' disposal system (our lymph system) with some simple, gentle movements. This discovery is so simple that many actually disc ard it as being to 'simple or easy' to be of any value. However the results with people who did these exercises several times per day are sometimes close to 'miraculous' The benefits of Rebounding go way beyond exercise. It is a whole-body exercise where EVERY SINGLE CELL is rejuvenated and oxygenated (in your muscles, bones, eyes, heart, lungs, kidneys, ears, glands - everything! NASA research found rebounding to be 68% more effic ient than running on a treadmill! In his book 'Jumping for Health', Dr Morton Walker claims that just 2 minutes of rebounding offers equivalent physiological benefits as: 6 minu tes of running, 10 minutes of swimming and 22 minutes of walking! Albert E Carter, Olympic athlete, journalist and li felong rebound researcher has claimed that Rebounding to be 'THE MOST EFFECTIVE EXERCISE YET D EVISED BY MAN' In just 2 minutes of rebounding - the entire lympha tic system is flushed out and the white blood cell count nearly triples, providing a greate r defense system to destroy cancer cells. DEEP BREATHING TECHNIQUE - TO ACTIVATE THE LYMPH SOFT WALK on a rebounder/mini trampoline www.BudwigCenter.com 44 1. Start off very gently - for 15 seconds with both feet firmly on the rebounder 'soft walk' on the surface gently raising each heal one at a time. 2. Never stress your body. As soon as you feel dizz y (a sign you are loaded with toxins) you stop. You could do some gentle deep breathing at t he same time (its gets easier with practice) 3. Keep doing this 'soft walk' several times a day if possible until you can do 30 minutes without fatigue. Listen to music that fits your moo d to enhance the benefits SEAT BOUNCES If your legs become tired or you are not able to st and on the rebounder, sit on the rebounder, with your feet on the floor, use you hands and feet to gently bounce up and down. Make it more effective and fun by bouncing from one hip to the other. If you are wheel chair bound then just put your feet on the rebounder and have s omeone else jump on it and it will help you activate the lymph system. LOW JOG 1. After you can do up to 30 minutes of the soft wa lk and not feel tired start with the 'low jog'. Do a slow, steady jogging motion, move your arms up and down and do deep breathing. This is not about speed but endurance. You may not be a ble to hold your breath like when you did deep breathing without the jumping on the trampolin e but it will still be beneficial AEROBIC LYMPHASIZING 1. After 5 minutes warming up with the 'soft steps' and 'low jog' you can now do faster and larger movements until you feel fatigue, then you r eturn to the lower level aerobic lymphasizing - repeat slow fast slow fast .... fast slow gradually slow down, not too fast into the low jog and then the soft step. Breath normal 2. Do not do an Aerobic Lymph session and then get off the rebounder without doing these lower level low jog and then soft step, otherwise y ou will cause more stress and trapped proteins in your system. Always do the 'cooling do wn' program 3. When you step down, you should be able to speak calmly without any fatigue or stress and feel more energetic than before. It may take patient months to be able to do this fu ll cycle. Transition is important. Its not about speed but endurance Your body has about 60 to 80 trillion cells. The 2 to 4 G forces (gravitational pull) involved in bouncing with a 'Rebounder' squeezes out toxins. Th en, during the brief weightless period when the body is suspended in the air, the lower pr essure in the cell promotes the movement of nutrients into the cells. Thus the flow of mate rials to and from cells is improved. It is like getting every cell in your body to exercise. Trampo line use helps the lymphatic system eliminate toxins by increasing the gravitational pu ll as you bounce. The lymphatic system is the metabolic garbage can of the body. It rids the body of toxins, fatigue substances, dead cells, diseased cells, nitrogenous wastes, trapped protein, fatty globules, pathogenic bacteria, infectious viruses, foreign substances, heavy metal s, and other assorted junk the cells cast off. Especially women with breast tumors would want to o btain a Rebounder and do daily sessions. Even 3 or 5 minutes will make a remarkab le different. Every room at the BUDWIG www.BudwigCenter.com 45 CENTER where the patients stay is equipped with a r ebounder. Some use it up to 5 times a day! *************************************************** ********************** DR BUDWIG ENCOURAGED DAILY SUNBATHING We want you to get a reasonable amount of sunshine everyday if you can. Sunbathing is the best natural way to increase the Vitamin D production in the body. Isn't sunbathing dangerous? Doesn't it lead to the risk of skin tumors? The 'real' cause of skin degeneration is for two-fo ld. First: people get 'too much sun'. They lie in the sun too long and get sunburnt which can lead to skin tumors. Dr Budwig recommended only 10 to 15 minutes full exposure of the body to the sun. After that it's best to go in the shade or cover up. People also lather their bodies with suntan lotions which most often contain isopropyl alcohol derivates which are very dangerous. Some virgin coconut oil is the best protection. True sun-blocking lotions may protect against burning, but the skin is still being harmed because after about 30 minutes of dire ct exposure the immune system is challenged and your skin is being damaged. Second: diet is a major contributor to all degenerative diseases, including skin tumors. Bad t rans fats (deep fried foods) and refined sugars (pastries, sweets, soft drinks, ice cream, e tc) all weaken the immune system. People who get a limited amount of sun, avoid sun tan loti ons and eat healthy food have a much lower risk. If you are prone to skin tumors on you r face, it is wise to avoid exposing that area of the body when sun bathing Try to sunbathe in the nude or close to it so the e ntire body benefits. Be careful about washing your body with soap the same day as can was h away the vitamin D that is being formed. Shower with water only and restrict the use of soap to the armpits and groin area within 24 hours of sunbathing or using a n FIR lamp. *************************************************** ********************** ASCITES - THE NATURAL ANSWER TO FLUID RETENTION Ascites is a build up of water and fluid in the sto mach or lungs caused by tumors. And there hasn't been a whole lot to do about it, other than getting fluid drawn when the stomach or lungs get too full. Dr Hamer, the oncologist mentio ned in the Psychological section of this report, mentioned in an article how this fluid buil dup frequently occurs when you are killing off the diseased cells. The fundamental reason this accumulation of fluid o ccurs has to do with acidity. Thus, we discuss it here in the pH section. There is so much acid being produced by the diseased cells, or by the killing off of the cells, which produces acidic waste, that the body dilutes this acid buildup with fluid. The buildup is so acidic, it wo uld be harmful if it was not diluted. So your body produces fluid to dilute the acid in an attemp t to protect itself. Sometimes it is a poorly functioning liver that is the reason the body can't get rid of the acids. Sometimes a poorly www.BudwigCenter.com 46 functioning kidney. Sometimes there is just too muc h acid for an okay functioning detox system to handle. The acid either comes from the metabolic waste of a large amount of degenerative cells, as they produce energy using lactic acid fermentation. Other times the acid is from the dead cells which are toxic and acid, on top of the acid that t he still live diseased cells are producing. The most abundant protein component of blood, produ ced primarily in the liver, albumin helps to keep the fluid portion of blood within the vessels. Low levels of albumin in the blood or its presence in urine may signal edema (th e accumulation of fluid) as in pedal edema (in the ankles) and fluid can begin to accumu late in the abdomen (ascites) or pulmonary edema (in the lungs), which may be sympto ms of congestive heart failure, kidney or liver disease. People with a degenerative disease are often low on energy and experience muscle loss. L-leucine is an essential amino acid, which should be taken along with L-isoleucine and L-valine. Food sources for L-leuc ine are meat, almonds, cashews, eggs, fish, chicken, lentils and liver. Do a blood test to mak e sure the albumin levels are not below 3.5 First thing to do is the Health Restoration/Trampoline/ Deep Breathing progr am at least once a day as already outlined here above in this G UIDE. You need the following: 1. Ginger root (3 capsules with each meal - 9 per day) 2. Artemisinin (take as per instructions that come with each order ) 3. Melatonin (3 grams per day at bedtime) 4. Astragalus (2,000 to 3,000 mgs per day at meal time) 5. Selenium (400 mcg daily) 6. D-Ribose (5 grams 3 x day) supplements make a significant i mprovement in energy levels, sleep patterns, mental clarity, pain intens ity, and wellbeing. 7. ALOEDIS 30 - Detoxification 8. Essential Oils (i.e. Frankincense, Myrrh, Lemongrass, Lavender, O range) 9. Taurine - 500 mg per day (purchase locally or on the net) 10. Trican ( 1-4 scoops per day) 11. Serrapeptase - at least 8 or 12 per day on an empty stomach 12. Amino Acids - 3 per day between meals 13. Deep Breathing and Trampoline (if not too weak) *************************************************** ********************** BRAIN TUMORS- Natural Proven Remedies 1. COCONUT OIL - Who would have ever thought that a food as simple as the coconut could provide such extremely beneficial health resu lts? Dr Newport has done a tremendous amount of research about the effects of coconut oil on the human body. The central theme of her book is that when we consu me coconut oil our body knows what to do with it in very special ways. One of th e things it does with part of it is to www.BudwigCenter.com 47 create a substance called ketones. She explains th at it has been known for many, many years that ketones are, in a sense, a backup e nergy supply to the cells in our bodies. She contends that in the brain, disease can begin and develop when, neurons, other brain cells, and possibly the synapses which connect brain cells, die or slip into a nonfunctional condition due to the lack of fuel. Ke tones can enter the cells in our body and provide the fuel the cells need to survive and function. Degeneration and tumors as well as other neurodegenerative diseases could b e and have been shown to be helped by the use of this backup fuel system. In f act research has been done to prove that this can happen; moreover there is a case of a woman referenced in the book who had an aggressive stage 4 brain tumor called a glioblastoma who agreed to be part of this type of treatment. Within 3 months her tumor was no longer able to be found on MRI and PET scans. http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/7/1/3 3 2. ESSENTIAL OILS - Especially Frankincense and Sandalwood are needed. 3. Artemisinin (take as per instructions that come with each order ) 4. Ginger in capsules (3 capsules with each meal - 9 per day) 5. Melatonin (3 grams per day at bedtime) 6. Astragalus (2,000 to 3,000 mgs per day at meal time) 7. Selenium (400 mcg daily) 8. DMSO - Swelling is a common issue with brain tumors and doctors will often prescribe steroids. At the BUDWIG CENTER we can offer homeop athic steroids during hyperthermia therapies with the BioMedic clinic. A lso DMSO gently massaged on the back of the neck and affected areas is very helpful in reducing and controlling swelling. This can be done several times a day. Please apply some Aloe Vera gel to your hands and the affected area afterwards to overcome excess ive dry skin that is often caused by the DMSO *************************************************** ********************** CLEANING AND PERSONAL HYGIENIC PRODUCTS Dangerous chemicals (in the workplace, home or garden), microbes, para sites and fungus, etc, all challenge the body and interfere with its proper functions. The late Dr Hulda Clark who examined and treated thousands of chronically ill p atients stated that 'all patients with tumors have both isopropyl alcohol (as found in many body care and household cleaning products) and the intestinal fluke (parasites, worms) in thei r liver'. Most commercial cleaning products are loaded with h armful toxins can be replaced with vinegar, baking soda, borax and dish soap. Look on the Internet for practical suggestions and alternatives. SHAMPOO - Look for a natural shampoo that does not have any harmful chemicals in them like: ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL, MINERAL OIL, PEG, PROPYLEN E GLYCOL (PG), SULFATE HYDANTOIN (read more: http://www.discoverhealthandwealth.com/toxic-ingred ients.html) www.BudwigCenter.com 48 A good and very affordable shampoo is made from 10% baking soda and 90% water - mix in a dispenser bottle ITCHY SCALP - Massage pure apple cider vinegar to y our hair and scalp 5 minutes before washing your hair. It not only makes the hair heal thy and shiny but controls dandruff. Rinse and then use a natural shampoo (eg baking soda) to clean your hair DEODORANT - Also use totally natural aluminum free deodorant. The hard natural Alum Stone stick is good. Some spread on a thin layer o f natural virgin coconut oil under the arm pits for a totally natural and very effective deodo rant. Most natural deodorants require washing mid day and reapplying again as they are no t as potent as chemical deodorants http://www.verdan.com/us/verdan-crystal-deodorant-a bout-us/our-products.html Men's shaving cream for example often contains some form of isopropyl alcohol. Imagine day after day putting t his harmful chemical on the skin. The Philashave Triple Head electric shaver from Phillips to be an excellent alternative . Many electric shavers just irritate the skin. This bran d with triple heads and all you need is to put water on your skin and on the shaving heads (waterproof model) works very well. You will also save a bundle of money as well on blades and l otion Be careful what you put on your skin. Underarm deodorants, hair sprays, men's shaving cream, sun-tanning lotion, rubbing alcohol, (the li st is endless) often contain isopropyl alcohol and other harmful chemicals. Look for reasonable al ternatives. Not all toxins can be avoided, unless you move to a secluded island, but try to av oid unnecessary daily exposure. It doesn't make sense just to save time that we poison ourselv es day in and day out *************************************************** ******************** PARASITES AND PETS There was a time when the humans lived in the house and the animals outside the house. However things have changed and Hollywood movies ha ve 'humanized' animals and they now sleep on our beds, sit on our sofas and even sit at our tables. Animals can provide many emotional benefits however they do transmit a lot o f parasites. So caution needs to be taken. Believe it or not about 85% of the entire world's p opulation is infected by different types of parasites and worms. According to the research of the late Dr Hulda Clar k she states 'In order to get a degenerative disease you must ha ve the human intestinal fluke parasite.' This parasite typ ically lives in the intestine where it might do little harm, causin g only colitis, Crohn's disease, or irritable bowel syndrome, or pe rhaps nothing at all. But if it invades a different organ, like the uteru s or the kidneys or liver, it does a great deal of harm. If it establishes itself in the liver, it causes tu mors! That It only establishes itself in the liver in some people. These people have isopropyl alcohol in their bodies. www.BudwigCenter.com 49 All tumor patients have both isopropyl alcohol and the intestinal fluke in their liver. Most of us think that only people living in Africa or South Am erica have parasites. These parasites are not your friends either as they can migrate to othe r areas such as your nose, ears, brain or your liver. The VEGA test will detect any parasite s you may have an offer a natural anti- parasite remedy. NEVER, EVER share food with your pet. Don't keep a cat box in the house; install a cat door. Wear a dust-mask when you chang e the cat box. Dr Clark's Pet Parasite Program [As in 'The Cure for All Cancers', 1993 ed ition] Please pet your animal(s) and then wash your hands. Try to have a set time to do this. If the animal lives in the house this will be more challen ging. Using the RIFE TIME on yourself and the pet(s) will be helpful as well as consuming the Anti-Parasite remedy (sold at the Budwig Center on line store) will be very important). Some have their pets cared for by friends and family until they recover their health! Remember your life is at stake! *************************************************** ************************ FAR Infrared Sauna - Detoxify Heavy Metals Everyone with any chronic illness should invest in a FAR INFRARED DRY SUANA. At the BUDWIG CENTER all our rooms are equipped with a por table blanket type sauna and we encourage all our patients to purchase a portable b lanket type FAR Infrared sauna to use daily at home. Sweating and fever are Nature's way of rid ing the body of poisonous toxins and heavy metals. Interestingly many people with a deg enerative disease and other ailments do not sweat or do not sweat easily. Poisonous toxins are trapped for years in the body. The benefits of high temperatures is that millions of weak degenerative diseased cells are weakened even further by controlled high temperatur es and when they self-destruct are naturally expelled from the body. The idea is to h eat the body to temperatures - between 107 and 113 degrees F (about 41 to 45 Celsius). Typic al sweat produced under normal conditions and regular steam saunas contains 97% water and 3% toxins. Sweat produced from a Far Infrared sauna is found t o be 80-85% water and 15-20% toxins! The BUDWIG CENTER puts a lot of emphasis on detoxif ying your body and get rid itself of an accumulation of potentially carcinogenic heavy meta ls: Such as lead, mercury, zinc, nickel, cadmium, as well as alcohol, nicotine, sodium, sulf uric acid lead, copper, aluminum, pesticide residues, petroleum-based toxins, chloride, fluorid e, as well as fat and cholesterol. Drink plenty of pure water during each sauna session. CAUTION: For women with breast and/or lympathic degenerative disease or water retention (ascites), saunas, increase lymphatic inflammation, and lymphadema, which can raise CEA 15-3 levels, Saunas therefore is not recommended in these cases Step 1 Place a towel on the bottom of the Infrared blanket so it will warm up with the blanket for about 10 min. www.BudwigCenter.com 50 Step 2 Drink at least 2 cups of Ginger Root tea right bef ore the session or 2 cups of Oregano tea (avoid oregano tea if you have high blood press ure) along with 2 or 3 ginger capsules will help generate sweating and an 'artificial fever\u00b4. If you sweat very easily this step may not be necessary. Step 3 Undress completely and remain in the sauna blanket for approx 30 minutes at 50 Celsius and work up to 60 Celsius for 60 minutes. Put a towel around your neck so all the heat stays right inside the blanket. Also put a blanket over the entire sauna unit so that it will keep all the heat in and give you a very good session. I f you develop symptoms, such as: feeling faint, nausea, do not start sweating after 10 minut es, develop a headache, vomiting or general malaise the session shoud be stopped. Step 4 After the session you will have a warm to cool shower to close the pores of the skin. Wipe down t he blanket with 3% hydrogen peroxide after session and once a week air out the sauna bla nket in the sunshine for 30-60 minutes Everyone that enrolls in any of the BUDWIG CENTER p rograms will automatically receive a list of all the suppliers for all the different therapie s and equipment needed. The BUDWIG CENTER places a lot of emphasis on combi ning natural healing remedies with emotional healing. Research shows that the immune system is challenged if during weeks, months and sometimes years you have to face negativ e emotional experiences. Severe negative emotional shock (death in the famil y, divorce, family problems, financial setbacks, etc.) often will precede degenerative dis eases. Ed Sopcak a degenerative disease researcher in United States consulted with over 30, 000 degenerative disease patients. He concluded 'most all the degenerative disease patien ts I have spoken with had a major stress in their life six months to 3 years before they were d iagnosed with degenerative disease and tumor activity. Medical doctor and degenerative disease surgeon Ryk e Geerd Hamer has examined 20,000 degenerative disease patients with all types of deg enerative diseases. Dr HAMER from his personal experience--he himself h as had a degenerative disease -and from those patients he took care of in many university c linics. Dr HAMER established over the years that there is always a definite syndrome at t he source of degenerative disease and not just a kind of stress. It requires a strong stimulus, a brutal psychic tra uma, which hits the patient as a major event in his life, an acute dramatic conflict, lived in a complete psychic isolation. The Body-Mind Connection The importance of adding emotional healing and sess ions of well- being to a successful degenerative disease treatmen t program is emphasized by the research EMOTIONAL HEALING with EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) 'TAPPING' www.BudwigCenter.com 51 of the John Hopkins Hospital which stated that: 'Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit. A proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor. Anger, resentment and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment. Learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit. Learn to relax and enjoy life' EFT - WHO'S WRITING ON THE WALLS OF YOUR MIND? PAST INFLUENTIAL WRITING - My teacher said I was thick and that I would never amount to much and he was right. My friends said I was easily influenced and I am. My Mum reacted as if whatever I did was never good enough - and it never was. My closest friend told me I was too soft and I am. Why are other's observations or predictions still happening? Could it possibly be anything to do with me? Was it what was said, or how I perceived life for me which became the mechanism of myself self fulfilling prophecy? This happened, or is still happening, for me as long as I continue to hold onto these beliefs. This is often an unconscious process which was intended for a positive purpose. My knee jerk reactions can be triggered by myself t alk, the images created in my mind as well as taste, touch, smell or gut feelings. PRESENT WRITING - When we think of the 'here and no w' we may well ask who is currently writing on the wall of our mind? Are we still stuc k in the mire of an old self fulfilling prophecy? Why do we continue to believe what was said to us? Did we just believe negative suggestions or did we also absorb positive messages ? From where do the images we keep seeing originate? Basically, the idea is that most emotional issues i nvolve a disruption to the free flow of the subtle energies that circulate throughout the body. In short, when emotional stress occurs those subtle energies have been short-circuited. Correct this disruption and the problem reduces or disappears. This process is like an emotional version of acupuncture except that needle s are not used. www.BudwigCenter.com 52 Instead, you stimulate certain energy meridian poin ts by tapping on them with your fingertips. Interestingly, since our emotional stressors are of ten linked with our physical ailments, we often find that diseases and other symptoms fade up on proper use of this process. There are tens of thousands of psychologists and me dical doctors that are currently using this exciting innovation in medical care. Past emoti onal hurts, anger, jealousy, conflict, trauma, etc. must be dealt with. Everyone that enrols in the BUDWIG CENTER programs will automatically receive the full TAPPING - E.F.T. programs (audio recordings and the written text, with training from the top EFT people all over the world.) FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS... It is only normal when you have a 'life-threatening illness' to have a zillion questions and the following are the answers to some of the most commo nly asked question. If you are registered with either our Home program or the Clin ical program, then you can ask all the questions you need to in order to understand the pr ogram correctly. 1. I need to obtain other supplements beside tho se the BUDWIG CENTER provides? Normally, no as our program is very complete. After completing our Energetic Frequency tests what is recommended is exactly what the body needs to repair and heal itself. What we send you is based on your HEALTH REPORT and we have care fully selected the remedies appropriate for your condition. We may encourage y ou to pick up some natural items locally like some chlorophyll to be consumed daily or some Epsom salts for constipation etc. Most herbal, mineral and homeopathic formulas we send yo u will be only temporary as well and when you finish them in most cases you will discont inue using them. Essential Oils (pure therapeutic grade only) are much more effective. We only recommend the Flaxseed oil and cottage cheese ONCE a day as we are not in favor of m ore dairy than this as this can cause inflammation and should be kept to the minimum. Infl ammation is a major cause of CEA 15-3 and other degenerative disease markers. Mineral deficien cy and toxic chemistry also increases it because it changes the hormone manufacture and commun ication, causing increased CEA 15-3. Some people believe that bombarding with everything will increase ability to heal, they do not realize that it interferes with the natural biochemi stries, which causes negative side effects and are incorrectly interpreted as a degenerative disease instead of inflammation or bad chemistry mixtures due to toxic chemistries. This is why we sugg est the mineral testing with our BIOREASONCE VEGA machine. To see the levels of the ch emistries and to see what is deficient or 'Too much' causing toxic side effects. At the beginning of your program we make sure the b ody has enough iodine, minerals, stronger immune system , hormonal correction, etc to make the program work faster and more effectively. Only fo ods and juices should be consumed at the same time you eat the flaxseed oil and cottage chee se. Always be sure at least an hour and a half or more has passed after consuming the flaxsee d oil and cottage cheese mixture before taking the TRICAN. 2. Do you recommend a Liver/Gallbladder cleanse? www.BudwigCenter.com 53 Our VEGA Energetic Test equipment will indicate whe ther you need to clean the gallbladder by showing if you have 'stones/sediment' in the liv er and gallbladder. The most effective program is a combination of 1 capsule with each mea l of pumpkin seed oil (3 per day for 30 days) and a product called SOLEAL which is a natural food supplement that effectively cleanses the liver and gallbladder of gallstones and debris. Recommended dosage is 1 capsule with each meal (3 per day) for 60 days. Ingredients: Rose hip (250 mg), Natural vitamin E ( 6 mg, 50% CDR *), Kiwi (5 mg) seed oil, Beta-carotene from marine alg ae (2 mg) Box of 60 soft gel capsules - 3 boxes of 60 capsules needed for full cleanse . 3. Is a 'needle biopsy' a dangerous procedure? The Budwig Center does not give advice about conven tional medical approaches and we always recommend you do your own research on these matters. As many degenerative disease tests are not 100% accurate, biopsies (wher e some tissue is removed and examined) is a very accurate way of determining the level of a d egenerative disease if any. However there is a down side. For educational purposes only we c an share with you the research we have uncovered. The tumor, unless it is pressing in an a rea that is life threatening, is really your 'friend', because it encapsulates all the toxins an d degenerative disease cells within a restricted area. Many have found that when they ha ve a biopsy and not one but often several needles puncture to the tumor, this causes these to xins to leak out and degenerative diseased cells to spread to the rest of the body. Several h ave reported a lot of pain and discomfort after a biopsy. We had a man from Greece come with a small tumor on the neck. He had a biopsy done and it swelled up like a coconut on the side of his neck and 2 months later he was dead! Using the full Budwig protocol addresses the original cause of the degenerative disease and the body will naturally cause tumors to shrink and leave the body (as all dead cells and toxins do through the eliminatory system). Many wh o come to our clinic have already had a tumor removed and almost inevitably it grows back b ecause the DNA of the cell reproduction has not been corrected. Removing the lymph system a lso takes away the protection that it affords to prevent the degenerative disease from s preading to the rest of the body. 4. What type of scans are best to detect degener ative disease and tumor activity? When If you want to know the level of active diseas ed cells and tumor you need a PET scan and not a CT or MRI scan. When diseased and tumor cells go necrotic (die), they wi ll still show up on CT & MRI scans with no indication that they a re dead. This may therefore give a false reading as the doctor will only see diseased and tu mor cells, be they dead or alive. However, PET scans indicate whether diseased and tumor cells are dead or alive. The bod y will eventually break down dead cells, but it takes time . The safest and very accurate VEGA test is what we do and recommend at the BUDWIG CENTER. 5. How can I balance hormones naturally? Once we do the VEGA Energetic Test we will know wha t will be needed and an effective remedy will be offered. TRICAN will balance the entire functioning of the body as it restores nutrition to the body on a deep DNA cellular level. Stops Hot Flashes, Decreases Stress & Illness, Fortifies Immune System, Increases. ENDROCRINE MENDER restores stamina, energy, balances hormones, helps with side effects of menop ause, premenopausal and controls Hot Flashes. Many have found just as effective as Horm one Replacement Therapy. Also an excellent remedy for prostate issues, thyroid issue s and sleep disorder, fibromyalgia, www.BudwigCenter.com 54 depression and type 2 Diabetes. TURMERIC (Curcuma) is a totally natural herb that helps detoxify the body and balances oestrogen levels so it is highly recommended if you have breast or prostate degeneration. It is also a natur al antiseptic and antibacterial agent, useful in disinfecting cuts and burns. 6. What is a natural remedy for cold feet? Rub some cayenne pepper on the bottom of each foot and then put on your socks and walk around for a minute or two. The cayenne will enter the 2,000 pores on the bottom of each foot. Leave the socks on all day. Do this once a da y and in a short time you will have toasty warm feet. Stop when they are warm enough and repea t if they start to get cold again after a few days. Caution: be sure to wash your hands care fully after using cayenne 7. How can I gain weight and increase my appetit e on this program? TRICAN will help correct weight issues especially w hen taken with Colostrum and probiotics. Weight lifters eat six (6) times a day and you will need to do the same. Dr Armin Grunewald (the nephew of Dr Budwig) also encouraged the consu mption of protein: acceptable sources are wild game, organic eggs, wild fish (not farm fe ed), 100% grass feed, organic chicken (NOT corn feed). Nuts are also a good natural source. Y ou need more protein when you have a degenerative disease and tumor because your body is fighting a degenerative disease and tumors and needs rebuilding. A strict vegetarian d iet is not recommended when you have a degenerative disease. Tahini (sesame seed puree) o n a rye cracker or sprouted bread with a dash of celtic sea salt is high in protein and calc ium and makes a very nice end of the day snack as well. Also lots of sweet potatoes which ar e high-calorie foods that are alkaline. Add some Quinoa - there are 382 calories in one cup. Yo u can add quinoa to soups. Or, have you tried millet? There are 600 calories in one cup of dry millet (150 calories in 1/4 cup). I occasionally make 1/4 cup millet for breakfast when I feel I need a little filler. Keep in mind that medication might be blocking good digestion. T here are various natural ways to try to improve digestion. The Gingerroot tea is incredible for improving your digestion. Please do NOT add extra honey to your diet. However, you coul d add more flax oil in Budwig ice cream, more oleolux in your steamed vegetables and soups a nd more raw nuts which contain healthy fats. Lots of raw, non roasted, non salted cashews are very good for weight gain (no peanuts allowed). Plus, Dr Budwig recommended a natural old -fashioned oatmeal gruel with freshly- ground flaxseeds added after cooking. She also rec ommended ground flaxseeds in champagne (or sparkling wine) which helps the seeds to be absorbed.. Especially before bedtime is a good time to eat because without any e xertion the weight is easily put on. 8. What can I do to overcome chronic constipation? ALOEDIS - Is a very effective product that BUDWIG C ENTER uses for constipation with very fast results However if you are not at the BUDWIG CENTER you can do the following: First of all you need to do the Deep Breathing/Trampoline/ Health Restoration prog ram already outlined in this Guide www.BudwigCenter.com 55 Cod Liver Oil - as taken in the Budwig program will normally solve any constipation issues. Increase dosage if you suffer from constip ation; lower dosage if you get diarrhea. A coffee or chlorophyll enema or even just a water enema will usually solve the problem A Castor Oil enema (should only be done once in 30 days) is a very effective remedy for serious constipation. First do a water enema a nd then warm up the castor oil and insert with a bulb type enema system, hold for 15 t o 20 min. Epsom Salts - drink 1 teaspoon in a glass (250ml) of water. Drink 1 to 3 times per day or more until you achieve results. Water - Drink water on an empty stomach first thing in the morning. Drink at least 2 liters per day as constipation is often linked to d ehydration. Add 1/8 of a teaspoon of 10. What is the main cause Breast tumors? The UK and USA have one of the highest incidence ra tes worldwide (together with the rest of North America and Australia/New Zealand), making th ese countries a priority for breast tumor awareness. You will notice in countries were woman rarely wear a bra there is much less, if any, breast tumors. View the map below to see how your country is impacted by breast tumors (The darker areas being the highest per capita): Breast degenerative disease and tumors are most com mon in women worldwide. It is also the principle cause of death from degenerative disease among women globally. Studies are linking this to wearing a bra. BE CAREFUL of the ty pe of bra you wear! We always recommend that all women and especially those with breast lum ps stop wearing the brassiere or wear it as little as possible because it cuts off the movement of the lymph system and traps toxins in the fatty tissues. Women find that after not wearing a bra for some time they get used of it. If this is not practical, wear a bra that is very loos e and is not tight around the rib cage. There is a whole series of new bras on the market t hat are excellent such as GeniBra, AireBra and Belvia Bra. They do not have the metal or hard plastic wire underneath. www.BudwigCenter.com 56 http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/features_ju lieshealthclub/2008/11/can-cancer- vani.html 11. Are there any safe pre-cancer degenerative d isease and tumor tests that can be done? Yes the Bio Resonance VEGA Energetic Frequency test can detect degenerative disease and tumors. We need to be very careful with submitting to CAT scans and Mammograms. First of all there is the issue of radiation. http://www.preventcancer.com/patients/mammography/d angers.htm 'Radiation from routine mammography poses significan t cumulative risks of initiating and promoting breast tumors. In a Swedish study of 60,000 women, 70 percent of t he mammographically detected tumors weren't tumors at all. These 'false positives' aren 't just financial and emotional strains, they may also lead to many unnecessary and invasive biop sies. In fact, 70 to 80 percent of all positive mammograms do not, upon biopsy, show any p resence of degenerative disease and tumor. (There is also a very concerned risk that cr ushing the breast tissue will spread the degenerative diseased cells if they are present). A t the same time, mammograms also have a high rate of missed tumors, or 'false negatives.' D r Samuel S. Epstein, in his book, The Politics Of Cancer, claims that in women ages 40 to 49, one in four instances of tumors are missed at each mammography. The National Cancer Institute (NC I) puts the false negative rate even higher at 40 percent among women ages 40-49. Nation al Institutes of Health spokespeople also admit that mammograms miss 10 percent of malig nant tumors in women over 50. Researchers have found that breast tissue is denser among younger women, making it difficult to detect tumors. For this reason, false negatives are twice as likely to occur in premenopausal mammograms. New Screening Technologies - While screening is an important step in fighting br east cancer, many researchers are looking for alternatives to ma mmography. Burton Goldberg totes the safety and accuracy of new thermography technologies . Able to detect tumors at a minute physical stage of development, thermography does no t use x-rays, nor is there any compression of the breast. Also important, new ther mography technologies do not lose effectiveness with dense breast tissue, decreasing the chances of false-negative results. Some doctors are now offering digital mammograms. Digita l mammography is a mammography system in which x-ray film is replaced by solid-sta te detectors that convert x-rays into electric signals. Though radiation is still used, digital ma mmography requires a much smaller dose. The electrical signals are used to produce images that can be electronically manipulated; a physician can zoom in, magnify and optimize differe nt parts of breast tissue without having to take an additional image Read more at : http://www.healthy- communications.com/mammograms_cause_breast_cancer.h tm At the BUDWIG CENTER we can offer a lymph drainage technique and ultra sound session in over the lymph and breast area to detect any trappe d toxins that could lead to breast cancer. The trapped toxins will be released often after one or two sessions. I recall having treated a woman in her thirties from Brazil who had lumps the size of dates in several areas of her breast. Toxins accumulate in fat cells. After a f ew sessions all the lumps naturally dissolved as the lymphatic system, which is out natural rubbish disposal system was activated and future breast tumor risk was prevented. www.BudwigCenter.com 57 Epsom salts to the water. This is very effective. If no results within 3 or 4 hours repeat Sunflower seeds - eat a handful of shelled, raw, un salted seeds every day 12. How can I overcome nausea and vomiting? NOMETEX - This is a small device that you attach to the wrist which has no side effects http://www.chemoband.com/nometex-anti-nausea-band-f or-chemotherapy.html Nausea - You may have to back off the program for a few days if you get ill due to the dying of degenerative disease and tumor cells. So start the program gently and if you have a strong reaction back off for 4 or 5 days if necessary. Ea se off on all the remedies and follow some of the suggestions here: Peppermint tea 2 teaspoons of dry peppermint leave s to 2 cups of water, boil and strain and add some Stevia and lemon juice if desired. If nece ssary you can drink up to a gallon (4 Liters) of this tea in a 24 hour period if very sick (accor ding to Dr Gerson). It washes out the bile and duodenum which then works better Epsom - teaspoon of Ep som salts in 1 glass (250ml) of water and sip on it throughout the day. This should relie ve the symptoms. Nausea might have something to do with the gallbladder or the liver. Early signs of magnesium deficiency include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and we akness. As magnesium deficiency worsens, numbness, tingling, muscle contractions and cramps, seizures (sudden changes in behaviors caused by excessive electrical activity in the brai n), personality changes, abnormal heart rhythms, and coronary spasms can occur. Severe magn esium deficiency can result in low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia). Magn esium deficiency is also associated with low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Eat oatmeal as your meal when weak and suffering fr om nausea. Try also raw grated carrots, apple sauce, mashed bananas, or watermelon. 'Gastrolyte' from a drug store. It comes in a pack et to mix with water. It hydrates, provides electrolytes and settles the tummy. It is very simi lar to a product for children called Pedeolyte. It is very light and easily tolerated by someone wh o is very ill. Cloves - chew on a fresh clove will help or take 1 x 500 mg of clove capsule 3 x day with water Clove oil - a few drops should stop vomiting and an infusion will relieve nausea Ginger tea - put the juice of a thumbnail size of f resh ginger in hot water. Leave to infuse for 5 to 10 minutes and drink or sip the tea. Or you can use 1 teaspoon of ginger powder in hot water, let sit for 5 minutes. 13. Should I have my amalgam (mercury) fillings removed? YES, YES, YES .....if you have black 'mercury/silver fillings this is dangerous to your health and your chances of recovering your health are in jeopa rdy until you have them replaced with a holistic natural ceramic substance. Every time you drink some hot liquids a little bit of the mercury from your fillings is released into your bo dy. Note: Be sure to look for a dentist that will use what is called a 'rubber damn' placed in t he mouth to catch the mercury shavings when they drill and/or an assistant needs to be on hand to vacuum the shavings at the same time so they do not go down your throat. Natural c eramic resin type material should be used to replace the metal fillings. Gold is more resist ant but some studies suggest that no metals of any kind should be used if possible in the mouth. The Budwig Center works with a bio-logical dentist who is bi-lingual and near to the clinic th at works with the full natural protocol and www.BudwigCenter.com 58 fees are very reasonable compared to USA and the UK . Arrangements can be made beforehand if you would like to have some mercury f illings removed during the two week clinical program. Telephone: +34 95 261 17 99 or +34 95 261 19 96 (Spain) Locat ed at Enrique de Egas 18 - 1E, Malaga . 14. I feel very tired most of the time. What cou ld be the reason? We would need to run our Energetic test on the pati ent or the hair and urine sample to see the underlying cause. Many are helped by doing Deep Breathing/Trampoline/ Health Restoration program already outlined in this Guide . Many patients get weak and it is often due to a lack of iron. In susceptible groups, such as the elderly and teenage women, up to 50% of Americans have been found to be deficient in iro n. Iron has long been known to be important for red blood cell function because of its fundamental role in the haemoglobin molecule. Our Center recommends daily intake (3 tablespoons or more) of Chlorophyll. Also Iron IV's and a natural iron supplements may be recommended. (Avoid synthetic iron as it may not be absorbed well and i s notorious for causing constipation). Also be sure to consume 5000 to 10,000 i.u. of Vitamin D3 which also helps with energy. The high amounts of Cod Liver Oil and the TRICAN in the Budwig program is also helpful. Nitric Oxide - dubbed the \"The Miracle Molecule\" - impacts the health of every cell, tissue, and organ. In fact, it is so important that the scientist s who discovered what it does for us won the Nobel Prize. Nitric oxide does a lot for us. Hundr eds of studies show that nitric oxide boosts circulation ... supports a healthy heart, increased ener gy ... and improves our sex lives. Without sufficient nitric oxide, we can feel fatigue d and worn down. It has the ability to expand blood vessels for better blood flow, which means more oxygen can reach the brain, heart, and other important organs. You can go the supplement rou te, or you can just boost nitric oxide production in the body naturally. Beetroot - Beets naturally boost the production of nitric ox ide in the body and help to support energy levels, largely due to the large amount of ni trates found within the root vegetable. Beetroot juice also supports immunity and helps to prot ect against cancer - two of many health benefits of beetroot. Thanks to the MIT breakthrough research it's clear that these foods must interact with the saliva and bacteria in your mouth. It is the only way to produce enough nitric oxide to reverse the deficiency that happens as we gr ow older. Wake Forest University scientists not only proved beets boosted nitric oxide, they act ually saw the effects in the brains of people who drank beet juice. And the MRIs showed that, just hours after drinking the beet juice, the brain was flooded with a steady flow of blood. So th ose areas received more oxygen and more nutrients than they would with lower nitric oxide le vels. Making your own fresh Beetroot juice is the best option. However, beetroot powder in capsule form is also available. You need about 1500 mg per day so look for the supplements that are p otent. The real magic happens however when beetroot juice is combined with Hawthorn exact . Hawthorn (Espino Blanco) is often used to prevent heart disease because it prevents arterial wal ls form becoming coated with plaque, acts as www.BudwigCenter.com 59 a calcium-channel blocker and helps the endothelial cells that line our blood vessels to secrete nitric oxide. Open the capsule of Beetroot extract and add along w ith 20 drops of hawthorn into water, juice, tea, FSOCC, or the carrot or vegetable smoothie or other foods then swish around in your mouth and chew for at least 30 seconds and then swallow. Th e beetroot and hawthorn must interact with your saliva to be the most effective. 15. How much should I exercise? Everyone can do the Deep Breathing and Health Restoration program even while in bed. You can hold any of the essential oils bottle near your nose and deep breath in the v apors for greater benefits. Other Morning Exercise is recommended if not too weak. Individualize it according to your strength - DON'T OVERDO IT. At our centre you can use a CHI Energy / Lymph drainage machine and/or rebounder [a mini- trampoline] because it helps clear the lymph system and promotes better drainage; the Reviber is another effective device for circulation and lymph activation. FEVER THERAPY with FIR Sauna Detox session is also very beneficial and we place a portable model in your place of stay. A go od walk every day in garden or beach like settings are also very good for the body and soul and for many people a good walk at th e pace their body can handle should be done every day. Peak Fitness Program - This hot trend in fitness is indeed making news - and b eing endorsed by famous celebrities and popular magazines. Some are e ven touting it as a \"way to lose weight in a hurry\". It's not cardio. Nor is it jogging or long distance ru nning. And it's not hour-long gym workouts or aerobic exercise classes. You see, scientists are discovering that it's intensity, not duration of exercise that may be the missing piece of the puzzle in becoming fit and slimming down. And this type of high-intensity exercise is especiall y beneficial for aging bodies. Here's what those who have discovered it love most: it takes a frac tion of the time of aerobic or cardio exercise - a huge relief if you're already feeling short on t ime. During 'peak exercises', you raise your heart rate b eyond your aerobic threshold and push it into your maximum intensity limit. Appropriate and safe for even seniors, intervals impro ve fitness by building new capillaries and a stronger heart and lungs. Your muscles benefit too, because this type of exercise helps create more mitochondria, the tiny motors that power cells. 1) Choose the form of exercise that you prefer such as w alking, swimming, cycling, cross country ski, elliptical, etc. 2) Do a 3 minutes warm up at regular speed Trad itional forms of exercise don't optimally benefit your body - or your heart. www.BudwigCenter.com 60 3) Then do 30 second very intense burst of exercise. If y ou are walking it would be a very fast 30 second walk (but not running) and then 90 se conds normal pace and then another 30 second burst of intense fast walking. Do this at l east 8 times for best results. 4) Apply the same program to whatever form of exercise you choose. I prefer an elliptical (resembles a cross country ski machine) because there is no hard impact on the knees and ankles but just a gentle rhythmic motion as in cross co untry skiing. 5) The intense 30 second burst should be so intense that you are panting and almost out of breath when you finish and you catch your breath aga in during the 90 second normal pace 6) Do this 2 or if possible 3 times a week This is a total 20 minute workout. Because you do the 3 minutes warm up and the 4 minute cool down you will probably not experience any muscle sore ness!

What food additives should I avoid? MSG is a neurotoxin, potentially toxic to everyone - even to those people who do not respond with adverse reactions such as migraine headache, a sthma, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, disorientation, and depression. We know that MSG kills brain cells in laboratory animals from studies where MSG was given in food and in drinking water. MSG causes macular degeneration (retinal degeneration). In one 2002 st udy (Ohguro et al) a high dietary intake of sodium glutamate as flavoring (Ajinomoto) caused gr oss changes in retinal morphology and function. Experimental Eye Research 75:(3),2002) no retinal damage was observed when MS G was fed to laboratory animals for a short period of time (a month), but that as time during which MSG was fed to those animals increased to 3 m onths and 6 months, so did observable damage. We know that learning disabilities and end ocrine disorders such as gross obesity and reproductive disorders often follow the death of br ain cells in animals. We also know that children and the elderly are most at risk from the toxic effects of MSG. These ALWAYS contain MSG: protein ( any protein that is hydrolyzed), Yeast extract, Yeast f ood, Autolyzed yeast, Yeast nutrient FOOD ADDITIVES (Here is a partial list of the most dangerous. In Eu rope they are identified with E numbers.

Is it good to do Coffee Enemas? COFFEE ENEMAS is still one of the most effective ways to detox th e liver and reduce pain (caused by harmful bacteria). However it is not re commended to do them on a long term basis as this could deplete minerals from the body. Usually it's good to do coffee enemas near the beginning of your program to fully detox the li ver. Three weeks of daily coffee enemas would be adequate and then maybe once or twice a mo nth for maintenance. Also chlorophyll enemas (using \u00bc cup of liquid chlorophyll in the wa ter) is very beneficial Coffee beans are toxic and should not be consumed when you have a degenerative disease. However you are allowed coffee in another \"way\". Yes a coffee enema is still one of the most effective ways to de tox the liver. Also research is now indicating that it even helps detoxify the lymph system. Some may find this concept a little awkward or distasteful, but the research done at the BUDWIG CENTER confirms that coffee enemas are effective no t only to cleanse the liver but to reduce pain If you are strong enough to do this therapy then by all means start as soon as you can. As the degenerative cells start to naturally die off with our program they need to be cleansed from the body as soon as possible to avoid 'auto-intoxic ation' which can be deadly. This procedure when followed properly is not danger ous. Use plenty of lubricate on the nozzle and the anus and do not push the nozzle into the body quickly but gently as per instructions here below. You will be surprised at just how easy this procedu re is. The patient will almost immediately feel lighter and better and if in pain will experie nce less pain. Most patients get into the routine of daily coffee enemas and even look forward to the benefits How often should one do coffee enemas? Once a day the first week, then every second day the following week and then do coffee enemas only i f you still have pain issues. Once the body is highly nourished with the TRICAN and the full Bu dwig program the liver, the parasites (using the RIFE TIME MACHINE and detoxification will occur naturally. A coffee enema is best done earlier in the day or early afternoon. Also it is best right after a bowel movement. To enhance the benefits of the coffee enema, we recommend a pu re spring (bottled drinking water or distilled or reverse osmosis water) enema to cleans e thoroughly the bowels beforehand followed immediately by the coffee enema The Green tea or chlorophyll enema is not as effect ive for detoxifying the liver but is an excellent option from time to time. It is a low-vol ume enema that remains only in the sigmoid colon. There is a duct between the sigmoid colon an d the liver called the entero-hepatic circulation system. When the stool reaches this poi nt, it contains many toxins, which are sent www.BudwigCenter.com 62 to the liver for detoxification. The coffee enema w ill increase the transit time in the bowel. The caffeine that is absorbed into the entero-hepat ic system causes the liver ducts, including the bile ducts, to empty (it actually causes the li ver to \"vomit\" out toxins) into the sigmoid colon and be eliminated. Releasing the toxins in th e liver ducts, makes room for toxins from the body to enter the liver for detoxification. The alkaloids in the caffeine stimulate the production of glutathione-S-transferase, which is a n enzyme that facilitates the liver detoxification pathways. The coffee enema is safe even for people who are se nsitive to caffeine because the coffee remains in the sigmoid colon, where it will not be absorbed, provided the proper amount is used and the enema bag is not place too high. You will need the following materials: /checkbld An enema bag or bucket, preferably one of clear pla stic that you can see through /checkbld A coffee machine to make 3 cups of coffee for male adult (2 cups for child or woman of 50/60 kg) /checkbld A tea pot to make 2 or 3 cups of green tea /checkbld 3 cups (3 x 250 mil) of pure water /checkbld Organic (if available) coffee fully caffeinated, dr ip grind coffee /checkbld Use 2 cups of coffee if you weigh around 60 kg and 3 cups for people approx 80 kg /checkbld Air mattress (especially if you are older or weak y ou should lie on a soft air mattress like you take to the beach...cover with plastic and o ld towels) /checkbld A plastic or metal type filter to strain the coffee (do not use paper filters as they contain many harmful chemicals) Note : Most pharmacies (except in the UK) carry the ene ma kits. Purchase the one with a bag and a tube and the nozzle. Do not use the one that is just a big pear shaped bulb. Supplier in the UK: Manifest Health Limited: www.manifesthealth.co.uk Supplier in Canada: http://drlwilson.com/articles/COFFEE%20ENEMA.HTM Supplier in USA : http://www.enemaequipment.com/ Procedure for Water Cleansing Enema /square4 Pour 2 or 3 cups of pure room temperature water int o the enema bag, Loosen the clamp to allow the water to run out to the end of t he catheter tip to get rid of any air bubbles and re-clamp the bag when all the air has b een removed from the enema tubing /square4 Use a coat hanger to hang the enema bag at least th ree feet above your back as you will be positioned on the floor on all fours. Mayb e put the enema bag on a door knob or towel rack. Do not hang it too high, as on a sho wer head, because it will be too www.BudwigCenter.com 63 forceful and the hose won't reach. It should flow v ery gently into the rectum and distal sigmoid colon only. It is not a high enema or colon ic. /square4 Place yourself on all fours, like a dog or horse, o n a thick towel or air mattress. Lubricate the end of the tube and the anus, and the n gently insert the catheter into the rectum about 4 or 5 inches (10 cm). Use lubrica tion, such food grade vegetable oil, olive oil, a vitamin E capsule, or KY jelly should be fine, unless you are chemically sensitive. It is generally a good idea to avoid pet roleum products. /square4 After gently inserting the tube into the rectum rel ease the clamp but not fully open...this could be too much at one time and cause s tomach pain... let the first (2 cups maximum) of water flow in slowly. Clamp the tu bing off as soon as there is the slightest amount of discomfort or fullness. Do not change positions or use an incline board to cause the enema to enter further into the colon; this defeats the purpose of this type of enema. /square4 You do not have to hold water in your body very lon g. This is to cleanse the colon. However for the coffee try to retain the enema for a minimum of 12 or more minutes so it can reach the liver and cause it to expel its toxins. Sometimes there will be an immediate urgency to get rid of it and that is fine . Or there may be a sharp pain, try to suffer through it. If you have sharp pains use les s liquid next time. Water helps to clean the stool out of the colon with the initial w ater enema so that next time around you can hold more of the enema longer. Never force yourself to retain it if you feel that you can't. When you have clamped the tubing, r emove the catheter tip and void when you have to. Procedure for the Coffee Enema /checkbld Put 4 cups (4 x 250 ml) of clean water into the cof fee machine and use 4 tablespoons of coffee (organic if possible). 4 cups will proba bly yield about 3 cups of coffee due to heat expansion and evaporation. Do not use a paper filter they are filled with chemicals. Use a nylon or metal permanent filter o r use the type of coffee machine that uses no filters /checkbld Allow coffee to cool down to a very comfortable, te pid temperature. Test with your finger. It should be the same temperature as a baby 's bottle. It's safer to have it too cold than too warm; never use it hot or steaming; b ody temperature is good. Do the same with the water. Some make the coffee extra st rong and then add a little cold water to cool it down, but if you make the coffee w ell in advance then it will have time to cool down is best. If you cannot wait, put some ice cubes in to cool it down faster /checkbld Now REPEAT the procedure for the water enema with t he coffee. Use old towels and for greater comfort use a pillow and bring along so me appropriately relaxing literature /checkbld When you have finished your session, rinse out the bag and tubing with boiling water or better still hydrogen peroxide (Agua Oxigenada i n Spanish) and hang it up to dry. If you feel wired or hyper, or have palpitations or ir regular heartbeats after a coffee enema, you should reduce the amount of coffee, usua lly by half for a few days or weeks. Or consider that you really need organic cof fee. Be sure the source of your water is good clean chemical-free spring, well, or filtered water. www.BudwigCenter.com 64 17 .

(This works with children too.) *************************************************** ******************* FUTURE TESTS When a patient seeks treatment for a certain illnes s most clinics give more or less the same protocol to all their patients. This may work some of the time, however a 'personalized' program is proven to produce faster and better resu lts. The BUDWIG CENTER using the VEGA Energy Frequency diagnostic equipment is able to do a complete body scan. This will help determine where the real origin and true cause of your health problems and at the same time recommend remedies that your body 'personally' needs to heal itself. Our equipment will verify all aspects of your health such as the major organs (ie heart, lungs, liver, brain gallbladder, etc), the backbone, teeth, tendons, hormones. Also muscles, parasites, viruses, harmful bacteria, Candida, infections as well as your emotional state of health which could be a major co ntributing cause to illnesses The body works like a complete unit, for example al l our teeth correspond to specific organs in the body. When all conventional diagnostic tests (physical an d biochemical) reveal no clues to the cause of a patient's complaints, the disorders are most l ikely functional in nature rather than morphological. The VEGA reveals about 80% of the otherwise undiagn osable cases of disease with common symptoms like migraines, backaches, and exhaustion, pain and sleep disturbance. Here is an email from just one of the many patients that did t he VEGA test noticed: This test can be done in conjunction with the Dr Na varro cancer test and/or standard medical tumor markers tests (PET scans, blood tests, etc.) However it goes way beyond many standard health tests as it is a total 'body scan'. There are several types of Bio Resonance testing eq uipment used in clinics around the world and they do not directly 'detect' cancer per say. The VEGA works on a 'total body test' and when there are disturbances in certain areas a mess age may come up that states: 'Need to www.BudwigCenter.com 65 treat or 'cys ts in process', etc, and the amount of times that message comes up is an indication of a 'low, m edium or high' level of suspicious diseased cells and/or energetic disturbance and degeneration in the body. Here are the steps to follow for the VEGA test: 1. Stop taking all natural herbal remedies and food su pplements as well as the flaxseed oil and cottage cheese for a day and then the follo wing morning collect the first urine of the morning, (fill it only about 75% full in cas e of freezing in transport) close the top tight and place it in a normal or bubble type envel ope. Some countries may have restrictions on sending any liquids of any kind. I f that is the case send us 3 grams (1/2 ounce of hair (cut or shaved from anywhere on the b ody) in a plastic bag. If you cannot send urine (some countries do not allow any liquids of any sort to be sent abroad) then just send us the hair samples 2. Write your name on the urine or hair sample specime n container or you could write it on a sticker and apply or better still so your name is perfectly legible print out your name using your computer and printer and then stick it to the container and another one on the plastic envelope with scotch tape. 3. Also we would need you to complete our HEALTH EVALU ATION (not by hand but using a computer so it will be very legible). If you have already sent us that before then simply print out a copy from your files, and includ e it in with the samples. We will also need the same Health Evaluation form sent to us by email, to PlanetBudwig@gmail.com 4) Send this envelope to: BUDWIG # 5 Local 11, Floor 1, Malaga 29007 (Mal aga) Spain You can send by Air Mail Express. Many ask us how long it w ill take to get the results. All depends on how fast your package reaches us because as soon as it comes in we can do the test and then email you the results. If you are in a really big hurry then send it by AIR EXPRESS POSTAL SERVICE which is almost as fast as Courier s ervices. Do not send it by Courier services as the Spanish Authorities often stop urine samples from coming into the country by courier. (Some just label it water and then they have no pro blems) Hair samples could be sent by Courier, however. Most Courier Services (eg UPS, D HL, Fedex, TNT) will not transport urine samples. Results of the test will be sent to your email address. www.BudwigCenter.com 66 BUDWIG CENTER RECIPES Most of the recipes below do not include any meat but can be eaten along with meat. However meat must be truly 100% organic. This is not always t hat easy to find. You can add wild game once a month, wild fish (not farm feed) and 100% grass feed beef. Organic chicken is also acceptable if NOT corn feed, once a week. As this may be difficul t you will probably find it best to eat mostly non-farm-fed fish (only eat fish which has fins and sca les).
