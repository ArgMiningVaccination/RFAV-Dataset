Over the recent years, a va riety of biologically active constituents have been isolated from these sources and confirmed to have multifunctional activity in experimental studies. Honokiol is a small-molecule polyphenol isolated from the genus Magnolia . It is accompanied by other related pol yphenols, including magnolol, with which OPEN ACCESSMolecules 2010 , 15 6453 it shares certain biological properties. Recen tly, honokiol and magnolol have been found to have anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti- tumor, and anti-microbial properties in preclinical models, without appreciable toxicit y. These findings have increased interest in bringing honokiol and magnolol to the clinic as novel therapeutic agents in dermatology. In this review, the findings concerning the major mechanisms of action of honokiol and magnolol are described. Knowledge of the multiple activities of honokiol and magnolol can assist with the development of honokiol and magnolol derivatives and the design of clinical trials that will maximize the poten tial benefit of honokiol and magnolol in the 1. Introduction Herbal therapy is becoming increasingly popular among physicians and patients [1,2]. Many medical plant preparations are marketed to the public for va rious ailments, including those of the skin [3-5]. Herbal therapies have been used successfully in Asia and Europe for treating dermatologic disorders (such as acne, wounds and burns, bacterial and funga l infections, dermatitis and psoriasis, and skin tumors) for thousands of years. In Asia, herbal tr eatments that have been used for centuries are now being studied scientifically. In United States, the he rbal products are considered as dietary supplements or cosmetic additives. Since there is no standardiza tion of active ingredients, purity, or concentration, this has made learning about and using these treatments challenging [6]. Figure 1. The chemical structures of (A) honokiol and (B) magnolol. Honokiol and magnolol (Figure 1) were initia lly described as components of the genus Magnolia , which are components of Chinese (Kampo) herb s, including houpo and saiboku-tu(o) [7]. In the 1990s, Molecules 2010 , 15 6454 honokiol and magnolol were found to have activity as free radical and lipid peroxidation inhibitors [8-11]. Thereafter, honokiol, magnolol, a nd a methanolic anti-inflammatory, stinal, and uterus modulation, cardiovascular and liver protective properties (Figure 2). The focus of this review are the recent findings regarding the biological effects of the antioxidative molecule s honokiol and magnolol in dermatology (Table 1). Knowledge of the multiple biological activities of honokiol and magnolol could assist with the development of honokiol and magnolol derivatives and the design of clinical trials that will maximize the potential benefit of honokiol and magnolol in th e patient setting for dermatologic disorders [12,13]. Figure 2. The flower, leaf, and bark of traditional Chinese medicinal plant Magnolia officinalis and the medicinal properties of honokiol/magnolol. 2. General Antioxidative Effects This inhibition of oxidative stress was demonstrated in vitro ; honokiol and magnolol reduce free radicals that generated by ultra-violet (UV) irradiation and inhibit UV-induced mutation in Salmonella [10]. This inhibition of lipid peroxidation was then ex vivo demonstrated in rat heart/liver mitochondria and human sperm [11,14]. It is approximately 1,000 times more potent than -tocopherol [11,15] in inhib iting lipid peroxidation in heart mitochondria and 340 times more potent in rat liver mitochondria [14]. In the in vivo animal studies, magnolol protects against small intestinal, cerebral, and hind limb ischemia-reperfusion injury [16-19]. The in vitro cell culture system reveals the possible underlying mechanisms that honokiol and/or magnolol inhibit resulting in the respiratory burst inhibition [21] and cellular protection [17,22]. Dikalov et al. studied the reactions of honokiol in cell-free and cellular systems Molecules 2010 , 15 6455 using electron spin resonance (ESR) and high-perf ormance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques suggesting that honokiol is an effective scavenge r of free radicals [23]. Additionally, the polyphenols may prevent formation of hydroxyl radical by chelati ng the transition metals such as copper and iron or repair molecules after free radical attack. Table 1.

Anti-Inflammation and Anti-Tumor Effects Oxidative stress and inflammation [24] play important roles in skin tumor promotion [25]. Skin cancer is the most prevalent of all cancer types and its inci dence is expected to increase substantially [26]. Chemoprevention involves the administration of ch emical agents to prevent initiation, promotion and/or progression that occurs during neoplastic development [26,27]. Konoshima et al. were the first to test the Magnolia officinalis neolignans, honokiol and magnolol, for inhibition of Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation induced by 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and concluded these plant derivatives exhibited rema rkable inhibitory effects on mouse skin tumor promotion in an in vivo carcinogenesis test [28]. Previous data showing blockade of inflammatory enzyme/cytokine production, nuclear factor (NF)- B activation, and leukocyte activation suggest that honokiol and magnolol would have anti-inflamma tory properties at clinically achievable concentrations [13]. Liou et al. found that honokiol inhibited PMA- or fMLP-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by neutrophils by distinct mechanisms in cluding: (i) honokiol diminished the activity of assembled-NADPH oxidase, a major reactive oxygen sp ecies producing enzyme in neutrophils; (ii) two other important enzymes for reactive oxygen species generation in neutrophils, i.e., myeloperoxidase and cyclooxygenase, were also inhibited by (GSH) ol and honokiol are important because incidences of skin diseases are also connected to immunological abnormalities. Honokiol/magnolol exhibits leukocyte suppression, anti-inflammation, and analgesic effect s via myeloperoxidase [30], mediator [31-33] and release well nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), basic fibroblast growth (bFGF), matrix edema [44]. The intracellular signa ling pathways involved in the the of the PI3K/Akt pathway [45], PKC [46,47], and redox-sensitive transcription factor NF- [48,49] activation, while the signal pa thways and kinases upstream of I B kinase (IKK) activation might be involved in the action of honokiol and magnolol [49]. Recent basic and clinical studies have implicated solar UV radiation in various skin diseases including premature aging and skin cancers. Chronic UV radiation exposure-induced skin disorders are caused by the excessive induction of inflammati on, oxidative stress and DNA damage. The use of chemopreventive agents, such as plant polyphenols, to inhibit these events in UV-exposed skin is gaining attention [27]. More recently, in addition to chemically induced skin cancer development, Chilampalli et al. studied the chemopreventive effects of honokiol on UVB-induced skin tumor development in SKH-1 mice, a model relevant to humans, and to elucidate the possible role of apoptotic proteins involved in the prevention of skin tumo r development. The honokiol-pretreated group exhibited significant reduction in tumor multiplicity as compared to the control group. Mechanistic studies showed the possible involvement of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and p53 activation to the induction of DNA fragme ntation and apoptosis. Their results show that honokiol acted as a potential chemopreventive agent to prevent UVB-induced skin cancer development, possibly by activating pro-apoptotic proteins through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways [50]. These results suggested that honokiol and magnolol may favorably supplement sunscreen protection, and may be useful for skin di seases associated with solar UV radiation-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. Ikeda et al. investigated the anti-metastatic e ffect of magnolol on tumor metastasis in vivo with experimental and spontaneous metastasis models with an experimental and spontaneous lung metastasis model using melanoma to clarify the mechanism [51]. In addition, magnolol inhibited proliferation of human malignant melanoma cells. It induced oligonucleosomal fragmentation of DNA in melanoma cells and increased caspase-3, 8, 9 activities followed by the degradation of caspase-3 substrates, inhibitor of caspase induces apoptosis by activation of both mitochondrial and deat h receptor pathways in melanoma cells [52]. These data from the in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that magnolol possesses strong anti-metastatic and tumor suppressing ability and that it may be a lead compound for drug development. Additionally, magnolol provides early protection ag ainst endotoxin challenge (following sub-lethal hemorrhage) by altering the course of endotoxin tolerance and cytokine response and attenuating peroxidative damage [53-55]. These findings have incr eased interest in bringing magnolol to the clinic as a novel anti-inflammatory and anti-anaphylaxis agent for inflammation. Preparations containing magnolol have also been used in pilot clinical trials for inflammation-related disorders [34-36,38,39]. 4. Anti-Microbial Effects Clark et al. first tested the significant anti-microbial ac tivity of magnolol using an agar well diffusion assay and found that honokiol and magnolol exhibited significant activity against Gram-positive and acid-fast bacteria and fungi [56,57]. The extract of Magnolia officinalis has been found to potently Molecules 2010 , 15 role in the pathogenesis of acne a nd seems to initiate the inflammatory process by producing proinflammatory cytokines. Since magnol ol had been known to exhibit antibacterial activities, Park et al. tested its antibacterial activity against Propionibacterium sp. In addition, they found the reduced secretion of IL-8 and TNF- induced by P. acnes in THP-1 cells indicating the anti-inflammatory effects of them [59]. Together with the previously known antibacterial activity against P. acnes and based on these results, it is suggest ed that magnolol may be introduced as possible acne-mitigating agents [60]. More recently, to improve the solubility a nd antibacterial activity of honokiol against E. and their solubility and antimicrobial activities were investigated by Kim et al. They reported that among the tested compounds, honokiol glycine showed improved water solubility and antibacterial activities against E. coli and P. aeruginosa when compared to honokiol [61]. 5. Safety of Herbal Preparations There are many herbal therapies available for derm atological diseases that patients have already begun to discover [62,63]. Many patients have the mi sconception that these have no adverse effects because herbs are \"natural\" [64]. However, herbal preparations vary greatly in their therapeutic indexes [65]. For example, some are consumed as f oods and have high therapeutic indexes, and others are highly biologically active and must be used very carefully [66]. Dermatol ogists must be educated not only in the benefits of these therapies, but must also be aware of some of the risks and potential adverse effects [67]. They need information about th e effects of herbal remedies in order to better serve their patients who may be using herbs to treat their dermatological conditions [6]. In addition to the adverse effects, patients should be counseled on the lack of regulation for herbal medicines. The design of clinical trials should be encouraged to maximize the potential benefit of honokiol and magnolol in the patient setting for dermatologic diso rders. Furthermore, quality-control measures to ensure the purity [68,69], concentration [70], or safe ty of herbal supplements should be standardized scientifically based on evidence-base medicine data [71,72]. 6. Conclusions Honokiol and magnolol have shown strong antioxi dative, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-microbial properties mediated by several mode s of action. Thus, honokiol and magnolol exhibit a desirable spectrum of bioavailability rather than othe r natural products. To fully realize the potential of honokiol and magnolol, clinical trials are neede d. Honokiol and magnolol analogues with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics will also make the field move forward. Safety during long-term administration, combined with its co st and future therapeutic potential, makes it an ideal agent for both prevention and therapy in dermatology either alone or in combination with other drugs. This knowledge is required for the development of future analogues, which may target either of these pathways, and for the development of clinical tr ials using honokiol and magnolol or their analogues. Further insights into the signaling network and in teraction points modulated by honokiol and magnolol Molecules 2010 , 15 6460 may provide the basis for novel discovery progr ams to exploit honokiol and magnolol for the prevention and treatment of dermatologic disorders.
