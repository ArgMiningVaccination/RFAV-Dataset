However, before vac-cines become fully integrated into thearsenal of weapons currently used totreat cancer, they must show not onlyefficacy but also safety and limited orno toxicity. Recently, a number ofcancer vaccines have moved into thestages of development where clinicalbenefits and good safety profiles canbe determined convincingly. Reports from a number of Phase II and Phase III studies suggest cancervaccines are not only well-toleratedbut that they are also meeting clinicalendpoints, ranging from significanttumour responses to improvements inmedian survival time. Results fromsuch trials build on a significant bodyof Phase I clinical data which suggestthat, in general, this class of thera-peutic is safe and that the attributedadverse event rate is low. Cancer vac-cines that have such a safety profile may be readily integrated into currentstandard-of-care regimens, particularlyin the first-line setting where combi-nation strategies TARGETED VS NON -SPECIFIC Cancer immunotherapies can broadlybe divided into two categories:tumour-specific and highly-targetedproducts, for example vaccines orantibodies that target a specifictumour antigen, and therapies whichmodulate the immune system in anon-tumour-specific way. An exampleof the latter is BCG, which has beenused for many years in the treatmentof bladder cancer and has beenshown to provide superior benefitsover chemotherapy regimens inpatients with a high risk of progres-sion. While the precise mode ofaction of the treatment is not known,it is accepted that it has an effect onthe immune system. Likewise, the cytokines IL-2 (interleukin 2) and IFNa (interferon ) have found widespread use in thetreatment of different malignancies,such as renal cancer and melanoma, yet they offer only modest benefits andfrequently lead to toxic side-effects. In between these two approaches lie cell-based therapies, in which wholetumour cells or cell extracts are used asthe immunogen. While tumour-specificimmune responses may be induced,the precise target(s) of the response isnot usually known. Furthermore,immune responses against other com-mon tissue antigens may also beinduced. Despite the lack of finespecificity of the immune responseinduced and the labour involved in theproduction of autologous, cell-basedtherapies, a number of products havecompleted Phase II and Phase III tri-als with promising results. The explosion in the identifica- tion of tumour-associated antigens(TAAs) in multiple cancer typeswhich occurred in the 1990s repre-sented a critical phase in the ability toapply tumour immunology research tothe development of immunotherapystrategies. This discovery enabled thedevelopment of targeted treatmentsand allayed some of the safety concernsover the deleterious autoimmune Richard Harrop* and Stuart Naylor*Cancer vaccines edge towards success A number of cancer vaccines are now entering the final stage of clinical development.

The successfultargeting of specific tumour antigensin vivo has been exemplified by theuse of monoclonal antibodies.Although they failed to live up to theirpromise in the 1980s, they have sinceenjoyed a renaissance in the treat- ment of different cancers, and thereare currently eight therapeutic anti-bodies approved by the Food andDrug Administration (FDA) billion in 2004.While the success of monoclonal A number of studies suggest cancer vaccines are not only well-tolerated but meet clinical endpoints KAREN KASMAUSKI / CORBIS / CONTRASTO30 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005DrugWatch antibody therapies cannot be denied, other targeted approaches are nowwaiting in the wings, including vacci-nation. Unlike monoclonal antibodies,which are usually delivered as a bolusinfusion, a vaccine's therapeuticpotential has to be transducedthrough multiple biological stepswithin each patient before any clinicalbenefit is realised. This offers bothadvantages and disadvantages over themore direct effects of infused mono-clonal antibody therapies. On the pos-itive side, a vaccine-based approach: Induces a broad polyclonal cellularand humoral immune response Leads to a response of potentiallygreater longevity, requiring fewerinjections Does not require 'humanisation' ofthe immune response, unlike the useof monoclonal antibody therapies,which are usually of murine origin Costs less However, success is dependent on the induction of a potent and 'appro-priate' immune response in a patientgroup that may be immuno-compro-mised. Furthermore, an efficaciousresponse may take a month or more toinduce. Despite these drawbacks, adiverse array of cancer vaccines hasmade the transition from pre-clinicalresearch to clinical development overthe past 5-10 years. The positiveresults now being observed in the clin-ic owe much to a greater understand-ing of the immune system, the timingand method used to deliver the thera-peutic antigen(s) and the increasedsensitivity of monitoring tools. THE MAIN CONTENDERS Given the time and money requiredto take a product from pre-clinicalresearch to pivotal Phase III clinicaltrials, only a small number of cancervaccines have to date progressed tothe stage at which efficacy can beestablished convincingly. However, clinical responses including tumourshrinkage, disease stabilisation andimprovements in time-to-disease pro-gression are being reported in con-trolled trials. And more importantly,statistically significant increases inpatient survival have been detected(see Table).For example, in June 2004, AphtonCorporation of Philadelphiaannounced the results of a Phase IIItrial of Insegia, a synthetic peptide,similar to a portion of the hormoneGastrin 17, linked to the diphtheriatoxin. The study compared Insegiawith placebo in patients withadvanced pancreatic cancer anddemonstrated a statistically signifi-cant increase in patient survival time;150 days for patients receiving thevaccine compared to 83 days forthose on placebo. And in February 2005, Seattle- based Dendreon announced encour-aging results for its immunotherapyproduct autologous cells loaded ex vivo men with asymptomatic,metastatic androgen-independent(hormone-refractory) prostate cancerwhen compared to placebo.According to the final three-yearintent-to-treat analysis of the ran-domised Phase III study, patientsreceiving Dendreon's investigationalproduct showed a 4.5-monthimprovement in median survival timeand a more than three-fold increasein survival after 36 months comparedto patients receiving placebo. This isnow being followed up with a secondPhase III clinical trial, with the objec-tive of confirming recent findings so that FDA approval of Provenge maybe sought. Other immunotherapies have led to positive results in subsets of treat-ed patients, for example, antibodyresponders in Aphton's Phase trialof Insegia in colorectal cancerpatients, in including CancerVax'trials of Canvaxin in melanoma. Inthe latter study, retrospective analysesshowed treatment with Canvaxin,which consists of irradiated cancercell lines, significantly improved sur-vival of patients with stage IVmelanoma. The median overall sur-vival time of 268 patients with thecancer, who received Canvaxin fol-lowing the surgical removal of theirtumours, was 42.4 months comparedto 14.3 months for 170 historical con-trol patients who did not receive thevaccine. Furthermore, a Phase IIb study of Canadian firm Biomira's BLP25 lipo-some vaccine, a synthetic MUC1peptide encapsulated in a system, has shown encourag-ing improvements in overall survivalin non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC) patients - although it did notquite attain statistical significance -and it has been granted fast-trackapproval by the FDA. Another candidate is TroVax, a vaccine based on the TAA 5T4 deliv-ered by attenuated vaccinia virus,MVA (modified vaccinia Ankara),under investigation by OxfordBioMedica in the UK. A recent announcement reported interim data from two Phase II clini-cal trials in which TroVax was admin-istered in combination withchemotherapy to patients with late-stage colorectal cancer. Immune responses specific to antigen 5T4 were observed in 100%of patients who were suitable for analysis. This observation is particu-larly encouraging given that a retro-spective statistical analysis of datacollated from a Phase I/II studyshowed a highly significant correla-tion between the strength of 5T4-spe-cific immune responses and Transgene France. TEMPERED EXPECTATIONS Cancer vaccine strategies are often atodds with classical clinical develop-ment approaches. For example, theyare usually trialled in potentiallyrefractory patient groups in which theability to galvanise an immuneresponse may well be compromised.And the decision as to where a cancervaccine is best placed as a therapeu-tic is a difficult one. Scientifically, the adjuvant setting, in which diseaseburden is minimal, may well repre-sent the optimal slot to detect clinicalbenefits. However, it requires a bolddecision to commit to this type ofstudy, because large patient numbersare required and clinical endpointsare protracted. Financially, this trans-lates to trials that are exceptionallyexpensive to conduct and that takemany years to yield results, and this isproblematic, especially for biotechcompanies. The selection of bothindication and setting, whether adju-vant, first-line or second-line treat-ment, has to balance the speed inreaching clinical endpoints with thetime needed for the immuneresponse to become effective in 'dis-ease management'. The expectation that vaccines will cure cancer may have to be tem-pered in certain indications and set-tings. While tumour regressions havebeen in a number of clinicaltrials, stabilisation of disease leadingto enhanced survival may be a morerealistic expectation in patients with large tumour burdens or with rapidlygrowing cancers.Despite the challenges, this is anexciting time for the cancer vaccineinvestigational arena. Results fromsome of the Phase III trials, such asstudies on Canvaxin, GVAX andPANVAC-VF should be available thisyear or early 2006. If the primary objectives are met, product registration could followwithin a year or two. Furthermore, important advances are being made in the search for sur-rogate markers and the ability to pre-dict whether individual patients arelikely to respond to a specific treat-ment. Such information will help torefine the design of clinical trial pro-tocols and target patients who aremore likely to gain benefit from theimmunotherapy. Subsequently, it ishoped that cancer vaccines will soonbecome commonplace alongside sur-gery, chemotherapy and radiotherapyfor the treatment and management of cancer.

Yet in Europe, green tea is drunk by few.Which is a pity, because it is probablythe healthiest choice. Like black tea,green tea is made from the leaves ofthe tea plant Camellia sinensis . The difference is essentially that, forblack tea, the leaves are fermented,while for green tea they are not.Green tea therefore contains plentymore chemicals called polyphenols.These are It is theseingredients that may make green teagood for our health. Years ago, epidemiologists noted that cancer rates in populations thatconsume green tea were lower thanexpected. We should not get tooexcited about such findings. Forinstance, tea drinkers could also beavoiding things that cause cancer orhave a lifestyle that protects them.But encouraging results about greentea kept coming in and eventuallyformed a compelling body of evi-dence. The curiosity snowballed and,currently, research into the health aspects of green tea is buoyant.Studies in test tubes show that theingredients of green tea inhibittumour growth and cause the deathof cancer cells. In animal experi-ments, green tea impedes the devel-opment of chemically induced can-cers. Some green tea ingredientsseem to enhance the effect of anti-cancer drugs. Other compounds pro-tect our organs against the damagethat cancer drugs can have, forinstance, on the heart. Taken along-side chemotherapy, green tea couldmaximise the benefits of such drugsand minimise their risks. These effects may be valuable for a range of cancers. Importantly, theyare supported not just by one or twoinvestigations, but by dozens of stud-ies from around the world. But the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Do we have data from clinical tri- als, or is all this based on lab experi-ments? So far few such studies havebeen completed. A rare exception is aprospective investigation from Chinaof 254 women with ovarian cancer.While 78% of the green tea drinkerssurvived for longer than three years, the figure was only 48% for theabstainers. The authors of this studytherefore believe that \"increasing theconsumption of green tea ... mayenhance epithelial ovarian cancersurvival.\" Another analysis found similar effects for sufferers ofprostate cancer. Antioxidants in green tea are not only important for cancer, they mightalso play a role in cardiovascular dis-ease. Regular green tea consumptionnormalises lipid metabolism, reducesblood pressure, slightly lowers bodyweight, stabilises glucose metabolismin diabetes patients, and might evenneutralise some effects of smoking.Collectively these effects are likely toamount to a significant protectionfrom heart disease, stroke and othercardiovascular problems. However, clinical trials are again scarce. A Japanese team observed203 patients who underwent a coro-nary angioplasty. Of these, 109 hadcoronary artery disease while the resthad normal coronaries.

The authors were optimistic: \"The more green teapatients consume, the less likely theyare to have coronary artery disease.\"Before you rush out to buy a car loadof green tea, a word of caution. All these findings are encouraging but,to be sure, we really need the resultsof clinical trials. These will take awhile to come through. The goodnews is that green tea is delicious and refreshing. The bad news is that tomatch the dose used in the researchstudies, you need to drink up to 12cups a day.DrugWatch In a Chinese study, 78% of green tea drinkers, but only 48% of abstainers, were alive at three years "}
