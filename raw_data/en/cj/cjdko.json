Energy Healing Sound, Reiki, Crystal, and Aroma Therapies can help you get to back wholeness. My multi-modality sessions are designed with your needs, your individual energetic blueprint, and your circumstances in mind. My energy work is chakra-based, working to balancing your energy centers, so that you feel better physically, psychologically, emotionally, and spiritually. Intuitive Guidance Humans are social beings, here with a purpose. Feeling disconnect and alone or without a clear sense of your true calling can make you miserable and depressed. I can help you feel more connected to your higher self and guides, tune into your highest good about your love life, and discover your purpose. Remote Sessions All of my 1:1 services are globally available. Healing sessions are often more powerful because you are able to relax into your own space. Intuitive Guidance sessions through Zoom are just as profound as in-person. And, recorded or livestreamed classes and meditations are so much more convenient for you. Group Sound Spas Experience the relaxing and therapeutic benefits of a sound bath in a spa-like atmosphere. My Sound Spa events are designed to offer healing soundscapes in a serene setting. So much more than a sound bath, Sound Spas include soothing and therapeutic sound from a wide variety of instruments in a peaceful atmosphere with massage tables, blankets, and cushions for your comfort. Special Events & Ceremonies Unique and magical, my Special Events are amazing experiences. These classes are usually a combination of different meditative and healing techniques and may include: meditation, ceremony, journaling, affirmations, journeying and sound baths. Offered periodically (like on the Full and New Moons) and seasonally, my Special Events are sure to delight, empower, and deepen your experience of life. Guided Meditation In addition to my private practice, I am also the owner of Meditation Bar, a meditation studio established in 2015. Our meditations are expertly-designed to combine the most effective meditation techniques. Me and my staff are highly-trained and experienced Meditation Guides, and our classes are accessible to all levels of meditation experience. On-Demand Meditation When the pandemic hit in 2020, Meditation Bar went online immediately. As the owner of Meditation Bar, I am proud of how the business, our clients, and our staff weathered the storm with meditation as a self-nurturing technique. We are creating a continually-growing on-demand library of our best livestreamed classes. Rent the best of our offerings, and meditate when it fits your schedule. So convenient and easy. Products Crystals and gemstones have meaning. From my extensive experience with crystal healing, I know crystals are our powerful allies in navigating this experience here on Earth. I have spent thousands of hours studying and working with gemstones and am honored to help you use them in your own chakra work and in making your home or business a sacred space. "}
