Introduction Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most com- mon aggressive and chemotherapy-refractory liver malignancy. Over the past decade, it has become a signi cant global concern due to its increasing diagnostic incidence and accompanying mortality rates.1The majority of patients have already reached advanced-stage disease at the time of diagnosis and only a few patients are suitable for curative hepatic resection.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis emerged as a powerful tool for revealing cellular diversity and intercellular communication at single-cell resolution.11-13Recently, scRNA- seq has been applied to dissect the complex tumor and im-mune landscapes of several cancers, including glioblastoma, has improved our understanding of cellular heterogeneityand facilitated the screening of promising molecular targets to guide anti-tumor therapies. However, tumor heterogeneity and the interplay between malignant cells and niche cells at single-cell resolution in human ICC remains poorly understood. In this study, we used a droplet-based scRNA-seq sequencing platform (10x Genomics) to pro le single cells from human ICC and adjacent tissues. We identi ed high inter-tumor heteroge- neity in ICC samples along with prominent immunosuppressive characteristics in CD4 regulatory T cells (Tregs). Furthermore, we dened 6 broblast subclusters in ICC and adjacent tissues, among which CD146 +vCAFs comprised the majority of CAFs in ICC tissues and could signi cantly induce enhancer of zeste ho- molog enhance interleukin (IL)-6/IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) axis. Furthermore, exosomal miR-9-5p derived from ICC cells strongly induced vCAFs to promote ICC progression. Together, our results providea comprehensive transcriptomic overview and dissect theintercellular crosstalk between ICC cells and vCAFs, suggesting potential targets for ICC therapy. Materials and methods ICC samples We obtained human ICC samples from the Fifth Medical Centerof Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital (Beijing,China), with Institutional Review Board approval (2017041D). Library preparation and sequencing Single-cell transcriptomic ampli cation and library preparation were performed by Capitalbio Technology Corporation and Berry Genomics Corporation using single-cell or v3 (10x Geno- mics) according to manufacturer's instructions. For further details regarding the materials and methods, please refer to the supplementary information and the CTAT table .Results Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed the complexity of human ICCs To investigate cellular diversity and molecular signatures in ICCtissues, we generated scRNA-seq pro les from 4 treatment-na\u00efve ICC samples, 1 recurrent ICC sample, and 3 adjacent tissues using10x Genomics sequencing ( Fig. 1 A; Dataset GSE138709). The clinical characteristics and H&E staining of these patients are presented in Table S1 and Fig. S1 . After stringent ltering, 31,302 cells from Dataset 1 were retained for further analysis. Following gene expression normalization, we conducteddimensionality reduction and clustering using principal compo- nent analysis and stochastic neighbor embedding(tSNE), respectively. Thereafter, copy number variation (CNV) analysis was employed to distinguish malignant and non- malignant cells ( Fig. S2A -C). These cells could be assigned to 10 distinct cell types ( Fig. 1 B) using known marker genes: malignant cells (11,601 cells, 37.1%, marked with EPCAM, keratin 19 [ KRT19 ], and ); cholangiocytes (546 cells, 1.7%, marked with FYXD2, TM4SF4 ,a n d ANXA4 ); hepatocytes (328 cells, 1.0%, marked with APOC3, FABP1 ,a n d APOA1 ); B cells (827 cells, 2.6%, marked with MS4A1 and CD79A ); T cells (10,883 cells, 34.8%, marked with CD2, CD3D, and CD3E ); ); cells, 2.4%, marked with CLEC9A and CD1C );broblasts (498 cells, 1.59%, with COL1A2 ); and endothelial cells (823 cells, with ENG and vWF;Fig. 1 C,Table S2 ). Remarkably, the malignant patient-specic, suggesting prominent molecular inter-tumor heteroge- neity in the ICC samples ( Fig. 1 D, and Fig. S2C ), while the pro- portion of each cell type varied greatly by sample ( Fig. 1 E). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and marker genes, asshown in the tSNE plots, con rmed the accuracy of cell identity (Fig. 1 F, and Fig. S2D ). T ranscriptomic inter-tumor heterogeneity of malignant cells in human ICCsIn this study, we identi ed 6 main subclusters following the reclustering of all the malignant and normal epithelial cells(Fig. 2 A). The malignant cells (subclusters 0 -3) displayed a high degree of inter-tumor heterogeneity, consistent with a previous study which reported that somatic mutations are patient- speci and APOE) possessed a lower CNV signal and were localized in adjacent tissues (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, subcluster 0 malignant cells were char- acterized by high expression levels of mesenchymal markers COL1A1, bronectin, and IGFBP7 mesenchymal transition (EMT) 1 high expression levels of the malignancy-promotingfactors S100P and FABP5 ; subcluster 2 exhibited high levels of the immune-associated genes CD74 and HLA-DRA ; and subcluster 3 malignant cells, from the recurrent patient,displayed high expression levels of SPINK1 (Fig. 2 B). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) indicated that these subclusters shared common activated signatures, such as IL6/STAT3, WNT, TGF, and TNF signals, alongside the EMT-dominant signature (subcluster 0), interferon response-dominant signature (subcluster 2; Fig. 2 C). In addition, Journal of Hepatology 2020 vol. 73 j1118 -1130 1119we employed the single-cell regulatory network inference (SCENIC) method to identify SNAI2, MYC, and STAT1 as the underlying transcription factors in the different signatures (Fig. 2 D, and Fig. S3 ).Moreover, our scRNA-seq data revealed that malignant sub- clusters exhibited diverse expression levels of the mature chol-angiocyte KRT19 E Percp-cy5.5-7AAD FACS sorting 10x genomics mRNA sequencing Tumor (n = 5) Adjacent (n = 3) Cell atlasbioinformatic analysisIsolate live cell Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomaPaired tumor and -25 Fig. 1.

Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that higher expression ofSPINK1 in patients with ICC was associated with worse sur- vival ( Fig. 2 G). quantitative reverse transcription PCR further showed indi- cated that SPINK1 was required for tumor sphere propagation, colony formation, invasion, and drug resistance ( Fig. S5, S6 ). Taken together, these results reveal a high degree of inter-tumorheterogeneity in patients with ICC and show that SPINK1 is closely associated with poor prognosis. Immunosuppressive tumor-in ltrating Tregs were enriched in human ICC tumors Tumor-in ltrating immune cells are highly heterogeneous and have been shown to play important roles in immune evasion and response to immunotherapy. 24In this study, the T and NK cells exhibited 8 distinct subclusters ( Fig. 3 A) and the tSNE plot revealed the subcluster distribution among sample pathology(Fig. 3 B). According to their top 30 DEGs, T cell and NK cell 7; Fig. 3 C, D). In addition, we found that CD8 T cell sub- populations (subclusters 0, 1, 3, and 6) expressed different such S7A ), and the proliferating CD8 T cells (subcluster 6) expressed a certain number of exhaustionmarkers, such as lymphocyte-activation gene 3 protein ( LAG3 ), Ig orHAVCR2), suggesting CD4 Tregs (C7 -Tregs -FOXP3) were characterized by the expression levels of immunosuppression markers such as TIGIT, cytotoxic T mainly derived from adja- cent tissues were characterized by high GZMB, GZMK, PRF1, and KLRF1 expression, indicating that these cells remained cytotoxic or activated ( Fig. 3 D, E). Pervasive changes in cancer-associated T and NK clusters were revealed by enriched signaling pathways, including communication inferred by ligand-receptor analysisindicated that the TIGIT-PVR pair was enriched between Tregs and malignant cells ( Fig. 3 F), suggesting that blocking the TIGIT- PVRaxis may affect the interaction of Tregs with malignant cells and could be an effective therapeutic strategy for ICCs. Takentogether, our single-cell analyses reveal that Tregs display highlyimmunosuppressive characteristics and suggest that manipula- tion of Tregs could present a novel therapeutic strategy for ICCs. Distinct broblast subpopulations in human ICC ecosystem An intense desmoplastic reaction is a hallmark of ICC, as demonstrated by picrosirius red and a-SMA IHC staining (Fig. 4 A). The 498 broblasts in our unselected viable strategy of scRNA-seq analyses (Dataset 1) accounted for only 1.59% of allviable cells, which re flects the challenge of capturing thesepopulations ( Fig. 4 B). Therefore, we used a negative selection strategy (EpCAM CD45CD31cells) to enrich the broblast population in 2 ICC samples ( Fig. 4 B; Dataset 2, 13,150 cells). After stringent ltering, we obtained 2,941 high-quality bro- blasts that were clustered into 6 subpopulations, of which 5 broblast clusters (subcluster 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) were mainly enriched in ICC tissues, whereas subcluster 5 was mainly present in adjacent tissues ( Fig. 4 C). All 6 subclusters expressed high levels of canonical broblast markers such (a-SMA ),COL1a2 con rming broblasts; however, each subcluster displayed distinct transcriptomic signatures(Fig. 4 D). Subcluster 0 broblasts accounted for the majority of the broblast populations (57.6%) and were characterized by microvasculature (MCAM) , chemokines such as IL-6 and CCL8 (Fig. 4 E). Thus, we designated them as vascular CAFs (vCAFs, vCAFs-c0-MCAM). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of vCAFs indicated signi cant enrichment for muscle contraction, response to hypoxia, and mesenchymal cell prolif- eration, consistent with their microvascular signatures ( Fig. 4 F). Subcluster 1 broblasts expressed low levels of a-SMA but high levels of extracellular matrix the GO terms enriched for this subtype were associated with ECM andcollagen bril organization, so we accordingly designated them as matrix CAFs (mCAFs, mCAFs -c1-POSTN, Fig. 4 E, F). Like subcluster 2 broblasts expressed low levels levels of complement genes ( C3and In addition, the GO terms enriched for this subcluster were related to ECM, in flammatory response regulation, and complement activation, indicating thatthis subcluster may engage in immune modulation. Accordingly,broblasts named in flammatory CAFs (iCAFs, iCAFs- c2-FBLN1; Fig. 4 E, F). Consistent with a previous report of mouse KPC tumors broblasts complex II (MHC-II) genes such as CD74, HLA- DRA, and HLA-DRB1 . Moreover, the GO terms enriched in this subcluster were related to leukocyte cell-cell adhesion, response to IFN- c, antigen processing, and antigen presentation via MHC- II; we therefore termed them antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs,apCAFs -c3-CD74; 4 E, F). Subcluster 4 broblasts mainly expressed epithelium-speci c marker genes such as KRT19, KRT8, and Fig. 4 D). Finally, subcluster 5 broblasts were mainly derived from adjacent tissues and expressed high levelsof lipid metabolism and processing related genes, includingAPOA2, FABP1, FABP4 obroblast -c5-FABP1 ( Fig. 4 D). Next, we investigated the correlation between vCAFs and mCAFs using scRNA-seq data and human ICC bulk RNA-seq data, nding that the vCAF signature in ICC was highly correlated with proliferation and microvasculature metagenes, whereas the mCAF signature was closely S8 ). 26Notably, we re-analyzed scRNA-seq data from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitortherapy, and our results were clearly veri ed in Ma et al. 's ICC scRNA-seq data ( Fig. S9A -C). 21We further con 73 j1118 and Biliary Cancerpresence of Interestingly, were mainly localized in the tumor core and microvascular region, suggesting that they undergo intense interactions with ICC cells. Conversely,POSTN+mCAFs were localized in the invasive front of tumor nests, predominantly within collagen-rich stromal streaks, sug- gesting that mCAFs are closely associated with ICC invasion.

The IL-6/IL-6R axis was enriched in the interplay between vCAFs and ICC cells To explore the interactions between ICC cells and niche cells, we conducted intercellular interaction analyses based on ligand- receptor pairs. Interestingly, broblasts expressed more ligands corresponding to the receptors expressed by malignant cells (Fig. 5 A). In addition, the IL-6/IL-6R pair was enriched in the interactions between vCAFs and malignant cells ( Fig. 5 B, Fig. S11A ), consistent with the nding that malignant subclusters display common activation signatures such as IL-6-STAT3 signaling upregulation ( Fig. 2 C). Moreover, IHC staining veri ed that IL-6 expression was mainly localized in the CD146+micro- vascular region ( Fig. 5 C), in accordance with our scRNA-seq ndings that IL-6 was highly expressed in the vCAFs (Fig. 4 D,E). We also isolated and expanded CD146+vCAFs from ICC tissues. Flow cytometry analysis and immuno fluorescence staining demonstrated that the vCAFs were positive for canonicalmesenchymal markers and IL-6 expression ( Fig. 5 D and Fig. S11B). Furthermore, we assessed the cytokines secreted by vCAFs using antibody microarray pro ling, 27nding that IL-6 was highly secreted by vCAFs. Importantly, even higher IL-6 secretion levels were detected in the vCAFs when they inter- acted directly with ICC cells ( Fig. 5 E). Additionally, IL-6 expres- was signi cantly upregulated when vCAFs were treated with conditioned medium from ICC cells ( Fig. 5 F, and Fig. S11C) or transwell co-cultured with ICC cells ( Fig. 5 G, and Fig. S11D ). Quantitative PCR (qPCR), western blotting, and ELISA further veri ed that IL-6 was highly expressed in the vCAFs (Fig. S11E ). Collectively, these results indicate that the IL-6/IL-6R axis is enriched in the interplay between vCAFs and ICC cells. Contribution of vCAFs to ICC tumorigenesis and cancer stemness via the IL-6/IL-6R axis To further explore whether vCAFs could contribute to ICC pro- gression, we subcutaneously injected luciferase-labeled ICC cellsinto nude mice alone or with vCAFs. We found that vCAFs signicantly accelerated tumor growth, as demonstrated by in vivo luciferase imaging, tumor volume, and tumor weight analysis ( Fig. 6 A). Moreover, cancer stem cell markers such as CD13, CD90, and EGFR were markedly increased when vCAFs were directly co-cultured with GFP-positive ICC cells ( Fig. 6 B). We also established vCAF/sphere transwell co-culture systemand found for- mation ( C); however, this effect was when treated IL-6R inhibitor, was used as a control ( Fig. 6 D). Consistent with these results, tumor sphere formation was signi cantly enhanced by the exogenous addition of IL-6, but not TGF- b1 (Fig. 6 E), while silencing IL-6Ra in ICC cells signi cantly repressed the sphere-promoting effects of vCAFs ( sion ( Fig. 6 G) and their sphere-promoting of vCAFs on tumor spheres was potently abrogated ( Fig. 6 H). Collectively, these data suggest that IL-6 secreted by vCAFs could signi cantly cells.Tumor exosomal miR-9-5p elicited IL-6 expression in vCAFs, epigenetic alterations in ICCWe used cDNA microarray analysis to explore the gene expres-sion in GFP-positive ICC cells after direct co-culture with vCAFs(Fig. 7 A). GO analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly enriched for epigenetic alterations including chromatin expressed epigenetic modi- cation factors in ICC samples compared to adjacent tissues us- ing our bulk cDNA microarrays (ICC and adjacent, n = 3) andhuman ICC TCGA bulk sequencing data (ICC, n = 36; adjacent, n = 9). We obtained consistent results showing that the epige- netic modi cation Fig. Depletion of EZH2 in ICC cells attenuated the proliferative capacity of tumors ( Fig. S12C). Moreover, tumor sphere formation was remarkably repressed by the addition ofsmall molecule EZH2 inhibitors (GSK126 contribute to epigenetic alter-ations, such as EZH2 upregulation, fostering ICC malignancy. Next, we explored whether IL-6 secreted by vCAFs could induce EZH2 upregulation Our scRNA-seq IHC staining veri ed that and IL-6R were highly expressed in tumor nests ( 7 Exogenous IL-6 ICC EZH2 downregulation was following IL-6Ra knockdown in ICC cells (sh IL-6Ra ;Fig. 7 D, E). Consistently, EZH2 expression was markedly downregulated in ICC cells when treated with the IL-6 signaling inhibitors SC144 (gp130 inhibitor) secreted by tumor cells can instruct the stroma to foster tumor progression, we puri ed exosomes from conditioned medium of ICC cells according to a standard protocol, as veri ed by electron microscopy and western blotting ( Fig. S14A ). Intriguingly, IL-6 was remarkably upregulated the vCAFs treated with exosomes from ICC cells ( Fig. 7 F). Exosome-encapsulated miRNAs are abundant and haverecently been implicated in the crosstalk between tumor and stromal cells 28-30; therefore, we hypothesized that exosomes derived from ICC cells might encapsulate miRNAs to mediate the upregulation of IL-6 expression in vCAFs. To validate this hypothesis, we used qPCR assays to detect the exosomal miRNA pro les of ICC cell-conditioned medium. Considering the close association between IL-6 and in flammation, ICC cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used as thepositive control. A panel of miRNAs, including miR-9-5p ,miR- upregulated by LPS stimulation(Fig. 7 G,Fig. S14B). Thereafter, ELISA, western blotting, and qPCR assays indicated that miR-9-5p markedly promoted IL-6 expression in the vCAFs ( Fig. 7 H, and Fig. S14C). When vCAFs were stably transfected with miR-9-5p , tumor formation in the transwell co-culture system was signi cantly elevated compared to the control vector ( Fig. 7 I). Collectively, these ndings suggest that ICC cell-derived exosomal miR-9- 5psignicantly induces in vCAFs, in turn leading to EZH2 upregulation and enhancing malignancy in ICC cells ( Fig. 7 J).

ICC tissues are characterized by an intense desmoplastic reaction during which activated CAFs surrounding ICC cells are believed to play a pivotal role in ICCprogression. However, cellular diversity of CAFs and how the CAF subsets interact with ICC cells at single-cell resolution have not been well de ned. ScRNA-seq analysis has been used to elucidate constituent cell types including CAFs in humanmelanoma, lung cancer, 17and head and neck cancer.18Due to the restrictions in the number of broblasts analyzed and the limitations of scRNA-seq methodology, clearly discriminatingCAF subsets at single-cell resolution remains a challenge. Several pioneer groups have used a negative selection strategy to enrich broblasts by depleting EpCAM +CD45+CD31+cells in scRNA-seq analysis. Bartoschek et al. have de ned 3 distinct CAF subsets in genetically engineered mouse models of breastcancer, revealing the spatial separation of CAF subpopulationsof different origins. 26Elyada et al. applied this strategy to enrich broblasts from mouse and human PDAC samples and demonstrated the presence of 3 CAF subtypes: myo broblastic CAFs, iCAFs abilityto present antigens to CD4 T cells and potentially modulate the immune response. 25We de ned 6 distinct broblast subtypes in human ICC and adjacent tissue, of which vCAFs, mCAFs, iCAFs, apCAFs, and eCAFs were found in ICC tissues and lip- obroblasts were mainly found in adjacent tissues, revealing that the desmoplastic microenvironment of ICC is highly heterogeneous. In this study, vCAFs were the most prevalent broblast subpopulation and expressed high levels of IL-6 levels and were speci cally distributed in the tumor core and microvascular region, suggesting their close interactions withICC cells. Furthermore, we found that the IL-6/IL-6R pair was signicantly enriched in the interactions between vCAFs and ICC cells, consistent with our GSVA assays which indicated that ICC subclusters shared common activated signatures such as IL6-STAT3 signaling. In addition, CD146 depletion in vCAFs resulted in a remarkable decrease of IL-6 expression. Functionalassays indicated that IL-6 secreted by vCAFs could upregulateEZH2 in ICC cells, thereby enhancing their malignancy. Inter- estingly, a recent study revealed that CD10 +GPR77+CAFs derived from patients with chemoresistant breast cancer can maintain cancer stemness and induce chemoresistance by abundantly expressing IL-6 and providing a survival niche for breast cancer stem cells.31Additionally, Fang et al. found that exosomal miR- 1247-3p secreted metastatic hepatocellular and IL-8 expression in CAFs, resulting in themetastasis of liver cancer to the lung. 32In this study, miR-9-5p was enriched in the exosomes of ICC cells and signi cantly induced IL-6 expression in vCAFs, upregulating cellsand enhancing malignancy. Collectively, our scRNA-seq dataand functional analyses indicated that vCAFs, which account forthe majority of broblasts in ICCs, could secrete high levels of IL-6 to modulate tumor epigenetic alterations and promote ICCprogression.Taken together, our ndings provide a comprehensive tran- scriptomic landscape of human ICC at single-cell resolution and present a well-established resource CAFs.
