Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-1-infected adults and adolescents. Department of Health andHuman Services. Available at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/ContentFiles/Adultand AdolescentGL.pdf number, etc., if applicable] It is emphasized that concepts relevant to HIV management evolve rapidly. The Panel has a mechanism to update recommendations on a regular basis, and the most recent informa-tion is available on the AIDS infowebsite (http://aidsinfo.nih.gov ). Access AIDS info mobile siteGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents iWhat's New in the Guidelines? (Last updated February 12, 2013; last reviewed February 12, 2013) The following key changes were made to update the March 28, 2012, version of the guidelines. Significant updates are highlighted throughout the revised guidelines. Drug-Resistance Testing In persons failing INSTI-based regimens, the panel now recommends that a genotypic assay for INSTIresistance should be performed to determine whether to include a drug from this class in subsequentregimens (AII). Previously, the Panel recommended that INSTI resistance testing should be considered(BIII) in this setting. Co-Receptor Tropism Assay A genotypic tropism is predicts HIV-1 co-receptor usage basedon sequencing of the V3-coding region of HIV-1 env, the principal determinant of co-receptor usage. ThePanel recommends that a genotypic tropism assay be used as an alternative to a phenotypic tropism assaybefore initiation of a CCR5 antagonist-containing regimen (BII). Initiating ART in Treatment-Naive Patients The Panel has updated its recommendations on initiation of ART in treatment-naive patients. The Panel'srecommendations are listed below. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all HIV-infected individuals to reduce the risk of disease progression. The strength and evidence for this recommendation vary by pretreatment CD4 cell (BIII). ART also is recommended for HIV-infected individuals for the prevention of transmission of HIV . The strength and evidence for this recommendation vary by transmission risks: perinatal transmission (AI); heterosexual transmission (AI); other transmission risk groups (AIII). Patients starting ART should be willing and able to commit to treatment and understand the benefits and risks of therapy and the importance of adherence (AIII). Patients may choose to postpone therapy, andproviders, on a case-by-case basis, may elect to defer therapy on the basis of clinical and/or psychosocialfactors. What to Start: Initial Combination Regimen for Antiretroviral-Naive Patients The following changes and updates were made to this section: A rilpivirine (RPV)-based regimen is now recommended as an alternative NNRTI-based regimen only in patients with pre-treatment HIV RNA 100,000 copies/mL (BI). This is based on results from clinical trials that show that the proportion of patients who experienced virologic failure at 96 weeks was greater in patients with pre-treatment HIV RNA >100,000 copies/mL than in patients with pre-therapy HIV RNA 100,000 copies/mL. Elvitegravir/cobicistat/tenofovir/emtricitabine (EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC) as a fixed-dose combination product is recommended as an alternative regimen for ART-naive patients with pre-treatment creatinine clearance >70 mL/min (BI).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents ii The discussion on 3-NRTI regimens was removed from this section because 3-NRTI regimens are no longer recommended regimens for ART-naive patients. Tables 5a , 5b, 6, and 7 were updated to reflect the above changes. Acute and Recent (Early) HIV Infection The term \"early\" HIV infection is now used when describing both the acute phase of HIV infection (i.e., immediately after HIV infection and before seroconversion) and recent (i.e., within first 6 months) HIV infection. The recommendation for initiation of ART in patients with early infection was changed from \"should be considered optional (CIII)\" to \"should be offered (BII).\" The section was updated to include a summary of recent randomized controlled trials that examined the role of time-limited ART in patients with early HIV infection. HIV-Infected Women The recommendation on use of efavirenz (EFV) during pregnancy was updated to be in accord with the recommendation in the Perinatal Antiretroviral Guidelines . The key update includes the following statement: \"Because the risk of neural tube defects is restricted to the first 5 to 6 weeks of pregnancy andpregnancy is rarely recognized before 4 to 6 weeks of pregnancy, EFV can be continued in pregnantwomen receiving an EFV-based regimen who present for antenatal care in the first trimester, provided theregimen produces virologic suppression (CIII).\" The Panel also recommends that intravenous zidovudine use during labor may be omitted in women who have HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL near delivery (BII). Oral combination ART should be continued duringlabor. Drug-Drug Interaction This section includes new information under the heading \"Pharmacokinetic (PK) Enhancing.\" The additional text describes the roles of ritonavir (RTV) and cobicistat (COBI) aspharmacokinetic enhancers to increase the exposure of antiretroviral drugs. Tables 14-16c have been updated with new pharmacokinetic interaction data, including known and predicted interactions involving EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC and other drugs. Additional Updates Minor revisions have also been made to the following sections: Introduction Adverse Effects of Antiretroviral Agents (and Table 13 ) ARV Drug Characteristics and ARV Drug Cost Tables (Appendix B )Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents iiiTable of Contents What's New in the Guidelines .......................................................................................................................i Panel Roster ........................................................................................................................................................vii Financial Disclosure .......................................................................................................................................ix Introduction ......................................................................................................................................................A-1 Table 1.

New drugs that offer new mechanisms of action, improvements inpotency and activity even against multidrug-resistant viruses, dosing convenience, and tolerability have beenapproved. ART has dramatically reduced HIV-associated morbidity and mortality and has transformed HIVdisease into a chronic, manageable condition. In addition, effective treatment of HIV-infected individualswith ART is highly effective at preventing transmission to sexual partners. 1However, less than one-third of HIV-infected individuals in the United States have suppressed viral loads,2which is mostly a result of undiagnosed HIV infection and failure to link or retain diagnosed patients in care. Despite remarkableimprovements in HIV treatment and prevention, economic and social barriers that result in continuedmorbidity, mortality, and new HIV infections persist. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents (the Panel) is a working group of the Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council (OARAC).The primary goal of the Panel is to provide HIV care practitioners with recommendations based on currentknowledge of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs used to treat adults and adolescents with HIV infection in theUnited States. The Panel reviews new evidence and updates recommendations in these guidelines whenneeded. The Panel's primary areas of attention have included baseline assessment, treatment goals,indications for initiation of ART, choice of the initial regimen for ART-naive patients, drugs or combinationsto avoid, management of adverse effects and drug interactions, management of treatment failure, and specialART-related considerations in specific patient populations. For recommendations related to pre-exposureHIV prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-uninfected persons, please refer to recommendations from the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC). 3, 4 These guidelines generally represent the state of knowledge regarding the use of ARV agents. However,because the science of HIV evolves rapidly, the availability of new agents and new clinical data may changetherapeutic options and preferences. Information included in these guidelines may not be consistent withapproved labeling for the particular products or indications in question, and the use of the terms \"safe\" and\"effective\" may not be synonymous with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-defined legal standardsfor product approval. The Panel frequently updates the guidelines (current and archived versions of theguidelines are available on the AIDSinfo website at http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov ). However, the guidelines cannot always be updated apace with the rapid evolution of new data in the field of HIV and cannot offerguidance on care for all patients. Clinicians should exercise clinical judgment in management decisionstailored to unique patient circumstances. The Panel recognizes the importance of clinical research in generating evidence to address unanswered questions related to the optimal safety and efficacy of ART. The Panel encourages both the development of protocols and patient participation in well-designed, Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved clinical trials.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents A-2Guidelines Development Process Table 1. Outline of the Guidelines Development Process Topic Comment Goal of the guidelinesProvide guidance to HIV care practitioners on the optimal use of antiretroviral (ARV) agents for thetreatment of HIV infection in adults and adolescents in the United States. Panel members The Panel is composed of approximately 40 voting members who have expertise in HIV care and research. ThePanel includes at least one representative from each of the following U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices (HHS) agencies: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration(FDA), Health Resource Services Administration (HRSA), and National Institutes of Health (NIH).Approximately two-thirds of the Panel members are non-governmental scientific members. The Panel alsoincludes four to five community members with knowledge in HIV treatment and care. The U.S. governmentrepresentatives are appointed by their respective agencies; other Panel members are selected after an openannouncement to call for nominations. Each member serves on the Panel for a 4-year term with an option forreappointment for an additional term. A list of current members can be found in the Panel Roster . Financialdisclosure All members of the Panel submit financial disclosure in writing annually, reporting any association withmanufacturers of ARV drugs or diagnostics used for management of HIV infections. A list of the latest disclosures is available on the AIDS infowebsite (http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/AA_financialDisclosures.pdf ). Users of theguidelinesHIV treatment providers Developer Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents\u2014a working group of the Office of AIDSResearch Advisory Council (OARAC) Funding source Office of AIDS Research, NIH EvidencecollectionThe recommendations in the guidelines are generally based on studies published in peer-reviewed journals.On some occasions, particularly when new information may affect patient safety, unpublished datapresented at major conferences or prepared by the FDA and/or manufacturers as warnings to the publicmay be used as evidence to revise the guidelines. RecommendationgradingAs described in Table 2 Method ofsynthesizing dataEach section of the guidelines is assigned to a working group of Panel members with expertise in the areaof interest. The working groups synthesize the available data and propose recommendations to the Panel.The Panel discusses all proposals during monthly teleconferences. Recommendations endorsed by thePanel are included in the guidelines as official recommendations. Other guidelines These guidelines focus on treatment for HIV-infected adults and adolescents. Included is a brief discussionon the management of women of reproductive age and pregnant women. For more detailed and up-to-datediscussion on the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for these women, as well as for children, and otherspecial populations, please refer to guidelines specific to these groups. The guidelines are also available onthe AIDS infowebsite (http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov ). Update plan The Panel meets monthly by teleconference to review data that may warrant modification of the guidelines.Updates may be prompted by new drug approvals (or new indications, dosing formulations, or frequencyof dosing), new significant safety or efficacy data, or other information that may have a significant impacton the clinical care of patients. In the event of significant new data that may affect patient safety, the Panelmay post a warning announcement with recommendations on the AIDS infowebsite in the interim until the guidelines can be updated with the appropriate changes. Updated guidelines are available on the AIDS info website (http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov ). Public comments A 2-week public comment period follows release of the updated guidelines on the AIDS infowebsite. The Panel reviews comments received to determine whether additional revisions to the guidelines areindicated. The public may also submit comments to the Panel at any time at contactus@aidsinfo.nih.gov .Basis for Recommendations Recommendations in these guidelines are based upon scientific evidence and expert opinion. Each recommended statement includes a letter (A, B, or C) that represents the strength of the recommendation andwith a Roman numeral (I, II, or III) that represents the quality of the evidence that supports therecommendation (see Table 2). Table 2. Rating Scheme for Recommendations HIV Expertise in Clinical Care Many studies have demonstrated that outcomes achieved in HIV-infected outpatients are better when care is delivered by a clinician with HIV expertise,5-10which reflects the complexity of HIV infection and its treatment. Thus, appropriate training and experience, as well as ongoing continuing education, are importantcomponents of optimal care. Primary care providers without HIV experience, such as those who provideservice in rural or underserved areas, should identify experts in their regions who will be available forconsultation when needed.

The goals ofthe initial evaluation are to confirm the diagnosis of HIV infection, obtain appropriate baseline historical andlaboratory data, ensure patient understanding about HIV infection and its transmission, and to initiate care asrecommended in HIV primary care guidelines 1and guidelines for prevention and treatment of HIV-associated opportunistic infections.2The initial evaluation also should include introductory discussion on the benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the patient's health and to prevent HIV transmission. Baseline informationthen can be used to define management goals and plans. In the case of previously treated patients who presentfor an initial evaluation with a new health care provider, it is critical to obtain a complete antiretroviral (ARV)history (including drug-resistance testing results, if available), preferably through the review of past medicalrecords. Newly diagnosed patients should also be asked about any prior use of ARV agents for prevention ofHIV infection. The following laboratory tests performed during initial patient visits can be used to stage HIV disease and to assist in the selection of ARV drug regimens: HIV antibody testing (if prior documentation is not available or if HIV RNA is below the assay's limit of detection) (AI); CD4 T-cell count (CD4 count) (AI); Plasma HIV RNA (viral load) (AI); Complete blood count, chemistry profile, transaminase levels, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine,urinalysis, and serologies for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses (AIII); Fasting blood glucose and serum lipids (AIII); and Genotypic resistance testing at entry into care, regardless of whether ART will be initiated immediately(AII). For patients who have HIV RNA levels <500 to 1,000 copies/mL, viral amplification for resistancetesting may not always be successful (BII). In addition, other tests (including screening tests for sexually transmitted infections and tests for determining the risk of opportunistic infections and need for prophylaxis) should be performed as recommended in HIVprimary care and opportunistic infections guidelines. 1, 2 Patients living with HIV infection often must cope with many social, psychiatric, and medical issues that are bestaddressed through a patient-centered, multi-disciplinary approach to the disease. The baseline evaluation shouldinclude an evaluation of the patient's readiness for ART, including an assessment of high-risk behaviors, substance abuse, social support, mental illness, comorbidities, economic factors (e.g., unstable housing), medical insurance status and adequacy of coverage, and other factors that are known to impair adherence to ART andincrease the risk of HIV transmission. Once evaluated, these factors should be managed accordingly. The baseline evaluation should also include a discussion of risk reduction and disclosure to sexual and/or needle sharing partners, especially with untreated patients who are still at high risk of HIV transmission. Education about HIV risk behaviors and effective strategies to prevent HIV transmission should be provided at each patient visit (see Preventing Secondary Transmission of HIV ). References 1.

Table 3 outlines the Panel's recommendations for the frequency of testing. As noted in the table, some tests may be repeated morefrequently if clinically indicated. Two surrogate markers are routinely used to assess the immune function and level of HIV viremia: CD4 T- cell count (CD4 count) and plasma HIV RNA (viral load). Resistance testing should be used to guideselection of an ARV regimen; a viral tropism assay should be performed before initiation of a CCR5antagonist; and HLA-B*5701 testing should be performed before initiation of abacavir (ABC). The rationalefor and utility of these laboratory tests are discussed below.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents C-2Entry into careFollow-up before ARTART initiation or modificationbFollow-up 2- load, CD4 count canbe monitored every 6-12months (see text).

Please refer to the HIV Primary Care guidelines for guidance on other laboratory tests generally recommended for primary health care maintenance of HIV patients.1 b ART may be modified for treatment failure, adverse effects, or regimen simplification. c If HIV RNA is detectable at 2 to 8 weeks, repeat every 4 to 8 weeks until suppression to <200 copies/mL, then every 3 to 6 months. d Viral load typically is measured every 3 to 4 months in patients on ART. However, for adherent patients with suppressed viral load and stable immunologic status for more than 2 to 3 years, monitoring at 6 month intervals may be considered. e In ART-naive patients, if resistance testing was performed at entry into care, repeat testing before initiation of ART is optional. The exception is pregnant women; repeat testing is recommended in this case. For virologically suppressed patients who are switching therapy for toxicity or convenience, viral amplification will not be possible and therefore resistance testing should not be performed. Results from prior resistance testingcan be used to help in the construction of a new regimen. fIf HBsAg is positive at baseline or before initiation of ART, TDF plus either FTC or 3TC should be used as part of the ARV regimen to treat both HBV and HIV infections. If HBsAg, and HBsAb, and anti-HBc are negative at baseline, hepatitis B vaccine series should be administered. gSerum Na, K, HCO3, Cl, BUN, creatinine, glucose (preferably fasting).

It is one of the key factors in determining both the urgency of antiretroviral therapy(ART) initiation and the need for prophylaxis for opportunistic infections. It is also the strongest predictor ofsubsequent disease progression and survival according to findings from clinical trials and cohort studies. 1, 2 CD4 counts are highly variable; a significant change (2 standard deviations) between 2 tests is approximatelya 30% change in the absolute count, or an increase or decrease in CD4 percentage by 3 percentage points. Use of CD4 Count for Initial Assessment. The CD4 count is one of the most important factors in determining the urgency of ART initiation and the need for prophylaxis for opportunistic infections. All patients at entry into care should have a baseline CD4 count (AI). Recommendations for initiation ofART can be found in the Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy in Antiretroviral-Naive Patients section of these guidelines. Use of CD4 Count for Monitoring Therapeutic Response. An adequate CD4 response for most patients on therapy is defined as an increase in CD4 count in the range of 50 to 150 cells/mm3per year, generally with an accelerated response in the first 3 months of treatment. Subsequent increases inpatients with good virologic control average approximately 50 to 100 cells/mm 3per year until a steady state level is reached.3Patients who initiate therapy with a low CD4 count4or at an older age5may have a blunted increase in their counts despite virologic suppression. Frequency of CD4 Count Monitoring. ART now is recommended for all HIV-infected patients. In untreated patients, CD4 counts should be monitored every 3 to 6 months to determine the urgency of ART initiation. In patients on ART, the CD4 count is used to assess the immunologic response to ART and theneed for initiation or discontinuation of prophylaxis for opportunistic infections (AI). The CD4 count response to ART varies widely, but a poor CD4 response is rarely an indication for modifying a virologically suppressive antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. In patients with consistently suppressed viral loadswho have already experienced ART-related immune reconstitution, the CD4 cell count provides limitedinformation, and frequent testing may cause unnecessary anxiety in patients with clinically inconsequentialfluctuations. Thus, for the patient on a suppressive regimen whose CD4 cell count has increased well abovethe threshold for opportunistic infection risk, the CD4 count can be measured less frequently than the viralload. In such patients, CD4 count may be monitored every 6 to 12 months, unless there are changes in thepatient's clinical status, such as new HIV-associated clinical symptoms or initiation of treatment withinterferon, corticosteroids, or anti-neoplastic agents (CIII). Factors that affect absolute CD4 count. The absolute CD4 count is a calculated value based on the total white blood cell (WBC) count and the percentages of total and CD4+ T lymphocytes. This absolute number may fluctuate in individuals or may be influenced by factors that may affect the total WBC count and lymphocyte percentages, such as use of bone marrow-suppressive medications or the presence of acute infections. Splenectomy 6, 7or co-infection with human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1)8may cause misleadingly elevated absolute CD4 counts. Alpha-interferon, on the other hand, may reduce the absolute CD4 count without changing the CD4 percentage.9In all these cases, CD4 percentage remains stable and may be a more appropriate parameter to assess the patient's immune function.

Commercially available HIV-1 RNA assays do notdetect HIV-2 viral load. For further discussion on HIV-2 RNA monitoring in patients with HIV-1/HIV-2 co-infection or HIV-2 mono-infection, see HIV-2 Infection . Analysis of 18 trials that included more than 5,000 participants with viral load monitoring showed a significant association between a decrease in plasmaviremia and improved clinical outcome. 1Thus, viral load testing serves as a surrogate marker for treatment response2and can be useful in predicting clinical progression.3, 4The minimal change in viral load considered to be statistically significant (2 standard deviations) is a threefold, or a 0.5 log10copies/mL change. Optimal viral suppression is generally defined as a viral load persistently below the level of detection (<20 to75 copies/mL, depending on the assay used). However, isolated blips (viral loads transiently detectable atlow levels, typically <400 copies/mL) are not uncommon in successfully treated patients and are not thoughtto represent viral replication or to predict virologic failure. 5In addition, low-level positive viral load results (typically <200 copies/mL) appear to be more common with some viral load assays than with others.Furthermore, there is no definitive evidence that patients with viral loads quantified as <200 copies/mL usingthese assays are at increased risk for virologic failure. 6-8For the purposes of clinical trials, the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) currently defines virologic failure as a confirmed viral load >200 copies/mL, whicheliminates most cases of apparent viremia caused by blips or assay variability. 9This definition also may be useful in clinical practice (see Virologic and Immunologic Failure ). For most individuals who are adherent to their antiretroviral (ARV) regimens and who do not harborresistance mutations to the prescribed drugs, viral suppression is generally achieved in 12 to 24 weeks,although it may take longer in some patients. Recommendations for the frequency of viral load monitoringare summarized below. At initiation or change in therapy. Plasma viral load should be measured before initiation of therapy and preferably within 2 to 4 weeks, and not more than 8 weeks, after treatment initiation or after treatment modification (BI). Repeat viral load measurement should be performed at 4- to 8-weekintervals until the level falls below the assay's limit of detection (BIII). In virologically suppressed patients in whom therapy was modified because of drug toxicity or forregimen simplification. Viral load measurement should be performed within 2 to 8 weeks after changing therapy. The purpose of viral load monitoring at this point is to confirm potency of the new regimen (BIII). In patients on a stable ARV regimen. Viral load should be repeated every 3 to 4 months or as clinically indicated (BII). Clinicians may extend the interval to every 6 months for adherent patients who have suppressed viral loads for more than 2 to 3 years and whose clinical and immunologic status is stable (BIII). Monitoring in patients with suboptimal response. In addition to viral load monitoring, a number of additional factors should be assessed, such as adherence to prescribed medications, altered pharmacology, or drug interactions. Patients who fail to achieve viral suppression should undergo resistance testing to aid in the selection of an alternative regimen, as discussed in Drug-Resistance Testing and Virologic and Immunologic Failure (AI).

Standard assays provide information on resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors(NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors inhibitors (PIs). Testing forintegrase and fusion inhibitor resistance can also be ordered separately from several commercial laboratories. Co-receptor tropism assays should be performed whenever the use of CCR5 antagonist is being considered. Phenotypic co-receptor tropism assays have been used in clinical practice. A genotypic assay to predict co- receptor use is now viral genes. Most genotypic assays involve sequencing of the RT and PR genes to detect mutations that are known to confer drug resistance. Genotypic assays that assess mutations in the integrase and gp41 (envelope) genes are also commercially available. Genotypic assays can be performed rapidly and results are available within 1 to 2 weeks of sample collection. Interpretation of test results requires knowledge of the mutations selected by different antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and of the potential for cross resistance to other drugs conferred by certain mutations. The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) maintains an updated list of significant resistance-associated mutations in the RT, PR, integrase, and envelope genes (seePanel's Recommendations HIV drug-resistance testing is recommended in persons with HIV infection at entry into care regardless of whether antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be initiated immediately or deferred (AII) . If therapy is deferred, repeat testing should be considered at the time of ART initiation (CIII) . Genotypic testing is recommended as the preferred resistance testing to guide therapy in antiretroviral (ARV)-naive patients (AIII) . Standard genotypic drug-resistance testing in ARV-naive persons involves testing for mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) genes. If transmitted integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) resistance is a concern, providers may wish to supplement standard genotypic resistance testing with an INSTI genotype test (CIII) . HIV drug-resistance testing should be performed to assist in the selection of active drugs when changing ARV regimens in persons with virologic failure and HIV RNA levels >1,000 copies/mL (AI) . In persons with HIV RNA levels >500 but <1,000 copies/mL, testing may be unsuccessful but should still be considered (BII) . Drug-resistance testing should also be performed when managing suboptimal viral load reduction (AII) . In persons failing INSTI-based regimens, genotypic testing for INSTI resistance should be performed to determine whether to include a drug from this class in subsequent regimens (AII) . Drug-resistance testing in the setting of virologic failure should be performed while the person is taking prescribed ARV drugs or, if not possible, within 4 weeks after discontinuing therapy (AII) . Genotypic testing is recommended as the preferred resistance testing to guide therapy in patients with suboptimal virologic responses or virologic failure while on first or second regimens (AII) . The addition of phenotypic to genotypic testing is generally preferred for persons with known or suspected complex drug- resistance mutation patterns, particularly to protease inhibitors (PIs) (BIII) . Genotypic resistance testing is recommended for all pregnant women before initiation of ART (AIII) and for those entering pregnancy with detectable HIV RNA levels while on therapy (AI) (see the Perinatal Treatment Guidelines for more detailed discussion). Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = Data from randomized controlled trials; II = Data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinionGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents C-10http://www.iasusa.org/resistance_mutations ).1The Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu ) also provides helpful guidance for interpreting genotypic resistance test results. Various tools to assist the provider in interpreting genotypic test results are now available.2-5Clinical trials have demonstrated that consultation with specialists in HIV drug resistance improves virologic outcomes.6 Clinicians are thus encouraged to consult a specialist to facilitate interpretation of genotypic test results and design of an optimal new regimen. Phenotypic Assays Phenotypic assays measure the ability of a virus to grow in different concentrations of ARV drugs. RT and PR gene sequences and, more recently, integrase and envelope sequences derived from patient plasma HIVRNA are inserted into the backbone of a laboratory clone of HIV or used to generate pseudotyped virusesthat express the patient-derived HIV genes of interest. Replication of these viruses at different drugconcentrations is monitored by expression of a reporter gene and is compared with replication of a referenceHIV strain. The drug concentration that inhibits viral replication by 50% (i.e., the median inhibitoryconcentration [IC 50]) is calculated, and the ratio of the IC50of test and reference viruses is reported as the fold increase in IC50(i.e., fold resistance). Automated phenotypic assays that can produce results in 2 to 3 weeks are commercially available, but theycost more to perform than genotypic assays. In addition, interpretation of phenotypic assay results iscomplicated by incomplete information regarding the specific resistance level (i.e., fold increase in IC 50) that is associated with drug failure, although clinically significant fold increase cutoffs are now available forsome drugs. 7-11Again, consultation with a specialist to interpret test results can be helpful. Further limitations of both genotypic and phenotypic assays include lack of uniform quality assurance testingfor all available assays, relatively high cost, and insensitivity to minor viral species. Despite being present,drug-resistant viruses that constitute less than 10% to 20% of the circulating virus population will probablynot be detected by commercially available assays. This limitation is important because after drugs exertingselective pressure on drug-resistant populations are discontinued, a wild-type virus often re-emerges as thepredominant population in the plasma. As a consequence, the proportion of virus with resistance mutationsdecreases to below the 10% to 20% threshold. 12-14In the case of some drugs, this reversion to predominantly wild-type virus can occur in the first 4 to 6 weeks after the drugs are discontinued. Prospective clinicalstudies have shown that despite this plasma reversion, re-initiation of the same ARV agents (or those sharingsimilar resistance pathways) is usually associated with early drug failure, and that the virus present at failureis derived from previously archived resistant virus. 15Therefore, resistance testing is of greatest value when performed before or within 4 weeks after drugs are discontinued (AII). Because resistant virus may persist inthe plasma of some patients for longer periods of time, resistance testing done 4 to 6 weeks afterdiscontinuation of drugs may still detect mutations. However, the absence of detectable resistance in such patients must be interpreted with caution when designing subsequent ARV regimens. Use of Resistance Assays in Clinical Practice (See Table 4 ) Use of Resistance Assays in Determining Initial Treatment Transmission of drug-resistant HIV strains is well documented and associated with suboptimal virologic response to initial antiretroviral therapy (ART).16-19The likelihood that a patient will acquire drug-resistant virus is related to the prevalence of drug resistance in HIV-infected persons engaging in high-risk behaviors in the community. In the United States and Europe, recent studies suggest that the risk that transmitted virus will be resistant to at least one ARV drug is in the range of 6% to 16%.20-25Up to 8%, but generally less than 5% of transmitted viruses will exhibit resistance to drugs from more than one class.24, 26-28 If the decision is made to initiate therapy in a person with early HIV infection, resistance testing at baselineGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents C-11can guide regimen selection to optimize virologic response. Therefore, resistance testing in this situation is recommended (AII). A genotypic assay is preferred for this purpose (AIII). In this setting, treatmentinitiation should not be delayed pending resistance testing results. Once results are obtained, the treatmentregimen can be modified if warranted (see Acute and Recent HIV Infection ). In the absence of therapy, resistant viruses may decline over time to less than the detection limit of standard resistance tests, but whentherapy is eventually initiated, resistant viruses even at a low level may still increase the risk of treatmentfailure. 29-31Therefore, if therapy is deferred, resistance testing should still be done during acute HIV infection (AIII). In this situation, the genotypic resistance test result may be kept on record until the patient is to bestarted on ART. Repeat resistance testing at the time treatment is started should be considered because it ispossible for a patient to acquire drug-resistant virus (i.e., superinfection) between entry into care andinitiation of ART (CIII). Performing drug-resistance testing before ART initiation in patients with chronic HIV infection is less straightforward. The rate at which transmitted resistance-associated mutations revert to wild-type virus hasnot been completely delineated, but mutations present at the time of HIV transmission are more stable thanthose selected under drug pressure. It is often possible to detect resistance-associated mutations in virusesthat were transmitted several years earlier. 32-34No prospective trial has addressed whether drug-resistance testing before initiation of therapy confers benefit in this population. However, data from several, but not all,studies suggest that virologic responses in persons with baseline resistance mutations are suboptimal. 16-19, 35-37 In addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis of early genotypic resistance testing suggests that baseline testing inthis population should be performed. 38Therefore, resistance testing in chronically infected persons is recommended at the time of entry into HIV care (AII). Although no definitive prospective data exist tosupport the choice of one type of resistance testing over another, genotypic testing is generally preferred inthis situation because of lower cost, more rapid turnaround time, the assay's ability to detect mixtures ofwild-type and resistant virus, and the relative ease of interpreting test results (AIII). If therapy is deferred,repeat testing soon before initiation of ART should be considered because the patient may have acquireddrug-resistant virus (i.e., superinfection) (CIII). Standard genotypic drug-resistance testing in ARV-naive persons involves testing for mutations in the RT and PR genes. Although transmission of integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-resistant virus has rarely beenreported, as use of INSTIs increases, the potential for transmission of INSTI-resistant virus may alsoincrease. Therefore, when INSTI resistance is suspected, providers may wish to supplement standardbaseline genotypic resistance testing with genotypic testing for resistance to this class of drugs (CIII). Use of Resistance Assays in the Event of Virologic Failure Resistance assays are useful in guiding treatment decisions for patients who experience virologic failure while on ART. Several prospective studies assessed the utility of resistance testing to guide ARV drug selection in patients with virologic failure. These studies involved genotypic assays, phenotypic assays, or both. 6, 39-45In general, these studies found that changes in therapy that were informed by resistance testing results produced better early virologic response to salvage regimens than regimen changes guided only by clinical judgment. In addition, one observational cohort study found that performance of genotypic drug-resistance testing in ART-experienced patients with detectable plasma HIV RNA was independently associated with improved survival.46Thus, resistance testing is recommended as a tool in selecting active drugs when changing ARV regimens because of virologic failure in persons with HIV RNA >1,000 copies/mL (AI) (see Virologic and Immunologic Failure ). with HIV RNA >500 copies/mL but <1,000 copies/mL, testing may be unsuccessful but should still be considered (BII). Drug-resistance testing in persons with a plasma viral load <500 copies/mL is not usually recommended because resistance assays cannot be consistently performed given low HIV RNA levels (AIII).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents C-12Resistance testing also can help guide treatment decisions for patients with suboptimal viral load reduction (AII). Virologic failure in the setting of combination ART is, for certain patients, associated with resistanceto only one component of the regimen. 47-49In this situation, substituting individual drugs in a failing regimen may be a possible option, but this concept will require clinical validation (see Virologic and Immunologic Failure ). In patients who are on a failing first or second ARV drug regimen and experiencing virologic failure orsuboptimal viral load reduction, genotypic testing is generally preferred for resistance testing (AII). This isbased on the fact that, when compared with phenotypic testing, genotypic testing costs less to perform, has afaster turnaround time, and greater sensitivity for detecting mixtures of wild-type and resistant virus. Inaddition, observations show that the assays are comparable predictors of virologic response to subsequentART regimens. 50 Addition of phenotypic to genotypic testing is generally preferred for persons with known or suspectedcomplex drug-resistance mutation patterns, particularly to PIs (BIII). In patients failing INSTI-based regimens, testing for INSTI resistance should be performed to determine whether to include drugs from this class in subsequent regimens (AII); genotypic testing is preferred for thispurpose. When the use of a CCR5 antagonist is being considered, a co-receptor performed (AI). Phenotypic co-receptor tropism have been used in clinical practice. A genotypic assay to predictco-receptor use is now commercially available and is less expensive than phenotypic assays. Evaluation ofgenotypic assays is ongoing, but current data suggest that such testing should be considered as an alternativeassay. The same principles regarding testing for co-receptor use also apply to testing when patients exhibitvirologic failure on a CCR5 antagonist. 51Resistance to CCR5 antagonists in the absence of detectable CXCR4-using virus has been reported, but such resistance is uncommon (see Co-receptor Tropism Assays ). Use of Resistance Assays in Pregnant Women In pregnant women, the goal of ART is to maximally reduce plasma HIV RNA to provide optimal maternal therapy and to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV . Genotypic resistance testing is recommended for allpregnant women before initiation of therapy (AIII) and for those entering pregnancy with detectable HIV RNA levels while on therapy (AI). Phenotypic testing in those found to have complex drug-resistancemutation patterns, particularly to PIs, may provide additional information (BIII). Optimal prevention ofperinatal transmission may require initiation of ART pending resistance testing results. Once the results areavailable, the ARV regimen can be changed as needed.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents C-13Clinical Setting/Recommendation Rationale Drug-resistance assay recommended In acute HIV infection: Drug-resistance testing is recommended regardless of whether antiretroviral therapy (ART) is initiated immediately or deferred (AII) . A genotypic assay is generally preferred (AIII) . If ART is deferred, repeat resistance testing should be considered atthe time therapy is initiated (CIII) . A genotypic assay generally is preferred (AIII) .If ART is initiated immediately, drug-resistance testing candetermine whether drug-resistant virus was transmitted. Testresults will help in the design of initial regimens or to modify orchange regimens if results are obtained after treatment initiation. Genotypic testing is preferred to phenotypic testing because of lower cost, faster turnaround time, and greater sensitivity fordetecting mixtures of wild-type and resistant virus. If ART is deferred, testing should still be performed because of the greater likelihood that transmitted resistance-associated mutationswill be detected earlier in the course of HIV infection. Results ofresistance testing may be important when treatment is initiated.Repeat testing at the time ART is initiated should be consideredbecause the patient may have acquired a drug-resistant virus (i.e.,superinfection). In ART-naive patients with chronic HIV infection: Drug-resistance testing is recommended at entry into HIV care, regardless ofwhether therapy is initiated immediately or deferred (AII) . A genotypic assay is generally preferred (AIII) . If therapy is deferred, repeat resistance testing should beconsidered before initiation of ART (CIII) . A genotypic assay is generally preferred (AIII) . If an INSTI is considered for an ART-naive patient and transmittedINSTI resistance is a concern, providers may supplement standardresistance testing with a specific INSTI genotypic resistance assay(CIII). If use of a CCR5 antagonist is being considered, a co-receptortropism assay should be performed (AI) (see Co-receptor Tropism Assays)Transmitted HIV with baseline resistance to at least 1 drug is seenin 6% to 16% of patients, and suboptimal virologic responses maybe seen in patients with baseline resistant mutations. Some drug-resistance mutations can remain detectable for years in untreated,chronically infected patients. Repeat testing before initiation of ART should be considered because the patient may have acquired a drug-resistant virus (i.e., asuperinfection). Genotypic testing is preferred to phenotypic testing because of lower cost, faster turnaround time, and greater sensitivity fordetecting mixtures of wild-type and resistant virus. Standard genotypic drug-resistance assays test only for mutations in the RT and PR genes. (see Co-receptor Tropism Assays ) In patients with virologic failure: Drug-resistance testing is recommended in patients on combination ART with HIV RNA levels >1,000 copies/mL (AI) . In patients with HIV RNA levels >500 copies/mL but <1,000 copies/mL, testing may not be successful butshould still be considered (BII) . A standard genotypic resistance assay is generally preferred forpatients experiencing virologic failure on their first or secondregimens (AII) . In patients failing INSTI-based regimens, genotypic testing forINSTI resistance should be performed to determine whether toinclude drugs from this class in subsequent regimens (AII) . If use of a CCR5 antagonist is being considered, a co-receptortropism assay should be (AI) (see phenotypic assay to genotypic assay generallypreferred in patients with known or suspected complex drug-resistance patterns, particularly to protease inhibitors (PIs) (BIII) .Testing can help determine the role of resistance in drug failure andmaximize the clinician's ability to select active drugs for the newregimen. Drug-resistance testing should be performed while thepatient is taking prescribed ARV drugs or, if not possible, within 4weeks after discontinuing therapy. Genotypic testing is preferred to phenotypic testing because of lower cost, faster turnaround time, and greater sensitivity fordetecting mixtures of wild-type and resistant HIV. Standard genotypic drug-resistance assays test only for mutations in the RT and PR genes. Phenotypic testing can provide additional useful information in patients with complex drug-resistance mutation patterns,particularly to PIs.Table 4. Recommendations for Using Drug-Resistance Assays (page 1 of 2)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents C-14Clinical Setting/Recommendation Rationale Drug-resistance assay recommended In patients with suboptimal suppression of viral load: Drug- resistance testing is recommended in patients with suboptimalsuppression of viral load after initiation of ART (AII) .Testing can help determine the role of resistance and thus assist theclinician in identifying the number of active drugs available for anew regimen. In HIV-infected pregnant women: Genotypic resistance testing is recommended for all pregnant women before initiation of ART (AIII)and for those entering pregnancy with detectable HIV RNA levelswhile on therapy (AI) .The goal of ART in HIV-infected pregnant women is to achievemaximal viral suppression for treatment of maternal HIV infectionand for prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV. Genotypicresistance testing will assist the clinician in selecting the optimalregimen for the patient. Drug-resistance assay not usually recommended After therapy is discontinued: Drug-resistance testing is not usually recommended more than 4 weeks after discontinuation of ARV drugs (BIII) .Drug-resistance mutations may become minor species in theabsence of selective drug pressure, and available assays may notdetect minor drug-resistant species. If testing is performed in thissetting, the detection of drug resistance may be of value; however,the absence of resistance does not rule out the presence of minordrug-resistant species. In patients with low HIV RNA levels: Drug-resistance testing is not usually recommended in patients with a plasma viral load <500copies/mL (AIII) .Resistance assays cannot be consistently performed given low HIVRNA levels.Table 4.

Changes in V3 loop sequence associated with failure of maraviroc treatment in patients enrolled in the MOTIV ATE 1 and 2 trials. Paper presented at: 15th Conference on Retroviruses and OpportunisticInfections. 2008; Boston, MA.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents C-19Co-Receptor Tropism Assays (Last updated February 12, 2013; last reviewed February 12, 2013) HIV enters cells by a complex process that involves sequential attachment to the CD4 receptor followed by binding to either the CCR5 or CXCR4 molecules and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes.1CCR5 co- receptor antagonists prevent HIV entry into target cells by binding to the CCR5 receptors.2Phenotypic and, to a lesser degree, genotypic assays have been developed that can determine or predict the co-receptor tropism(i.e., CCR5, CXCR4, or both) of the patient's dominant virus population. An older generation assay (Trofile,Monogram Biosciences, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was used to screen patients who were participating inclinical trials that led to the approval of maraviroc (MVC), the only CCR5 antagonist currently available. Theassay has been improved and is now available with enhanced sensitivity. In addition, a genotypic assay topredict co-receptor usage is now commercially available. During acute/recent infection, the vast majority of patients harbor a CCR5-utilizing virus (R5 virus), which suggests that the R5 variant is preferentially transmitted. Viruses in many untreated patients eventually exhibita shift in co-receptor tropism from CCR5 usage (i.e.,dual- or mixed-tropic; D/M-tropic). This shift is temporally associated with a more rapid decline in CD4 T-cellcounts, 3, 4but whether this tropism shift is a cause or a consequence of progressive immunodeficiency remains undetermined.1Antiretroviral (ARV)-treated patients with extensive drug resistance are more likely to harbor X4- or D/M-tropic variants than untreated patients with comparable CD4 counts.5The prevalence of X4- or D/M-tropic variants increases to more than 50% in treated patients who have CD4 counts <100 cells/mm3.5, 6 plasma-derived virus. These assays involve thegeneration of laboratory viruses that express patient-derived envelope proteins (i.e., gp120 and gp41). These pseudoviruses, which are replication-defective, are used to infect target cell lines that express either CCR5 or CXCR4. 7, 8Using the Trofile assay, the co-receptor tropism of the patient-derived virus is confirmed by testing the susceptibility of the virus to specific CCR5 or CXCR4 inhibitors in vitro. This assay takes about 2 weeks to perform and requires a plasma HIV RNA level 1,000 copies/mL. The performance characteristics of these assays have evolved. Most, if not all, patients enrolled in pre- marketing clinical trials of MVC and other CCR5 antagonists were screened with an earlier, less sensitive version of the Trofile assay.8This earlier assay failed to routinely detect low levels of CXCR4-utilizing variants. As a consequence, some patients enrolled in these clinical trials harbored low levels of CXCR4- utilizing virus at baseline that were below the assay limit of detection and exhibited rapid virologic failure after initiation of a CCR5 antagonist.9The assay has been revised and is now able to detect lower levels of CXCR4-utlizing viruses. In vitro, the assay can detect CXCR4-utilizing clones with 100% sensitivity when those clones represent 0.3% or more of the virus population.10Although this more sensitive assay has hadPanel's Recommendations A co-receptor tropism assay should be performed whenever the use of a CCR5 co-receptor antagonist is being considered (AI).

For unclear reasons, a minority of samples cannot be successfully phenotyped with either generation of the Trofile assay. In patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA below the limit of detection, co-receptor usage can be determined fromproviral DNA obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells; however, the clinical utility of this assayremains to be determined. 11 Genotypic Assays Genotypic determination of HIV-1 co-receptor usage is based on sequencing of the V3-coding region of HIV-1 env, the principal determinant of co-receptor usage. A variety of algorithms and bioinformatics programscan be used to predict co-receptor usage from the V3 sequence. When compared to the phenotypic assay,genotypic methods show high specificity (~90%) but only modest sensitivity (~50%-70%) for the presenceof a CXCR4-utilizing virus. Given these performance characteristics, these assays may not be sufficientlyrobust to completely rule out the presence of an X4 or D/M variant. 12 Studies in which V3 genotyping was performed on samples from patients screened for clinical trials of MVCsuggest that genotyping performed as well as phenotyping in predicting the response to MVC. 13-15On the basis of these data, accessibility, and cost, European guidelines currently favor genotypic testing to determineco-receptor usage. 16An important caveat to these results is that the majority of patients who received MVC were first shown to have R5 virus by a phenotypic assay (Trofile). Consequently, the opportunity to assesstreatment response to MVC in patients whose virus was considered R5 by genotype but D/M or X4 byphenotype was limited to a relatively small number of patients. Use of Assays to Determine Co-Receptor Usage in Clinical Practice An assay for HIV-1 co-receptor usage should be performed whenever the use of a CCR5 antagonist is beingconsidered (AI). In addition, because virologic failure may occur due to a shift from CCR5-using to CXCR4-using virus, testing for co-receptor usage is recommended in patients who exhibit virologic failure on aCCR5 antagonist (BIII). Virologic failure also may be caused by resistance of a CCR5-using virus to aCCR5 antagonist, but such resistance is uncommon. Compared to genotypic testing, phenotypic testing hasmore evidence supporting its usefulness. Therefore, a phenotypic test for co-receptor usage is generallypreferred (AI). However, because phenotypic testing is more expensive and requires more time to perform, agenotypic test to predict HIV-1 co-receptor usage should be considered as an alternative test (BII). A tropism assay may potentially be used in clinical practice for prognostic purposes or to assess tropism before starting ART if future use of a CCR5 antagonist is anticipated (e.g., a regimen change for toxicity).Currently, sufficient data do not exist to support these uses.

This reaction has been reported in 5%-8% of patients participating in clinical trials when using clinicalcriteria for the diagnosis, and it is the major reason for early discontinuation of ABC. Discontinuing ABCusually promptly reverses HSR, whereas subsequent rechallenge can cause a rapid, severe, and even life-threatening recurrence. 1 Studies that evaluated demographic risk factors for ABC HSR have shown racial background as a risk factor,with white patients generally having a higher risk (5%-8%) than black patients (2%-3%). Several groupsreported a highly significant association between ABC HSR and the presence of the major histocompatibilitycomplex (MHC) class I allele HLA-B*5701. 2-3Because the clinical criteria used for ABC HSR are overly sensitive and may lead to false-positive ABC HSR diagnoses, an ABC skin patch test (SPT) was developedas a research tool to immunologically confirm ABC HSR. 4A positive ABC SPT is an ABC-specific delayed HSR that results in redness and swelling at the skin site of application. All ABC SPT-positive patientsstudied were also positive for the HLA-B*5701 allele. 5The ABC SPT could be falsely negative for some patients with ABC HSR and, at this point, is not recommended for use as a clinical tool. The PREDICT-1study randomized patients before starting ABC either to be prospectively screened for HLA-B*5701 (withHLA-B*5701-positive patients not offered ABC) or to standard of care at the time of the study (i.e., no HLAscreening, with all patients receiving ABC). 6The overall HLA-B*5701 prevalence in this predominately white population was 5.6%. In this cohort, screening for HLA-B*5701 eliminated immunologic ABC HSR(defined as ABC SPT positive) compared with standard of care (0% vs. 2.7%), yielding a 100% negativepredictive value with respect to SPT and significantly decreasing the rate of clinically suspected ABC HSR(3.4% vs. 7.8%). The SHAPE study corroborated the low rate of immunologically validated ABC HSR in black patients and confirmed the utility of HLA-B*5701 screening for the risk of ABC HSR (100% sensitivity in black and white populations). 7 On the basis of the results of these studies, the Panel recommends screening for HLA-B*5701 before starting patients on an ABC-containing regimen (AI). HLA-B*5701-positive patients should not be prescribed ABC (AI), and the positive status should be recorded as an ABC allergy in the patient's medical record (AII). HLA-B*5701 testing is needed only once in a patient's lifetime; thus, efforts to carefully record and maintain the test result and to educate the patient about its implications are important. The specificity of the HLA- B*5701 test in predicting ABC HSR is lower than the sensitivity (i.e., 33%-50% of HLA-B*5701-positive patients would likely not develop confirmed ABC HSR if exposed to ABC). HLA-B*5701 should not be used as a substitute for clinical judgment or pharmacovigilance, because a negative HLA-B*5701 result does not absolutely rule out the possibility of some form of ABC HSR.

ART has reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality8-11and has reduced perinatal12and behavior-associated transmission of HIV .13-17HIV suppression with ART may also decrease inflammation and immune activation thought to contribute to higher rates of cardiovascular and other end-organ damage reported in HIV-infected cohorts. (See Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy .) Maximal and durable suppression of plasma viremia delays or prevents the selection of drug-resistance mutations, preserves CD4 T-cell numbers, and confers substantialclinical benefits, all of which are important treatment goals. 18-19 Achieving viral suppression requires the use of ARV regimens with at least two, and preferably three, activedrugs from two or more drug classes. Baseline resistance testing and patient characteristics should guidedesign of the specific regimen. (See What to Start: Initial Combination Regimens for the Antiretroviral- Naive Patient .) When initial suppression is not achieved or is lost, rapidly changing to a new regimen with at least two active drugs is required. (See Virologic and Immunologic Failure .) The increasing number of drugs and drug classes makes viral suppression below detection limits an appropriate goal in all patients. Viral load reduction to below limits of assay detection in an ART-naive patient usually occurs within the first 12-24 weeks of therapy. Predictors of virologic success include: high potency of ARV regimen, excellent adherence to treatment regimen,20 low baseline viremia,21 higher baseline CD4 count (>200 cells/mm3),22and rapid reduction of viremia in response to treatment.21,23 Successful outcomes are usually observed, although adherence difficulties may lower the success rate in clinical practice to below the 90% rate commonly seen in clinical trials.24 Strategies to Achieve Treatment Goals Achieving treatment goals requires a balance of sometimes competing considerations, outlined below. Providers and patients must work together to define individualized strategies to achieve treatment goals. Selection of Initial Combination Regimen Several preferred and alternative ARV regimens are recommended for use. (See What to Start .) Many of these regimens have comparable efficacy but vary to some degree in dosing frequency and symmetry, pillGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents D-2burden, drug interactions, and potential side effects. Regimens should be tailored for the individual patient to enhance adherence and thus improve long-term treatment success. Individual regimen choice is based onsuch considerations as expected side effects, convenience, comorbidities, interactions with concomitantmedications, and results of pretreatment genotypic drug-resistance testing. Pretreatment Drug-Resistance Testing Current studies suggest a 6%-16% prevalence of HIV drug resistance in ART-naive patients,25-29and some studies suggest that the presence of transmitted drug-resistant viruses may lead to suboptimal virologicresponses. 30Therefore, pretreatment genotypic resistance testing should be used to guide selection of the most optimal initial ARV regimen. (See Drug-Resistance Testing .) Improving Adherence Suboptimal adherence may result in reduced treatment response. Incomplete adherence can result fromcomplex medication regimens; patient factors, such as active substance abuse and depression; and healthsystem issues, including interruptions in patient access to medication and inadequate treatment education andsupport. Conditions that promote adherence should be maximized before and after initiation of ART. (SeeAdherence to Antiretroviral Therapy .) References 1. Dinoso JB, Kim SY , Wiegand AM, et al.

The primary goal of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is to prevent HIV-associated morbidity and mortality.This goal is best accomplished by using effective ART to maximally inhibit HIV replication so that plasmaHIV RNA levels (viral load) remain below that detectable by commercially available assays. Durable viralsuppression improves immune function and quality of life, lowers the risk of both AIDS-defining and non-AIDS-defining complications, and prolongs life. Furthermore, high plasma HIV RNA is a major risk factor for HIV transmission and use of effective ART can reduce viremia and transmission of HIV to sexual partners. 1, 2Modelling studies suggest that the expanded use of ART may result in lower incidence and, eventually, prevalence of HIV on a community or populationlevel. 3Thus, a secondary goal of ART is to reduce the risk of HIV transmission. Historically, HIV-infected individuals have presented for care with low CD4 counts,4but increasingly there have been concerted efforts to both increase testing of at-risk patients and to link HIV-infected patients tomedical care soon after HIV diagnosis (and before they have advanced HIV diseases). For those with high CD4 cell counts, whose short-term risk for death may be low, 5the recommendation to initiate ART is based on growing evidence that untreated HIV infection or uncontrolled viremia is associated with development of non-AIDS-defining diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), kidney disease, liver disease, neurologic complications, and malignancies. Furthermore, newer ART regimens are more effective, more convenient, and better tolerated than regimens used in the past. Regardless of CD4 count, the decision to initiate ART should always include consideration of any co-morbid conditions, the willingness and readiness of the patient to initiate therapy, and the availability of resources. In settings where resources are not available to initiate ART in all patients, treatment should be prioritized for patients with the lowest CD4 counts and those with the following clinical conditions: pregnancy, CD4 count <200 cells/mm3, or history of an AIDS-defining illness, including HIV-associated dementia, HIV-associated nephropathy (HIV AN), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and acute HIV infection. Panel's Recommendations Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all HIV-infected individuals to reduce the risk of disease progression. The strength and evidence for this recommendation vary by pretreatment CD4 also is recommended for HIV-infected individuals for the prevention of transmission of HIV. The strength and evidence for this recommendation vary by transmission risks: perinatal transmission (AI) ; heterosexual transmission (AI) ; other transmission risk groups (AIII) . Patients starting ART should be willing and able to commit to treatment and understand the benefits and risks of therapy and the importance of adherence (AIII) . Patients may choose to postpone therapy, and providers, on a case-by-case basis, may elect to defer therapy on the basis of clinical and/or psychosocial factors. Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = Data from randomized controlled trials; II = Data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinionGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents E-2Tempering the enthusiasm to treat all patients regardless of CD4 count is the absence of randomized data that definitively demonstrate a clear clinical benefit of ART in patients with CD4 count >350 cells/mm3and mixed results from observational cohort studies on the definitive benefits of early ART. For some patients,the potential risks of short- or long-term, drug-related complications and non-adherence to long-term therapyin asymptomatic patients may offset possible benefits of earlier initiation of therapy. An ongoing randomizedcontrolled trial to evaluate the role of immediate versus delayed ART in patients with CD4 count >500cells/mm 3will help to further define the role of ART in this patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00867048). The known and potential benefits and limitations of ART overall, and in different patient populations are discussed below. Benefits of Antiretroviral Therapy Reduction in Mortality and/or AIDS-Related Morbidity According to Pretreatment CD4 Cell Count Patients with a history of an AIDS-defining illness or CD4 count <350 cells/mm3 HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3are at higher risk of opportunistic diseases, non- AIDS morbidity, and death than HIV-infected patients with higher CD4 counts. Randomized controlled trials in patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3and/or a history of an AIDS-defining condition provide strong evidence that ART improves survival and delays disease progression in these patients.6-8Long-term data from multiple observational cohort studies comparing earlier ART (i.e., initiated at CD4 count >200cells/mm 3) with later treatment (i.e., initiated at CD4 count <200 cells/mm3) also have provided strong support for these findings.9-14 Few large, randomized controlled trials address when to start therapy in patients with CD4 counts >200cells/mm 3. CIPRA HT-001, a randomized clinical trial conducted in Haiti, enrolled 816 participants without AIDS. Participants were randomized to start ART with CD4 counts of 200 cells/mm3to 350 cells/mm3or to defer treatment until their CD4 counts dropped to <200 cells/mm3or they developed an AIDS-defining condition. An interim analysis of the study showed that, when compared with participants who began ARTwith CD4 counts of 200 cells/mm 3to 350 cells/mm3, patients who deferred therapy had a higher mortality rate (23 versus 6 deaths; hazard ratio [HR] = 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-9.8) and a tuberculosis (TB) (HR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2-3.6). 15 Collectively, these studies support the Panel's recommendation that ART should be initiated in patients witha history of an AIDS-defining illness or with a CD4 count <350 cells/mm 3(AI). Patients with CD4 counts between 350 and 500 cells/mm3 Data supporting initiation of ART in patients with CD4 counts ranging from 350 cells/mm3to 500 cells/mm3 are derived from large observational studies and secondary analysis of randomized controlled trials. Analysis of the findings from the observational studies involved use of advanced statistical methods that minimize the bias and confounding that arise when observational data are used to address the question of when to start ART. However, unmeasured confounders for which adjustment was not possible may have influenced the analysis. The ART Cohort Collaboration (ART-CC) included 45,691 patients from 18 cohort studies conducted primarily in North America and Europe. Data from ART-CC showed that the rate of progression to AIDS and/or death was higher when therapy was deferred until a patient's CD4 count fell to the 251 cells/mm3to 350 cells/mm3range than when ART was initiated at the cells/mm3to 450 cells/mm3range (risk ratio: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04-1.57).11When analysis of the data was restricted to mortality alone, the difference between the 2 strategies was weaker and not statistically significant (risk ratio: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.80-1.60).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents E-3In a collaboration of North American cohort studies (NA-ACCORD) that evaluated patients regardless of whether they had started therapy, the 6,278 patients who deferred therapy until their CD4 counts were <350cells/mm 3had greater risk of death than the 2,084 patients who initiated therapy with CD4 counts 500 cells/mm3(risk ratio: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.26-2.26) after adjustment for other factors that differed between these 2 groups.16 Another collaboration of cohort studies from Europe and the United States (the HIV-CAUSALCollaboration) included 8,392 ART-naive patients with initial CD4 counts declines in CD4 count to <500 cells/mm3.14The study estimated that delaying initiation of ART until CD4 count <350 cells/mm3was associated with a greater risk of AIDS-defining illness or death than initating ART with CD4 count between 350 cells/mm3and 500 cells/mm3(HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.23-1.56). There was, however, no evidence of a difference in mortality (HR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.84-1.22). A collaboration of cohort studies from Europe, Australia, and Canada (the CASCADE Collaboration) included 5,527 ART-naive patients with CD4 counts in the 350 to 499 cells/mm3range. Compared with patients who deferred therapy until their CD4 counts fell to <350 cells/mm3, patients who started ART immediately had a marginally lower risk of AIDS-defining illness or death (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: CI: 0.33-0.80). 17 Randomized data showing clinical evidence favoring ART in patients with higher CD4 cell counts came fromtwo studies. First, in a small subgroup analysis of the SMART trial, undertaken primarily in North and SouthAmerica, Europe, and Australia, which randomized participants with CD4 counts >350 cells/mm 3to continuous ART or to treatment interruption until CD4 count dropped to <250 cells/mm3. In the subgroup of 249 participants who were ART naive at enrollment (median CD4 count: 437 cells/mm3), participants who deferred therapy until CD4 count dropped to <250 cells/mm3had a greater risk of serious AIDS- and non-AIDS-related events than those who initiated therapy immediately (7 vs. 2 events, HR: 4.6, 95% CI: 1.0-22.2).18 Second, the HPTN 052 was a large multinational, multicontinental (Africa, Asia, South America, and NorthAmerica) randomized trial that examined whether treatment of HIV-infected individuals reduces transmissionto their uninfected sexual partners. 2A secondary objective of the study was to determine whether ART reduces clinical events in the HIV-infected participants. This trial enrolled 1,763 HIV-infected participants with CD4counts between 350 cells/mm 3and 550 cells/mm3and their HIV-uninfected partners. The infected participants were randomized to initiate ART immediately or to delay initiation until they had 2 consecutive CD4 counts<250 cells/mm 3. At a median follow-up of 2.1 years, there were 77 primary events in the delayed arm versus 57 in the immediate therapy arm (adjusted HR: 1.39, 95% CI: 0.98-1.96). The most frequent event wastuberculosis (34 cases in the delayed therapy arm versus 17 in the immediate therapy arm); deaths wererelatively rare (15 cases in the delayed therapy arm; 11 in the immediate therapy arm). 19 Collectively, these studies suggest that initiating ART in patients with CD4 counts between 350 cells/mm3 and 500 cells/mm3reduces HIV-related disease progression; whether there is a corresponding reduction in mortality is unclear. This benefit supports the Panel's recommendation that ART should be initiated in patients with CD4 counts 350 cells/mm3to 500 cells/mm3(AII). Recent evidence demonstrating the public health benefit of earlier intervention further supports the strength of this recommendation (see Prevention of Sexual Transmission ). Patients with CD4 counts >500 cells/mm3 The NA-ACCORD study also observed patients who started ART with CD4 counts >500 cells/mm3or after their CD4 counts dropped below this threshold. The adjusted mortality rates were significantly higher in the 6,935 patients who deferred therapy until their CD4 counts fell to <500 cells/mm3than in the 2,200 patients who started >500 cells/mm3(risk ratio: 1.94, generally representative of the HIV-infected patients in care in the United States, the study has severalGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents E-4limitations, including the small number of deaths and the potential for unmeasured confounders that might have influenced outcomes independent of ART. In contrast, results from 2 cohort studies did not identify a benefit of earlier initiation of therapy in reducing AIDS progression or death. In an analysis of the ART-CC cohort,11the rate of progression to AIDS/death associated with deferral of therapy until CD4 count is in the 351 to 450 cells/mm3range was similar to the rate with initiation of therapy with CD4 count in the 451 to 550 cells/mm3range (HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.76- 1.29). There was no significant difference in rate of death identified between the two groups (HR: 0.93, 95%CI: 0.60-1.44). This study also found that the proportion of patients with CD4 counts between 451 and 550cells/mm 3who would progress to AIDS or death before having CD4 count <450 cells/mm3was low the 5,162 patients with CD4 counts in the 500 to 799 cells/mm3range, compared with patients who deferred therapy, those who started ART immediately did not experience a significant reduction in the composite outcome of progression toAIDS/death (HR: 1.10, 0.49-2.12). While it was not a clinical endpoint study, a recent clinical trial (Setpoint Study) randomized patients within 6 months of HIV seroconversion to receive either immediate ART for 36 weeks or deferred treatment. Morethan 57% of the study participants had CD4 count >500 cells/mm 3. The deferred treatment group had a statistically higher risk of meeting ART eligibility criteria than the immediate treatment group. The study washalted early and illustrated that the time from diagnosis of early infection to the need for initiation of ARTwas shorter than anticipated in the deferred therapy group. 20 The expanded use of ART to treat individuals with CD4 counts >500 cells/mm3has also demonstrated public health benefits. In 2010, a large, publicly-funded clinic in San Francisco adapted a universal ART approachto initiate ART in all HIV-infected persons and evaluated temporal trends in viral suppression. In 534 patientsentering the clinic with CD4 counts >500 cells/mm 3, the 1-year incidence of viral suppression increased from 9% to 14% before universal ART to >52% after the approach was adopted. After adjustment, this policy wasassociated with a six-fold increase in the probability of viral suppression six months after clinic entry. 21 Because the risk of HIV transmission is associated with level of viremia, from a public health standpoint, thisreduction in community viral load can potentially reduce new HIV infections at the community level. With a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV infection, the growing awareness that untreated HIV infection increases the risk of many non-AIDS-defining diseases (as discussed below), and the benefit ofART in reducing transmission of HIV , the Panel recommends initiation of ART in patients with CD4 counts>500 cells/mm 3(BIII). When discussing initiation of ART at high CD4 cell counts (i.e., >500 cells/mm3), clinicians should inform patients that data on the clinical benefit of starting treatment at such levels are not conclusive, especially forpatients with very high CD4 counts. Clinicians should also inform patients that viral suppression from effective ART can reduce the risk of sexual transmission to others. Patients should also be told that untreated HIV infection will eventually lead to immunological deterioration and increased risk of clinical disease and death. Therefore, if therapy is not initiated, continued monitoring and close follow-up is necessary. Further ongoing research (both randomized clinical trials and cohort studies) to assess the short- and long- term clinical and public health benefits and cost effectiveness of starting therapy at higher CD4 counts is needed. Findings from such research will provide the Panel with guidance to make future recommendations. Effects of Viral Replication on HIV-Related Morbidity Since the mid-1990s, it has been known that measures of viral replication are predictive of HIV disease progression. In untreated HIV-infected individuals, time to clinical progression and mortality is fastest in those with higher viral loads.22This finding is confirmed across the wide spectrum of HIV-infected patientGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents E-5populations, including injection drug users (IDUs),23women,24and individuals with hemophilia.25Several studies have shown the prognostic value of pre-treatment viral load for predicting post-therapy response.26, 27 Once therapy has been initiated, failure to achieve viral suppression28-30and viral load at the time of treatment failure31are predictive of clinical disease progression. More recent studies have examined the impact of ongoing viral replication for both longer durations and at higher CD4 cell counts. Using viremia copy-years, a novel metric for quantifying viral load over time, theCenters for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) cohort found that cumulativeexposure to replicating virus is independently associated with mortality. Using viremia copy-years, the HRfor mortality was 1.81 per log 10copy-year/mL (95% CI: 1.51-2.18), which was the only viral load-related variable that retained statistical significance in the multivariable model (HR 1.44 per log10copy-year/mL; 95% CI: 1.07-1.94). These findings support the concept that unchecked viral replication, which occurs in theabsence of effective ART, is a factor in disease progression and death independent of CD4 count. 32 The EuroSIDA collaboration evaluated HIV-infected individuals with CD4 counts >350 cells/ 500-9,999 copies/mL, and 10,000 copies/mL) todetermine the impact viral load on fatal and non-fatal AIDS-related and non-AIDS-related events. Thelower viral load stratum included more subjects on ART (92%) than the middle (62%) and high (31%) viralload strata. After adjustment for age, region, and ART, the rates of non-AIDS events were 61% (P = 0.001) and 66% (P = 0.004) higher in participants with viral loads 500 to 9,999 copies/mL and >10,000 copies/mL, respectively, than in individuals with viral loads <500 copies/mL. These data further confirm that uncheckedviral replication is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in individuals with CD4 counts >350cells/mm 3.33 Collectively, these data show that the harm of ongoing viral replication affects both untreated patients andthose who are on ART but continue to be viremic. The harm of ongoing viral replication in patients on ARTis compounded by the risk of emergence of drug-resistant virus. Therefore, all patients on ART should becarefully monitored and counseled on the importance of adherence to therapy. Effects of ART on HIV-Related Morbidity HIV-associated immune deficiency, the direct effects of HIV on end organs, and the indirect effects of HIV-associated inflammation on these organs all most likely contribute to HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Ingeneral, the available data demonstrate that Untreated HIV infection may have detrimental effects at all stages of infection, Earlier treatment may prevent the damage associated with HIV replication during early stages of infection, ART is beneficial even when initiated later in infection; however, later therapy may not repair damage associated with viral replication that occurred during early stages of infection, and Sustaining viral suppression and maintaining higher CD4 count, mostly as a result of effective combination ART, may delay, prevent, or reverse some non-AIDS-defining complications, such as HIV- associated kidney disease, liver disease, CVD, neurologic complications, and malignancies, as discussed below. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIV AN) HIV AN is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease in HIV-infected individuals that may lead to end-stage kidney disease. 34HIV AN is almost exclusively seen in black patients and can occur at any CD4 count. Ongoing viral replication appears to be directly involved in renal injury,35and HIV AN is extremely uncommon in virologically suppressed patients.36ART in patients with HIV AN has been associated with bothGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents E-6preserved renal function and prolonged survival.37-39Therefore, ART should be started in all patients with HIV AN, regardless of CD4 count, at the earliest sign of renal dysfunction (AII). Coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) HIV infection is associated with more rapid progression of viral hepatitis-related liver disease, including cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and fatal hepatic failure.40-42The pathogenesis of accelerated liver disease in HIV-infected patients has not been fully elucidated, but HIV-relatedimmunodeficiency and a direct interaction between HIV and hepatic stellate and Kupffer cells have beenimplicated. 43-46In individuals co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV), ART may attenuate liver disease progression by preserving or restoring immune function and reducing HIV-related immune activation and inflammation. 47-49ARV drugs active against both HIV and HBV of significant liver disease by directly suppressing HBV replication. 50, 51Although ARV drugs do not inhibit HCV replication directly, HCV treatment outcomes typically improve when HIV replication iscontrolled or CD4 counts are increased. 52In one prospective cohort, after controlling for liver and HIV disease stage, HCV co-infected patients receiving ART were approximately 66% less likely to experienceend-stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and fatal hepatic failure than patients not receiving ART. 53 While some studies have shown that chronic viral hepatitis increases the risk of ART-induced liver injury, themajority of coinfected persons do not develop clinically significant liver injury 54-56and the rate of hepatotoxicity may be greater in persons with more advanced HIV disease. Collectively, these data suggestthat earlier treatment of HIV infection in persons coinfected with HBV (and likely HCV) may reduce the riskof liver disease progression. ART is recommended for patients coinfected with HBV; the ART regimenshould include drugs with activity against both HIV and HBV (AII) (also see Hepatitis B Virus/HIV Co- Infection ). ART also is recommended for most patients coinfected with HCV (BII), including those with high CD4 counts and those with cirrhosis. This recommendation is based on findings from retrospective andprospective cohort studies that indicated that the receipt of ART is associated with slower progression ofhepatic fibrosis and reduced risk of liver disease outcomes. 53, 57-59Combined treatment of both HIV and HCV can be complicated by large pill burden, drug interactions, and overlapping toxicities. Although ART shouldbe considered for HIV/HCV-co-infected patients regardless of CD4 cell count, for patients infected withHCV genotype 1, some clinicians may choose to defer ART in HIV treatment-naive patients with CD4counts >500 the protease inhibitors (PIs) is completed (also see HIV/Hepatitis C Virus Co-Infection ). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) In HIV-infected patients, CVD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for one-third of serious non-AIDS conditions and at least 10% of deaths.60-62A number of studies have found that, over time, HIV-infected persons are at greater risk for CVD events than age-matched uninfected individuals. In a meta- analysis and review of studies of CVD risk in HIV-infected individuals, the relative risk of CVD events was greater in untreated HIV-infected patients than in HIV-uninfected individuals (1.61: 95% CI 1.43 to 1.81).63 It is important to note, however, that the selected studies made comparisons to the general population, did not control for smoking or other potential confounders that could be lead to excessive CVD in the HIV-infected individuals, and also did not attempt to account for competing risks.64Thus, questions remain regarding the relative contributions of host-, treatment-, and disease-related factors to excess number of CVD events in those with HIV infection. Persons living with HIV infection have higher rates of established CVD risk factors, particularly smoking and dyslipidemia than HIV-uninfected individuals. In the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) cohort study such factors, including age; male obesity; smoking; family history of CVD; diabetes; and dyslipidemia, were each strongly and independently associated with risk of myocardialGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents E-7infarction (MI).65This study also found that the risk of CVD was greater with exposure to some ARV drugs, including certain PIs and abacavir, than with exposure to other ARV drugs.65, 66 In terms of preventing the progression to CVD events, it has not been determined whether delaying ART initiation is preferable to immediate treatment. In the meta-analysis mentioned above, the risk of CVD inHIV-infected individuals was 1.5 times higher in those being treated with ART than in those not beingtreated with ART. 63These analyses were limited by concern that the treated individuals may have been infected for longer periods of time and had prior episodes of untreated HIV disease, as well as the fact thatthe untreated people were at higher risk for competing events, including death. Furthermore, there isevidence that untreated HIV infection also may be associated with an increased risk of CVD. In the SMARTstudy, the risk of cardiovascular events was greater in participants randomized to CD4-guided treatmentinterruption than in participants who received continuous ART. 67In other studies, ART resulted in marked improvement in parameters associated with CVD, including markers of inflammation (such as interleukin 6[IL-6]), immune dysfunction (e.g., T cell activation, T cell senescence), monocyte activation (e.g., IL-6,CD163), hypercoagulation (e.g., D-dimers) nadir and/or proximal on-therapy CD4 cell count has been linked to CVD (MI and/or stroke),70-72suggesting that low CD4 count might result in increased risk of CVD. Collectively, the increased risk of cardiovascular events with treatment interruption, the effects of ART on markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, and the association between CVD and CD4 celldepletion suggest that early control of HIV replication with ART can be used as a strategy to reduce risk ofCVD, particularly if drugs with potential cardiovascular toxicity are avoided. However, at this time no studyhas demonstrated that initiation of ART prevents CVD. Therefore, a role for early ART in preventing CVDremains to be established. For HIV-infected individuals with a significant risk of CVD, as assessed bymedical history and established estimated risk calculations, risk of CVD should be taken into considerationwhen selecting a specific ART regimen. Malignancies Population-based analyses suggest that the incidence of both AIDS-defining malignancies (i.e., Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin non-AIDS-defining malignancies is increased inchronic HIV infection. The incidence of several malignancies (particularly liver, anal, oropharyngeal, andlung cancers, Hodgkin lymphoma, and melanoma) is higher in HIV-infected subjects than in matched HIV-uninfected controls, 73, 74and the burden of these non-AIDS defining malignancies has continued to increase in the United States between 1996 and 2007.75Large cohort studies enrolling mainly patients receiving ART have reported a consistent link between low CD4 counts (<350 cells/mm3to 500 cells/mm3) and malignancies.12, 72, 76-79The ANRS C04 Study demonstrated a statistically significant relative risk of all cancers evaluated (except for anal carcinoma) in patients with CD4 counts <500 cells/mm3compared with patients with current CD4 counts >500 cells/mm3, an increased risk of anal cancer based on time with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3, and, regardless of CD4 count, a protective effect of ART for HIV-associated malignancies.76This potential effect of HIV-associated immunodeficiency is striking particularly with regard to cancers associated with chronic viral infections such as HBV , HCV , virus-8 (HHV-8).80, 81 Cumulative HIV viremia, independent of other factors, may also be associated with the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other AIDS-defining malignancies.79, 82From the early 1990s through 2000, incidence rates for many cancers, including Kaposi sarcoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, declined markedly in HIV-infected individuals in the United States, with more gradual declines noted after 2000.83However, for other AIDS-defining and non-AIDS defining cancers, such as Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, cervical cancer, and anal cancer, similar reductions in incidence have not been observed.83, 84Declines in overall mortality and aging of HIV-infected cohorts increase overallGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents E-8cancer incidence, which may confound a clear assessment of the impact of ART on preventing the development of malignancies.75, 85In the SMART study,86patients randomized to the drug conservation arm (i.e., those starting ART with CD4 count <250 cells/mm3) had a higher incidence of AIDS-defining malignancies, but not non-AIDS defining malignancies, than patients in the viral suppression arm (i.e., thosereceiving continuous ART). In a pooled analysis of the ESPRIT and SMART studies, 87history of an AIDS- defining event increased risk of any cancer. Taken together this evidence suggests that initiating ART tosuppress HIV replication and maintain CD4 counts at levels >350 to 500 cells/mm 3reduces the overall incidence of AIDS-defining malignancies and may also reduce the risk of non-AIDS-defining malignancies.The effect on incidence is most likely heterogeneous across various cancer types. Neurological diseases Although HIV RNA can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of most untreated patients, 88, 89these patients usually do not present with overt symptoms of HIV-associated neurological disease.90In some patients, CNS infection progresses to HIV encephalitis and can present as HIV-associated dementia (HAD).91-93This progression is usually in the context of more advanced untreated systemic HIV infection when severe CNS opportunistic infections (OIs) also cause high morbidity and mortality.94 Effective viral suppression resulting from ART has dramatically reduced the incidence of HAD and severeCNS OIs. 95-97Suppressive ART usually reduces CSF HIV RNA to undetectable levels.98, 99Exceptional cases of symptomatic and asymptomatic CNS viral escape, in which HIV RNA is detectable in CSF despite viralsuppression in plasma, have been documented. 100, 101This suggests that in some settings it may be useful to monitor CSF HIV RNA. Recent attention has turned to milder forms of CNS dysfunction, defined by impairment on formal neuropsychological testing.93, 102It is unclear whether this impairment is a consequence of injury sustained before treatment initiation or whether neurologic damage can continue or develop despite systemicallyeffective ART. 103The association between cognitive impairment and low nadir CD4 counts supports the hypothesis for pretreatment injury and bolsters the argument that earlier initiation of ART may preventsubsequent brain dysfunction. 104, 105 The peripheral nervous system (PNS) also is a target in HIV infection, and several types of neuropathieshave been identified. 106Most common is HIV-associated polyneuropathy, a chronic, predominantly sensory and sometimes painful neuropathy. The impact of early treatment on this and other forms of neuropathy isnot as clearly defined as that on HAD. 107, 108 Age and treatment-related immune reconstitution (also see HIV and the Older Patient ) The CD4 cell response to ART is an important predictor of short- and long-term morbidity and mortality.Treatment initiation at an older age is consistently associated with a less robust CD4 count response; starting therapy at a younger age may result in better immunologic and perhaps clinical outcomes .109-112 T-cell activation and inflammation Early untreated HIV infection is associated with sustained high-level inflammation and T-cell activation.113-115 The degree of T-cell activation during untreated HIV disease is associated with risk of subsequent disease progression, independent of other factors such as plasma HIV RNA levels and peripheral CD4 T-cell count.116, 117ART results in a rapid, but often incomplete, decrease in most markers of HIV-associated immune activation.87, 118-121Persistent T-cell activation and/or T-cell dysfunction is particularly evident in patients who delay therapy until later stage disease (CD4 count <350 cells/mm3).119, 121, 122The degree of persistent inflammation during treatment, as represented by the levels of IL-6, D-dimers, sCD14, and sCD163, may be independently associated with risk of morbidity and mortality.123-125Collectively, these observations support earlier use of ART for at least two reasons. First, treatment decreases the level of inflammation, which may beGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents E-9associated with reduced short-term risk of AIDS- and non-AIDS-related morbidity and mortality.123, 126, 127 Second, because the degree of residual inflammation and/or T-cell dysfunction with ART appears to be higher in patients with lower CD4 cell nadirs,119, 121, 122earlier treatment may result in less residual immunological perturbations on therapy and, hence, less risk for AIDS- and non-AIDS-related complications (CIII). Antiretroviral Therapy for Prevention of HIV Transmission Prevention of perinatal transmission Effective ART reduces transmission of HIV . The most dramatic and well-established example of this effect is the use of ART in pregnant women to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV . Effective suppression of HIVreplication, as reflected in plasma HIV RNA, is a key determinant in reducing perinatal transmission. In thesetting of ART initiation before 28 weeks' gestation and an HIV RNA level <50 copies/mL near delivery, useof combination ART during pregnancy has reduced the rate of perinatal transmission of HIV fromapproximately 20% to 30% to <0.5%. 128Thus, use of combination ART drug regimens is recommended for all HIV-infected pregnant women (AI). Following delivery, in the absence of breastfeeding, considerationsregarding continuation of the ARV regimen for maternal therapeutic indications are the same as thoseregarding ART for other non-pregnant individuals. For detailed recommendations, see the Perinatal Guidelines .129 Prevention of sexual transmission Recent study results provide strong support for the premise that treatment of the HIV-infected individual can significantly reduce sexual transmission of HIV . Lower plasma HIV RNA levels are associated withdecreases in the concentration of the virus in genital secretions. 130, 131Studies of HIV-serodiscordant heterosexual couples have demonstrated a relationship between level of plasma viremia and risk oftransmission of HIV: when plasma HIV RNA levels are lower, transmission events are less common. 1, 132-135 HPTN 052 was a multicontinental trial that enrolled 1,763 HIV-serodiscordant couples in which the HIV-infected partner was ART naive with CD4 count 350 cells/mm 3to 550 cells/mm3at enrollment. The study compared immediate ART with delayed therapy (i.e., not started until CD4 count <250 cells/mm3) for the HIV-infected partner.2At study entry, 98% of the participants were in heterosexual monogamous relationships. All study participants were counseled on behavioral modification and condom use. Twenty-eight linked HIV transmission events were identified during the study period, but only 1 event occurred inthe early therapy arm. This 96% reduction in transmission associated with early ART was statisticallysignificant (HR 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.27, P <0.001). These results show that early ART is more effective at preventing transmission of HIV than all other behavioral and biomedical prevention interventions studied todate, including condom use, male circumcision, vaginal microbicides, HIV vaccination, and pre-exposureprophylaxis. This study, as well as other observational studies and modeling analyses showing a decreased rate of HIV transmission in serodiscordant heterosexual couples following the introduction of ART, demonstrate that suppression of viremia in ART-adherent patients with no concomitant sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) substantially reduces the risk of transmission of HIV . 3, 134-138HPTN 052 was conducted in heterosexual couples and not in populations at risk of transmission via homosexual exposure or needle sharing, but the prevention benefits of effective ART presumably apply to these populations as well. Therefore, the Panel recommends that ART be offered to patients who are at risk of transmitting HIV to sexual partners. (The strength of this recommendation varies according to mode of sexual transmission: AI for heterosexual transmission and AIII for male-to-male and other modes of sexual transmission.) Clinicians should discuss with patients the potential individual and public health benefits of therapy and the need for adherence to the prescribed regimen and counsel patients that ART is not a substitute for condom use and behavioral modification and that ART does not protect against other STDs (also see Preventing Secondary Transmission of HIV ).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents E-10Concerns Regarding Earlier Initiation of Therapy Despite increasing evidence for the benefits associated with earlier initiation of ART, three areas of concern have served as a rationale for deferral of HIV therapy: ARV drug toxicities have an adverse affect on quality of life and adherence. Earlier initiation of ART extends exposure to ARV agents by several years. The D:A:D study found an increased incidence of CVD associated with cumulative exposure to some drugs in the nucleoside reversetranscriptase inhibitor and PI drug classes. 65, 139In the SMART study, when compared with interruption or deferral of therapy, continuous exposure to ART was associated with significantly greater loss of bonedensity. 67There may be unknown complications related to cumulative use of ARV drugs for many decades. A list of known ARV-associated toxicities can be found in Adverse Effects of Antiretroviral Agents . ART frequently improves quality of life for symptomatic patients. However, some side effects of ART mayimpair quality of life for some patients, especially those who are asymptomatic at initiation of therapy. Forexample, efavirenz (EFV) can cause neurocognitive or psychiatric side effects and PIs have been associatedwith gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. As noted above, it has been suggested that some therapies increase therisk of CVD. Some patients may find that the inconvenience of taking medication every day outweighs theoverall benefit of early ART and may choose to delay therapy. ARV non-adherence may have an impact on virologic efficacy. At any CD4 count, adherence to therapy is essential to achieve viral suppression and prevent emergence of drug-resistance mutations. Several behavioral and social factors associated with poor adherence, such asuntreated major psychiatric disorders, active substance abuse, unfavorable social circumstances, patientconcerns about side effects, and poor adherence to clinic visits, have been identified. Clinicians shouldidentify areas where additional intervention is needed to improve adherence both before and after initiationof therapy. Some strategies to improve adherence are discussed in Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy . Earlier development of resistance may reduce therapeutic options at a later time. Despite concerns about the development of resistance to ARV drugs, the evidence thus far indicates that resistance occurs more frequently in individuals who initiate therapy later in the course of infection than inthose who initiate ART earlier. 140Furthermore, recent data have indicated a slight increase in the prevalence of 2-drug class resistance from 2000 to 2005.141 Cost. In resource-rich countries, the cost of ART exceeds $10,000 per year (see Appendix B, Table 8 ). Several modeling studies support the cost effectiveness of HIV therapy initiated soon after diagnosis.142-144One study reported that the annual cost of care is 2.5 times higher for patients with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3than for patients with CD4 counts >350 cells/mm3.145A large proportion of the health care expenditure in patients with advanced infection is from non-ARV drugs and hospitalization. There are no cost comparisons for patients starting ART with CD4 count 350 to 500 cells/mm3and patients starting ART with CD4 count >500 cells/mm3. Conditions Favoring More Rapid Initiation of Therapy Several conditions increase the urgency for therapy, including: Pregnancy (AI) (Clinicians should refer to the Perinatal Guidelines for more detailed recommendations on the management of HIV-infected pregnant women.)129 AIDS-defining conditions, including HIV-associated dementia (AI)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents E-11 Acute opportunistic infections (OIs) (see discussion below) Lower CD4 counts (e.g., <200 cells/mm3) (AI) HIV AN (AII) Acute/recent infection (BII) (see more discussion in the Acute and Recent (Early) Infection section) HIV/HBV coinfection (AII) HIV/HCV coinfection (BII) Rapidly declining CD4 counts (e.g., >100 cells/mm3decrease per year) (AIII) Higher viral loads (e.g., >100,000 copies/mL) (BII) Acute opportunistic infections In patients with opportunistic conditions for which no effective therapy exists (e.g., cryptosporidiosis, microsporidiosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) but in whom ART may improve outcomes byimproving immune responses, the benefits of ART outweigh any increased risk; therefore, treatment shouldbe started as soon as possible (AIII). In the setting of some OIs for which immediate therapy may increase the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis or nontuberculous mycobacterial infections), ashort delay before initiating ART may be warranted (CIII). 146, 147In the setting of other OIs, such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), early initiation of ART is associated with increased survival;8 therefore, therapy should not be delayed (AI). In patients who have active TB, initiating ART during treatment for TB confers a significant survival advantage;148-152therefore, ART should be initiated as recommended in Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Disease with HIV Coinfection . Clinicians should refer to the Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV- Infected Adults and Adolescents153for more detailed discussion on when to initiate ART in the setting of a specific OI. Conditions Where Deferral of Therapy May be Considered Some patients and their clinicians may decide to defer therapy for a period of time on the basis of clinical orpersonal circumstances. Deferring therapy for the reasons discussed below may be reasonable in patientswith high CD4 counts (e.g., >500 cells/mm 3) but deferring therapy in patients with much lower CD4 counts (e.g., <200 cells/mm3) should be considered only in rare situations and should be undertaken with close clinical follow-up. Briefly delaying therapy to allow a patient more time to prepare for lifelong treatmentmay be considered. When there are significant barriers to adherence (also see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy ) In patients with higher CD4 counts who are at risk of poor adherence, it may be prudent to defer treatment while addressing the barriers to adherence. However, in patients with conditions that require urgent initiation of ART (see above), therapy should be started while simultaneously addressing the barriers to adherence. Several methodologies exist to help providers assess adherence. When the most feasible measure of adherence is self-report, this assessment should be completed at each clinic visit using one of the available reliable and valid instruments.154, 155If other objective measures (e.g., pharmacy refill data, pill count) are available, these methods should be used to assess adherence at each follow-up visit.156-158Continuous assessment and counseling make it possible for the clinician to intervene early to address barriers to adherence occurring at any point during treatment (see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy ).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents E-12Presence of comorbidities that complicate or prohibit antiretroviral therapy Deferral of ART may be considered when either the treatment or manifestations of other medical conditions may complicate the treatment of HIV infection or vice versa. Examples include: Surgery that may result in an extended interruption of ART Treatment with medications that have clinically significant drug interactions with ART and for which alternative medications are not available In each of these circumstances, the assumption is that the situation is temporary and that ART will be initiated after the conflicting condition has resolved. Some less common situations exist in which ART may not be indicated at any time while CD4 counts remain high. In particular, such situations include that of patients with a poor prognosis due to a concomitantmedical condition who would not be expected to gain survival or quality-of-life benefits from ART.Examples include patients with incurable non-HIV-related malignancies or end-stage liver disease who arenot being considered for liver transplantation. The decision to forego ART in such patients may be easier tomake in those with higher CD4 counts; they are likely asymptomatic for HIV , and their survival is unlikely tobe prolonged by ART. However, it should be noted that ART may improve outcomes, including survival, inpatients with some HIV-associated malignancies (e.g., lymphoma or Kaposi sarcoma) and in due to chronic HBV or HCV . Long-term nonprogressors and elite HIV controllers A small subset of HIV-infected individuals (~3% to 5%) maintain normal CD4 counts for many years in the absence of therapy (long-term nonprogressors), and an even smaller subset (~1%) maintain undetectable HIVRNA level for years (\"elite\" controllers). 159, 160Many long-term non-progressors have detectable viremia while some elite controllers progress immunologically and/or clinically despite having no detectable viremia. The evidence on how to manage these individuals is limited. Given the potential harm associated with uncontrolled HIV replication, many of the preceding arguments for early therapy most likely apply to non-progressors who have consistently detectable viremia (i.e., HIV RNA >200 to 1000 copies/mL). Also giventhat ongoing HIV replication occurs in elite controllers, ART is also recommended for those rare controllerswho exhibit evidence of disease progression, as defined by declining CD4 counts or development of HIV-related complications. The Panel has no recommendations for the management of controllers with high CD4counts, but the fact that these individuals have higher than normal levels of inflammation and immuneactivation provides at least some rationale for treatment. Clinical trials assessing the potential benefit oftherapy in these individuals are ongoing. The Need for Early Diagnosis of HIV Fundamental to the earlier initiation of ART recommended in these guidelines is the assumption that patients will be diagnosed early in the course of HIV infection and linked to medical care, thereby, making earlier initiation of therapy an option. Unfortunately, most cases of HIV infection are not diagnosed until patients are at much later stages of disease,161-164although the mean CD4 count at initial presentation for care has increased in more recent years.4Despite the 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for routine, opt-out HIV screening in the health care setting regardless of perceptions about a patient's risk of infection,165the median CD4 count of newly diagnosed patients remains below 350 cells/mm3.4The exception is pregnant women whose infection was diagnosed during prenatal care; they have a much higher median initial CD4 count. Compared with other groups, diagnosis of HIV infection is more often delayed in nonwhites, IDUs, and older patients, and a substantial proportion of these individuals develop AIDS-defining illnesses within 1 year of diagnosis.161-164Thus, for the current treatment guidelinesGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents E-13to have maximum impact, routine HIV screening per current CDC recommendations is essential. It is also critical to educate all newly diagnosed patients about HIV disease and link them to care for full evaluation,follow-up, and management. Once patients are in care, focused effort is required to retain them in the healthcare system so that both infected individuals and their sexual partners can accrue the full benefits of earlydiagnosis and treatment. Conclusion The current recommendations are based on greater evidence supporting earlier initiation of ART than wasadvocated in previous guidelines. The strength of the recommendations varies according to the quality andavailability of existing evidence supporting each recommendation. In addition to benefitting the health of theHIV-infected individual, the evidence that effective ART reduces sexual transmission to HIV provides furtherreason for earlier initiation of ART. The Panel will continue to monitor and assess the results of ongoing andplanned randomized clinical trials and observational studies. Findings from these studies will provide thePanel with additional guidance to form future recommendations. References 1. Quinn TC, Wawer MJ, Sewankambo N, et al.

These 6 classes include the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). An initial ARV regimen generally consists of two NRTIs in combination with an NNRTI, a PI (preferably boosted with ritonavir [RTV]), an INSTI, antagonist-based have all resulted in HIV RNA decreases and CD4cell increases in a large majority of patients. 1-7 Data Used for Making Recommendations The Panel's recommendations are primarily based on clinical trial data published in peer-reviewed journals anddata prepared by manufacturers for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review. In select cases, the Panelconsiders data presented in abstract format at major scientific meetings. The first criterion for selection ofevidence on which to base recommendations is published information from a randomized, prospective clinical trial with an adequate sample size that demonstrates that an ARV regimen has shown durable viral suppression and immunologic enhancement (as evidenced by increase in CD4 count). Few of these trials include clinical endpoints, such as development of AIDS-defining illness or death. Thus, assessment of regimen efficacy and potency is primarily based on surrogate marker endpoints (HIV RNA and CD4 responses). The Panel reviewed data from randomized clinical trials and other reports to arrive at \"preferred,\" \"alternative,\" or \"other\" ratings for each regimen noted in Tables 5a and 5b . \"Preferred regimens\" are those regimens studied in randomized controlled trials and shown to have optimal and durable virologic efficacy, favorable tolerability and toxicity profiles, and ease of use. \"Alternative regimens\" are those regimens that are effective but have potential disadvantages when compared with preferred regimens. In certain situations and based on individual patient characteristics and needs, a regimen listed as an alternative may actually be the preferred regimen for a specific patient. Some regimens are classified as \"other regimens\" because of reduced virologic activity, lack of efficacy data from large clinical trials, or other factors (such as greaterPanel's Recommendations The Panel recommends the following as preferred regimens (listed in order of FDA approval) for TDF/FTC) (AI) Panel-recommended alternative and other regimens can be found in Table 5a and Table 5b . Selection of a regimen should be individualized on the basis of virologic efficacy, toxicity, pill burden, dosing frequency, drug-drug interaction potential, resistance testing results, and comorbid conditions. Based on individual patient characteristics and needs, in some instances, an alternative or other regimen may be a preferred regimen for a specific patient. Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = Data from randomized controlled trials; II = Data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinionGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-2toxicities, pill burden, drug interaction potential, or need for additional testing before use) when compared with preferred or alternative regimens. Considerations When Selecting a First Antiretroviral Regimen for Antiretroviral Therapy- Naive Patients Factors to Consider When Selecting an Initial Regimen Regimen selection should be individualized on the basis of several factors, including the following: the patient's comorbid conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease [CVD], chemical dependency, liver or renal disease, psychiatric illnesses, or tuberculosis [TB]); potential adverse drug effects; known or potential drug interactions with other medications; pregnancy or pregnancy potential; results of genotypic HIV considering MVC; patient preferences (when possible) and adherence potential; and convenience (e.g., factors such as pill burden, dosing frequency, availability of fixed dose combinationproducts, and food and fluid requirements). Potential advantages and disadvantages of the components recommended as initial therapy for ARV-naive patients are listed in Table 6 to guide prescribers in choosing the optimal regimen for an individual patient. Table 7 provides a list of agents or components not recommended for initial treatment. Appendix B, Tables 1-6list characteristics of individual ARV agents, such as formulations, dosing recommendations, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and common adverse effects. Appendix B, Table 7 provides clinicians with ARV dosing recommendations for patients who have renal or hepatic insufficiency. Choosing Between Preferred Initial Regimens Each of the four preferred initial regimens listed in Table 5a has shown potent virologic efficacy as measured by the proportion of subjects achieving and maintaining viral suppression in comparative clinical trials.Given the comparable efficacy of the preferred regimens, selection of an optimal regimen for a specific patient will depend on other factors, including characteristics of the regimen (e.g., adverse event profile, barrier to resistance, dosing frequency, pill burden, food restrictions, the availability of fixed-dose combination formulations, the potential for drug-drug interactions), the patient's pre-treatment resistance testing results, and whether the patient is a woman who may become pregnant. A complete description of the advantages and disadvantages of the preferred and alternative options for therapy are listed in Table 6 . Currently, all of the preferred initial regimens include the NRTI combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), which is available as a fixed-dose combination tablet. In two comparative clinical trials, this NRTI combination was more effective than the alternative NRTI pair, abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC),8, 9but in a third study, the NRTI combinations showed comparable efficacy.10TDF may cause kidney injury in some patients, particularly in those who have pre-existing renal disease or are receiving concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. In addition, TDF induces a greater decline in bone mineral density than other ARV drugs.11Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-3Of the four preferred regimens, efavirenz (EFV) in combination with TDF/FTC has been studied in the greatest number of clinical trials.6, 12-15This regimen is available in a single tablet, once-daily formulation, and is generally well tolerated. Disadvantages of the regimen include central nervous system (CNS) side effects thatresolve over time in some (but not all) patients, a higher incidence of rash (including severe skin reactions)than with other preferred regimens, and dyslipidemia. Owing to concerns related to potential teratogenicityemerging from animal studies and some human case reports, ARV regimens that do not include EFV should bestrongly considered in women who wish to conceive or are sexually active and not using effectivecontraception, assuming these alternative regimens are not thought to compromise the woman's health. Initial treatment with ritonavir (RTV) boosted PI-containing regimens is unique from the resistanceperspective, as virologic failure rarely selects for PI-resistance and NRTI resistance is uncommon. As aresult, some clinicians consider these the initial regimens of choice for patients at higher risk for virologicfailure due to suboptimal adherence, inconsistent follow-up, or other factors. A disadvantage of RTV-boostedPI-based regimens is the large number of drug-drug interactions, in particular with medications metabolizedthrough the cytochrome p450 pathway. As a result, RTV-boosted PI-based regimens may be difficult to use inpatients who are taking many other medications. RTV-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) is as effective as EFV , but causes less rash and has a more favorable lipid profile. 13ATV induces reversible indirect hyperbilirubinemia, which may result in visible jaundice or scleral icterus in a small proportion of patients; ATV has also been associated with nephrolithiasis and cholelithiasis.Optimal absorption of ATV depends on presence of food and low gastric pH; if acid-reducing agents areneeded, co-administration should be done according to the dosing guidelines shown in Table 15a . RTV- boosted darunavir (DRV/r) shares many of the characteristics of boosted ATV , but does not causehyperbilirubinemia and can be given with acid-reducing agents. There are no fully-powered clinical trialsthat compare the virologic efficacy of DRV/r and ATV/r. One small study found that these boosted-PIs hadcomparable effects on lipids. 16Both ATV/r and DRV/r can be given once daily. Raltegravir (RAL) plus TDF/FTC demonstrated comparable antiviral efficacy to EFV/TDF/FTC, with fewerdrug-related adverse effects and a more favorable lipid profile. 6RAL has fewer drug-drug interactions than both boosted-PI and EFV-based regimens, and is therefore easier to add to a patient's complex medicationregimen. Rare but severe side effects (e.g., rhabdomyolysis, severe skin, systemic hypersensitivity reactions)have been reported with RAL. RAL plus TDF/FTC is the only preferred regimen that requires twice-dailydosing. There are clinical scenarios in which options for initial therapy should be chosen from the list of alternative and other regimens rather than from the preferred list. Tables 5a and 5b provide a list of alternative and other regimens that may be prescribed for select patients. Table 6 lists the advantages and disadvantages of the individual ARV components of the regimens. Acute symptomatic HIV infection may be diagnosed while an individual is receiving TDF/FTC for pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) (see Acute and Recent [Early] HIV Infection ). As with all newly diagnosed cases of HIV-infection, genotype testing should be performed. In most cases, HIV infection in this setting is secondary to suboptimal adherence17to the prescribed daily TDF/FTC regimen, hence resistance in the setting of PrEP failure in clinical trials has been uncommon. Pending genotype testing results, a regimen consisting of a boosted PI (ATV/r or DRV/r) plus TDF/FTC (AIII) can be initiated. ARV drugs should be modified as needed based on the results of baseline resistance testing. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-4Table 5a. Preferred and Alternative Antiretroviral Regimens for Antiretroviral Therapy-Naive Patients A combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen generally consists of two NRTIs plus one active drug from one of the following classes: NNRTI, PI (generally boosted with RTV), INSTI, or a CCR5 antagonist. Selection of a regimen should beindividualized on the basis of virologic efficacy, toxicity, pill burden, dosing frequency, drug-drug interaction potential, and thepatient's resistance testing results and comorbid conditions. Refer to Table 6 for a list of advantages and disadvantages of the individual ARV agents listed below and to Appendix B, Tables 1-6 for dosing information. The regimens in each category are listed in alphabetical order. For more detailed recommendations on ARV use in HIV-infected pregnant women, refer to the latest perinatalguidelines available at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines . Preferred Regimens Regimens with optimal and durable efficacy, favorable tolerability and toxicity profile, and ease of use. The preferred regimens for non-pregnant patients are arranged by chronological order of FDA approval of components other than nucleosides and, thus, by duration of clinical experience. NNRTI-Based Regimen PI-Based Regimens (in + TDF/FTCa(AI)Comments EFVis teratogenic in non-human primates. A regimen that does not include EFV should be strongly considered in women who are planning to becomepregnant or who are sexually active and not using effective contraception. TDFshould be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency. ATV/rshould not be used in patients who require >20 mg omeprazole equivalent per day. Refer to Table 15a for dosing recommendations regarding interactions between ATV/r and acid-lowering agents.

Other Antiretroviral Regimens for Antiretroviral Therapy-Naive Patients The discussions below focus on the rationale for the Panel's recommendations, which are based on the efficacy, safety, and other characteristics of different agents within the individual drug classes. Non-Nucleoside regimens have demonstrated virologic potency and durability. The major disadvantages of currently available NNRTIs involve the prevalence of NNRTI-resistant viral strains in ART-naive patients18-21 and the NNRTIs' low genetic barrier for the development of resistance. Resistance testing should be performed to guide therapy selection for ART-naive patients (see Drug-Resistance Testing ). High level resistance to all NNRTIs (except ETR) may occur with a single mutation; cross resistance is common. ETR has in vitro activity against some viruses with mutations that confer resistance to DLV , EFV , and NVP.22In RPV-treated patients, the presence of RPV-resistant mutations at virologic failure is common and may confer cross resistance to other NNRTIs including ETR.14, 23Regimens that may be selected for some patients but are less satisfactory than preferred or alternative regimens listed in Table 5a Comments NVPshould not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).b NVPshould not be used in women with pre-ART CD4 cells/mm3or ABCtogether with caution; both can cause HSRs within the first few weeks after initiation of therapy.

MVC may be considered in patients who have only CCR5-tropic virus. SQV/rwas associated with PR and QT prolongation in a healthy volunteer study.

Key to Abbreviations: 3TC = lamivudine, ABC = abacavir, ART = antiretroviral therapy, ATV = atazanavir, ATV/r = atazanavir/ritonavir, AV = atrioventricular, for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-6The Panel recommends that EFV , RPV , or NVP may be used as part of an initial regimen. EFV is preferred on the basis of its potency (as discussed below). RPV may be used as an alternative NNRTI option in patientswith pre-treatment HIV RNA < 100,000 copies/mL; NVP may be another NNRTI option in women withpretreatment counts 250 cells/mm 3or in men with pretreatment CD4 counts 400 cells/mm3(see discussions below). Compared with the other NNRTIs, DLV has the highest dosing frequency (three times daily), the least supportive clinical trial data, and the least antiviral activity. Therefore, DLV is not recommended as part of an initial regimen (BIII). ETR at a dose of 200 mg twice daily is approved for use in treatment-experiencedpatients with virologic failure. 24In a small, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, ETR 400 mg once daily was compared with EFV 600 mg once daily (both in combination with two NRTIs) intreatment-naive subjects (79 and 78 subjects in the ETR and EFV arms, respectively). Virologic responseswere comparable at 48 weeks. 25However, pending results from larger clinical trials, the panel cannot recommend ETR as initial therapy at this time. Following is a more detailed discussion of individual NNRTI-based regimens for initial therapy. Efavirenz (EFV). Large randomized, controlled trials and cohort studies of ART-naive patients have demonstrated potent viral suppression in patients treated with EFV plus two NRTIs; a substantial proportion of these patients had HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at up to 7 years of follow-up.1, 2, 26Studies that compared EFV-based regimens with other regimens demonstrated that the combination of adverse effects, such as abnormal dreams, dizziness, headache, and depression, whichusually resolve over a few weeks in some (but not all) patients. In animal reproductive studies, EFV at drugexposure levels similar to those achieved in humans caused major congenital anomalies in the CNS ofnonhuman primates. 29In humans, several cases of neural tube defects in newborns of mothers exposed to EFV during the first trimester of pregnancy have been reported.30, 31Although emerging information about the use of EFV in pregnancy is reassuring,32, 33data remain insufficient to rule out a potential 2 to 3 fold increase in neural tube birth defects with first-trimester exposure to EFV . Therefore, alternative ARVregimens that do not include EFV should be strongly considered in women who are planning to becomepregnant or who are sexually active and not using effective contraception, assuming these alternativeregimens are acceptable to the provider and are not thought to compromise the woman's health. Because therisk of neural tube defects is restricted to the first 5 to 6 weeks of pregnancy (before pregnancy is usuallyrecognized), and because unnecessary ARV changes during pregnancy may be associated with loss of viralcontrol and increased risk of perinatal transmission, EFV can be continued in pregnant women receiving an EFV-based regimen who present for antenatal care in the first trimester, provided the regimen produces virologic suppression. 34 In studies using EFV and 3TC), the regimens show durable virologic activity, although responses vary depending on the dual-NRTI combination chosen (see Dual-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor Options ). EFV is formulated both as a single-drug tablet and in a fixed-dose combination tablet of EFV/TDF/FTC that allows for once daily dosing. EFV/TDF/FTC is currently a preferred initial treatment regimen (AI). Alternative Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor-Based Regimens Rilpivirine randomized, double-blind clinical trials, RPV (25 mg once daily) was compared with EFV (600 mg once daily), each agent in combination with two NRTIs. In a pooledGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-7analysis of the 2 studies, 76% of RPV-treated subjects and 77% of EFV-treated subjects had plasma HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at 96 weeks.23Although RPV demonstrated non-inferiority to EFV participants with pretreatment HIV RNA (>100,000 copies/mL), virologic failure occurred morefrequently in those randomized . Moreover, more subjects with pre-treatment CD4 count <200cells/mm 3, regardless of baseline HIV RNA, experienced virologic failure than those with pre-ART CD4 count 200 cells/mm3. Subjects with virologic failure on RPV were also more likely to have genotypic resistance to other NNRTIs (i.e., EFV , ETR, and and to have TDF- and/or 3TC/FTC-associatedgenotypic resistance. Drug discontinuations because of adverse effects were more common with EFV than with RPV . The frequency of depressive disorders and discontinuations due to depressive disorders were similar between thetwo arms, whereas dizziness, abnormal dreams, rash, and hyperlipidemia were more frequent with EFV thanwith RPV . At higher than the approved dose of 25 mg, RPV (75 mg once daily or 300 mg once daily) may prolong the QTc interval. As a result, RPV should be used cautiously when co-administered with a drug that has a knownrisk of torsades de pointes. Although RPV has shown no teratogenicity in animal studies, data on PKs andsafety of RPV in pregnant HIV-infected women are insufficient at this time. RPV is formulated both as an individual tablet and in a fixed-dose combination tablet of RPV/TDF/FTC. The latter allows for one-tablet once-daily dosing. RPV must be administered with a meal. Because the oralbioavailability of RPV may be significantly reduced in the presence of acid-lowering agents, RPV should beused with caution with antacids and antagonists. use with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) iscontraindicated. Table 15b provides guidance on the timing of RPV administration when the agent is used with antacids or H2 receptor antagonists. In patients with high pretreatment viral load (HIV RNA >100,000 copies/mL) or low CD4 cell count (<200 cells/mm3), RPV has less virologic activity and a higher rate of resistance at virologic failure than EFV . The panel recommends RPV/TDF/FTC as an alternative regimen for initial therapy, which should only be used inpatients with pre-treatment HIV RNA < 100,000 copies/mL (BI). RPV should not be used in patients withplasma given d4T and 3TC, in ART-naive patients. In this trial, 65% of participants in the twice-daily NVP arm and 70% in the EFV arm achieved virologicsuppression (defined as HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) at 48 weeks. This difference did not reach criteria necessaryto demonstrate non-inferiority of NVP. 27Two deaths were attributed to NVP use: one from fulminant hepatitis and one from staphylococcal sepsis as a complication of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). In the ARTEN trial, ART-naive participants were randomized to NVP 200 mg twice daily or 400 mg once daily, or to RTV-boosted ATV (ATV/r), all in combination with TDF/FTC. The proportion of participants in each arm who achieved the primary endpoint of having at least two consecutive plasma HIV RNA levels <50 copies/mL before Week 48 was similar (66.8% of NVP participants vs. 65.3% of ATV/r participants). However, more participants in the NVP arms than in the ATV/r arm discontinued study drugs before Week 48 because of adverse events (13.6% on NVP vs. 2.6% on ATV/r) or lack NVP vs. 1.6% on ATV/r). NNRTI- and/or NRTI-resistance mutations were selected in 29 of 44 (65.9%) participants who experienced virologic failure while on NVP, whereas resistance mutations were not detected in any of the 28 participants who had virologic failure on ATV/r.35 Serious hepatic events have been observed when NVP was initiated in ART-naive patients. These events generally occur within the first few weeks of treatment. In addition to experiencing elevated serumGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-8transaminases, approximately half of the patients also develop skin rash, with or without fever or flu-like symptoms. Some events, particularly those with rash and other systemic symptoms, have progressed to liverfailure. Retrospective analysis of reported events suggests that women with higher CD4 counts appear to be athighest risk for serious hepatic events. 36, 37A 12-fold higher incidence of symptomatic hepatic events was seen in women with CD4 counts >250 cells/mm3at the time of NVP initiation than in women with CD4 counts 250 cells/mm3at NVP initiation (11.0% vs. 0.9%, respectively). The risk was also greater in men with pre- treatment CD4 counts >400 cells/mm3than in with men with pre-treatment CD4 counts 400 cells/mm3(6.3% vs. 1.2%, respectively). Most of these patients had no identifiable underlying hepatic abnormalities. In somecases, hepatic injuries continued to progress despite discontinuation of NVP. 37, 38In contrast, other studies have not shown an association between baseline CD4 counts and severe NVP hepatotoxicity.39, 40 Symptomatic hepatic events have not been reported in mothers or infants given single-dose NVP to preventperinatal HIV infection. On the basis of the safety and efficacy data discussed above, the Panel classifies NVP-based combinations inthe Other NNRTI-Based Regimens category as initial therapy in women with pretreatment CD4 counts 250 cells/mm3or in men with pretreatment CD4 counts 400 cells/mm3(C). Patients whose CD4 count increases to levels above these thresholds as a result of NVP-containing therapy can safely continue therapy without anincreased risk of adverse hepatic events. 41 NVP should be initiated at a dosage of 200 mg once daily for a 14-day lead-in period before being increasedto the maintenance dosage of 400 mg per day (as an extended-release 400 mg tablet once daily or 200 mgimmediate-release tablet twice daily). The lead-in period has been observed to decrease the incidence of rash.Some experts recommend monitoring serum transaminases at baseline, at 2 weeks, again 2 weeks after doseescalation, and then monthly for the first 18 weeks. Clinical and laboratory parameters should be assessed ateach and durability in treatment-naive subjects. In contrast to NNRTI- and INSTI-based regimens, few or no PI mutations aredetected in patients who developed virologic failure on their first PI-based regimen. 35, 42Each PI has its own virologic potency, adverse effect profile, and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. The characteristics,advantages, and disadvantages of each PI are listed in Table 6 and Appendix B, Table 3 . When selecting a boosted PI-based regimen for an ART-naive patient, clinicians should consider factors such as dosingfrequency, food requirements, pill burden, daily RTV dose, drug interaction potential, toxicity profile of theindividual PI, and baseline lipid profile and pregnancy status of the patient. See the Perinatal Guidelines for specific recommendations in pregnancy.34 A number of metabolic abnormalities, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, have been associated with PI use. The currently available PIs differ in their propensity to cause these metabolic complications, which also depends on the dose of RTV used as a PK boosting agent. Two large observational cohort studies fosamprenavir (FPV), or RTV-boosted rates of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke.43, 44This association was not seen with ATV .45 These studies had too few patients receiving DRV/r to be included in the analysis. RTV-boosted saquinavir (SQV/r) can prolong the PR and QT intervals on electrocardiogram (ECG). The degree of QT prolongation seen with SQV/r is greater than that seen with some other boosted PIs. Therefore, SQV/r should be used with caution in patients with underlying heart conditions such as heart rate or rhythm problems, or who use concomitant drugs that may increase the risk of developing these ECG abnormalities.46 SQV/r is rarely used for initial therapy for this reason, and because, when compared with other PI-basedGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-9regimens, the regimen has a higher pill burden and no clear advantages. The potent inhibitory effect of RTV on the cytochrome P (CYP) 450 3A isoenzyme allows the addition of low-dose RTV to other PIs as a PK enhancer to increase drug exposure and prolong the plasma half-life ofthe active PI. The drawbacks associated with this strategy are the potential for increased risk ofhyperlipidemia and a greater potential of drug-drug interactions from the addition of RTV . RTV boosting isrecommended in all PI-based regimens whenever possible; when boosting is not possible and a PI-basedregimen is desired, only ATV should be used. In patients without pre-existing PI resistance, once-dailyboosted PI regimens that use only 100 mg of RTV per day are preferred. These regimens tend to cause fewergastrointestinal (GI) side effects and less metabolic toxicity than regimens that use RTV at a dose of 200 mgper day. The Panel uses the following criteria to distinguish between preferred, alternative, and other PIs for use in ART-naive patients: Demonstrated superior or non-inferior virologic efficacy when compared with at least one other PI-based regimen, based on, at least, published 48-week data RTV-boosted PI using no more than 100 mg of RTV per day Once-daily dosing Low pill count Good tolerability. Using these criteria, the Panel recommends once-daily ATV/r and DRV/r as preferred PIs. Preferred Protease Inhibitor-Based alphabetical order, by active PI component Ritonavir-Boosted Atazanavir (ATV/r). In a clinical trial, ATV/r enhanced ATV concentrations and improved virologic activity more than unboosted ATV .47The CASTLE study compared once-daily ATV/r with twice-daily LPV/r, each in combination with TDF/FTC, in 883 ARV-naive participants. In this open- label, noninferiority study, the two regimens showed similar virologic and CD4 responses at 48 weeks48and at 96 weeks.49More hyperbilirubinemia and less GI toxicity were seen in the ATV/r arm than in the LPV/r arm. This study supports the designation of ATV/r + TDF/FTC as a preferred PI-based regimen (AI). The main adverse effect associated with ATV/r is indirect hyperbilirubinemia, with or without jaundice or but without concomitant hepatic transaminase elevations. Nephrolithiasis50-52and cholelithiasis53also have been reported in patients who received ATV . ATV/r requires acidic gastric pH for dissolution. Thus, concomitant use of drugs that raise gastric pH (e.g., antacids, H2 antagonists, and particularly PPIs), may impair absorption of ATV . Table 15a provides recommendations for use of ATV/r with these agents. Ritonavir-Boosted Darunavir (DRV/r). The ARTEMIS study compared DRV/r (800/100 mg once daily) with LPV/r (once or twice daily), both in combination with TDF/FTC, in a randomized, open-label, non- inferiority trial. The 689 DRV/r was non-inferior to LPV/r at 48 weeks54, and superior at week 192.55In participants with baseline HIV RNA levels >100,000 copies/mL, virologic response rates were lower in the LPV/r arm than in the DRV/r arm. Grades 2 to 4 adverse events, primarily diarrhea, were seen more frequently in LPV/r recipients than in DRV/r recipients. At virologic failure, no major PI mutations were detected in participants randomized to either arm.42, 55Based on these data, the Panel recommends DRV/r + TDF/FTC as a preferred PI-based regimen (AI). No randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of DRV/r with other 2-NRTI combinations exists. A smallGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-10retrospective study suggested that DRV/r plus ABC/3TC may be effective in treatment-naive patients for up to 48 weeks.56Based on this preliminary information, the Panel recommends this combination as an alternative PI-based regimen (BIII). Alternative Protease Inhibitor-Based Regimens active component Ritonavir-Boosted Fosamprenavir (FPV/r, once or twice daily). FPV/r is an alternative PI. The KLEAN trial compared twice-daily FPV/r with LPV/r, each in combination with ABC and 3TC, in ART-naivepatients. At Weeks 48 and 144, similar percentages of subjects achieved viral loads <400 copies/mL. 57, 58The frequency and severity of adverse events did not differ between the regimens. Twice-daily FPV/r was non-inferior to twice-daily LPV/r. Based on preference for once-daily more than 100mg/day of RTV , twice-daily FPV is considered an alternative choice. A trial of once-daily FPV/r (1400/100 mg) and once-daily ATV/r, both in combination TDF/FTC, was conducted in 106 ARV-naive participants. 59The regimens showed similar virologic and CD4 benefits. The study's small sample size precludes the assessment of superior or non-inferior virologicefficacy required for a preferred PI. Collectively, FPV/r the only available coformulated boosted PI. It can be given once or twice daily. However, because LPV/r must be boosted with 200 mg/day of RTV and is associated with higher rates of GI side effects and hyperlipidemia than other PIs boosted with 100 mg ofRTV , LPV/r is recommended as an alternative PI for ART-naive patients. A 7-year follow-up study of LPV/rand 2 NRTIs showed sustained virologic suppression in patients who were maintained on the originallyassigned regimen. 60Results of clinical trials that compared LPV/r with ATV/r, DRV/r, FPV/r, or SQV/r are discussed in the related sections of this document. The ACTG 5142 study showed that, when compared withEFV plus 2 NRTIs, the regimen of twice-daily LPV/r plus 2 NRTIs had decreased virologic efficacy.However, the CD4 response was greater with LPV/r, and there was less drug resistance associated withvirologic failure. 4 In addition to diarrhea, major adverse effects of LPV/r include insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia,especially hypertriglyceridemia; these required pharmacologic management in some patients. In the D:A:Dand French observational cohorts, cumulative use of LPV/r was associated with a slightly increased risk ofMI. 43, 44Once-daily LPV/r should not be used in patients who have HIV mutations associated with PI resistance, because higher LPV trough levels may be required to suppress resistant virus. Once-daily dosingshould not be used in pregnant women, especially during the third trimester, when LPV levels are expectedto decline. For more detailed information regarding ART drug choices and related issues in pregnancy, see the Perinatal Guidelines .34 Other Protease Inhibitor-Based Regimens Atazanavir (ATV). In a clinical trial, ATV concentrations were enhanced with the addition of RTV 100 mg when compared to once-daily unboosted ATV , as a result, better virologic activity was seen with ATV/r.47 Nevertheless, unboosted ATV may be selected for some patients because it has fewer GI adverse effects including less hyperbilirubinemia and less impact on lipid profiles than ATV/r. Three studies compared unboosted ATV-based combination regimens with either NFV- or EFV-based regimens. These studies established that ATV 400 mg once daily and both comparator treatments had similar virologic efficacy in ARV-naive patients after 48 weeks of therapy.5, 47, 61, 62In a multinational randomized trial comparing three initial treatment strategies, unboosted ATV + ddI + FTC was inferior to both EFV + TDF/FTC and EFV + ZDV/3TC.63Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-11Unboosted ATV may be used as initial therapy when a once-daily regimen without RTV is desired and in patients with underlying risk factors that indicate that hyperlipidemia may be particularly undesirable (C).However, in these situations, other NNRTI- and INSTI-based regimens should generally be used instead ofunboosted ATV . When ATV is co-administered with TDF or EFV , it should be boosted with RTV because ATVconcentrations are reduced in the presence of these drugs. ATV requires acidic gastric pH for dissolution. Thus,concomitant use of drugs that raise gastric pH (such as antacids, H2 antagonists, and PPIs) may significantlyimpair ATV absorption. PPIs should not be used in patients who are taking unboosted ATV . H2 antagonists andantacids should be used with caution and with careful dose separation (see Tables 14 and 15a ). Ritonavir-Boosted Saquinavir (SQV/r). The mg twice daily) and LPV/r, both given twice daily, in combination with TDF/FTC given once daily, in 337 ART-naiveparticipants who were monitored over 48 weeks. Levels of viral suppression and increases in CD4 countswere similar in both arms of the study. 64Triglyceride (TG) levels were higher in the LPV/r arm than in the SQV/r arm. The SQV/r regimen has a higher pill burden and requires twice-daily dosing and 200 mg of RTV .In a healthy volunteer study, SQV/r use at the recommended dose was associated with increases in both QTand PR intervals. The degree of QT prolongation with SQV/r was greater than that seen with some otherboosted PIs used at their recommended doses. Rare cases of torsades de pointes and complete heart blockhave been reported in post-marketing surveillance. Based on these findings, an ECG before initiation ofSQV/r is recommended. SQV/r is not recommended for patients with any of the following conditions:documented congenital or acquired atrioventricular (A V) block without implantedpacemakers, at risk of complete A V block, or receiving other drugs that prolong QT interval. 46On the basis of these restrictions, and because several other preferred or alternative PI options are available, the Panelrecommends that, although SQV/r may be acceptable, it should be used with caution in select ARV-naivepatients (C). Integrase Raltegravir (RAL). RAL is an INSTI that is approved for use in ART-naive patients on the basis of results of STARTMRK, a Phase III study that compared RAL (400 mg twice daily) and EFV (600 mg once daily), each in combination with TDF/FTC, in ART-naive subjects. This multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 563 subjects with plasma viral loads >5,000 copies/mL. At Week 48, similarpercentages of subjects in both groups achieved viral loads <50 copies/mL (86.1% and 81.9% non-inferiority). CD4 counts rose by 189 cells/mm 3in the RAL group and 163 cells/mm3in the EFV group. The frequency of serious adverse events was similar in both groups.6At 156 weeks, virologic and immunologic responses remained similar in both groups with no new safety concerns identified.65On the basis of these data, the Panel recommends RAL + TDF/FTC as a preferred regimen in ART-naive patients (AI). In a small single-arm pilot study of 35 subjects who received a regimen of RAL + ABC/3TC, 91% of subjects had viral loads <50 copies/mL at Week 48.66On the basis of these preliminary data, RAL + ABC/3TC may be used as an alternative INSTI-based regimen (BIII). RAL use has been associated with creatine kinase elevations. Myositis and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Rare cases of severe skin reactions and systemic hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) in patients who received RAL have been reported during post-marketing surveillance.67 Comparisons of RAL-based regimens and boosted PI-based regimens in ART-naive subjects have not been reported. RAL must be administered twice daily\u2014a potential disadvantage when comparing RAL-based treatment with some other regimens. RAL, like EFV , has a lower genetic barrier to resistance than RTV- boosted PIs. In the STARTMRK comparative trial, resistance mutations were observed with approximately the same frequency in RAL- and EFV-treated participants.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-12Alternative Integrase product with cobicistat (COBI), TDF, and FTC (EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC), and is approved as a single-tablet, once-daily regimen for ART-naive patients. EVG is metabolized CYP3A enzymes; as result, CYP3A inducers orinhibitors may concentrations. COBI is potent CYP3A inhibitor with no activity againstHIV . It acts as a PK enhancer of EVG, which allows for once daily dosing of the combination product. 68 EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC is not recommended for patients with pre-treatment estimated creatinine clearanceless than 70 mL/min. 69For more RTV or COBI, see Drug-Drug Interactions\u2014Pharmacokinetic Enhancing . In two Phase 3 randomized clinical studies, the safety and efficacy of this combination regimen in ART-naiveHIV-infected subjects was compared to that of two currently recommended regimens. suppression copies/mL 3%, 95% CI -1.9, 7.8). 70Rates of virologic failure were low and comparable across study arms, with non-inferior results for treatment arms maintained at 96 weeks.71, 72At virologic failure, INSTI-associated mutations were detected in some EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC-treated patients who failed therapy.15, 70These mutations conferred varying degrees of cross-resistance to RAL. The most common adverse events reported withEVG/COBI/TDF/FTC were diarrhea, nausea, and headache. COBI inhibits active tubular secretion of creatinine, resulting in increases in serum creatinine and a reduction in estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) without reducing glomerular function. 73Although the overall incidence of study drug discontinuation due to adverse events was lower in the EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC arms(3.7%) than in either comparator arm (5.1% each), more subjects in the EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC arms (8subjects) discontinued study drugs because of renal adverse events than in the comparator arms (one in theATV/r + TDF/FTC arm). Four of the eight subjects in the EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC arms who discontinuedstudy drug had evidence of proximal tubular dysfunction; after drug discontinuation, abnormal lab values inthese four patients improved but did not completely resolve. CrCl, urine glucose and urine protein should beassessed before starting therapy and monitored during therapy. Consideration should be given to periodicmonitoring of serum phosphorus in patients at risk for renal impairment. Although COBI may cause modestincreases in serum creatinine and modest declines in CrCl, patients who experience a confirmed increase inserum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg/dL from baseline should be closely monitored and evaluated forevidence of tubulopathy. Proteinuria, normoglycemic glycosuria, and increased fractional excretion ofphosphorous may represent the first signs of tubulopathy and precede any decline in renal function. Patients on EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC should be switched to an alternative ARV regimen if estimated CrCl decreases to less than 50 mL/min. Concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided. In summary, EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF has rates of virologic suppression comparable to two currently preferred regimens. As a co-formulated tablet, it can be given as one tablet, once daily. Limitations of this combination include a possible increased risk of proximal renal tubulopathy in addition to inhibition of active tubular secretion of creatinine, significant drug-drug interactions, limited data in patients with advanced HIV disease and in women, and food requirement. On the basis of these factors, the Panel recommends EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF as an alternative regimen in ART-naive patients (BI). CCR5 Antagonist-Based Regimens with EFV , both in randomized, double-blind trial in ART-naive participants.7Only participants who hadGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-13CCR5-tropic virus and no evidence of resistance to any drugs used in the study were enrolled (n = 721). At 48 weeks, HIV RNA level <50 copies/mL was observed in 65.3% of MVC recipients and 69.3% of EFVrecipients. The HIV RNA <50 copies/mL results did not meet the criteria set by the investigators todemonstrate noninferiority for MVC in this study. CD4 count increased by an average of 170 cells/mm 3in the MVC arm and by 144 cells/mm3in the EFV arm. Through 48 weeks, compared with participants receiving EFV , more participants discontinued MVC because of lack of efficacy (11.9% vs. 4.2%), whereasfewer participants discontinued MVC because of toxicity (4.2% vs. 13.6%). Follow-up results at 96 weeksdemonstrated durable responses for both ARVs. 74In a post-hoc reanalysis using a more assay, 15% of patients with dual/mixed tropic virus at screening virus were excluded from analysis.Their retrospective exclusion resulted in similar virologic suppression in both arms. Because MVC requirestwice-daily dosing and requires a tropism assay before use, and experience with regimens other thanZDV/3TC is limited, the Panel recommends MVC + ZDV/3TC as another option for use in ART-naivepatients (CI). Although ZDV/3TC was used as the NRTI backbone in the MERIT trial, pending further data,many clinicians favor the combination of MVC with TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC (CIII). Dual-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Therapy Summary: Dual-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor Components Dual NRTIs are commonly used in combination with an NNRTI, a PI (usually boosted with RTV), an INSTI, or a CCR5 antagonist. Most dual-NRTI combinations used in clinical practice consist of a primary NRTI plus3TC or FTC. Both 3TC and FTC have few adverse effects but may select for the M184V resistance mutation,which confers high-level resistance to both drugs; a modest decrease in susceptibility to ddI and ABC; andimproved susceptibility to ZDV , d4T, and TDF. 75 All NRTIs except ddI can be taken with or without food. Adherence may be additionally improved withonce-daily dosing (available for all NRTIs except ZDV/3TC. The Panel's recommendations on specific dual-NRTI options are made on the basis of virologic potency and durability, short- and long-term toxicities, the propensity to select for resistance mutations, and dosingconvenience. Preferred Dual-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Tenofovir/Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC, co-formulated). TDF is a nucleotide analog with potent activity against both HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) and a long intracellular half-life that allows for fixed-dose combinations of TDF/FTC, EFV/TDF/FTC, RPV/TDF/FTC, and EVG/COBI/TDF/ FTC are administered as one tablet, once daily and are designed to improve adherence. TDF, when used with either 3TC or FTC as part of an EFV-based regimen in ART-naive patients, demonstrated potent virologic suppression 26and was superior to ZDV/3TC in virologic efficacy up to 144 weeks.76In the 934 study, more participants in the ZDV/3TC arm than in the TDF/FTC arm developed loss of limb fat (as assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) and anemia at 96 and 144 weeks.76 Emergence of the M184V mutation was less frequent with TDF/FTC than with ZDV/3TC, and by 144 weeks of therapy no participant had developed the K65R mutation. TDF + FTC or 3TC has also been studied in combination with RPV , several boosted PIs, EVG/COBI, and RAL in randomized clinical trials; all trials demonstrate good virologic benefit.6, 15, 48, 54, 59, 70, 77 TDF/FTC was compared with ABC/3TC in the ACTG 5202 HEAT trial.10In the ACTG 5202 trial, virologic responses were observed in participants randomized to ABC/3TC who had a pre-Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-14treatment HIV RNA >100,000 copies/mL. This was not observed in the HEAT trial or in other trials (see the ABC/3TC section below for more detailed discussion). Renal impairment, manifested by increases in serum creatinine, proteinuria, glycosuria, hypophosphatemia, proximal renal tubulopathy, has been associated with TDF use.78, 79Risk factors may include advanced HIV disease, longer treatment history, and pre-existing renal impairment.80In the HEAT trial, 15% of subjects receiving TDF/FTC versus 10% of those receiving ABC/3TC progressed to amore advanced stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on treatment. 10Renal function, urinalysis, and electrolytes should be monitored in patients who are on TDF. In patients who have some degree of pre-existing renal insufficiency (CrCl <50 mL/min), TDF dosage adjustment is required (see Appendix B, Table 7for dosage recommendations). However, in this setting, the use of alternative NRTIs (for example, ABC) may be preferred over dose-adjusted TDF because available dosage adjustment guidelines for renaldysfunction are based on PK studies only and not on safety and efficacy data. Concomitant use of boosted PIs and COBI can increase TDF concentrations, and studies have suggested a greater risk of renal dysfunction when TDF is used in PI- and COBI-based regimens. 69, 78, 81-84TDF has been used in combination with PIs without significant renal toxicity in several clinical trials that involved patientswho had CrCl >50 mL/min to 60 mL/min. studies comparing TDF/FTC with ABC/3TC, participants receiving TDF/FTC experienced a significantly greater decline in bone mineraldensity than ABC/3TC-treated participants. 11, 86 TDF plus FTC is the preferred NRTI combination, especially in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients because thesedrugs have activity against both viruses. The use of a single HBV-active NRTI (e.g., 3TC or FTC) can lead toHBV resistance and is not recommended (see HIV/Hepatitis B Co-infection Alternative Dual Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (ABC/3TC, co-formulated) for patients who test negative for HLA-B*5701. In a comparative trial of ABC/3TC and ZDV/3TC (both given twice daily and combined with EFV), participantsin both arms achieved similar virologic responses. CD4 T-cell increase at 48 weeks was greater in the ABC-treated participants than in the ZDV-treated participants. 87The ACTG 5202 study, a randomized controlled trial in more than 1,800 participants, evaluated the efficacy and safety of ABC/3TC and TDF/FTC when usedin combination with either EFV or RTV-boosted ATV . Treatment randomization was stratified on the basis ofa screening HIV RNA of <100,000 copies/mL or 100,000 copies/mL. HLA-B*5701 testing was notrequired before study entry, which may have influenced the results of the trial with respect to some of thesafety and tolerability endpoints. A Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended early termination of the100,000 copies/mL stratification group because of a significantly shorter time to study-defined virologicfailure in the ABC/3TC arm than in the TDF/FTC arm. 8This difference in time to virologic failure between arms was observed regardless of whether the third active drug was EFV or ATV/r. There was no difference between ABC/3TC and TDF/FTC in time to virologic failure for participants who had plasma HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL at screening.88 In the HEAT study, 688 participants received ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC in combination with once-daily LPV/r. A subgroup analysis according to baseline HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL or 100,000 copies/mL yielded similar percentages of participants with HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at 96 weeks in the two regimens (63% vs. 58% in those with HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL and 56% vs. 58% in those with 100,000 copies/mL).10 The ASSERT study compared open label ABC/3TC with TDF/FTC in 385 HLA-B*5701-negative, ART- naive patients; all study subjects also received EFV . At 48 weeks, the proportion of participants with HIV RNA <50 copies/mL was lower among ABC/3TC-treated subjects (59%) than (71%) confidence interval [CI], 2.2-21.1).9 suspected HSRs have been observed in 5% to 8% of patients who start ABC. The risk of thisGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-15reaction is highly associated with the presence of the HLA-B*5701 allele (see HLA-B*5701 Screening ).89, 90 HLA-B*5701 testing should precede use of ABC. ABC should not be given to patients who test positive for HLA-B*5701 and, on the basis of test results, ABC hypersensitivity should be noted on the patient's allergylist. Patients who test HLA-B*5701 negative are less likely to experience an HSR, but they should becounseled about the symptoms of the reaction. Patients who discontinue ABC for suspected HSR shouldnever be rechallenged, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status. An association between ABC use and MI was first reported in the D:A:D study. This large, multinational observational study group found that recent (within 6 months) or current use of ABC, but not TDF, wasassociated with an increased risk of MI, particularly in participants with pre-existing cardiac risk factors. 43, 91 Since the report of this study, multiple studies have explored this association. Some studies have found anassociation; 92-95others have found a weak association or no association.44, 96-99Several studies have also been conducted to evaluate potential mechanistic pathways that may underlie the association between ABC useand an increased risk of MI, including endothelial dysfunction, increased platelet reactivity, leukocyteadhesion, inflammation, and hypercoagulability. 100-107However, to date, no consensus on the association between ABC use and MI risk or the mechanism for such an association has been reached. The fixed-dose combination of ABC/3TC allows for once-daily dosing. Pending additional data, ABC/3TC should be used with caution in individuals who have plasma HIV RNA levels 100,000 copies/mL and inpersons at high risk of CVD. However, the combination of ABC/3TC remains an alternative dual-NRTIoption for some ART-naive patients (BI). Other Dual Nucleoside Reverse coformulated). durability, and tolerability experience. 3, 5, 108-112In a multinational, randomized trial comparing three initial treatment strategies, EFV/ZDV/3TC and EFV/TDF/FTC showed similar virologicefficacy; both regimens were superior to ATV/ddI/FTC. 63 A fixed-dose combination of ZDV/3TC is available for one-tablet, twice-daily dosing. Selection of the 3TC-associated M184V mutation has been associated with increased susceptibility to ZDV . In a comparative trialof ABC/3TC and ZDV/3TC (both given twice daily and combined with EFV), the CD4 count increase wasgreater in the ABC/3TC-treated patients than in the ZDV/3TC-treated patients, 87even though virologic responses were similar in both arms. Bone marrow suppression, manifested by macrocytic anemia and/or neutropenia, is seen in some patients. ZDV also is associated with GI toxicity, fatigue, and possibly mitochondrial toxicity, including lacticacidosis/hepatic steatosis and lipoatrophy. Because ZDV/3TC toxicity and requires twice-daily dosing, the Panel classifies ZDV/3TC in the Other Dual-NRTI category, rather than as a preferred or alternative, dual-NRTI option (CI). ZDV/3TC remains as a preferred NRTI option in pregnant women because the two drugs have the most PK, safety, and efficacy data for both mother and newborn of any other ARVs. For more detailed information regarding ARV drug choices and related issues in pregnancy, see the Perinatal Guidelines .34 Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). Three of the currently approved NRTIs\u2014FTC, 3TC, and TDF\u2014have activity against HBV TDF/FTC (or TDF + 3TC) as their NRTI backbone to provide additional activity against HBV and to avoid selection of HBV mutation that confers resistance to 3TC and FTC. Importantly, patients who have HIV/HBV coinfection may be at risk of acute exacerbation of hepatitis after initiation or discontinuation of TDF, 3TC, or FTC.113-115Thus, these patients should be monitored closely for clinical or chemical hepatitis if these drugs are initiated or discontinued (see HIV/Hepatitis B Coinfection and Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy ).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents F-16Table 6.

These are summarized below. Antiretroviral Regimens Recommended Monotherapy with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Single-NRTI therapy does not demonstrate potent and sustained antiviral activity and should not be used (AII). For prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), zidovudine (ZDV) monotherapy is not recommended but might beconsidered in certain unusual circumstances in women with HIV RNA <1,000 copies/mL, although the useof a potent combination regimen is preferred. (See Perinatal Guidelines ,1available at under investigation with mixed results, and cannot be recommended outside of a clinical trial at this time. Dual-NRTI regimens. These regimens are not recommended because they have not demonstrated potent and sustained antiviral activity compared with triple-drug combination regimens (AI).6 possibly lamivudine/zidovudine + tenofovir (3TC/ZDV + TDF) (BII) should not be used because of suboptimal virologic activity7-9or lack of data (AI). Antiretroviral Components Not Recommended Atazanavir (ATV) + indinavir (IDV). Both of these PIs can cause Grade 3 to 4 hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice. Additive adverse effects may be possible when these agents are used concomitantly. Therefore,these two PIs are not recommended for combined use (AIII). Didanosine (ddI) + stavudine (d4T). The combined use of ddI and d4T as a dual-NRTI backbone can result in a high incidence of toxicities, particularly peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and lactic acidosis. 10-13This combination has been implicated in the deaths of several HIV-infected pregnant women secondary to severelactic acidosis with or without hepatic steatosis and pancreatitis. 14Therefore, the combined use of ddI and d4T is not recommended (AII). Didanosine (ddI) + tenofovir (TDF). Use of ddI + TDF may increase ddI ddI- associated toxicities including pancreatitis and lactic acidosis.16-17These toxicities may be lessened by ddI dose reduction. The use of this combination has also been associated with immunologic nonresponse or CD4 cell decline despite viral suppression,18-19high rates of early virologic failure,20-21and rapid selection of resistance mutations.20-22Because of these adverse outcomes, this dual-NRTI combination is not generally recommended (AII). Clinicians caring for patients who are clinically stable on regimens containing ddI + TDF should consider altering the NRTIs to avoid this combination. Two-non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (2-NNRTI) combinations. In the 2NN trial, combined with d4T and 3TC.23A higher frequency of clinical adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation was reported in participants randomized to the two-NNRTI arm. Both EFV and NVP may induce metabolism of etravirine (ETR), which leads to reduction in ETR drug exposure.24 Based on these findings, the Panel does not recommend using two NNRTIs in combination in any regimen (AI).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents G-2Efavirenz (EFV) in first trimester of pregnancy and in women with significant childbearing potential. EFV use was associated with significant teratogenic effects in nonhuman primates at drug exposures similarto those representing human exposure. Several cases of congenital anomalies have been reported after earlyhuman gestational exposure to EFV . 25-26EFV should be avoided in pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, and in women of childbearing potential who are trying to conceive or who are not using effectiveand consistent contraception (AIII). If no other ARV options are available for the woman who is pregnant orat risk of becoming pregnant, the provider should consult with a clinician who has expertise in both HIVinfection and pregnancy. (See Perinatal Guidelines ,1available at http://aidsinfo.nih.gov .) Emtricitabine (FTC) + lamivudine (3TC). Both of these drugs have similar resistance profiles and have minimal additive antiviral activity. Inhibition of intracellular phosphorylation may occur in vivo, as seen withother dual-cytidine analog combinations. 27These two agents should not be used as a dual-NRTI combination (AIII). Etravirine (ETR) + unboosted PI. ETR may induce the metabolism and significantly reduce the drug exposure of unboosted PIs. Appropriate doses of the PIs have not been established24(AII). Etravirine ETR may alter the concentrations of these PIs. Appropriate doses of the PIs have not been not be co-administered24(AII). Nevirapine (NVP) initiated in ARV-naive women ARV-naive CD4 counts >400 cells/mm3.Greater risk of symptomatic hepatic events, including serious and life-threatening events, has been observed in these patient groups. NVP should not be initiated in these patients (BI) unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.28-30Patients who experience CD4 count increases to levels above these thresholds as a result of antiretroviral therapy (ART) can be safely switched to NVP.31 benefit of these PIs has been demonstrated only when they were used with concomitant RTV . Therefore, use of these agents as part of a combination regimen without RTV is not recommended (AII). Stavudine (d4T) + zidovudine (ZDV). These two NRTIs should not be used in combination because of antagonism demonstrated in vitro32and in vivo33(AII).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents G-3Table 8.

Virologic failure: The inability to achieve or maintain suppression of viral replication (to an HIV RNA level <200 copies/mL). Incomplete virologic response: Two consecutive plasma HIV RNA levels >200 copies/mL after 24 weeks on an ARV regimen. Baseline HIV RNA may affect the time course of response, and some regimens will take longer than others to suppress HIV RNA levels.Panel's Recommendations Assessing and managing an antiretroviral (ARV)-experienced patient experiencing failure of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is complex. Expert advice is critical and should be sought. Evaluation of virologic failure should include an assessment of the severity of the patient's HIV disease, ART history, use of concomitant medications with consideration of adverse drug interactions with ARV agents, HIV RNA and CD4 T-cell count trends over time, and prior drug-resistance testing results. Drug-resistance testing should be obtained while the patient is taking the failing ARV regimen or within 4 weeks of treatment discontinuation (AII) . The goal of treatment for ARV-experienced patients with drug resistance who are experiencing virologic failure is to re- establish virologic suppression (e.g., HIV RNA <48 copies/mL) (AI) . To design a new regimen, the patient's treatment history and past and current resistance test results should be used to identify at least two (preferably three) fully active agents to combine with an optimized background ARV regimen (AI) . A fully active agent is one that is likely to have ARV activity on the basis of the patient's treatment history, drug-resistancetesting, and/or a novel mechanism of action. In general, adding a single, fully active ARV in a new regimen is not recommended because of the risk of rapid development of resistance (BII) . In patients with a high likelihood of clinical progression (e.g., CD4 count <100 cells/mm 3) and limited drug options, adding a single drug may reduce the risk of immediate clinical progression, because even transient decreases in HIV RNA and/ortransient increases in CD4 cell counts have been associated with clinical benefits (CI) . For some highly ART-experienced patients, maximal virologic suppression is not possible. In this case, ART should be continued (AI) with regimens designed to minimize toxicity, preserve CD4 cell counts, and avoid clinical progression. Discontinuing or briefly interrupting therapy in a patient with viremia may lead to a rapid increase in HIV RNA and a decrease in CD4 cell count and increases the risk of clinical progression. Therefore, this strategy is not recommended (AI). In the setting of virologic suppression, there is no consensus on how to define or treat immunologic failure.

Persistent low-level viremia: Confirmed levels that are <1,000 copies/mL. Virologic blip: After virologic suppression, an isolated detectable HIV RNA level that is followed by a return to virologic suppression. Causes of Virologic Failure Virologic failure in a patient can occur for multiple reasons. Data from older patient cohorts suggested that suboptimal adherence and drug intolerance/toxicity accounted for 28%-40% of virologic failure and regimendiscontinuations. 1-2More recent data suggest that most virologic failure on first-line regimens occurred due to either pre-existing (transmitted) drug resistance or suboptimal adherence.3Factors associated with virologic failure include: Patient characteristics higher pretreatment or baseline HIV RNA level (depending on the specific regimen used) lower pretreatment or nadir CD4 T-cell count prior AIDS diagnosis comorbidities (e.g., active substance abuse, depression) presence of drug-resistant virus, either transmitted or acquired prior treatment failure incomplete medication adherence and missed clinic appointments ARV regimen characteristics drug side effects and toxicities suboptimal pharmacokinetics (variable absorption, metabolism, or, theoretically, penetration into reservoirs) food/fasting requirements adverse drug-drug interactions with concomitant medications suboptimal virologic potency prescription errors Provider characteristics, such as experience in treating HIV disease Other or unknown reasons Management of Patients with Virologic Failure Assessment of Virologic Failure If virologic failure is suspected or confirmed, a thorough work-up is indicated, addressing the following factors: change in HIV RNA and CD4 T-cell counts over time occurrence of HIV-related clinical events ARV treatment history results of prior resistance testing (if any) medication-taking behavior (including adherence to recommended drug doses, dosing frequency, and food/fasting requirements)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents H-3 tolerability of medications concomitant medications and supplements (with consideration for adverse drug-drug interactions) comorbidities (including substance abuse) In many cases, the cause(s) of virologic failure will be identified. In some cases, no obvious cause(s) may be identified. It is important to distinguish among the reasons for virologic failure because the approaches tosubsequent therapy differ. The following potential causes of virologic failure should be explored in depth. Adherence. Assess the patient's adherence to the regimen. For incomplete adherence, identify and address the underlying cause(s) (e.g., difficulties accessing or tolerating medications, depression, active substance abuse) and simplify the regimen if possible (e.g., decrease pill count or dosing frequency).(See Adherence .) Medication Intolerance. Assess the patient's tolerance of the current regimen and the severity and duration of side effects, keeping in mind that even minor side effects can impact adherence. Managementstrategies for intolerance in the absence of drug resistance may include: using symptomatic treatment (e.g., antiemetics, antidiarrheals) changing one ARV to another within the same drug class, if needed (e.g., change to tenofovir [TDF] or [EFV]-related toxicities) 4-5 changing from one drug class to another (e.g., from a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase prior drug resistance is suspected Pharmacokinetic Issues. Review food/fasting requirements for each medication. Review recent history of gastrointestinal symptoms (such as vomiting or diarrhea) to assess the likelihood of short-termmalabsorption. Review concomitant medications and dietary supplements for possible adverse drug-druginteractions (consult Drug Interactions section and tables for common interactions) and make appropriate substitutions for ARV agents and/or concomitant medications, if possible. Therapeutic drug monitoring(TDM) may be helpful if pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions or impaired drug absorption leading todecreased ARV exposure is suspected. (See also Exposure-Response Relationship and Therapeutic Drug Monitoring .) Suspected Drug Resistance. Obtain resistance testing while the patient is taking the failing regimen or within 4 weeks after regimen discontinuation if the plasma HIV RNA level is >500 copies/mL (AII).(See Drug-Resistance Testing .) Evaluate the degree of drug resistance and consider the patient's prior treatment history and prior resistance test results. Drug resistance tends to be cumulative for a givenindividual; thus, all prior treatment history and resistance test results should be taken into account. Routine genotypic or phenotypic testing gives information relevant for selecting nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), NNRTIs, and PIs. Additional drug-resistance tests for patients experiencing failure on fusion inhibitors and/or integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) and viral tropism tests for patients experiencing failure on a CCR5 antagonist also are available. (See Drug- Resistance Testing .) Changing ART There is no consensus on the optimal time to change therapy for virologic failure. The goal of ART is to suppress HIV replication to a level where drug-resistance mutations do not emerge. However, the specific level of viral suppression needed to achieve durable virologic suppression remains unknown. Selection of drug resistance does not appear to occur in patients with persistent HIV RNA levels suppressed to <48 copies/mL,6although this remains controversial.7Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents H-4The clinical implications of HIV RNA in the range of >48 to <200 copies/mL in a patient on ART are controversial. Unlike the case with higher levels of HIV RNA, most, if not all, circulating virus fromindividuals with this level of HIV RNA results from the release of HIV from long-lived latently infected cellsand does not signify ongoing viral replication with the emergence of drug-resistant virus. 8Although some studies have suggested that viremia at this low level predicts subsequent failure9and can be associated with the evolution of drug resistance,10a large retrospective analysis showed that using an HIV RNA threshold for virologic failure of <200 copies/mL had the same predictive value as using a threshold of <50 copies/mL.11 Newer technologies (e.g., Taqman assay) have made it possible to detect HIV RNA in more patients with lowlevel viremia (<200 copies/mL) than was possible with previous assays. Use of these newer assays hasresulted in more confirmatory viral load testing than may be necessary. 12-14 Persistent HIV RNA levels >200 copies/mL often are associated with evidence of viral evolution and drug-resistance mutation accumulation; 15this is particularly common when HIV RNA levels are >500 copies/mL.16Persistent plasma HIV RNA levels in the 200 to 1,000 copies/mL range should therefore be considered as virologic failure. Viremia \"blips\" (e.g., viral suppression followed by a detectable HIV RNA level and then subsequent return to undetectable levels) usually are not associated with subsequent virologic failure.17 Management of Virologic Failure Once virologic failure is confirmed, generally the regimen should be changed as soon as possible to avoid progressive accumulation of resistance mutations.18 Ideally, a new ARV regimen should contain at least two, and preferably three, fully active drugs on the basisof drug treatment history, resistance testing, or new mechanistic class (AI). 19-27Some ARV drugs (e.g., NRTIs) may contribute partial ARV activity to a regimen, despite drug resistance,28while others (e.g., T-20, NNRTIs, RAL) likely do not provide partial activity.28-30Because of the potential for drug-class cross resistance that reduces drug activity, using a \"new\" drug that a patient has not yet taken may not mean thatthe drug is fully active. In addition, archived drug-resistance mutations may not be detected by standarddrug-resistance tests, emphasizing the importance of considering treatment history and prior drug-resistancetests. Drug potency and viral susceptibility are more important than the number of drugs prescribed. Early studies of ART-experienced patients identified factors associated with better virologic responses to subsequent regimens. 31-32These factors included lower HIV RNA level and/or higher CD4 cell count at the time of therapy change, using a new (i.e., not yet taken) class of ARV drugs, and using ritonavir (RTV)-boosted PIs in PI-experienced patients. More recent clinical trials support the strategy of conducting reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PT) resistance testing (both genotype and phenotype) while an ART-experienced patient is taking a failing ARV regimen, designing a new regimen based on the treatment history and resistance testing results, and selecting at least two and preferably three active drugs for the new treatment regimen. 20-21, 23-24, 33Higher genotypic and/or phenotypic susceptibility scores (quantitative measures of drug activity) are associated with better virologic responses.23-24Patients who receive more active drugs have a better and more prolonged virologic response than those with fewer active drugs in the regimen. Active ARV drugs include those with activity against drug-resistant viral strains, including newer members of existing classes (the NNRTI\u2014ETR, the PIs\u2014darunavir [DRV] and tipranavir [TPV]) and drugs with new mechanisms of action (the fusion inhibitor\u2014T-20, the CCR5 antagonist\u2014maraviroc [MVC] in patients with R5 but not X4 virus, and the INSTI\u2014RAL). Drug-resistance tests for patients experiencing failure on fusion inhibitors (FIs) and/or INSTIs and viral tropism tests for patients experiencing failure on a CCR5 antagonist also are available. (See Drug-Resistance Testing .)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents H-5Clinical Scenarios of Virologic Failure Low-level viremia (HIV RNA <1,000 copies/mL). Assess adherence. Consider variability in HIV RNA assays. Patients with HIV RNA <48 copies/mL or isolated increases in HIV RNA (\"blips\") do not require a change in treatment13(AII). There is no consensus regarding how to manage patients with HIV RNA levels >48 copies/mL and <200 copies/mL; HIV RNA levels should be followed over time to assess theneed for changes (AIII). Patients with persistent HIV RNA levels >200 copies/mL often select out drug-resistant viral variants, particularly when HIV RNA levels are >500 copies/mL. Persistent plasma HIVRNA levels in the 200 to 1,000 copies/mL range should be considered as possible virologic failure;resistance testing should be attempted if the HIV RNA level is >500 copies/mL. For individuals withsufficient therapeutic options, consider treatment change (BIII). Repeated detectable viremia (HIV RNA >1,000 copies/mL) and NO drug resistance identified.Consider the timing of the drug-resistance test (e.g., was the patient off ARV for >4 weeks and/ornonadherent?). Consider resuming the same regimen or starting a new regimen and then repeatinggenotypic testing early (e.g., in 2-4 weeks) to determine whether a resistant viral strain emerges (CIII). Repeated detectable viremia (HIV RNA >1,000 copies/mL) and drug resistance identified. The goals in this situation are to resuppress HIV RNA levels maximally (i.e., to <48 copies/mL) and toprevent further selection of resistance mutations. With the availability of multiple new ARVs, includingsome with new mechanisms of action, this goal is now possible in many patients, including those withextensive treatment experience and drug resistance. With virologic failure, consider changing thetreatment regimen sooner, rather than later, to minimize continued selection of resistance mutations. In apatient with ongoing viremia and evidence of resistance, some drugs in a regimen (e.g., NNRTI, T-20,RAL) should be discontinued promptly to decrease the risk of selecting additional drug-resistancemutations in order to preserve the activity of these drug classes in future regimens. A new regimenshould include at least two, and preferably three, fully active agents (AII). Highly drug resistant HIV . There is a subset of patients who have experienced toxicity and/or developed resistance to all or most currently available regimens, and designing a regimen with two orthree fully active drugs is not possible. Many of these patients received suboptimal ARV regimens (i.e.,did not have access to more than one or two of the drugs at the time they became available) or have beenunable to adhere to any regimen. If maximal virologic suppression cannot be achieved, the goals are topreserve immunologic function and to prevent clinical progression (even with ongoing viremia). There isno consensus on how to optimize the management of these patients. It is reasonable to observe a patienton the same regimen, rather than changing the regimen, depending on the stage of HIV disease (BII).Even partial virologic suppression of HIV RNA >0.5 log 10copies/mL from baseline correlates with clinical benefits.34There is evidence from cohort studies that continuing therapy, even in the presence of viremia and the absence of CD4 T-cell count increases, reduces the risk of disease progression.35Other cohort studies suggest continued immunologic and clinical benefits if the HIV RNA level is maintained <10,000-20,000 copies/mL.36-37However, these potential benefits all must be balanced with the ongoing risk of accumulating additional resistance mutations. In general, adding a single, fully active ARV in a new regimen is notrecommended because of the risk of rapid development of resistance (BII). However, in patients with a high likelihood of clinical progression (e.g., CD4 cell count <100 cells/mm3) and limited drug options, adding a single drug may reduce the risk of immediate clinical progression, because even transient decreases in HIV RNA and/or transient increases in CD4 cell counts have been associated with clinical benefits (CI). Weighing the risks (e.g., selection of drug resistance) and benefits (e.g., ARV activity) of using a single active drug in the heavily ART-experienced patient is complicated, and consultation with an expert is advised. Patients with ongoing viremia and with an insufficient number of approved treatment options to construct aGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents H-6fully suppressive regimen may be candidates for research studies or expanded access programs, or single- patient access of investigational new drug(s) (IND), as specified in Food and Drug Administration (FDA)regulations: http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm163982.htm . Discontinuing or briefly interrupting therapy in a patient with viremia may lead to a rapid increase in HIVRNA and a decrease in CD4 T-cell count and increases the risk of clinical progression. 38-39Therefore, this strategy is notrecommended (AI). See Discontinuation or Interruption of Antiretroviral Therapy . Prior treatment and suspected drug resistance, now presenting to care in need of therapy withlimited information (i.e., incomplete or absence of self-reported history, medical records, orprevious resistance data). Every effort should be made to obtain medical records and prior drug- resistance testing results; however, this is not always possible. One strategy is to restart the most recentARV regimen and assess drug resistance in 2-4 weeks to help guide the choice of the next regimen;another strategy is to start two or three drugs known to be active based on treatment history (e.g., MVCwith R5 virus, RAL if no prior INSTI). Immunologic Failure: Definition, Causes, and Management Immunologic failure can be defined as the failure to achieve and maintain an adequate CD4 response despitevirologic suppression. Increases in CD4 counts in ARV-naive patients with initial ARV regimens areapproximately 150 cells/mm 3over the first year.40A CD4 count plateau may occur after 4-6 years of treatment with suppressed viremia.41-45 No accepted specific definition for immunologic failure exists, although some studies have focused on patientswho fail to increase CD4 counts above a specific threshold (e.g., >350 or 500 cells/mm 3) over a specific period of time (e.g., 4-7 years). Others have focused on an inability to increase CD4 counts above pretherapy levelsby a certain threshold (e.g., >50 or 100 cells/mm 3) over a given time period. The former criterion may be preferable because of data linking these thresholds with the risk of non-AIDS clinical events.46 The proportion of patients experiencing immunologic failure depends on how failure is defined, theobservation period, and the CD4 count when treatment was started. In the longest study conducted to date,the percentage of patients with suppressed viremia who reached a CD4 count >500 cells/mm 3through 6 years of treatment was 42% in those starting treatment with a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3, 66% in those starting with a CD4 count 200-350 cells/mm3, and 85% in those starting with a CD4 count >350 cells/mm3.41 A persistently low CD4 count while on suppressive ART is associated with a small, but appreciable, risk ofAIDS- and non-AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. 47-48For example, in the FIRST study,49a low CD4 count on therapy was associated with an increased risk of AIDS-related complications (adjusted hazard ratioof 0.56 per 100 cells/mm 3higher CD4 count). Similarly, a low CD4 count was associated with an increased risk of non-AIDS events, including cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal disease and cancer. Other studies support these associations.50-53 Factors associated with poor CD4 T-cell response: CD4 count <200/mm3when starting ART Older (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV], HIV-2, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 [HTLV-1], both ARVs (e.g., ZDV ,54TDF + didanosine [ddI]55-57) and other medications. Persistent immune activation Loss of regenerative potential of the immune system Other medical conditionsGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents H-7Assessment of Immunologic Failure. CD4 count should be confirmed by repeat testing. Concomitant medications should be reviewed carefully, with a focus on those known to decrease white blood cells or, specifically, CD4 T-cells (e.g., cancer chemotherapy, interferon, prednisone, ZDV; combination of TDF andddI), and consideration should be given to substituting or discontinuing these drugs, if possible. Untreatedcoinfections (e.g., HIV-2, HTLV-1, HTLV-2) and serious medical conditions (e.g., malignancy) also shouldbe considered. In many cases, no obvious cause for immunologic failure can be identified. Management of Immunologic Failure. No consensus exists on when or how to treat immunologic failure. Given the risk of clinical events, it is reasonable to focus on patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm 3 because patients with higher CD4 counts have a lower risk of clinical events. It is not clear that immunologic failure in the setting of virologic suppression should prompt a change in the ARV regimen. Because ongoingimmune activation occurs in some patients with suppressed HIV RNA levels, some have suggested adding adrug to an existing regimen. However, this strategy does not result in clear virologic or immunologicbenefit. 58Others suggest changing the regimen to another regimen (e.g., from NNRTI-based to PI-based, INSTI-based, or CCR5 antagonist-based regimens), but this strategy has not shown clear benefit. An immune-based therapy, interleukin-2, demonstrated CD4 count increases but no clinical benefit in two large randomized studies59and therefore is not recommended (AI). Other immune-based therapies (e.g., gene therapies, growth hormone, cyclosporine, interleukin-7) are under investigation. Currently, immune-basedtherapies should not be used unless in the context of a clinical trial (AIII). References 1. d'Arminio Monforte A, Lepri AC, Rezza G, et al.

This section will review situations in which clinicians might consider simplifying treatment in a patient withvirologic suppression. Importantly, this section will not review consideration of changes in treatment forreducing ongoing adverse effects. Regimens used in simplification strategies generally should be those thathave proven high efficacy in antiretroviral (ARV)-naive patients (see What to Start ) or that would be predicted to be highly active for a given patient based on the individual's past treatment history and resistance profile. Rationale The major rationales behind regimen simplification are to improve the patient's quality of life, maintain long-term adherence, avoid toxicities that may develop with prolonged ARV use, and reduce the risk of virologicfailure. Systematic reviews in the non-HIV literature have shown that adherence is inversely related to thenumber of daily doses. 1Some prospective studies in HIV-infected individuals have shown that those on regimens with reduced dosing frequency have higher levels of adherence.2-3Patient satisfaction with regimens that contain fewer pills and reduced dosing frequency is also higher.4 Candidates for Regimen Simplification Unlike ARV agents developed earlier in the HIV epidemic, many ARV medications approved in recent yearshave sufficiently long half-lives to allow for once-daily dosing, and most also do not have dietaryrestrictions. Patients on regimens initiated earlier in the era of potent combination ART with drugs that pose ahigh pill burden and/or frequent dosing requirements are often good candidates for regimen simplification. Patients without suspected drug-resistant virus. Patients on first (or modified) treatment regimens without a history of treatment failure are ideal candidates for regimen simplification. These patients are less likely to harbor drug-resistant virus, especially if a pretreatment genotype did not detect drug resistance. Prospectiveclinical studies have demonstrated that the likelihood of treatment failure is relatively low in patients aftersimplification and, indeed, may be lower than in patients who do not simplify treatment. 5However, some patients may have unrecognized drug-resistant HIV , either acquired at the time of infection or as aconsequence of prior treatment, such as patients who were treated with presumably nonsuppressive mono- or dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) regimens before the widespread availability of HIV RNA monitoring and resistance testing. Patients with documented or suspected drug resistance. Treatment simplification may also be appropriate for selected individuals who achieve viral suppression after having had documented or suspected drug resistance. Often, these patients are on regimens selected when management of drug resistance, understanding of potentially adverse drug-drug interactions, and understanding of treatment options were relatively limited. Regimen simplification may also be considered for patients on two ritonavir (RTV)- boosted protease inhibitors (PIs). Although successful in suppressing viral replication, this treatment may cause patients to be on regimens that are cumbersome, costly, and associated with potential long-term adverse events. The ability to simplify regimens in this setting often reflects the availability of recently approved agents that have activity against drug-resistant virus and are easier to take without sacrificing ARV activity. Specific situations in which drug simplification could be considered in ART-experienced patientsGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents H-12with viral drug resistance are outlined below. Simplifying regimens in patients who have extensive prior treatment histories is complicated. In such a case, a patient's treatment history, treatment responses andtolerance, and resistance test results should be thoroughly reviewed before designing a new regimen. Expertconsultation should be considered whenever possible. Types of Treatment Simplification Within-Class Simplifications. Within-class substitutions offer the advantage of not exposing patients to still-unused drug classes, which potentially preserves other classes for future regimens. In general, within-class substitutions use a newer agent; coformulated drugs; or a formulation that has a lower pill burden, alower dosing frequency, or would be less likely to cause toxicity. NRTI Substitutions (e.g., changing from [TDF] or abacavir [ABC]): This may be considered for a patient who has no history of viral resistance on an NRTI-containing regimen. Other NRTIs may be substituted to create a regimen with lower dosing frequency (e.g., once daily) that takes advantage of coformulated agents and potentially avoids somelong-term toxicities (e.g., pancreatitis, lipoatrophy). nevirapine [NVP] to efavirenz [EFV]): This may be considered to reduce dosing frequency or to take advantage of coformulated agents. Switching of PIs: This switch can be from one PI to another PI, to the same PI at a lower dosing frequency (such as from twice-daily to once-daily RTV-boosted lopinavir or RTV-boosteddarunavir [DRV/r]) or, the case of atazanavir (ATV), to administration without RTV boosting. 6 (Unboosted ATV is presently not a preferred PI component and not recommended if the patient is takingTDF or if the patient has HIV with reduced susceptibility to ATV .) Such changes can reduce dosingfrequency, pill count, drug-drug or drug-food interactions, or dyslipidemia or can take advantage ofcoformulation. These switches can be done with relative ease in patients without PI-resistant virus.However, these switches are not recommended in patients who have a history of documented orsuspected PI resistance because convincing data in this setting are lacking. Out-of-Class Substitutions. One common out-of-class substitution for regimen simplification involves achange from a PI-based to an NNRTI-based regimen. An important study in this regard was the NEFA trial,which evaluated substitution of a PI-based regimen with NVP, EFV , orABC. 7Although the baseline regimens in the study are no longer in widespread use, the NEFA findings are still relevant and provide information about the risks and benefits of switching treatment in patients withvirologic suppression. In this study, 460 patients on stable, PI-based regimens with virologic suppression(<200 copies/mL for the previous 6 months) were switched to their randomized treatment arms. After 36months of follow-up, virologic failure occurred more frequently in patients switched to ABC than in patients switched to EFV or NVP. The increased risk of treatment failure was particularly high in patients who had previous suboptimal treatment with mono- and dual-NRTI therapy. This emphasizes the need to consider the potential for drug-resistant virus prior to attempting simplification. 8 Newer agents that target different sites in the HIV life cycle, such as the integrase strand transfer offer opportunities for out-of- class substitutions, particularly in patients who have a history of virus resistant to older HIV drugs. Three randomized studies have evaluated replacing a boosted PI with RAL in virologically suppressed patients. In two of these studies,9-10the switch to RAL was associated with an increased risk of virologic failure in patients with documented or suspected pre-existing NRTI resistance; a third study did not find this higher risk, possibly due to a longer period of virologic suppression before the change.11Overall, these results suggest that in ART-experienced patients, RAL should be used with caution as a substitute for a boosted PI.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents H-13This strategy should be avoided in patients with documented NRTI resistance unless there are other fully active drugs in the regimen. Because enfuvirtide (T-20) requires twice-daily injections, causes injection-site reactions, and is more expensive than other available ARV agents, patients who are virologically suppressed on T-20-containingregimens may wish to substitute T-20 with an active oral agent. Because the majority of patients on T-20have highly drug-resistant virus, substitution must be with another fully active agent. Data from onerandomized trial and one observational study suggest that RAL can safely substitute for T-20 in patients notpreviously treated with INSTI. 12-13Although this strategy generally maintains virologic suppression and is well tolerated, clinicians should be aware that any drug substitution may introduce unanticipated adverseeffects or drug-drug interactions. 14 Other newer agents that might be considered as substitutes for T-20 are etravirine (ETR) or MVC. Use ofETR in this setting would optimally be considered only when viral susceptibility to ETR can be assured fromresistance testing performed prior to virologic suppression and after carefully assessing for possibledeleterious drug-drug interactions (e.g., ETR cannot be administered with several PIs [see Table 16b ]). In the ETR early access program, switching from T-20 to ETR showed promise in maintaining viral suppression at24 weeks, but only 37 subjects were included in this report. 15MVC is only active in those with documented R5-only virus, a determination that cannot routinely be made in those with undetectable HIV RNA on astable regimen. Although there is a commercially available proviral DNA assay to assess viral tropism invirologically suppressed patients, there are no clinical data on whether results of this test predict thesuccessful use of MVC as a substitute for another active drug. Reducing the number of active drugs in a regimen. This approach to treatment simplification involves switching a patient from a suppressive regimen to fewer active drugs. In early studies, this approach wasassociated with a higher risk of treatment failure than continuation of standard treatment with two NRTIsplus a PI. 16More recently, studies have evaluated the use of an RTV-boosted PI as monotherapy after virologic suppression with a two-NRTI + boosted-PI regimen.17-18The major motivations for this approach are a reduction in NRTI-related toxicity and lower cost. In a randomized clinical trial,18low-level viremia was more common in those on maintenance LPV/r alone than on a three-drug combination regimen. Viralsuppression was achieved by resuming the NRTIs. Studies of DRV/r monotherapy, both as once- or results. 19-20In aggregate, boosted-PI monotherapy as initial21or as simplification treatment has been somewhat less effective in achieving complete virologic suppression andavoiding resistance. Therefore, this strategy cannot be recommended outside of a clinical trial. Monitoring After Treatment Simplification Patients should be evaluated 2-6 weeks after treatment simplification to assess tolerance and to undergolaboratory monitoring, including HIV RNA, CD4 cell count, and markers of renal and liver function. Assessment of fasting cholesterol subsets and triglycerides should be performed within 3 months after the change in therapy. In the absence of any specific complaints, laboratory abnormalities, or viral rebound at that visit, patients may resume regularly scheduled clinical and laboratory monitoring. References 1.

TDM is a strategy applied to certain antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, antineoplastics, and antibiotics that utilizes measured drug concentrations to design dosing regimens to improve the likelihood of the desiredtherapeutic and safety outcomes. The key characteristic of a drug that is a candidate for TDM is knowledgeof the exposure-response relationship and a therapeutic range of concentrations. The therapeutic range is arange of concentrations established through clinical investigations that are associated with a greaterlikelihood of achieving the desired therapeutic response and/or reducing the frequency of drug-associatedadverse reactions. Several ARV agents meet most of the characteristics of agents that can be considered candidates for a TDM strategy. 1The rationale for TDM in managing antiretroviral therapy (ART) derives from the following: data showing that considerable interpatient variability in drug concentrations exists among patients whotake the same dose; data indicating that relationships exist between the concentration of drug in the body and anti-HIV effectand, in some cases, toxicities; and data from small prospective studies demonstrating that TDM improved virologic response and/ordecreased the incidence of concentration-related drug toxicities. 2-3 TDM for ARV agents, however, is not recommended for routine use in the management of the HIV-infected adult (CIII). Multiple factors limit the routine use of TDM in HIV-infected adults.4-5These factors include: lack of large prospective studies demonstrating that TDM improves clinical and virologic outcomes. (This is the most important limiting factor for the implementation of TDM at present.); lack of established therapeutic range of concentrations for all ARV drugs that is associated with achieving the desired therapeutic response and/or reducing the frequency of drug-associated adverse reactions; intrapatient variability in ARV drug concentrations; lack of widespread availability of clinical laboratories that perform quantitation of ARV concentrations under rigorous quality assurance/quality control standards; and shortage of experts to assist with interpretation of ARV concentration data and application of such data to revise patients' dosing regimens. Panel's Recommendations Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for antiretroviral (ARV) agents is not recommended for routine use in the management of the HIV-infected adult (CIII) . TDM may be considered in selected clinical scenarios, as discussed in the text below. Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = Data from randomized controlled trials; II = Data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinionGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents H-16Exposure-Response Relationships and TDM with Different ARV Classes Protease Inhibitors (PIs), Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs), and Integrase Inhibitors. Relationships between the systemic exposure to PIs and NNRTIs and treatment response have been reviewed in various publications.4-7Although there are limitations and unanswered questions, the consensus among clinical pharmacologists from the United States and Europe is that the data provide aframework for the potential implementation of TDM for PIs and NNRTIs. However, information onrelationships between concentrations and drug-associated toxicities are sparse. Clinicians who use TDM as astrategy to manage either ARV response or toxicities should consult the most current data on the proposedtherapeutic concentration range. Exposure-response data for darunavir (DRV), etravirine (ETR), andraltegravir (RAL) are accumulating but are not sufficient to recommend minimum trough concentrations.The median trough concentrations for these agents in HIV-infected persons receiving the recommended doseare included in Table 9b . CCR5 Antagonists. Trough maraviroc (MVC) concentrations have been shown to be an important predictor of virologic success in studies conducted in ART-experienced persons.8-9Clinical experience in the use of TDM for MVC, however, is very limited. Nonetheless, as with PIs and NNRTIs, the exposure-response dataprovide a framework for TDM, and that information is presented in these guidelines (Table 9b ). Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs). Relationships between of NRTIs and their intracellular pharmacologically active moieties have not yet been established. Therefore,monitoring of plasma or intracellular NRTI concentrations for an individual patient largely remains aresearch tool. Measurement of plasma concentrations, however, is routinely used for studies of drug-druginteractions. Scenarios for Use of TDM. Multiple scenarios exist in which both ARV concentration data and expert opinion may be useful in patient management. Consultation with a clinical pharmacologist or a clinical pharmacist with HIV expertise may be advisable in these cases. These scenarios include the following: Suspect clinically significant drug-drug or drug-food interactions that may result in reduced efficacy or increased dose-related toxicities; Changes in pathophysiologic states that may impair gastrointestinal, hepatic, or renal function, therebypotentially altering drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination; Pregnant women who may be at risk of virologic failure as a result of changes in their pharmacokineticparameters during the later stage of pregnancy, which may result in plasma concentrations lower thanthose achieved in the earlier stages of pregnancy and in the nonpregnant patient; Heavily pretreated patients experiencing virologic failure and who may have viral isolates with reducedsusceptibility to ARVs; Use of alternative dosing regimens and ARV combinations for which safety and efficacy have not been established in clinical trials; Concentration-dependent, drug-associated toxicities; and Lack of expected virologic response in medication-adherent persons. TDM For patients who have drug-susceptible virus. Table 9a includes a synthesis of recommendations2-7for minimum target trough PI and NNRTI concentrations in persons with drug-susceptible virus. For ART-experienced patients with virologic failure (see Table 9b ). Fewer data are available to formulate suggestions for minimum target trough concentrations in ART-experienced patients who have viral isolates with reduced susceptibility to ARV agents. Concentration recommendations for tipranavirGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents H-17(TPV) and MVC were derived only from studies in ART-experienced persons. It is likely that use of PIs and NNRTIs in the setting of reduced viral susceptibility may require higher trough concentrations thanthose needed for wild-type virus. The inhibitory quotient (IQ), which is the ratio of ARV drugconcentration to a measure of susceptibility (genotype or phenotype) of the patient's strain of HIV to thatdrug, may additionally improve prediction of virologic response\u2014as has been shown, for example, withDRV in ART-experienced persons. 10-11Exposure-response data for DRV , ETR, and RAL are accumulating but are not sufficient to recommend minimum trough concentrations. The median trough concentrationsfor these agents in HIV-infected persons receiving the recommended dose are included in Table 9b . Using Drug Concentrations to Guide Therapy. There are several challenges and considerations for implementation of TDM in the clinical setting. Use of TDM to monitor ARV concentrations in a patientrequires multiple steps: quantification of the concentration of the drug, usually in plasma or serum; determination of the patient's pharmacokinetic characteristics; integration of information on patient adherence; interpretation of the concentrations; and adjustment of the drug dose to achieve concentrations within the therapeutic range, if necessary. Guidelines for the collection of blood samples and other practical suggestions can be found in a position paper by the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group Pharmacology Committee. 4 A final caveat to the use of measured drug concentrations in patient management is a general one\u2014drugconcentration information cannot be used alone; it must be integrated with other clinical information. Inaddition, as knowledge of associations between ARV concentrations and virologic response continues toaccumulate, clinicians who employ a TDM strategy for patient management should consult the most currentliterature.

Concentrations of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treatment-Experienced Patients with Virologic Failure Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents H-19Discontinuation or Interruption of Antiretroviral Therapy (Last updated January 10, 2011; last reviewed January 10, 2011) Discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) may result in viral rebound, immune decompensation, and clinical progression. Unplanned interruption of ART may become necessary because of severe drug toxicity,intervening illness, surgery that precludes oral therapy, or unavailability of antiretroviral (ARV) medication.Some investigators have studied planned treatment discontinuation strategies in situations or for reasons thatinclude: in patients who achieve viral suppression and wish to enhance adherence; to reduce inconvenience,long-term toxicities, and costs for patients; or in extensively treated patients who experience treatment failuredue to resistant HIV , to allow reversion to wild-type virus. Potential risks and benefits of interruption varyaccording to a number of factors, including the clinical and immunologic status of the patient, the reason forthe interruption, the type and duration of the interruption, and the presence or absence of resistant HIV at thetime of interruption. Below are brief discussions on what is currently known about the risks and benefits oftreatment interruption in some of these circumstances. Short-Term Therapy Interruptions Reasons for short-term interruption (days to weeks) of ART vary and may include drug toxicity; intercurrentillnesses that preclude oral intake, such as gastroenteritis or pancreatitis; surgical procedures; orunavailability of drugs. Stopping ARV drugs for a short time (i.e., <1 to 2 days) due to medical/surgicalprocedures can usually be done by holding all drugs in the regimen. Recommendations for some otherscenarios are listed below: Unanticipated Need for Short-Term Interruption When a patient experiences a severe or life-threatening toxicity or unexpected inability to take oral medications\u2014all components of the drug regimen should be stopped simultaneously, regardless of drughalf-life. Planned Short Term Interruption (>2-3 days) When all regimen components have similar half-lives and do not require food for proper absorption\u2014all drugs may be given with a sip of water, if allowed; otherwise, all drugs should bestopped simultaneously. All discontinued regimen components should be restarted simultaneously. When all regimen components have similar half-lives and require food for adequate absorption,and the patient cannot take anything by mouth for a sustained period of time\u2014temporarydiscontinuation of all drug components is indicated. The regimen should be restarted as soon as thepatient can resume oral intake. When the ARV regimen contains drugs with differing half-lives\u2014stopping all drugs simultaneously may result in functional monotherapy with the drug with the longest half-life (typically a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]). Options in this circumstance are discussed below. (See Discontinuation of efavirenz, etravirine, or nevirapine .) Interruption of Therapy after Pregnancy ARV drugs for prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV are recommended for all pregnant women, regardless of whether they have indications for ART for their own health. Following delivery, considerations regarding continuation of the ARV regimen for maternal therapeutic indications are the same as for other nonpregnant individuals. The decision of whether to continue therapy after delivery should take into account current recommendations for initiation of ART, current and nadir CD4 T-cell counts and trajectory, HIV RNA levels, adherence issues, and patient preference.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents H-20Planned Long-Term Therapy Interruptions Planned therapy interruptions have been contemplated in various scenarios, listed below. Research is ongoing in several of the scenarios. Therapy interruptions cannot be recommended at this time outside of controlled clinical trials (AI). In patients who initiated therapy during acute HIV infection and achieved virologic suppression\u2014 the optimal duration of treatment and the consequences of treatment interruption are not known at thistime. (See Acute HIV Infection .) In patients who have had exposure to multiple ARV agents, have experienced ARV treatmentfailure, and have few treatment options available because of extensive resistance mutations\u2014interruption is not recommended unless done in a clinical trial setting (AI). Several clinical trials, largely yielding negative results, but some with conflicting results, have been conducted to betterunderstand the role of treatment interruption in these patients. 1-4The largest of these studies showed negative clinical impact of treatment interruption in these patients.1The Panel notes that partial virologic suppression from combination therapy has been associated with clinical benefit;5therefore, interruption of therapy is not recommended. In patients on ART who have maintained a CD4 count above the level currently recommended fortreatment initiation and irrespective of whether their baseline CD4 counts were either above orbelow that recommended threshold\u2014interruption is also not recommended unless done in a clinical trial setting (BI). (See discussion below highlighting potential adverse outcomes seen in some treatmentinterruption trials.) Temporary treatment interruption to reduce inconvenience, potential long-term toxicity, and/or overalltreatment cost has been considered as a strategy for patients on ART who have maintained CD4 counts abovethose currently recommended for initiating therapy. Several clinical trials have been designed to determinethe safety of such interruptions, in which reinitiation is triggered by predetermined CD4 count thresholds. Inthese trials, various CD4 count levels have been set to guide both treatment interruption and reinitiation. Inthe SMART study, the largest of such trials with more than 5,000 subjects, interrupting treatment with CD4counts >350 cells/mm 3and reinitiating when <250 cells/mm3was associated with an increased risk of disease progression and all cause mortality compared with the trial arm of continuous ART.6In the TRIV ACAN study, the same CD4 count thresholds were used for stopping and restarting treatment.7This study also showed that interruption was an inferior strategy; the interventions in both trials were stoppedearly because of these findings. Data from the DART trial reported a twofold increase in rates of WorldHealth Organization (WHO) Stage 4 events/deaths in the 12-week ART cycling group among Africanpatients achieving a CD4 count >300/mm 3compared with the continuous ART group.8Observational data from the EuroSIDA cohort noted a twofold increase in risk of death after a treatment interruption of >3 months. Factors linked to increased risk of death or progression included lower CD4 counts, higher viral loads, and a prior history of AIDS.9Other studies have reported no major safety concerns,10-12but these studies had smaller sample sizes. Results have been reported from several small observational studies evaluating treatment interruption in patients doing well with nadir CD4 counts >350/mm3, but further studies are needed to determine the safety of treatment interruption in this population.13-14There is concern that CD4 counts <500 cells/mm3are associated with a range of non-AIDS clinical events (e.g., cancer and heart, liver, and kidney disease).6, 15-16 Planned long-term therapy interruption strategies cannot be recommended at this time outside of controlled clinical trials (BI) based on available data and a range of ongoing concerns. If therapy has to be discontinued, patients should be counseled about the need for close clinical and laboratory monitoring. They should also be aware of the risks of viral rebound, acute retroviral syndrome,Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents H-21increased risk of HIV transmission, decline of CD4 count, HIV disease progression or death, development of minor HIV-associated manifestations such as oral thrush, development of serious non-AIDS complications,development of drug resistance, and the need for chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infectionsdepending on the CD4 count. Treatment interruptions often result in rapid reductions in CD4 counts. Prior to any planned treatment interruption, a number of ARV-specific issues should be taken into consideration. These Discontinuation efavirenz (EFV), etravirine , ETR, or NVP and other ARV drugs is not known. The duration of detectable levels of EFV or NVP after discontinuation ranges from less than 1 week to more than 3 weeks. 17-18 Simultaneously stopping all drugs in a regimen containing these agents may result in functionalmonotherapy with the NNRTIs because NNRTIs have much longer half-lives than other agents. This mayincrease the risk of selection of NNRTI-resistant mutations. It is further complicated by evidence thatcertain host genetic polymorphisms may result in slower rates of clearance. Such polymorphisms may bemore common among specific ethnic groups, such as African Americans and Hispanics. 18-19Some experts recommend stopping the NNRTI but continuing the other ARV drugs for a period of time. The optimaltime sequence for staggered component discontinuation has not been determined. A study in South Africademonstrated that giving 4 or 7 days of zidovudine (ZDV) + lamivudine (3TC) after a single dose ofNVP reduced the risk of postnatal NVP resistance from 10%-12%. 20Use such as tenofovir (TDF) plus emtricitabine (FTC)has also been shown to decrease NVP resistance after single-dose treatment. 21The findings may, however, differ in patients on chronic NVP treatment. An alternative strategy is to substitute a proteaseinhibitor (PI) for the NNRTI and to continue the PI with dual NRTIs for a period of time. In a post-studyanalysis of the patients who interrupted therapy in the SMART trial, patients who were switched from anNNRTI- to a PI-based regimen prior to interruption had a lower rate of NNRTI-resistant mutation afterinterruption and a greater chance of resuppression of HIV RNA after restarting therapy than those whostopped all the drugs simultaneously or stopped the NNRTI before the 2-NRTI. 22The optimal duration needed to continue the PI-based regimen after stopping the NNRTI is not known. Given the potential ofprolonged detectable NNRTI concentrations for more than 3 weeks, some suggest that the PI-basedregimen may need to be continued for up to 4 weeks. Further research to determine the best approach todiscontinuing NNRTIs is needed. Clinical data on ETR and treatment interruption is lacking but its longhalf-life of approximately 40 hours suggests that stopping ETR needs to be done carefully using the samesuggestions for NVP and EFV for the time being. Discontinuation and reintroduction of NVP. Because NVP is an inducer of the drug-metabolizing hepatic enzymes, administration of full therapeutic doses of NVP without a 2-week, low-dose escalation phase willresult in excess plasma drug levels and potentially increase the risk of toxicity. Therefore, in a patient who has interrupted treatment with NVP for more than 2 weeks, NVP should be reintroduced with a dose escalation period of 200 mg once daily for 14 days and then a 200 mg twice-daily regimen (AII). Discontinuation of FTC, 3TC, or TDF in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection. Patients with HBV coinfection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HbsAg] or hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg] positive) and receiving one or a combination of these NRTIs may experience an exacerbation of hepatitis upon drug discontinuation.23-24(See Hepatitis B (HBV)/HIV Coinfection .)

Recent infection generally is considered the phase up to 6 months after infection during which anti-HIV antibodies are detectable. Throughout this section, the term \"early HIV infection\" is used to refer to either acute or recent HIV infection. An estimated 40% to 90% of patients with acute HIV infection will experience symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome, characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, skin rash, myalgias/arthralgias, and other symptoms.1-6Primary care clinicians, however, often do not recognize acute HIV infection because the self- limiting symptoms are similar to those of many other viral infections, such as influenza and infectious mononucleosis. Acute infection can also be asymptomatic. Table 10 provides practitioners with guidance to recognize, diagnose, and manage acute HIV infection.Panel's Recommendations Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all persons with HIV infection and should be offered to those with early* HIV infection (BII) , although definitive data are lacking as to whether this approach will result in long-term virologic, immunologic, or clinical benefits. All pregnant women with early HIV infection should start ART as soon as possible to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV (AI). If treatment is initiated in a patient with early HIV infection, the goal is to suppress plasma HIV RNA to below detectable levels (AIII) . For patients with early HIV infection in whom therapy is initiated, testing for plasma HIV RNA levels, CD4 count, and toxicity monitoring should be performed as described for patients with chronic HIV infection (AII) . Genotypic drug-resistance testing should be performed before initiation of ART to guide the selection of the regimen (AII). If therapy is deferred, genotypic resistance testing should still be performed because the results will be useful in selecting a regimen with the greatest potential for achieving optimal virologic response when therapy is ultimately initiated (AII) . For patients without transmitted drug resistant virus, therapy should be initiated with a regimen that is recommended for patients with chronic HIV infection (see What to Start ) (AIII). ART can be initiated before drug resistance test results are available. Since resistance to ritonavir (RTV)-boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) emerges slowly and since clinically significant transmitted resistance to PIs is uncommon,these drugs combined with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) should be used in this setting (AIII) . Patients starting ART should be willing and able to commit to treatment and should understand the possible benefits and risks of therapy and the importance of adherence (AIII) . Patients may choose to postpone therapy, and providers, on a case-by-case basis, may elect to defer therapy because of clinical and/or psychosocial factors. * Early infection represents either acute or recent infection as defined in the first paragraph below. Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = Data from randomized controlled trials; II = Data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinionGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-2Diagnosis of Acute HIV Infection Health care providers should maintain a high level of suspicion of acute HIV infection in patients who have a compatible clinical syndrome\u2014especially in those who report recent high-risk behavior (Table 10 ).7Patients may not always disclose or admit to high-risk behaviors or they may not perceive that their behaviors put themat risk for HIV acquisition. Thus, signs and symptoms consistent with acute retroviral syndrome should motivateconsideration of a diagnosis of acute HIV infection even in the absence of reported high-risk behaviors. Acute HIV infection is usually defined as detectable HIV RNA or p24 antigen, the latter often used incurrently available HIV antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combination assays, in serum or plasma in the setting of anegative or indeterminate HIV antibody test. 7, 8When the acute retroviral syndrome is suspected in a patient with a negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test result, a test for HIV RNA should be performed todiagnose acute infection (AII). A low-positive HIV RNA level (<10,000 copies/mL) may represent a false-positive test result because values in acute infection are generally very high (>100,000 copies/mL). 5, 6A presumptive diagnosis of acute HIV infection can be made on the basis of a negative or indeterminate HIVantibody test result and a positive HIV RNA test result. However, if the results of an HIV RNA test are low-positive, the test should be repeated using a different specimen from the same patient. It is highly unlikelythat a second test will reproduce a false-positive result. 6Interest in routine screening for acute infection has led select centers to use the HIV Ag/Ab test as the primary HIV screening assay or to test all HIV antibodynegative samples for HIV RNA. 9Combination HIV Ag/Ab tests (ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo and GS HIV Combo Ag/Ab) now are approved by the Food and Drug Administration; however, the currentlyavailable tests do not differentiate between a positive antibody test result and a positive antigen result. ThusHIV Ag/Ab-reactive specimens should be tested with an antibody assay, and if the test results are negative orindeterminate and if acute HIV infection is suspected, be further tested for HIV RNA. 10, 11Because HIV RNA or Ag/Ab combination assays are not yet used routinely for HIV screening in all settings, clinicians shouldnot assume that a laboratory report of a negative HIV test result indicates that screening for acute HIVinfection has been conducted. Patients also should know that home HIV testing only detects HIV antibodiesand therefore will not detect very early acute HIV infection. Persons diagnosed presumptively with acuteHIV infection should have serologic testing repeated over the next 3 to 6 months to document seroconversion(AI) (see Table 10 ). Treatment for Early HIV Infection Clinical trial data regarding the treatment of early HIV infection is limited. Many patients who enrolled instudies to assess the role of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in early HIV infection, as outlined below, wereidentified as trial participants because they presented with signs or symptoms of acute infection. With theintroduction of HIV screening tests that include assays for HIV RNA or p24 antigen and wider HIVscreening in healthcare systems, the number of asymptomatic patients identified with early infection may be increasing. The natural history of HIV disease in these patients may differ from that in persons with symptomatic infections, thus further studies on the impact of ART on the natural history of asymptomatic acute HIV infection are needed. The initial burst of high level viremia in infected adults usually declines shortly after acute infection (e.g., within 2 months); however, a rationale for treatment during recent infection (e.g., 2-6 months after infection) remains because the immune system may not yet have maximally contained viral replication in the lymphoid tissue during this time. 12Several trials have addressed the question of the long-term benefit of potent treatment regimens initiated during early HIV infection. The potential benefits and risks of treating HIV during this stage of disease are discussed below: Potential Benefits of Treatment During Early HIV Infection. Preliminary data indicate that treatment of early HIV infection with combination ART improves laboratory markers of disease progression.13-17 The data, though limited, indicate that treatment of early HIV infection may also decrease the severity of acute disease; lower the viral set point,18-20which can affect disease progression rates in the event therapyGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-3is stopped; reduce the size of the viral reservoir;21and decrease the rate of viral mutation by suppressing viral replication and preserving immune function.22Because early HIV infection often is associated with high viral loads and increased infectiousness,23and ART use by HIV-infected individuals reduces transmission to serodiscordant sexual partners,24treatment during this stage of infection is expected to substantially reduce the risk of HIV transmission. In addition, although data are limited and the clinical relevance unclear, the profound loss of gastrointestinal lymphoid tissue that occurs during the first weeksof infection may be mitigated by initiating ART during early HIV infection. 25, 26Many of the potential benefits described above may be more likely to occur with treatment of acute infection, but they alsomay occur if treatment is initiated during recent HIV infection. Potential Risks of Treatment During Early HIV Infection. The potential disadvantages of initiating therapy during early HIV infection include more prolonged exposure to ART without a known long-termclinical benefit. This could result in drug toxicities, development of drug resistance, and adverse effectson an individual's quality of life due to earlier initiation of lifelong therapy that requires strict adherence. Several randomized controlled trials have studied the effect of ART during acute and recent infection to assess whether initiating early therapy would allow patients to stop treatment and maintain lower viral loadsand higher CD4 counts while off ART for prolonged periods of time. This objective was of interest whenthese studies were initiated but is less relevant in an era in which treatment is recommended for virtually allHIV-infected patients and treatment interruptions are not recommended (see Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy in Treatment-Naive Patients ). The Setpoint Study (ACTG A5217 Study) randomized patients with recent but not acute HIV infection toeither defer therapy or immediately initiate ART for 36 weeks and then stop. 18The primary study end point was a composite of meeting criteria for ART or re-initiation of ART and viral load results at week 72 in bothgroups and at week 36 in the deferred treatment group. The study was stopped prematurely by the Data andSafety Monitoring Board because of an apparent benefit associated with early therapy that was driven mostlyby greater proportion of participants meeting criteria for ART initiation in the deferred treatment group(50%) than in the immediate treatment group (10%). Nearly half of the patients in the deferred treatmentgroup needed to start therapy during the first year of study enrollment. The Randomized Primo-SHM Trial randomized patients with acute (~70%) or recent (~30%) infection to either defer ART or to undergo treatment for 24 or 60 weeks and then stop. 19Significantly lower viral loads were observed 36 weeks after treatment interruption in the patients who had been treated early. Thesepatients also experienced a longer time before the need to initiate therapy, primarily on the basis of reachinga CD4 count of <350 cells/mm 3. The median time to starting treatment was 0.7 years for the deferred therapy group and 3.0 and 1.8 years for the 24- and 60-week treatment arms, respectively. The time to reaching aCD4 count of <500 cells/mm 3was only 0.5 years in the deferred group. Finally, the SPARTAC Trial included patients with acute and recent infection randomized to either defer therapy or to undergo treatment for 12 or 48 weeks and then stop.20In this case, the time to CD4 <350 cells/mm3or initiation of therapy was significantly longer in the group treated for 48 weeks than in the deferred treatment group or the group treated for 12 weeks. However, no difference was observed comparing persons who received 12 weeks of ART with those who deferred treatment during early infection. The strategies tested in these studies are of limited relevance in the current treatment era in which treatment interruption is not recommended. The study results may not fully reflect the natural history of HIV disease in persons with asymptomatic acute infection because most patients in these trials were enrolled on the basis of identified early symptomatic HIV infections. Nevertheless, the results do demonstrate that some immunologic and virologic benefits may be associated with the treatment of early HIV infection. Moreover, all the findings suggest, at least in the population recruited for these studies, that the time to initiating ART after identificationGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-4of early infection is quite short when the threshold for ART initiation is 350 CD4 cells/mm3, and nonexistent when therapy is advised for all individuals regardless of CD4 cell count as currently recommended in these guidelines. These observations must be balanced with the risks of early treatment, risks that are largely thesame as those of therapy initiated in chronically infected asymptomatic patients with high CD4 counts.Consequently, the health care provider and the patient should be fully aware that the rationale for initiatingtherapy during early HIV infection is based on theoretical benefits and the extrapolation of data from thestrategy trials outlined above. These potential benefits must be weighed against the risks. For these reasons,and because ART is currently recommended for all HIV-infected patients (see Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy in Treatment-Naive Patients ), ART should be offered to all patients with early HIV infection (BII). However, patients must be willing and able to commit to treatment and providers, on a case-by-case basis, may elect todefer therapy for clinical and/or psychosocial reasons. Providers also should consider enrolling patients withearly HIV infection in clinical studies to further evaluate the natural history of this stage of HIV infection andto further define the role of ART in this setting. Providers can obtain information regarding such trials atwww.clinicaltrials.gov or from local HIV treatment experts. Treatment for Early HIV Infection During Pregnancy Because early HIV infection is associated with a high risk of perinatal transmission, all HIV-infected pregnantwomen should start combination ART as soon as possible to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV (AI). 27 Treatment Regimen for Early HIV Infection Data from the United States and Europe demonstrate that transmitted virus may be resistant to at least 1antiretroviral in 6% to 16% of patients. 28-30Up to 21% of isolates from contemporary patients with acute HIV infection demonstrated resistance to at least 1 drug.31Therefore, before initiation of ART in a person with early HIV infection, genotypic antiretroviral drug-resistance testing should be performed to guide theselection of a regimen (AII). If the decision to initiate therapy during early infection is made, especially inthe setting of acute infection, treatment initiation should not be delayed pending resistance testing results.Once results are available, the treatment regimen can be modified if warranted. If therapy is deferred,resistance testing still should be performed because the results will help guide selection of a regimen tooptimize virologic response once therapy is initiated (AII). The goal of therapy during early HIV infection is to suppress plasma HIV RNA to undetectable levels (AIII). Because data to draw firm conclusions regarding specific drug combinations to use in this stage of HIVinfection are insufficient, ART should be initiated with one of the combination regimens recommended forpatients with chronic infection (AIII) (see What to Start ). If therapy is started before the results of drug- resistance testing are available, because resistance to RTV-boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) emerge slowlyand clinically significant transmitted resistance to PIs is uncommon (AIII). If available, the results of ARVdrug-resistance testing or the ARV resistance pattern of the source person's virus should be used to guide the selection of the ARV regimen. Given the recent approval of daily tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), 32-34early infection may be diagnosed in some patients while they are taking TDF/FTC as PrEP. In this setting, resistance testing should be performed; however, because PI resistance is unlikely, use of a RTV-boosted PI with TDF/FTC remains a reasonable option pending resistance testing results (see What to Start ). Patient Follow-up Testing for plasma HIV RNA levels, CD4 cell counts, and toxicity monitoring should be performed as described in Laboratory Testing for Initial Assessment and Monitoring While on Antiretroviral Therapy (i.e., HIV RNA at initiation of therapy, after 2 to 8 weeks, then every 4 to 8 weeks until viral suppression, and thereafter, every 3 to 4 months) (AII).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-5Duration of Therapy for Early HIV Infection The optimal duration of therapy for patients with early HIV infection is unknown. Recent studies of early HIV infection have evaluated the potential for starting and then stopping treatment.18-20Although these studies showed some benefits associated with this strategy, a large randomized controlled trial of patientswith chronic HIV infection found that treatment interruption was harmful in terms of increased risk of AIDSand non-AIDS events, 35and that the strategy was associated with increased markers of inflammation, immune activation and coagulation.36For these reasons and because of the potential benefit of ART in reducing the risk of HIV transmission, the Panel recommends against discontinuation of ART in patientstreated for early HIV infection (AIII).

AIDS. 1991;5(1):1-14. Available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=1812848 . Suspecting acute HIV infection: Signs or symptoms of acute HIV infection with recent (within 2 to 6 weeks) high risk of exposure to HIVa Signs/symptoms/laboratory findings may include but are not limited to one or more of the following: fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, myalgia/arthralgia, headache, diarrhea, oral ulcers, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, transaminase elevation. High-risk exposures include sexual contact with an HIV-infected person or a person at risk of HIV infection, sharing injection drug use paraphernalia, or contact of mucous membranes or breaks in skin with potentially infectious fluids. Differential diagnosis: Includes but is not limited to viral illnesses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)- and non-EBV (e.g., cytomegalovirus) infectious viral streptococcal infection, or syphilis. Evaluation/diagnosis of acute HIV infection: Acute infection is defined as detectable HIV RNA or p24 antigen (the antigen used in currently available HIV antigen/antibody [Ag/Ab] combination assays), in serum or plasma in the setting of a negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test result A reactive HIV antibody test or Ag/Ab test must be followed by supplemental confirmatory testing. A negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test in a person with a positive Ag/Ab test or in whom acute HIV infection is suspected requires assessment of plasma HIV RNAbto assess for acute HIV infection. A positive plasma HIV RNA test in the setting of a negative or indeterminate antibody result is consistent with acute HIV infection. Patients presumptively diagnosed with acute HIV infection should have serologic testing repeated over the next 3 to 6 months to document seroconversion. Considerations for antiretroviral therapy (ART) during early HIV infection: All pregnant women with early HIV infection should begin taking combination ART as soon as possible because of the high risk of perinatal HIV transmission (AI) . Treatment for early HIV infection should be offered to all non-pregnant persons (BII). The risks of ART during early HIV infection are largely the same as those for ART initiated in chronically infected asymptomatic patients with high CD4 counts. If therapy is initiated, the goal should be sustained plasma virologic suppression (AIII) . Providers should consider enrolling patients with early HIV infection in clinical studies. aIn some settings, behaviors conducive to acquisition of HIV infection might not be ascertained or might not be perceived as high risk by the health care provider or the patient or both. Thus, symptoms and signs consistent with acute retroviral syndrome should motivate consideration of this diagnosis even in the absence of reported high-risk behaviors. bPlasma HIV RNA can be measured by a variety of quantitative assays, including branched DNA (bDNA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assays as by a qualitative transcription-mediated amplification assay (APTIMA, GenProbe).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-62.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimatesthat 15% of the 35,314 new HIV diagnoses reported among the 33 states that participated in confidential,name-based HIV infection reporting in 2006 were among youth 13-24 years of age. 1Recent trends in HIV prevalence reveal that the disproportionate burden of HIV/AIDS among racial minorities is even greateramong youth 13-19 years of age than among young adults 20-24 years of age. 2Furthermore, trends for all HIV/AIDS diagnoses in 33 states from 2001 to 2006 decreased for all transmission categories except amongmen who have sex with men (MSM). Notably, among all black MSM, the largest increase in HIV/AIDSdiagnoses occurred among youth 13-24 years of age. 3HIV-infected adolescents represent a heterogeneous group in terms of sociodemographics, mode of HIV infection, sexual and substance abuse history, clinicaland immunologic status, psychosocial development, and readiness to adhere to medications. Many of thesefactors may influence decisions concerning when to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) and what antiretroviral(ARV) medications should be used. Most adolescents who acquire HIV are infected through high-risk behaviors. Many of them are recently infected and unaware of their HIV infection status. Thus, many are in an early stage of HIV infection, whichmakes them ideal candidates for early interventions, such as prevention counseling, linkage, and engagementto care. A recent study among HIV-infected adolescents and young adults presenting for care identifiedprimary genotypic resistance mutations to ARV medications in up to 18% of the evaluable sample of recentlyinfected youth, as determined by the detuned antibody testing assay strategy that defined recent infection asoccurring within 180 days of testing. 4This transmission dynamic reflects that a substantial proportion of youth's sexual partners are likely older and may be more ART experienced; thus, awareness of theimportance of baseline resistance testing among recently infected youth naive to ART is imperative. A limited but increasing number of HIV-infected adolescents are long-term survivors of HIV infection acquiredperinatally or in infancy through blood products. Such adolescents are usually heavily ART experienced andmay have a unique clinical course that differs from that of adolescents infected later in life. 5If these heavily ART-experienced adolescents harbor resistant virus, optimal ARV regimens should be based on the sameguiding principles as for heavily ART-experienced adults. (See Virologic and Immunogic Failure .) Adolescents are developmentally at a difficult crossroad. Their needs for autonomy and independence andtheir evolving decisional capacity intersect and compete with concrete thinking processes, risk-takingbehaviors, preoccupation with self-image, and the need to \"fit in\" with their peers. This makes it challengingto attract and sustain adolescents' focus on maintaining their health, particularly for those with chronicillnesses. These challenges are not specific to any particular transmission mode or stage of disease. Thus, irrespective of disease duration or mode of HIV transmission, every effort must be made to engage them in care so they can improve and maintain their health for the long term. Antiretroviral Therapy Considerations in Adolescents Adult guidelines for ART are usually appropriate for postpubertal adolescents, because the clinical course of HIV-infected adolescents who were infected sexually or through injection drug use during adolescence is more similar to that of adults than to that of children. Adult guidelines can also be useful for postpubertal youth who were perinatally infected because these patients often have treatment challenges associated with the use of long-term ART that mirror those of ART-experienced adults, such as extensive resistance, complex regimens, and adverse drug effects. Dosage of medications for HIV infection and opportunistic infections should be prescribed according to Tanner staging of puberty and not solely on the basis of age.6-7Adolescents in early puberty (i.e., TannerGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-10Stages I and II) should be administered doses on pediatric schedules, whereas those in late puberty (i.e., Tanner Stage V) should follow adult dosing schedules. However, Tanner stage and age are not necessarilydirectly predictive of drug pharmacokinetics. Because puberty may be delayed in children who were infectedwith HIV perinatally, 8continued use of pediatric doses in puberty-delayed adolescents can result in medication doses that are higher than the usual adult doses. Because data are not available to predict optimalmedication doses for each ARV medication for this group of children, issues such as toxicity, pill or liquidvolume burden, adherence, and virologic and immunologic parameters should be considered in determiningwhen to transition from pediatric to adult doses. Youth who are in their growth spurt period (i.e., TannerStage III in females and Tanner Stage IV in males) and following adult or pediatric dosing guidelines andadolescents who have transitioned from pediatric to adult doses should be closely monitored for medicationefficacy and toxicity. Therapeutic drug monitoring can be considered in selected circumstances to help guidetherapy decisions in this context. Pharmacokinetic studies of drugs in youth are needed to better defineappropriate dosing. For a more detailed discussion, see Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection .9 Adherence Concerns in Adolescents HIV-infected adolescents are especially vulnerable to specific adherence problems based on theirpsychosocial and cognitive developmental trajectory. Comprehensive systems of care are required to serveboth the medical and psychosocial needs of HIV-infected adolescents, who are frequently inexperienced withhealth care systems and who lack health insurance. Many HIV-infected adolescents face challenges inadhering to medical regimens for reasons that include: denial and fear of their HIV infection; misinformation; distrust of the medical establishment; fear and lack of belief in the effectiveness of medications; low self-esteem; unstructured and chaotic lifestyles; mood disorders and other mental illness; lack of familial and social support; absence of or inconsistent access to care or health insurance; and incumbent risk of inadvertent parental disclosure of the youth's HIV infection status if parental health insurance is used. In selecting treatment regimens for adolescents, clinicians must balance the goal of prescribing a maximally potent ART regimen with realistic assessment of existing and potential support systems to facilitate adherence. Adolescents benefit from reminder systems (e.g., beepers, timers, and pill boxes) that are stylish and inconspicuous. 10It is important to make medication adherence as user friendly and as little stigmatizing as possible for the older child or adolescent. The concrete thought processes of adolescents make it difficult for them to take medications when they are asymptomatic, particularly if the medications have side effects. Adherence to complex regimens is particularly challenging at a time of life when adolescents do not want to be different from their peers.11-13Directly observed therapy might be considered for selected HIV-infected adolescents such as those with mental illness.14-18 Difficult Adherence Problems Because adolescence is characterized by rapid changes in physical maturation, cognitive processes, and life style, predicting long-term adherence in an adolescent can be very challenging. The ability of youth to adhereGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-11to therapy needs to be included as part of therapeutic decision making concerning the risks and benefits of starting treatment. Erratic adherence may result in the loss of future regimens because of the development ofresistance mutations. Clinicians who care for HIV-infected adolescents frequently manage youth who, whileneeding therapy, pose significant concerns regarding their ability to adhere to therapy. In these cases,alternative considerations to initiation of therapy can be the following: (1) a short-term deferral of treatmentuntil adherence is more likely or while adherence-related problems are aggressively addressed; (2) anadherence testing period in which a placebo (e.g., vitamin pill) is administered; and (3) the avoidance of anyregimens with low genetic resistance barriers. Such decisions are ideally individualized to each patient andshould be made carefully in context with the individual's clinical status. For a more detailed discussion onspecific therapy and adherence issues for HIV-infected adolescents, see Guidelines for Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection .9 Special Considerations in Adolescents Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), in particular human papilloma virus (HPV), should also be addressedin all adolescents. For a more detailed discussion on STIs, see the most recent CDC guidelines 19and the pediatric opportunistic infection treatment guidelines on HPV among HIV-infected adolescents.20Family planning counseling, including a discussion of the risks of perinatal transmission of HIV and methods toreduce risks, should be provided to all youth. Providing gynecologic care for the HIV-infected femaleadolescent is especially important. Contraception, including the interaction of specific ARV drugs onhormonal contraceptives, and the potential for pregnancy also may alter choices of ART. As an example,efavirenz (EFV) should be used with caution in females of childbearing age and should only be prescribedafter intensive counseling and education about the potential effects on the fetus, the need for closemonitoring\u2014including periodic pregnancy testing\u2014and a commitment on the part of the teen to useeffective contraception. For a more detailed discussion, see HIV-Infected Women and the Perinatal Guidelines .21 Transitioning Care Given lifelong infection with HIV and the need for treatment through several stages of growth anddevelopment, HIV care programs and providers need flexibility to appropriately transition care for HIV-infected children, adolescents, and young adults. A successful transition requires an awareness of somefundamental differences between many adolescent and adult HIV care models. In most adolescent HIVclinics, care is more \"teen-centered\" and multidisciplinary, with primary care being highly integrated intoHIV care. Teen services, such as sexual and reproductive health, substance abuse treatment, mental health,treatment education, and adherence counseling are all found in one clinic setting. In contrast, some adult HIVclinics may rely more on referral of the patient to separate subspecialty care settings, such as gynecology.Transitioning the care of an emerging young adult includes considerations of areas such as medical insurance, independence, autonomy, decisional capacity, confidentiality, and consent. Also, adult clinic settings tend to be larger and can easily intimidate younger, less motivated patients. As an additional complication to this transition, HIV-infected adolescents belong to two epidemiologically distinct subgroups: (1) those perinatally infected\u2014who would likely have more disease burden history, complications, and chronicity; less functional autonomy; greater need for ART; and higher mortality risk; and (2) those more recently infected due to high-risk behaviors. Thus, these subgroups have unique biomedical and psychosocial considerations and needs. To maximize the likelihood of a successful transition, facilitators to successful transitioning are best implemented early on. These include the following: (1) optimizing provider communication between adolescent and adult clinics; (2) addressing patient/family resistance caused by lack of information, stigma or disclosure concerns, and differences in practice styles; (3) preparing youth for life skills development, including counseling them on the appropriate use of a primary care provider and appointment management,Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-12the importance of prompt symptom recognition and reporting, and the importance of self-efficacy with medication management, insurance, and entitlements; (4) identifying an optimal clinic model for a givensetting (i.e., simultaneous transition of mental health and/or case management versus a gradual phase-in); (5)implementing ongoing evaluation to measure the success of a selected model; (6) engaging in regularmultidisciplinary case conferences between adult and adolescent care providers; (7) implementinginterventions that may be associated with improved outcomes, such as support groups and mental healthconsultation; and (8) incorporating a family planning component into clinical care. Attention to these keyareas will likely improve adherence to appointments and avert the potential for a youth to \"fall through thecracks,\" as it is commonly referred to in adolescent medicine.

In addition, noninjection illicit drug use may facilitate sexual transmission of HIV . Injection and noninjection illicit drugsinclude the following: heroin, commonly used illicit drugs associatedwith HIV infection are heroin and stimulants (e.g., cocaine and amphetamines); however, the use of clubdrugs has increased substantially in the past several years and is common among individuals who have HIVinfection or who are at risk of HIV infection. The association between club drugs and high-risk sexualbehavior in men who have sex with men (MSM) is strongest for methamphetamine and amyl nitrate; thisassociation is less consistent with the other club drugs. 1 Illicit drug use has been associated with depression and anxiety, either as part of the withdrawal process or asa consequence of repeated use. This is particularly relevant in the treatment of HIV infection becausedepression is one of the strongest predictors of poor adherence and poor treatment outcomes. 2Treatment of HIV disease in illicit drug users can be successful but HIV-infected illicit drug users present special treatmentchallenges. These challenges may include the following: (1) an array of complicating comorbid medical andmental health conditions; (2) limited access to HIV care; (3) inadequate adherence to therapy; (4) medicationside effects and toxicities; (5) the need for substance abuse treatment; and (6) drug interactions that cancomplicate HIV treatment. 3 Underlying health problems in injection and noninjection drug users result in increased morbidity andmortality, either independent of or accentuated by HIV disease. Many of these problems are the consequenceof prior exposures to infectious pathogens from nonsterile needle and syringe use. Such problems can includehepatitis B or C virus infection, tuberculosis (TB), skin and soft tissue infections, recurrent bacterialpneumonia, and endocarditis. Other morbidities such as alteration in levels of consciousness and neurologicand renal disease are not uncommon. Furthermore, these comorbidities are associated with a higher risk ofdrug overdoses in illicit drug users with HIV disease than in HIV-uninfected illicit drug users, due in part torespiratory, hepatic, and neurological impairments associated with HIV infection. 4Successful HIV therapy for illicit drug users often depends on clinicians becoming familiar with and managing these comorbidconditions and providing overdose prevention support. Illicit drug users have less access to HIV care and are less likely to receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) than other populations. 5-6Factors associated with low rates of ART use among illicit drug users include active drug use, younger age, female gender, suboptimal health care, recent incarceration, lack of access torehabilitation programs, and health care providers' lack of expertise in HIV treatment. 5-6The typically unstable, chaotic life patterns of many illicit drug users; the powerful pull of addictive substances; and common misperceptions about the dangers, impact, and benefits of ART all contribute to decreased adherence.7The chronic and relapsing nature of substance abuse as a biologic and medical disease, compounded by the high rate of mental illness that antedates and/or is exacerbated by illicit substance use, additionally complicate the relationship between health care workers and illicit drug users.8-9The first step in provision of care and treatment for these individuals is to recognize the existence of a substance abuse problem. It is often obvious that the problem exists, but some patients may hide these problem behaviors from clinicians. Assessment of a patient for substance abuse should be part of routine medical history taking and should be done in a professional, straightforward, and nonjudgmental manner. Treatment Efficacy in HIV-Infected Illicit Drug Use Populations Although illicit drug users are underrepresented in HIV therapy clinical trials, available data indicate that efficacy of ART in illicit drug users\u2014when they are not actively using drugs\u2014is similar to that seen in otherGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-15populations.10Furthermore, therapeutic failure in this population generally correlates with the degree that drug use disrupts daily activities rather than with drug use per se.11Providers need to remain attentive to the possible impact of disruptions caused by drug use on the patient both before and while receiving ART. Although many illicit drug users can sufficiently control their drug use for long enough time to benefit fromcare, substance abuse treatment is often necessary for successful HIV management. Close collaboration with substance abuse treatment programs and proper support and attention to this population's special multidisciplinary needs are critical components of successful HIV treatment. Essential tothis end are accommodating, flexible, community-based HIV care sites that are characterized by familiaritywith and nonjudgmental expertise in management of drug users' wide array of needs and in development ofeffective strategies to promote medication adherence. 9These strategies should include, if available, the use of adherence support mechanisms such as modified directly observed therapy (mDOT), which has shownpromise in this population. 12 Antiretroviral Agents and Opioid Substitution Therapy Compared with noninjection drug users receiving ART, injection drug users (IDUs) receiving ART are morelikely to experience an increased frequency of side effects and toxicities of ART. Although not systematicallystudied, this is likely because underlying hepatic, renal, neurologic, psychiatric, gastrointestinal (GI), andhematologic disorders are highly prevalent among IDUs. These comorbid conditions should be consideredwhen selecting antiretroviral (ARV) agents in this population. Opioid substitution therapies such asmethadone and buprenorphine/naloxone and extended-release naltrexone are commonly used formanagement of opioid dependence in HIV-infected patients. Methadone and Antiretroviral Therapy. Methadone, an orally administered, long-acting opioid agonist, is the most common pharmacologic treatment for opioid addiction. Its use is associated with decreased heroinuse, decreased needle sharing, and improved quality of life. Because of its opioid-induced effects on gastricemptying and the metabolism of 450 isoenzymes 2B6, 3A4, and 2D6, pharmacologiceffects and interactions with ARV agents may commonly occur. 13These may diminish the effectiveness of either or both therapies by causing opioid withdrawal or overdose, increased methadone beenassociated with significant decreases in methadone levels. Patients and substance abuse treatment facilitiesshould be informed of the likelihood of this interaction. The clinical effect is usually seen after 7 days of co-administration and may be managed by increasing the methadone dosage, usually in 5-mg to 10-mgincrements daily until the desired effect is achieved. Buprenorphine and Antiretroviral Therapy. Buprenorphine, a partial -opioid agonist, is administrated sublingually and is often coformulated with naloxone. It is increasingly used for opioid dependence treatment. Compared with methadone, buprenorphine has a lower risk of respiratory depression and overdose. This allows physicians in primary care to prescribe buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependency. The flexibility of the primary care setting can be of significant value to opioid-addicted HIV- infected patients who require ART because it enables one physician or program to provide both medical and substance abuse services. Limited information is currently available about interactions between buprenorphine and ARV agents. 13-14Findings from available studies show that the drug interaction profile of buprenorphine is more favorable than that of methadone. Naltrexone and Antiretroviral Therapy. A once-monthly extended-release intramuscular formulation of naltrexone was recently approved for prevention of relapse in patients who have undergone an opioid detoxification program. Naltrexone is also indicated for treatment of alcohol dependency. Naltrexone is not metabolized via the CYP450 enzyme system and is not expected to interact with protease inhibitors (PIs) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).15Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-16Table 11 provides the currently available pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction data that clinicians can use as a guide for managing patients receiving ART and methadone or buprenorphine. Particular attention is needed concerning communication between HIV care providers and drug treatment programs regarding additivedrug toxicities and drug interactions resulting in opiate withdrawal or excess. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), GHB, ketamine, and methamphetamine all have the potential to interact with ARV agents because all are metabolized, at least in part, by the CYP450 system. Overdosessecondary to interactions between the party drugs (i.e., MDMA or GHB) and PI-based ART have beenreported. 16 Summary It is usually possible over time to support most active drug users such that acceptable adherence levels withARV agents can be achieved. 17-18Providers must work to combine all available resources to stabilize an active drug user in preparation for ART. This should include identification of concurrent medical andpsychiatric illnesses, drug treatment and needle and syringe exchange programs, strategies to reduce high-risk sexual behavior, and harm-reduction strategies. A history of drug use alone is insufficient reason towithhold ART because individuals with a history of prior drug use have adherence rates similar to those whodo not abuse drugs. Important considerations in the selection of successful regimens and the provision of appropriate patient monitoring in this population include need for supportive clinical sites; linkage to substance abuse treatment;and awareness of the interactions between illicit drugs and ARV agents, including the increased risk of sideeffects and toxicities. Simple regimens should be considered to enhance medication adherence. Preferenceshould be given to ARV agents that have a lower risk of hepatic and neuropsychiatric side effects, simpledosing schedules, and minimal interaction with methadone.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents reported.

Clinicians who provide care for pregnant womenshould consult the current Perinatal Guidelines 1for more in-depth discussion and management assistance. Additional guidance on the management of HIV-infected women can be found athttp://hab.hrsa.gov/deliverhivaidscare/clinicalguide11 . Gender Considerations in Antiretroviral Therapy In general, studies to date have not shown gender differences in virologic responses to antritretroviral therapy (ART),2-4but a number of studies have suggested that gender may influence the frequency, presentation, and severity of selected antiretroviral (ARV)-related adverse events.5Although data are limited, evidence also exists that pharmacokinetics for some ARV drugs may differ between men and women, possibly because of variations between men and women in factors such as body weight, plasma volume, gastric emptying time, plasma protein levels, cytochrome P (CYP) 450 activity, drug transporter function, and excretion activity.6-8 Adverse Effects : Nevirapine (NVP)-associated hepatotoxicity: NVP has been associated with an increased risk of symptomatic, potentially fatal, and often rash-associated liver toxicity in ARV-naive individuals; women with higher CD4 counts (>250 cells/mm3) or elevated baseline transaminase levels appear to be atPanel's Recommendations The indications for initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the goals of treatment are the same for HIV-infected women as for other HIV-infected adults and adolescents (AI) . Women taking antiretroviral (ARV) drugs that have significant pharmacokinetic interactions with oral contraceptives should use an additional or alternative contraceptive method to prevent unintended pregnancy (AIII) . In pregnant women, an additional goal of therapy is prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV, with a goal of maximal viral suppression to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV to the fetus and newborn (AI) . When selecting an ARV combination regimen for a pregnant woman, clinicians should consider the known safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic data on use during pregnancy for each agent (AIII) . Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of efavirenz (EFV) and receive counseling about the potential risk to the fetus and desirability of avoiding pregnancy while on EFV-based regimens (AIII). Alternative regimens that do not include EFV should be strongly considered in women who are planning to become pregnant or sexually active and not using effective contraception, assuming these alternative regimens areacceptable to the provider and are not thought to compromise the woman's health (BIII) . Because the risk of neural tube defects is restricted to the first 5 to 6 weeks of pregnancy and pregnancy is rarely recognized before 4 to 6 weeks of pregnancy, EFV can be continued in pregnant women receiving an EFV-basedregimen who present for antenatal care in the first trimester, provided the regimen produces virologic suppression(CIII). When designing a regimen for a pregnant woman, clinicians should consult the most current Health and Human Services (HHS) Perinatal Guidelines (AIII) . Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = Data from randomized controlled trials; II = Data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinionGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-21greatest risk.9-12It is generally recommended that NVP not be prescribed to ARV-naive women who have CD4 counts >250 cells/mm3unless there is no other alternative and the benefit from NVP outweighs the risk of hepatotoxicity (AI). Lactic acidosis: There is a female predominance in the increased incidence of symptomatic and even fatal lactic acidosis associated with prolonged exposure to nucleoside reverse transcriptase Lactic acidosis didanosine and zidovudine (ZDV)but it can occur with other NRTIs. 13 Metabolic complications: A few studies have compared women and men in terms of metabolic complications associated with ARV use. Compared with HIV-infected men, HIV-infected women aremore likely to experience increases in central fat with ART and are less likely to have triglycerideelevations on treatment. 14, 15Women have an increased risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis, particularly after menopause, and this risk is exacerbated by HIV and ART.16, 17At the present time, none of these differences requires women-specific recommendations regarding treatment or monitoring. Women of Childbearing Potential All women of childbearing potential should be offered pre-conception counseling and care as a component of routine primary medical care. Counseling should include discussion of special considerations pertaining toARV use when trying to conceive and during pregnancy (see Perinatal Guidelines 1). Safe sexual practices, reproductive desires and options for conception, HIV status of sexual partner(s), and use of effectivecontraception to prevent unintended pregnancy should be discussed. An HIV-infected woman who wishes toconceive with an HIV-uninfected male partner should be informed of options to prevent sexual transmissionof HIV while attempting conception. Interventions include initiation of maximally suppressive ART, whichsignificantly decreases the risk of sexual transmission (see Preventing Secondary Transmission of HIV ), and artificial insemination, including the option to self-inseminate with the partner's sperm during theperiovulatory period 18(for more extensive discussion on this topic, see the Reproductive Options for HIV- Concordant and Serodiscordant Couples section of the Perinatal Guidelines .1 Efavirenz (EFV) is teratogenic in non-human primates. Women of childbearing potential should undergopregnancy testing before initiation of EFV and receive counseling about the potential risk to the fetus anddesirability of avoiding pregnancy while on EFV-based regimens (AIII). Alternative regimens that do notinclude EFV should be strongly considered in women who are planning to become pregnant or who aresexually active and not using effective contraception, assuming these alternative regimens are acceptable tothe provider and are not thought to compromise the woman's health (BIII). The most vulnerable period infetal organogenesis is early in gestation, before pregnancy is recognized. Hormonal Contraception Safe and effective reproductive health and family planning services to reduce unintended pregnancy and perinatal transmission of HIV are an essential component of care for HIV-infected women of childbearing age. Counseling about reproductive issues should be provided on an ongoing basis. Providers should be aware of potential interactions between ARV drugs and hormonal contraceptives that could lower contraceptive efficacy. Several protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have drug interactions with combined oral contraceptives (COCs). Interactions include either a decrease or an increase in blood levels of ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone, or norgestimate (see Tables 15a and 15b ), which potentially decreases contraceptive efficacy or increases estrogen- or progestin- related adverse effects (e.g., thromboembolism). Small studies of HIV-infected women receiving injectable depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) while on ART showed no EFV , of etonogestrelGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-22implant in two patients on EFV-based therapy has been reported and a study has shown EFV may decrease plasma progestin concentrations of COCs containing ethinyl estradiol and levels.24, 25A small study from Malawi showed that NVP use did not significantly affect estradiol or progestin levels in HIV-infected women.26Overall, data are relatively limited and the clinical implications of these findings are unclear. The magnitudes of change indrug levels that may reduce contraceptive efficacy or increase adverse effects are unknown. Concerns aboutpharmacokinetic interactions between oral and implant hormonal contraceptives and ARVs should notprevent clinicians from prescribing hormonal contraceptives for women on ART if that is their preferredcontraceptive method. However, when women wish to use hormonal contraceptives and drug interactionswith ARVs are known, additional or alternative contraceptive methods may be recommended (see druginteraction Tables 15a, 15b, and 15d and Perinatal Guidelines1). Consistent use of male or female condoms to prevent transmission of HIV and protect against other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) isrecommended for all HIV-infected women and their partners, regardless of contraceptive use. The data on the association between hormonal contraception and the risk of acquisition of HIV are conflicting. 27A retrospective secondary analysis of two studies of serodiscordant couples in Africa in which the HIV-infected partner was not receiving ART found that women using hormonal contraception (the vastmajority using injectable DMPA) had a twofold increased risk of acquiring HIV (for HIV-infected male/HIV-uninfected female couples) or transmitting HIV (HIV-infected female/HIV-uninfected male couples).HIV-infected women using hormonal contraception had higher genital HIV RNA concentrations than didwomen not using hormonal contraceptives. 28Oral contraceptive use was not significantly associated with transmission of HIV; however, the number of women using oral contraceptives in this study was insufficientto adequately assess risk. It is important to note that not all studies have supported a link between hormonalcontraception and transmission or acquisition of HIV and that the individuals in this study were not receivingART. Further research is needed to definitively determine if hormonal contraceptive use is an independentrisk factor for acquisition and transmission of HIV , particularly in the setting of ART. 27, 29 Intrauterine devices (IUDs) appear to be a safe and effective contraceptive option for HIV-infected women.30-33 Although studies have focused primarily on non-hormone-containing IUDs (e.g., copper IUD), several smallstudies have also found levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs to be safe and not associated with increased genital tractshedding of HIV . 31, 34, 35 Pregnant Women Clinicians should review the Perinatal Guidelines1for a detailed discussion of the management of HIV- infected pregnant women. The use of combination ARV regimens is recommended for all HIV-infectedpregnant women, regardless of virologic, immunologic, or clinical parameters (AI). Pregnant HIV-infectedwomen should be counseled regarding the known benefits and risks of ARV use during pregnancy to the woman, fetus, and newborn. A woman's decision regarding ARV use should be respected. Coercive and punitive approaches undermine provider-patient trust and could discourage women from seeking prenatal care and adopting health care behaviors that optimize maternal, fetal, and neonatal well-being. Prevention of Perinatal Transmission of HIV . The use of ARVs and the resultant reduction of HIV RNA levels decrease perinatal transmission of HIV . 36-38The goal of ARV use is to achieve maximal and sustained suppression of HIV RNA levels during pregnancy. As in non-pregnant individuals, genotypic resistance testing is recommended for all pregnant women before ARV initiation (AIII) and for pregnant women with detectable HIV RNA levels while on therapy (AI). Optimal prevention of perinatal transmission may require initiation of ARV drugs before results of resistance testing are available. If results demonstrate the presence of significant mutation(s) that may confer resistance to the prescribed ARV regimen, the regimen should be modified.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-23Long-term follow-up is recommended for all infants born to women who have received ARVs during pregnancy, regardless of the infant's HIV status (see the Perinatal Guidelines1). Regimen Considerations. Pregnancy should not preclude the use of optimal drug regimens. Because recommendations on ARVs to use for treatment of HIV-infected pregnant women are subject to uniqueconsiderations, recommendations specific to the timing of therapy initiation and the choice of ARVs for pregnantwomen may differ from those for non-pregnant individuals. These considerations include the following: Potential changes in pharmacokinetics and, thus, dosing requirements, which result from physiologic changes associated with pregnancy; potential ARV-associated adverse effects in pregnant women and the woman's ability to adhere to aparticular regimen during pregnancy; and potential short- and long-term effects of the ARV on the fetus and newborn, which are unknown formany drugs. Combination drug regimens are considered the standard of care in pregnancy, both for the treatment of HIV infection and for the prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV . Because the risk of neural tube defects isrestricted to the first 5 to 6 weeks of pregnancy and pregnancy is rarely recognized before 4 to 6 weeks ofpregnancy, and unnecessary changes in ARV drugs during pregnancy may be associated with loss of viralcontrol and increased risk of perinatal transmission, EFV can be continued in pregnant women receiving anEFV-based regimen who present for antenatal care in the first trimester, provided the regimen producesvirologic suppression (CIII). Detailed recommendations on ARV choice in pregnancy are discussed in detailin the Perinatal Guidelines (see Perinatal Guidelines 1). Intravenous (IV) zidovudine (ZDV) infusion to the mother during labor is recommended if maternal HIVRNA is 400 copies/mL (or with unknown HIV RNA levels) near delivery, regardless of antepartum regimenor mode of delivery (AI). Consideration can be given to omitting IV ZDV infusion during labor for HIV-infected women receiving combination ART regimens who have HIV RNA <400 copies/mL near delivery(BII); however, the combination ART should continue to be administered during labor. Clinicians who are treating HIV-infected pregnant women are strongly encouraged to report cases of prenatal exposure to ARVs (either administered alone or in combinations) to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry(http://www.apregistry.com ). The registry collects observational data regarding exposure to Food and Drug Administration-approved ARV drugs during pregnancy for the purpose of assessing potential teratogenicity.For more information regarding selection and use of ART during pregnancy, refer to the Perinatal Guidelines .1 Postpartum Management Following delivery, clinical, immunologic, and virologic follow-up should continue as recommended for non-pregnant adults and adolescents. Because maternal ART reduces but does not eliminate the risk of transmission of HIV in breast milk and postnatal transmission can occur despite maternal ART, women should also be counseled to avoid breastfeeding.1HIV-infected women should avoid pre-mastication of food fed to their infants because the practice has been associated with transmission of HIV from mother to child.39 Considerations regarding continuation of ART for maternal therapeutic indications are the same as those for ART use in other non-pregnant individuals. For more information regarding postpartum discontinuation of ART, refer to the Perinatal Guidelines .1 Several studies have demonstrated that adherence to ART may worsen in the postpartum period.40-44 Clinicians caring for women postpartum who are receiving ART should specifically address adherence, including an evaluation of specific facilitators and barriers to adherence. Clinicians may consider an intervention to improve adherence (see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy ).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-24References 1.

Although HIV-2 has had only limited spread outside this area, it should be considered in persons of West African origin or those who have had sexual contact or sharedneedles with persons of West African origin. The prevalence of HIV-2 infection is also disproportionatelyhigh in countries with strong socioeconomic ties to West Africa (e.g., France; Spain; Portugal; and formerPortuguese colonies such as Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, and parts of India near Goa). The clinical course of HIV-2 infection is generally characterized by a longer asymptomatic stage, lower plasma HIV-2 viral loads, and lower mortality rates compared with HIV-1 infection. 1-2However, HIV-2 infection can progress to AIDS, and thus antiretroviral therapy (ART) may become necessary during thecourse of infection. Concomitant HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection may occur and should be considered in patientsfrom an area with high prevalence of HIV-2. In the appropriate epidemiologic setting, HIV-2 infection shouldbe suspected in patients with clinical conditions suggestive of HIV infection but with atypical serologicresults (e.g., a positive screening assay with an indeterminate HIV-1 Western blot). 3The possibility of HIV-2 infection should also be considered in the appropriate epidemiologic setting in patients with serologicallyconfirmed HIV infection but low or undetectable viral loads or in those with declining CD4 counts despiteapparent virologic suppression on ART. The Multispot HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Test (Bio-Rad Laboratories) is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for differentiating HIV-1 from HIV-2 infection. Commercially available HIV-1 viral load assays donot reliably detect or quantify HIV-2, and no HIV-2 commercial viral load assays are currently available. 4-5 Most studies reporting HIV-2 viral loads use \"in-house\" assays that are not widely available, making itdifficult to monitor virologic response in the clinical setting. In addition, no validated HIV-2 genotypic orphenotypic antiretroviral (ARV) resistance assays are available. To date, there have been no randomized trials addressing the question of when to start ART or the choice of initial or second-line therapy for HIV-2 infection; 6thus, the optimal treatment strategy has not been defined. HIV-2 appears intrinsically resistant to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)7and to enfuvirtide.8In vitro data suggest HIV-2 is sensitive to the currently available nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), although with a lower barrier to resistance than HIV-1.9-10Variable sensitivity among protease inhibitors (DRV) no approved assays to determine HIV-2 coreceptor tropism exist and HIV-2 is known to coreceptors in addition to CCR5 and CXCR4. 16Several small studies suggest poor responses among HIV-2 infected individuals treated with some ARV regimens, including dual-NRTI regimens,regimens containing two triple-NRTI regimens are conflicting.20-21In general, boosted PI-containing regimens have resulted in more favorable virologic and immunologic responses.21One small study suggested satisfactory responses to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-containing in 17 of 29 (59%) of ARV-naive Resistance-associated mutations develop commonly in HIV-2 patients on therapy.17, 21, 23Genotypic algorithms used to predict drug resistance in HIV-1 may not be applicable to HIV-2, because pathways and mutational patterns leading to resistance may differ.10, 21, 24CD4 cell recovery on therapy may be poor,25 suggesting that more reliable methods for monitoring disease progression and treatment efficacy in HIV-2 infection are needed. Some groups have recommended specific preferred and alternative regimens for initial therapy of HIV-2 infection,24though as yet there are no controlled trial data to reliably predict their success. Until more definitive data are available in an ART-naive patient with HIV-2 mono-infection or with HIV-1/HIV-2 dualGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-28infection who requires treatment, clinicians should initiate a regimen containing two NRTIs and a boosted PI. Monitoring of virologic response in such patients is problematic because of the lack of a commerciallyavailable HIV-2 viral load assay; however, clinical and CD4 count improvement can be used to assesstreatment response.

In the United States, approximately 30% ofpeople currently living with HIV/AIDS are age 50 years or older and trends suggest that the proportion ofolder persons living with HIV/AIDS will increase steadily. 1Care of HIV-infected patients increasingly will involve adults 60 to 80 years of age, a population for which data from clinical trials or pharmacokineticstudies are very limited. There are several distinct areas of concern regarding the association between age and HIV disease. 2First, older HIV-infected patients may suffer from aging-related comorbid illnesses that can complicate the management of HIV infection, as outlined in detail below. Second, HIV disease may affect the biology ofaging, possibly resulting in early manifestations of many clinical syndromes generally associated withadvanced age. Third, reduced mucosal and immunologic defenses (such as post-menopausal atrophicvaginitis) and changes in risk behaviors (for example, decrease in condom use because of less concern aboutpregnancy and increased use of erectile dysfunction drugs) in older adults could lead to increased risk of acquisition and transmission of HIV . 3-4Finally, because older adults generally are perceived to be at low risk of HIV infection, screening for HIV in this population remains low. For these reasons, HIV infection in many older adults may not be diagnosed until late in the disease process. This section focuses on HIV diagnosis and treatment considerations in the older HIV-infected patient. HIV Diagnosis and Prevention Even though many older individuals are engaged in risk behaviors associated with acquisition of HIV , they may be perceived to be at low risk of infection and, as a result, they are less likely to be tested for HIV than younger persons.5According to one U.S. survey, 71% of men and 51% of women age 60 years and older continue to be sexually active,6with less concern about the possibility of pregnancy contributing to less condom use. Another national survey reported that among individuals age 50 years or older, condoms were not used during most recent intercourse with 91% of casual partners or 70% of new partners.7In addition,Key Considerations When Caring for Older HIV-Infected Patients Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended in patients >50 years of age, regardless of CD4 cell count (BIII) , because the risk of non-AIDS related complications may increase and the immunologic response to ART may be reduced in older HIV-infected patients. ART-associated adverse events may occur more frequently in older HIV-infected adults than in younger HIV-infected individuals. Therefore, the bone, kidney, metabolic, cardiovascular, and liver health of older HIV-infected adultsshould be monitored closely. The increased risk of drug-drug interactions between antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and other medications commonly used in older HIV-infected patients should be assessed regularly, especially when starting or switching ART andconcomitant medications. HIV experts and primary care providers should work together to optimize the medical care of older HIV-infected patients with complex comorbidities. Counseling to prevent secondary transmission of HIV remains an important aspect of the care of the older HIV- infected patient. Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = Data from randomized controlled trials; II = Data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinionGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-31results from a CDC survey8show that in 2008 only 35% of adults age 45 to 64 years had ever been tested for HIV infection despite the 2006 CDC recommendation that individuals age 13 to 64 years be tested at least once and more often if sexually active.9Clinicians must be attuned to the possibility of HIV infection in older patients, including those older than 64 years of age who, based on CDC recommendations, would notbe screened for HIV . Furthermore, sexual history taking, risk-reduction counseling, and screening forsexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (if indicated), are important components of general health care for HIV-infected and -uninfected older patients. Failure to consider a diagnosis of HIV in older persons likely contributes to later disease presentation andinitiation of ART. 10One surveillance report showed that the proportion of patients who progressed to AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis was greater among patients >60 years of age (52%) than among patients youngerthan 25 years (16%). 1When individuals >50 years of age present with severe illnesses, AIDS-related opportunistic infections (OIs) need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of the illness. Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy Concerns about decreased immune recovery and increased risk of serious non-AIDS events are factors thatfavor initiating ART in patients >50 years of age regardless of CD4 cell count (BIII). (See Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy in Treatment-Naive Patients .) Data that would favor use of any one of the Panel's recommended initial ART regimens (see What to Start ) on the basis of age are not available. The choice of regimen should be informed by a comprehensive review of the patient's other medical conditions andmedications. A noteworthy limitation of currently available information is lack of data on the long-term safetyof specific antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in older patients, such as use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) inolder patients with declining renal function. The recommendations on how frequently to monitor parameters ofART effectiveness and safety for adults age >50 years are similar to those for the general HIV-infectedpopulation; however, the recommendations for older adults focus particularly on the adverse events of ARTpertaining to renal, liver, cardiovascular, metabolic, and bone health (see Table 13 ). HIV, Aging, and Antiretroviral Therapy The efficacy, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and drug interaction potentials of ART in the older adulthave not been studied systematically. There is no evidence that the virologic response to ART is different inolder patients than in younger patients. However, CD4 T-cell recovery after starting ART generally is lessrobust in older patients than in younger patients. 11-14This observation suggests that starting ART at a younger age will result in better immunologic and possibly clinical outcomes. Hepatic metabolism and renal elimination are the major routes of drug clearance, including the clearance of ARV drugs. Both liver and kidney function may decrease with age, which may result in impaired drug elimination and drug accumulation.15Current ARV drug doses are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data derived from studies conducted in subjects with normal organ function. Most clinical trials include only a small proportion of study participants >50 years of age. Whether drug accumulation in the older patient may lead to greater incidence and severity of adverse effects than seen in younger patients is unknown. HIV-infected patients with aging-associated comorbidities may require additional pharmacologic intervention, making therapeutic management increasingly complex. In addition to taking medications to manage HIV infection and comorbid conditions, many older HIV-infected patients also are taking medications to ameliorate discomfort (e.g., pain medications, sedatives) or to manage adverse effects of medications (e.g., anti-emetics). They also may self-medicate with over-the-counter medicines or supplements. In the HIV-negative population, polypharmacy is a major cause of iatrogenic problems inGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-32geriatric patients.16This may be the result of medication errors (by prescribers or patients), nonadherence, additive drug toxicities, and drug-drug interactions. Older HIV-infected patients probably are at an even greater risk of polypharmacy and its attendant adverse consequences than younger HIV-infected or similarlyaged HIV-uninfected patients. Drug-drug interactions are common with ART and easily can be overlooked by prescribers. 17The available drug interaction information on ARV agents is derived primarily from pharmacokinetic studies performed in a small number of relatively young, HIV-uninfected subjects with normal organ function (see Tables 14-16b ). Data from these studies provide clinicians with a basis to assess whether a significant interaction may exist.However, the magnitude of the interaction may be different in older HIV-infected patients than in youngerHIV-infected patients. Nonadherence is the most common cause of treatment failure. Complex dosing requirements, high pill burden, inability to access medications because of cost or availability, limited health literacy including lackof numeracy skills, misunderstanding of instructions, depression, and neurocognitive impairment are amongthe key reasons for nonadherence. 18Although many of these factors likely will be more prevalent in an aging HIV-infected population, some data suggest that older HIV-infected patients may be more adherent to ARTthan younger HIV-infected patients. 19-21Clinicians should assess adherence regularly to identify any factors, such as neurocognitive deficits, that may make adherence a challenge. One or more interventions such asdiscontinuation of unnecessary medications; regimen simplification; or use of adherence tools, includingpillboxes, daily calendars, and evidence-based behavioral approaches may be necessary to facilitatemedication adherence (see Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy ). Non-AIDS HIV-Related Complications and other Comorbidities With the reduction in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality observed with effective use of ART, non-AIDSconditions constitute an increasing proportion of serious illnesses in ART-treated HIV-infected populations. 22-24 Heart disease and cancer are the leading causes of death in older Americans.25Similarly, for HIV-infected patients on ART, non-AIDS events such as heart disease, liver disease, and cancer have emerged as majorcauses of morbidity and mortality. Neurocognitive impairment, already a major health problem in agingpatients, may be exacerbated by the effect of HIV infection on the brain. 26That the presence of multiple non- AIDS comorbidities coupled with the immunologic effects of HIV infection could add to the disease burden ofan aging HIV-infected person is a concern. 27-29At present, primary care recommendations are the same for HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adults and focus on identifying and managing risks of conditions such asheart, liver, and renal disease; cancer; and bone demineralization. 30-32 Discontinuing Antiretroviral Therapy in Older Patients Important issues to discuss with aging HIV-infected patients are living wills, advance directives, and long- term care planning including financial concerns. Health care cost sharing (e.g., co-pays, out-of-pocket costs), loss of employment, and other financial-related factors can cause interruptions in treatment. Clinic systems can minimize loss of treatment by helping patients maintain access to insurance. For the severely debilitated or terminally ill HIV-infected patient, adding palliative care medications, while perhaps beneficial, further increases the complexity and risk of negative drug interactions. For such patients, a balanced consideration of both the expected benefits of ART and the toxicities and negative quality-of-life effects of ART is needed. Few data exist on the use of ART in severely debilitated patients with chronic, severe, or non-AIDS terminal conditions.33-34Withdrawal of ART usually results in rebound viremia and a decline in CD4 cell count. AcuteGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents I-33retroviral syndrome after abrupt discontinuation of ART has been reported. In very debilitated patients, if there are no significant adverse reactions to ART, most clinicians would continue therapy. In cases whereART negatively affects quality of life, the decision to continue therapy should be made together with thepatient and/or family members after a discussion on the risks and benefits of continuing or withdrawing ART. Conclusion HIV infection may increase the risk of many major health conditions experienced by aging adults andpossibly accelerate the aging process. 35As HIV-infected adults age, their health problems become increasingly complex, placing additional demands on the health care system. This adds to the concern thatoutpatient clinics providing HIV care in the United States share the same financial problems as other chronicdisease and primary care clinics and that reimbursement for care is not sufficient to maintain care at asustainable level. 36Continued involvement of HIV experts in the care of older HIV-infected patients is warranted. However, given that the current shortage of primary care providers and geriatricians is projectedto continue, current HIV providers will need to adapt to the shifting need for expertise in geriatrics throughcontinuing education and ongoing assessment of the evolving health needs of aging HIV-infected patients. 37 The aging of the HIV-infected population also signals a need for more information on long-term safety andefficacy of ARV drugs in older patients.

Discontinuation of these drugs may potentially cause serious hepatocellular damage resulting from reactivation of HBV .8 Entecavir has activity against HIV; its use for HBV treatment without ART in patients with dual infection may result in the selection of the M184V mutation that confers HIV resistance to 3TC and FTC. Therefore, entecavir must be used in addition to a fully suppressive ARV regimen when used in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients (AII).9 3TC-resistant HBV is observed in approximately 40% of patients after 2 years on 3TC for chronic HBV and in approximately 90% of patients after 4 years when 3TC is used as the only active drug for HBV inPanel's Recommendations Prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), all patients who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) should be tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA using a quantitative assay to determine the level of HBV replication (AIII). Because emtricitabine (FTC), lamivudine (3TC), and tenofovir against both HIV and HBV, if HBV orHIV treatment is needed, ART should be initiated with the combination of TDF + FTC or TDF + 3TC as the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone of a fully suppressive antiretroviral (ARV) regimen (AI) . If HBV treatment is needed and TDF cannot safely be used, the alternative recommended HBV therapy is entecavir in addition to a fully suppressive ARV regimen (BI) . Other HBV treatment regimens include peginterferon alfa monotherapy or adefovir in combination with 3TC or FTC or telbivudine in addition to a fully suppressive ARV regimen (BII) . Entecavir has activity against HIV; its use for HBV treatment without ART in patients with dual infection may result in the selection of the M184V mutation that confers HIV resistance to 3TC and FTC. Therefore, entecavir must be usedin addition to a fully suppressive ARV regimen when used in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients (AII) . Discontinuation of agents with anti-HBV activity may cause serious hepatocellular damage resulting from reactivation of HBV; patients should be advised against self-discontinuation and carefully monitored duringinterruptions in HBV treatment (AII) . If ART needs to be modified due to HIV virologic failure and the patient has adequate HBV suppression, the ARV drugs active against HBV should be continued for HBV treatment in combination with other suitable ARV agents toachieve HIV suppression (AIII) . Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = Data from randomized controlled trials; II = Data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinionGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents J-2coinfected patients. Therefore, 3TC or FTC should be used in combination with other anti-HBV drugs (AII).10 Immune reconstitution after initiation of treatment for HIV and/or HBV can be associated with elevationin transaminases, possibly because HBV is primarily an immune-mediated disease. 11 Some ARV agents can cause increases in transaminase levels. The rate and magnitude of these increasesare higher with HBV coinfection. 12-13The etiology and consequences of these changes in liver function tests are unclear because continuation of ART may be accompanied by resolution of the changes.Nevertheless, some experts suspend the implicated agent(s) when the serum alanine transferase (ALT)level is increased to 5-10 times the upper limit of normal. However, in HIV/HBV-coinfected persons,increases in transaminase levels can herald hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion due to immunereconstitution, so the cause of the elevations should be investigated prior to the decision to discontinuemedications. In persons with transaminase increases, HBeAg seroconversion should be evaluated bytesting for HBeAg and anti-HBe as well as HBV DNA levels. Recommendations for HBV/HIV-Coinfected Patients All patients with chronic HBV should be advised to abstain from alcohol, assessed for immunity to hepatitis A virus (HA V) infection (anti-HA V antibody total) and vaccinated if nonimmune, advised onmethods to prevent HBV transmission (methods that do not differ from those to prevent HIVtransmission), and evaluated for the severity of HBV infection as outlined in the Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents .14 Prior to intiation of ART, all persons who test positive for HBsAg should be tested for HBV DNA using aquantitative assay to determine the level of HBV replication (AIII). Persons with chronic HBV infectionalready receiving ART active against HBV should undergo quantitative HBV DNA testing every 6-12months to determine the effectiveness of therapy in suppressing HBV replication. The goal of HBVtherapy with NRTIs is to prevent liver disease complications by sustained suppression of HBVreplication to the lowest achievable level. If not yet on therapy and HBV or HIV treatment is needed: In persons without HIV infection, the recommended anti-HBV drugs for the treatment of persons naive to HBV therapy are TDF andentecavir. 15-16In HIV-infected patients, however, only TDF can be considered part of the ARV regimen; entecavir has weak anti-HIV activity and must not be considered part of an ARV regimen. In addition,only TDF is fully active for the treatment of persons with known or suspected 3TC-resistant HBVinfection. To avoid selection of HBV-resistant variants, when possible, these agents should not be used asthe only agent with anti-HBV activity in an ARV regimen (AIII). Preferred regimen. The combination of TDF + FTC or TDF + 3TC should be used as the NRTI backbone of a fully suppressive ARV regimen and for the treatment of HBV infection (AII). 17-19 Alternative regimens. If TDF cannot safely be used, entecavir should be used in addition to a fully suppressive ARV regimen (AII); importantly, entecavir should not be considered to be a part of the ARV regimen20(BII). Due to a partially overlapping HBV-resistance pathway, it is not known if the combination of entectavir + 3TC or FTC will provide additional virologic or clinical benefit compared with entecavir alone. In persons with known or suspected 3TC-resistant HBV infection, the entecavir dose should be increased from 0.5 mg/day to 1 mg/day. However, entecavir resistance may emerge rapidly in patients with 3TC-resistant HBV infection. Therefore, entecavir should be used with caution in such patients with frequent monitoring (~ every 3 months) of the HBV DNA level to detect viral breakthrough. Other HBV treatment regimens include peginterferon alfa monotherapy or adefovir in combination with 3TC or FTC or telbivudine in addition to a fully suppressive ARV regimen;17, 21-22however, data on these regimens in persons with HIV/HBV coinfection are limited (BII). Due to safety concerns, peginterferon alfa should not be used inGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents J-3HIV/HBV-coinfected persons with cirrhosis. Need to discontinue medications active against HBV: The patient's clinical course should be monitored with frequent liver function tests. The use of adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, or telbivudine to prevent flares, especially in patients with marginal hepatic reserve such as persons with compensated ordecompensated cirrhosis, can be considered. 8These alternative HBV regimens should only be used in addition to a fully suppressive ARV regimen. Need to change ART because of HIV resistance: If the patient has adequate HBV suppression, the ARV drugs active against HBV should be continued for HBV treatment in combination with othersuitable ARV agents to achieve HIV suppression (AIII).

Although ART appears to slow the rate of HCV disease progression in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, several studieshave demonstrated that the rate continues to exceed that observed in those without HIV infection. 7, 8Whether HCV infection accelerates HIV progression, as measured by AIDS-related opportunistic infections (OIs) ordeath, 9is unclear. If such an increased risk of HIV progression exists, it may reflect the impact of injection drug use, which is strongly linked to HCV infection.10,11The increased frequency of antiretroviral (ARV)- associated hepatotoxicity with chronic HCV infection also complicates HIV treatment.12, 13 A combination regimen of peginterferon and ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) has been the mainstay of treatment forHCV infection. In HCV genotype 1-infected patients inhibitor (PI) boceprevir or telaprevir to the rate of sustained virologic response (SVR). 14, 15Clinical trials of these HCV PIs in combination with PegIFN/RBV for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection in HIV-infected patients are currently under way. Both boceprevir and telaprevir are substrates and boceprevir is also metabolized by aldo-keto reductase. These drugs have significant interactions with certain ARV drugs that are metabolized by the same pathways. As such, the presence of HCV infection and the treatment of HCV may influence HIV treatment as discussed below. Assessment of HIV/Hepatitis C Virus Coinfection Before Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy All HIV-infected patients should be screened for HCV infection using sensitive immunoassays licensed for detection of antibody to HCV in blood.16HCV-seronegative patients at risk for the acquistion of HCVKey Considerations When Managing Patients Coinfected with HIV and Hepatitis C Virus All HIV-infected patients should be screened for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, preferably before starting antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART may slow the progression of liver disease by preserving or restoring immune function and reducing HIV-related immune activation and inflammation. For most HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, including those with cirrhosis, the benefits of ART outweigh concerns regarding drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Therefore, ART should be consideredfor HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, regardless of CD4 count (BII) . Initial ART combination regimens for most HIV/HCV-coinfected patients are the same as those for individuals without HCV infection. However, when treatment for both HIV and HCV is indicated, consideration of potential drug-druginteractions and overlapping toxicities should guide ART regimen selection or modification (see discussion in the text). Combined treatment of HIV and HCV can be complicated by large pill burden, drug interactions, and overlapping toxicities. Although ART should be initiated for most HIV/HCV-coinfected patients regardless of CD4 cell count, in ART-naive patients with CD4 counts >500 cells/mm 3some clinicians may choose to defer ART until completion of HCV treatment. In patients with lower CD4 counts (e.g., <200 cells/mm3), it may be preferable to initiate ART and delay HCV therapy until CD4 counts increase as a result of ART. Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = Data from randomized controlled trials; II = Data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinionGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents J-6infection should undergo repeat testing annually. HCV-seropositive patients should be tested for HCV RNA using a qualitative or quantitative assay to confirm the presence of active infection.17 Patients with HIV/HCV coinfection should be counseled to avoid consuming alcohol and to useappropriate precautions to prevent transmission of HIV and/or HCV to others. HIV/HCV-coinfectedpatients who are susceptible to hepatitis A virus (HA V) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection should bevaccinated against these viruses. All patients with HIV/HCV coinfection should be evaluated for HCV therapy. HCV treatment is recommended according to standard guidelines. 18, 19Strong preference should be given to commence HCV treatment in patients with higher CD4 counts. For patients with lower CD4 counts (e.g., <200cells/mm 3), it may be preferable to initiate ART and delay HCV therapy until CD4 counts increase as a result of HIV treatment.17, 20-22 Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV/Hepatitis C Virus Coinfection When to start antiretroviral therapy : The rate of liver disease (liver fibrosis) progression is accelerated in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, particularly in individuals with low CD4 counts (350 cells/mm3). Data largely from retrospective cohort studies are inconsistent regarding the effect of ART on the naturalhistory of HCV disease. 6, 23, 24However, ART may slow the progression of liver disease by preserving or restoring immune function and reducing HIV-related immune activation and inflammation.25-27Thus, for most coinfected patients, including those with high CD4 counts and those with cirrhosis, the benefits ofART outweigh concerns regarding DILI. Therefore, ART should be initiated for most HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, regardless of CD4 count (BII). However, in HIV treatment-naive patients with CD4counts >500 cells/mm 3, some clinicians may choose to defer ART until completion of HCV treatment. What antiretroviral to start and what antiretroviral not to use : Initial ARV combination regimens for most HIV treatment-naive patients with HCV are the same as those for patients without HCV infection.Special considerations for ARV selection in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients include: When both HIV and HCV treatments are indicated, the choice of ARV regimen should be guided by the HCV treatment regimen selected with careful consideration of potential drug-drug interactionsand overlapping toxicities (as discussed below). Cirrhotic patients should be carefully assessed for signs of liver decompensation according to the Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification system because hepatically metabolized ARV drugs may requiredose modification or avoidance in patients with Child-Pugh class B and C disease. (See Appendix B, Table 7 .) Hepatotoxicity : DILI following initiation of ART is more common in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients than in those with HIV monoinfection. The greatest risk of DILI may be observed in coinfected individualswith advanced liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease). 28Eradication of HCV infection with treatment may decrease the likelihood of ARV-associated DILI.29 Given the substantial heterogeneity in patient populations and drug regimens, comparison of DILI incidence rates for individual ARV agents across clinical trials is difficult. In such studies, the highest incidence rates of significant elevations in liver enzyme levels (>5 times the upper limit of the laboratory reference range) have been observed during therapy with ARV drugs that are no longer commonly used in clinical practice, including stavudine (d4T) (with (RTV) (600 mg twice daily).30Additionally, certain ARV agents should be avoided if possible because they have been associated with higher incidence of serious liver-associated adverse effects, such as fatty liver disease with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) such as d4T, ddI, or zidovudine (ZDV);31noncirrhotic hypertension associated with ddI;32and hepatotoxicity associated with RTV-boosted tipranavir.33Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents J-7 Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored at 1 month after initiation of ART and then every 3 to 6 months. Mild to moderate fluctuations in ALT and/or AST are typical in individuals with chronic HCV infection. In the absence of signs and/orsymptoms of liver disease these fluctuations do not require interruption of ART. Significant ALTand/or AST elevation should prompt careful evaluation for signs and symptoms of liver insufficiencyand for alternative causes of liver injury (e.g., acute HA V or HBV infection, hepatobiliary disease, oralcoholic hepatitis); short-term interruption of the ART regimen or of the specific drug suspected tobe responsible for the DILI may be required. 34 Treating Both HIV and Hepatitis C Virus Infection Concurrent treatment of HIV and HCV is feasible but may be complicated by high pill burden, druginteractions, and overlapping drug toxicities. In this context, the decision to treat chronic HCV should alsoinclude consideration of the medical need for such treatment on the basis of an assessment of HCV diseasestage. Some clinicians may choose to defer HCV therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with no orminimal liver fibrosis. If treatment with PegIFN/RBV alone or in combination with one of the HCV NS3/4APIs (boceprevir or telaprevir) is initiated, the ART regimen may need to be modified to reduce the potentialfor drug interactions and/or toxicities that may develop during the period of concurrent HIV and HCVtreatment. Considerations for using certain nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and hepatitis C virus treatments: ddI should not be given with RBV because of the potential for drug-drug interactions leading to life- threatening use of ZDV and RBV is associated with increased rates of anemia, making RBV dosereduction necessary. Therefore, this combination should be avoided when possible. 36Because the risk of anemia may further increase when boceprevir or telaprevir is combined with PegIFN/RBV , ZDV shouldnot be given with this combination (AIII). Abacavir (ABC) has been associated with decreased response to PegIFN/RBV in some, but not all, retrospective studies; current evidence is insufficient to recommend avoiding this combination. 37-39 Considerations for the use of HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors (boceprevir or telaprevir) and antiretroviral is approved for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection in patients without HIV infection. After 4 weeks of PegIFN/RBV therapy, boceprevir is added to the regimen for 24, 32, or 44 additional weeks of HCV therapy. Data on the use of an HCV regimen containing boceprevir together with ART in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals are limited. In 1 small study of coinfected patients, higher HCV response was observed with boceprevir plus PegIFN/RBV (64 patients) than with PegIFN/RBV alone (34 patients). In this study, patients received ART that included HIV-1 ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r), darunavir Boceprevir is primarily metabolized by aldo-keto reductase, but because the drug is also a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 and p-gp enzymes, it may interact with ARVs metabolized by these pathways. Based on drug interaction studies in healthy volunteers, boceprevir can be co-administered with RAL.41 (EFV) is not recommended because of bidirectional drug interactions (see Table 15a and 15b ).42, 43Importantly, the pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions of HIV PIs with boceprevir were not identified before the approval of boceprevir and before participant enrollment in the HIV/HCV-coinfection trial; consequently, someGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents J-8coinfected patients have received HIV PIs and boceprevir during HCV treatment. Patients who are currently receiving these drug combinations should be advised not to stop any medication untilcontacting their health care providers. If therapy with HIV PIs and boceprevir is continued, patientsshould be closely monitored for HIV and HCV responses and consideration should be given to switchingthe HIV PI or EFV to RAL during boceprevir therapy. Additional clinical trial data are needed todetermine if other ARVs may be co-administered with boceprevir. Telaprevir is approved for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection in patients without HIV infection. Telaprevir is administered in combination with PegIFN/RBV for the initial 12 weeks of HCV therapyfollowed by 12 or 36 weeks of additional treatment with PegIFN/RBV . Data on the use of this regimen inHIV/HCV-coinfected individuals are limited. In 1 small study of coinfected patients, higher HCVresponse was observed with telaprevir plus PegIFN/RBV (38 patients) than with PegIFN/RBV alone (22patients). In this study, patients received ART containing EFV or ATV/r plus tenofovir/emtricitabine(TDF/FTC) or no ART during the HCV therapy. 44 Because telaprevir is a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and p-gp enzymes, the drug may interact with ARVs metabolized by these pathways. On the basis of drug interaction studies in healthy volunteers and dataon responses in coinfected patients enrolled in the small clinical trial noted above, telaprevir can be co-administered with ATV/r 45and RAL46at the standard recommended dose of telaprevir (750 mg every 7-9 hours) and with EFV at an increased dose of telaprevir (1125 mg every 7-9 hours) (see Table of 45Data on PK interactions of with other ARVs including non-nucleoside reverse inhibitors notavailable; therefore, co-administration of telaprevir with other ARVs cannot be recommended. Following are preliminary recommendations for the use of boceprevir or telaprevir in HIV patientscoinfected with HCV genotype 1 based on current ART use. These recommendations may be modifiedas new drug interaction and clinical trial information become available. Patients not on ART: Use either boceprevir or telaprevir Patients receiving RAL + 2-NRTI: Use either boceprevir or telaprevirPatients receiving ATV/r + 2-NRTI: Use telaprevir at standard dose. Do not use boceprevir.Patients receiving EFV + 2-NRTI: Use telaprevir at increased dose of 1125 mg every 7-9 hours. Do not use boceprevir. Patients receiving other ARV regimens: If HCV disease is minimal (i.e., no or mild portal fibrosis), consider deferring HCV treatment given rapidly evolving HCV drug development. If good prognostic factors for HCV treatment response are present\u2014IL28B CC genotype or low HCV RNA level [IU]/mL)\u2014consider use of PegIFN/RBV without HCV NS3/4A PI. On the basis of ART history and HIV genotype testing results, if possible, consider switching to the ART regimens listed above to permit the use of boceprevir or telaprevir. For patients with complex ART history or resistance to multiple classes of ART, consultation with experts regarding the optimal strategy to minimize the risk of HIV breakthrough may be needed. In such patients, telaprevir may be the preferred HCV NS3/4A PI because its duration of use (12 weeks) is shorter than that of boceprevir (24 to 44 weeks). Summary: In summary, HCV coinfection and use of PegIFN/RBV with or without HCV NS3/4A PIs (telaprevir or boceprevir) to treat HCV may impact the treatment of HIV because of increased pill burden, toxicities, andGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents J-9drug-drug interactions. Because ART may slow the progression of HCV-related liver disease, ART should be considered for most HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, regardless of CD4 count. If treatment with PegIFN/RBValone or in combination with one of the HCV NS3/4A PIs (telaprevir or boceprevir) is initiated, the ARTregimen may need to be modified to reduce the potential for drug-drug interactions and/or drug toxicities thatmay develop during the period of concurrent HIV and HCV treatment. The science of HCV drugdevelopment is evolving rapidly. As new clinical trial data on the management of HIV/HCV-coinfectedpatients with newer HCV drugs become available, the Panel will modify its recommendations accordingly. References 1. Alter MJ, et al.

The CD4 cell count influences both the frequency and severity of active TB disease.1-2Active TB also negatively affectsPanel's Recommendations The principles for treatment of active tuberculosis (TB) disease in HIV-infected patients are the same as those for HIV-uninfected patients (AI) . All HIV-infected patients with diagnosed active TB should be started on TB treatment immediately (AI) . All HIV-infected patients with diagnosed active TB should be treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) (AI) . In patients with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3, ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of starting TB treatment (AI) . In patients with CD4 counts 50 cells/mm3who present with clinical disease of major severity as indicated by clinical evaluation (including low Karnofsky score, low body mass index [BMI], low hemoglobin, low albumin, organ system dysfunction, or extent of disease), ART should be initiated within 2 to 4 weeks of starting TB treatment. Thestrength of this recommendation varies on the basis of CD4 cell count: CD4 count 50 to 200 cells/mm3(BIII) In patients with CD4 counts 50 cells/mm3who do not have severe clinical disease, ART can be delayed beyond 2 to 4 weeks of starting TB therapy but should be started within 8 to 12 weeks of TB therapy initiation. The strength ofthis recommendation also varies on the basis of CD4 cell count: CD4 count 50 to count cells/mm3(BIII) In all HIV-infected pregnant women with active TB, ART should be started as early as feasible, both for maternal health and for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV (AIII) . In (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB, ART should be initiated within 2 to 4 weeks of confirmation of TB drug resistance and initiation of second-line TB therapy (BIII). Despite pharmacokinetic drug interactions, a or rifabutin) should be included in TB regimens for patients receiving ART, with dosage adjustment if necessary (AII) . Rifabutin is the preferred rifamycin to use in HIV-infected patients with active TB disease on a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen because the risk of substantial drug interactions with PIs is lower with rifabutin than withrifampin (AII) . Co-administration of rifampin and PIs (with or without ritonavir [RTV] boosting) is not recommended (AII) . Rifapentine (RPT) is NOT recommended in HIV-infected patients receiving ART for treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) or active TB, unless in the context of a clinical trial (AIII) . Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) may occur after initiation of ART. Both ART and TB treatment should be continued while managing IRIS (AIII) . Treatment support, which can include directly observed therapy (DOT) of TB treatment, is strongly recommended for HIV-infected patients with active TB disease (AII) . Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional Rating of Evidence: I = Data from randomized controlled trials; II = Data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinionGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents J-13HIV disease. It may be associated with a higher HIV viral load and more rapid progression of HIV disease.3 Active pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB disease requires prompt initiation of TB treatment. The treatment of active TB disease in HIV-infected patients should follow the general principles guiding treatment forindividuals without HIV (AI). Treatment of drug-susceptible TB disease should include a standard regimenthat consists of isoniazid (INH) + a rifamycin (rifampin or rifabutin) + pyrazinamide + ethambutol given for2 months, followed by INH + a rifamycin for 4 to 7 months. 4The Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents4include a more complete discussion of the diagnosis and treatment of TB disease in HIV-infected patients. All patients with HIV/TB disease should be treated with ART (AI). Important issues related to the use of ART in patients with active TB disease include: (1) when to start ART, (2) significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between rifamycins and some antiretroviral (ARV) agents, (3) the additive toxicitiesassociated with concomitant ARV and TB drug use, (4) the development of TB-associated IRIS after ARTinitiation, and (5) the need for treatment support including DOT and the integration of HIV and TB care andtreatment. Antiretroviral Therapy in Patients with Active Tuberculosis Patients Diagnosed with Tuberculosis While Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy When TB is diagnosed in a patient receiving ART, the patient's ARV regimen should be assessed with particular attention to potential pharmacokinetic interactions with rifamycins (discussed below). Thepatient's regimen may need to be modified to permit use of the optimal TB treatment regimen (see Tables 14-16 for dosing recommendations). Patients Not Yet Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy Until recently, when to start ART in patients with active TB has been a subject of debate. Survival isimproved when ART is started early following initiation of TB therapy, but a delay in initiating ART oftenwas favored because of the potential complications of high pill burden, additive toxicities, drug interactions,adherence, and the potential for development of IRIS.Recent studies primarily conducted in resource-limitedsettings, including three randomized controlled trials, have helped clarify the question of when to start ARTin patients with active TB. 5-8 The SAPiT study conducted in South Africa convincingly demonstrated that starting ART during rather thanafter concluding treatment for TB can significantly reduce mortality. In this study, ambulatory HIV-infectedpatients smear-positive TB and CD4 counts to one of three treatment arms: integrated therapy with ART initiated either during the first 4 weeks of TB therapy or after the first 8 weeks of TB treatment (i.e., during the continuation phase of TB therapy) or sequential therapy with ART initiated after the conclusion of standard TB therapy. The median CD4 cell count of participants at study entry was 150 cells/mm3. The sequential therapy arm was stopped when an early analysis demonstrated that the mortality rate in the combined two integrated arms was 56% lower than the rate in the sequential therapy arm. Treatment was continued in the two integrated arms until study completion.5 With the completion of SAPiT and 2 other randomized controlled trials, CAMELIA and STRIDE, the question on the optimal time to initiate ART during TB therapy has been addressed. Findings from these trials now serve as the basis for the Panel's recommendations on when to start ART in patients with active TB. In the final analysis of the SAPiT trial, there were no differences in rates of AIDS or death between the 2 integrated arms of the study (patients who started ART within 4 weeks after initiating TB treatment vs. those who started ART at 8-12 weeks [i.e., within 4 weeks after completing the intensive phase of TB treatment]).Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents J-14However, in patients with baseline CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3(17% of the study population), the rate of AIDS or death was lower in the earlier therapy group than in the later therapy group (8.5 vs. 26.3 cases per 100 person-years, a strong trend favoring the earlier treatment arm, P = 0.06). For all patients, regardless of CD4 cell count, earlier therapy was associated with a higher incidence of IRIS and of adverse events that required aswitch in ARV drugs than later therapy. Two deaths were attributed to IRIS. 6 In the CAMELIA study, which was conducted in Cambodia7, patients who had CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3 were randomized to initiate ART at 2 weeks or 8 weeks after initiation of TB treatment. Study participants hadadvanced HIV disease, with a median entry CD4 count of 25 cells/mm 3; low BMIs (median = 16.8 kg/m2), Karnofsky scores (87% <70), and hemoglobin levels (median = 8.7 g/dl); and high rates of disseminated TBdisease. Compared with therapy initiated at 8 weeks, ART initiated at 2 weeks resulted in a 38% reduction inmortality (P = 0.006). A significant reduction in mortality was seen in patients with CD4 counts 50 cells/mm 3 and in patients with CD4 counts 51 to 200 cells/mm3. Overall, 6 deaths associated with TB-IRIS were reported. The ACTG 5221 (STRIDE) trial, a multinational study conducted at 28 sites, randomized ART-naive patientswith confirmed or earlier (<2 weeks) ART.8At study entry, the participants' median CD4 count was 77 cells/mm3. The rates of mortality and AIDS diagnoses were not different between the earlier and later arms, although higher rates of IRIS were seen in theearlier arm. However, a significant reduction in AIDS or death was seen in the subset of patients with CD4counts <50 cells/mm 3who were randomized to the earlier ART arm (P = 0.02). In each of these 3 studies, IRIS was more common in patients initiating ART earlier than in patients startingART later, but the syndrome was infrequently associated with mortality. Collectively these 3 trials demonstratethat in patients with active TB and with very low CD4 cell counts (i.e., <50 cells/mm 3), early initiation of ART can reduce mortality and AIDS progression, albeit at the risk of increased IRIS. These findings strongly favorinitiation of ART within the first 2 weeks of TB treatment in patients with CD4 cell counts <50 cells/mm 3(AI). The question of when to start ART in patients with CD4 counts 50 cells/mm3is also informed by these studies. The STRIDE and SAPiT studies\u2014in which the patients with CD4 cell counts 50 cells/mm3were relatively healthy and with reasonable Karnofsky scores (note the SAPiT study excluded patients withKarnofsky scores <70) and BMIs\u2014demonstrated that ART initiation in these patients can be delayed until 8to 12 weeks after initiation of TB therapy (AI for However, the CAMELIA study, which included more patients who were severely ill than the STRIDE andSAPiT studies, showed that early initiation of ART improved survival both in patients with CD4 counts 50cells/mm 3and in patients with CD4 counts from 51 to 200 cells/mm3. In a multivariate analysis, age >40 years, (<40), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level (>1.25 x the upper limit of normal [ULN]), disseminated and MDR TB were independently associated with poor survival; whereas in a univariate analysis, hemoglobin <10g/dl also was associated with poor survival. Thus, recently published results from the three clinical trials are complementary in defining the need for ART and use of CD4 count and clinical status to inform decisions on the optimal time to initiate ART in patients with HIV and TB disease. Earlier initiation of ART within 2 to 4 weeks of TB treatment should be strongly considered for patients with CD4 cell counts from 50 to 200 cells/mm3who have evidence of clinical disease of major severity as indicated by clinical evaluation, low Karnofsky score, low BMI, low hemoglobin, low albumin, or organ system dysfunction (BI). Initiation of ART within 2 to 4 weeks also should be considered for patients with CD4 counts >200 cells/mm3who present with evidence of severe disease (BIII). Of additional importance, each of the above studies demonstrated excellent responses to ART, with 90% and >95% of participants achieving suppressed viremia (HIV RNA <400 copies/mL) at 12 months in the SAPiTGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents J-15and CAMELIA studies, respectively, and 74% of participants at 2 years in the STRIDE study. Mortality rates in patients with MDR or XDR TB and HIV coinfection are very high.9Retrospective case control studies and case series provide growing evidence of better outcomes associated with receipt of ART in such coinfected patients,10but the optimal timing for initiation of ART is unknown. However, given the high rates and rapid mortality, most experts recommend that ART be initiated within 2 to 4 weeks after confirmation of thediagnosis of drug resistance and initiation of second-line TB therapy (BIII). All HIV-infected pregnant women with active TB should be started on ART as early as feasible, both formaternal health and to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV (AIII). The choice of ART should be based onefficacy and safety in pregnancy and take into account potential drug-drug interactions between ARVs andrifamycins (see Perinatal Guidelines for more detailed discussions).11 TB meningitis often is associated with severe complications and high mortality rate. In a randomized studyconducted in Vietnam, patients were randomized to immediate ART or to therapy deferred until 2 monthsafter initiation of TB treatment. A higher rate of severe (Grade 4) adverse events was seen in patients whoreceived immediate ART than in those who deferred therapy (80.3% vs. 69.1%, respectively; P = 0.04). 12In this study 59.8% of the immediate ART patients and 55.5% of the delayed ART patients died within 9months. However, in the United States, where patients may be more closely monitored and treated for severeadverse events such as central nervous system (CNS) IRIS, many experts feel that ART should be initiated asfor other HIV/TB-coinfected patients (CIII). Drug Interaction Considerations A rifamycin is a crucial component in treatment of drug-sensitive TB. However, both rifampin and rifabutinare gluconyltransferase (UGT) 1A1enzymes and are associated with significant interactions with most ARV agents including all PIs, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), isa potent enzyme inducer, leading to accelerated drug clearance and significant reduction in ARV drugexposure. Despite these interactions, some observational studies suggest that good virologic, immunologic,and clinical outcomes may be achieved with standard doses of efavirenz (EFV) 13-14and, to a lesser extent, nevirapine (NVP)15-16when combined with rifampin. However, rifampin is not recommended in combination with all PIs and the NNRTIs etravirine (ETR) and rilpivirine (RPV). When rifampin is used with MVC orRAL, increased dosage of the ARV is generally recommended. Rifabutin, a weaker enzyme inducer, is analternative to rifampin. Because rifabutin is a substrate of the CYP 450 enzyme system, its metabolism maybe affected by the NNRTI or PI. Tables 14, 15a, 15b, 15d, and 15e outline the magnitude of these interactions and provide dosing recommendations when rifamycins and selected ARV drugs are used concomitantly. After determining the drugs and doses to use, clinicians should monitor patients closely to assure good control of both TB and HIV infections. Suboptimal HIV suppression or suboptimal response to TB treatment should prompt assessment of drug adherence, subtherapeutic drug levels (consider therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM]), and acquired drug resistance. Rifapentine is a long-acting rifamycin that can be given once weekly with INH for the treatment of active or latent TB infection. Similar to rifampin and rifabutin, rifapentine is also a CYP3A4 inducer. No systematic study has been performed to assess the magnitude of the enzyme induction effect of rifapentine on the metabolism of ARV drugs and other concomitant drugs. Significant enzyme induction can result in reduced ARV drug exposure, which may compromise virologic efficacy. Rifapentine is not recommended for treatment of latent or active TB infection in patients receiving ART, unless given in the context of a clinical trial (AIII). Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents J-16Anti-Tuberculosis/Antiretroviral Drug Toxicities ARV agents and TB drugs, particularly INH, rifamycin, and pyrazinamide, can cause drug-induced hepatitis. These first-line TB drugs should be used for treatment of active TB disease, even with co-administration ofother potentially hepatotoxic drugs or when baseline liver disease is present (AIII). Patients receivingpotentially hepatotoxic drugs should be monitored frequently for clinical symptoms and signs of hepatitis andhave laboratory monitoring for hepatotoxicity. Peripheral neuropathy can occur with administration of INH,didanosine (ddI), or stavudine (d4T) or may be a manifestation of HIV infection. All patients receiving INHalso should receive supplemental pyridoxine to reduce peripheral neuropathy. Patients should be monitoredclosely for signs of drug-related toxicities and receive alternative ARVs to ddI or d4T. Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome with Tuberculosis and Antiretroviral Agents IRIS occurs in two forms: unmasking and paradoxical. The mechanism of the syndrome is the same for both forms: restoration of immune competence by administration of ART, resulting in an exuberant host response toTB bacilli and/or antigens. Unmasking IRIS refers to the initial clinical manifestations of active TB that occurssoon after ART is started. Paradoxical IRIS refers to the worsening of TB clinical symptoms after ART is startedin patients who are receiving TB treatment. Severity of IRIS ranges from mild to severe to life threatening. IRIShas been reported in 8% to more than 40% of patients starting ART after TB is diagnosed, although theincidence depends on the definition of IRIS and the intensity of monitoring. 17-18 Predictors of IRIS include severity of TB disease, especially high pathogen burden; and less than 30-dayinterval between initiation of TB and HIV treatments. 19-22Most IRIS in HIV/TB disease occurs within 3 months of the start of TB treatment. Delaying initiation of ART for 2 to 8 weeks may reduce the incidenceand severity of IRIS. However, this possible advantage of delayed ART must be weighed against thepotential benefit of earlier ART in improving immune function and preventing progression of HIV diseaseand mortality. Patients with mild or moderately severe IRIS can be managed symptomatically or treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Patients with more severe IRIS can be treated successfully with corticosteroids. Arecent randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated benefit of corticosteroids in the management ofIRIS symptoms (as measured by decreasing days of hospitalization and Karnofsky performance score)without adverse consequences. 23In the presence of IRIS, neither TB therapy nor ART should be stopped because both therapies are necessary for the long-term health of the patient (AIII). Immune Reconstitution with Antiretroviral Therapy: Conversion to Positive Tuberculin Skin Test and Interferon-Gamma Release Assay Immune reconstitution with ART may result in unmasking LTBI (i.e., conversion of a previously negative tuberculin skin test [TST] to a positive TST or interferon-gamma [IFN-] assay [IGRA] for Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific proteins). A positive IGRA, similar to a positive TST, is indicative of LTBI in the absence of evidence of active TB disease.24Because treatment for LTBI is indicated in the absence of evidence of active TB disease, clinicians should be aware of this phenomenon. Patients with a negative TST or IGRA and advanced HIV disease (i.e., CD4 count <200 cells/mm3) should have a repeat TST or IGRA after initiation of ART and CD4 count increase to >200 cells/mm3(BII).25Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents J-17Caring for Patients with HIV and Tuberculosis Close collaboration among clinicians, health care institutions, and public health programs involved in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-infected patients with active TB disease is necessary in order to integratecare and improve medication adherence and TB treatment completion rates, reduce drug toxicities, andmaximize HIV outcomes. HIV-infected patients with active TB disease should receive treatment support,including adherence counseling and DOT, corresponding to their needs (AII). ART simplification or use ofcoformulated fixed-dose combinations also may help to improve drug adherence. References 1. Jones BE, Young SM, Antoniskis D, Davidson PT, Kramer F, Barnes PF.

Although newer regimens include more fixed-dose combinationproducts and offer once-daily dosing, adherence remains a challenge. Because HIV treatment is a lifelongendeavor, and because many patients will initiate therapy when they are generally in good health, feel well,and demonstrate no obvious signs or symptoms of HIV disease, adherence poses a special challenge andrequires commitment from the patient and the health care team. Adherence remains a challenging and complicated topic. This section provides clinicians with some guidance in their approaches to assist patients in maintaining adherence. Factors Associated with Nonadherence Adherence to ART can be influenced by characteristics of the patient, the regimen, the clinical setting, andthe provider/patient relationship. 3To assure adherence, it is critical that the patient receive and understand information about HIV disease, the goal of therapy, and the specific regimen prescribed. A number of factorshave been associated with poor adherence, including the following: low levels of health literacy 4or numeracy (ability to understand numerical-related health information);5 certain age-related (e.g., polypharmacy, vision loss, cognitive impairment)6; younger age; psychosocial issues (e.g., depression, homelessness, low social support, stressful life events, or psychosis);7 nondisclosure of HIV serostatus8 neurocognitive issues (e.g., cognitive impairment, dementia) active (but not history of) substance abuse, particularly for patients who have experienced recent relapse; stigma9; difficulty with taking medication (e.g., trouble swallowing pills, daily schedule issues); complex regimens (e.g., high pill burden, high-frequency dosing, food requirements); adverse drug effects; nonadherence to clinic appointments10 cost and insurance coverage issues; and treatment fatigue. Adherence studies conducted in the early era of combination ART with unboosted protease inhibitors (PIs) found that virologic failure is much less likely to occur in patients who adhere to more than 95% of their prescribed doses than in those who are less adherent.11More recent adherence studies were conducted using boosted PIs and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). These studies suggest that the longer half-lives of boosted PIs and efavirenz may make the drugs more forgiving of lapses in adherence.12-13 Nonetheless, clinicians should encourage patients to adhere as closely as possible to the prescribed doses and schedules for all ART regimens. Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents K-2Measurement of Adherence There is no gold standard for the assessment of adherence,1but there are many validated tools and strategies to choose from. Although patient self-report of adherence predictably overestimates adherence by as much as 20%,14this measure still is associated with viral load responses.15Thus, a patient's report of suboptimal adherence is a strong indicator of nonadherence and should be taken seriously. When ascertained in a simple, nonjudgmental, routine, and structured format that normalizes less-than- perfect adherence and minimizes socially desirable responses, patient self-report remains the most usefulmethod for the assessment and longitudinal monitoring of a patient's adherence in the clinical setting. Asurvey of all doses missed during the past 3 days or the past week accurately reflects longitudinal adherenceand is the most practical and readily available tool for adherence assessments in clinical trials and in clinicalpractice. 1Other strategies also may be effective. One study found that asking patients to rate their adherence on a six-point scale during 1 month was more accurate than asking them about the frequency of missed dosesor to estimate the percentage of doses taken during the previous 3 or 7 days. 16Pharmacy records and pill counts also can be used in addition to simply asking the patient about adherence.17Other methods of assessing adherence include the use of electronic measurement devices (e.g., bottle caps, dispensingsystems). However, these methods may not be feasible in some clinical settings. Interventions to Improve Adherence Before writing the first prescriptions, the clinician should assess the patient's readiness to take medication,including information such as factors that may limit adherence (psychiatric illness, active drug use, etc.) andmake additional support necessary; the patient's understanding of the disease and the regimen; and thepatient's social support, housing, work and home situation, and daily schedules. During the past several years, a number of advances have simplified many regimens dramatically, particularly those for treatment-naive patients. Prescribing regimens that are simple to take, have a low pillburden and low-frequency dosing, have no food requirements, and have low incidence and severity ofadverse effects will facilitate adherence. 18The Panel considered both regimen simplicity and effectiveness when making current treatment recommendations (see What to Start ). Patients should understand that their first regimen usually offers the best chance for a simple regimen thataffords long-term treatment success and prevention of drug resistance. Given that effective response to ARTis dependent on good adherence, clinicians should identify barriers to adherence such as a patient's schedule,competing psychosocial needs, learning needs, and literacy level before treatment is initiated. As appropriate,resources and strategies that will help the patient to achieve and maintain good adherence should beemployed. Individualizing treatment with involvement of the patient in decision making is the cornerstone of any treatment plan. 17The first principle of successful treatment is negotiation of an understandable plan to which the patient can commit.19-20Establishing a trusting relationship over time and maintaining good communication will help to improve adherence and long-term outcomes. An increasing number of interventions have demonstrated efficacy in improving adherence to ART. A meta- analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials of ART adherence interventions found that intervention participants were 1.5 times as likely to report 95% adherence and 1.25 times as likely to achieve an undetectable viral load as participants in comparison conditions.21 In a more recent synthesis, CDC provides new guidance to assist providers in selecting from among the many possible adherence interventions. According to efficacy criteria described by the CDC HIV/AIDS Prevention Research Synthesis (PRS) project, CDC has identified a subset of best-evidence medication adherence interventions. In December 2010, CDC published a new online Medication Adherence chapter ofGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents K-3the Compendium of Evidence-Based HIV Behavioral Interventions that includes eight medication adherence behavioral interventions identified from the scientific literature published or in press from January 1996through December 2009. For descriptions of the interventions, see: http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/ research/prs/ma-good-evidence-interventions.htm .22Since these reviews have been conducted, additional evidence also has accumulated regarding the efficacy and benefits of motivational interviewing.23 In summary, effective adherence interventions vary in their modality and duration, providing clinics,providers, and patients with options to suit a range of needs and settings. Some effective interventionsidentified include multiple nurse home visits, five-session group intervention, pager messaging, and couples-based interventions. Substance abuse therapy and strengthening social support also can improve adherence.All health care team members, including nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, medication managers, andsocial workers, have integral roles in successful adherence programs. 24-27Directly observed therapy (DOT) has been shown to be effective in provision of ART to active drug users.28However, the benefits cannot be sustained after transitioning the drug users out of the methadone clinics and halting the provision of ART byDOT. 29 To routinely determine whether such additional adherence intervention is warranted, assessments should bedone at each clinical encounter and should be the responsibility of the entire health care team. Routinemonitoring of HIV viral load and pharmacy records are useful determinants for the need of intensified efforts. Conclusion Significant progress has been made regarding determinants, measurements, and interventions to improveadherence to ART. Given the various assessment strategies and potential interventions available, thechallenge for the treatment team is to select the techniques that provide the best fit for the treatment setting,resources available, and patient population. The complexity and the importance of adherence encourageclinicians to continue to seek novel, patient-centered ways to improve adherence and to tailor adherenceinterventions. Early detection of nonadherence and prompt intervention can reduce greatly the developmentof viral resistance and the likelihood of virologic failure.

However, because most clinical trials have a relatively short follow-upduration, the longer term complications of ART can be underestimated. In the Swiss Cohort study, during 6years of follow-up, the presence of laboratory adverse events was associated with higher rates of mortality,which highlights the importance of adverse events in overall patient management. 2 Several factors may predispose individuals to adverse effects of ARV medications. For example, comparedwith men, women (especially ART-naive women with CD4 counts >250 cells/mm 3) seem to have a higher propensity to develop Stevens-Johnson syndrome, rashes, and hepatotoxicity from nevirapine (NVP)3-5and have acidosis due to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).6-8Other factors may also contribute to the development of adverse events: Concomitant use of medications with overlapping and additive toxicities; Comorbid conditions that may increase the risk of or exacerbate adverse effects (e.g., alcoholism9or coinfection with viral hepatitis10-12may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity); Drug-drug interactions that may lead to an increase in drug toxicities (e.g., interactions that result from concomitant use of statins with protease inhibitors [PIs]); or Genetic factors that predispose patients to abacavir (ABC) hypersensitivity reaction (HSR).13, 14 The therapeutic goals of ART include achieving and maintaining viral suppression and improving immune function, but an overarching goal should be to select a regimen that is not only effective but also safe. Thisrequires consideration of the toxicity potential of an ARV regimen, as well as the individual patient'sunderlying conditions, concomitant medications, and prior history of drug intolerances. In addition, it should be appreciated that, in general, the overall benefits of ART outweigh its risks and that some conditions (e.g., anemia, cardiovascular disease [CVD], renal impairment), may be more likely in theabsence of ART. 15, 16 Information on adverse events of ARVs is outlined in several tables in the guidelines. Table 13 provides clinicians with a list of the most common and/or severe known ARV-associated adverse events by drug class.The most common adverse effects of individual ARV agents are summarized in Appendix B, Tables 1-6 .

A thorough review of concomitant medications can help in designing aregimen that minimizes undesirable interactions. In addition, the potential for drug interactions should beassessed when any new drug (including over-the-counter agents), is added to an existing ARV combination.Most drug interactions with ARV drugs are mediated through inhibition or induction of hepatic drugmetabolism. 1The mechanisms of drug interactions with each ARV drug class are briefly summarized below. Tables 14-16c list significant drug interactions with different ARV agents and recommendations on contraindications, dose modifications, and alternative agents. Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) All NNRTIs are (ETR) is a substrate ofCYP2C9 and 2C19 enzymes. Concomitantly administered drugs that induce or inhibit these enzymes can alterNNRTI drug concentrations, resulting in virologic failure or adverse effects. All NNRTIs, except rilpivirine(RPV), induce or inhibit CYP isoenzymes. EFV acts a inducer NVP, itprimarily induces CYP3A also induces CYP3A but inhibits CYP2C9 and 2C19enzymes. The inducing effects of NNRTIs can result in sub-therapeutic concentrations of concomitantlyadministered drugs that are metabolized by CYP enzymes. Examples of such interacting medications includeazole antifungals, rifamycins, hepatitis methadone. See Table 15b for dosing recommendations. Protease Inhibitors (PIs) All PIs are metabolized in the liver by CYP3A isoenzymes; consequently their metabolic rates may bealtered in the presence of CYP inducers or inhibitors. Co-administration of PIs with ritonavir (RTV), a potentCYP3A inhibitor, intentionally increases PI exposure (see Pharmacokinetic Enhancing below). Co- administration of PIs with a potent CYP3A inducer may lead to suboptimal drug concentrations and reducedtherapeutic effects of the PI. These drug combinations should be avoided if alternative agents can be used. Ifthis is not possible, close monitoring of plasma HIV RNA, with or without ARV dosage adjustment andtherapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), may be warranted. For example, the rifamycins (i.e., rifampin and, to alesser extent, rifabutin) are CYP3A4 inducers that can significantly reduce plasma concentrations of mostPIs. 2, 3Rifabutin is a less potent CYP3A4 inducer than rifampin. Therefore, despite wider experience with rifampin use, rifabutin is generally considered a reasonable alternative to rifampin for the treatment of tuberculosis when used with a PI-based regimen.4, 5Table 15a lists dosage recommendations for concomitant use of rifamycins and other CYP3A4 inducers with PIs. Some PIs may also induce or inhibit CYP isoenzymes, P-glycoprotein, or other transporters in the gut and elsewhere. Tipranavir (TPV), for example, is a potent inducer of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. The net effect of ritonavir-boosted tipranavir (TPV/r) CYP3A in vivo, however, appears to be enzyme inhibition. Thus, concentrations of drugs that are substrates for only CYP3A are most likely to be increased if the drugs are given with TPV/r. The net effect of TPV/r on a drug that is a substrate of both CYP3A and P-glycoprotein (P- gp) cannot be confidently predicted. Significant decreases in saquinavir (SQV), amprenavir (APV), and lopinavir (LPV) concentrations have been observed in vivo when the PIs were given with TPV/r. The use of a CYP3A substrate that has a narrow margin of safety in the presence of a potent CYP3A inhibitor, such as the PIs, may lead to markedly prolonged elimination half-life (t1/2) and toxic drugGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents L-2accumulation. Avoidance of concomitant use or dose reduction of the affected drug, with close monitoring for dose-related toxicities, may be warranted. The list of drugs that may have significant interactions with PIs is extensive and is continuously expanding. Some examples of these drugs include lipid-lowering agents (e.g., statins), inhibitors. Herbal products, such as St. John's wort, can also causeinteractions that risk adverse clinical effects. See Table 15a for dosage recommendations. Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTIs) Raltegravir (RAL) is primarily mediated diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase cansignificantly reduce the concentration of RAL. 6See Table 15e for dosage recommendations. Raltegravir does not appear to affect CYP or UGT enzymes or P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Elvitegravir (EVG) is available only as a fixed dose combination with cobicistat (COBI), tenofovir (TDF), and emtricitabine (FTC). EVG is enzymes but also undergoesglucuronidation by UGT EVG exposure (see Pharmacokinetic Enhancing below). Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A enzymes can alter concentrations of EVG. The co-formulation of EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC should not be co-administered with other ARVs because of potential drug interactions that may alter drug levels of EVG,COBI, or the concomitant drug. Examples of interacting drugs include those listed above for NNRTIs andPIs. See Table 15e for dosage recommendations. Nucleoside theCYP metabolic pathway. Significant pharmacodynamic interactions of NRTIs and other drugs, such asadditive bone marrow suppressive effects of zidovudine (ZDV) and ganciclovir, have been reported.Pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions have also been reported; for example, atazanavir (ATV) concentration canbe reduced when it is co-administered with TDF. 7However, the mechanisms underlying some of these interactions are still unclear. Table 15c lists significant interactions with NRTIs. CCR5 Antagonist MVC is a substrate of CYP3A enzymes and P-glycoprotein. As a consequence, the concentrations of MVCcan be significantly increased in the presence of strong CYP3A inhibitors (such as RTV and other PIs, exceptfor TPV/r) and are reduced when MVC is used with CYP3A inducers (such as EFV or rifampin). Dose adjustment is necessary when MVC is used in combination with these agents (see Table 16b or Appendix B, Table 6 for dosage recommendations). MVC is neither an inducer nor an inhibitor of the CYP3A system and does not alter the PKs of the drugs evaluated in interaction studies to date. Fusion Inhibitor The fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (T20) is a 36-amino-acid peptide that does not enter human cells. It is expected to undergo catabolism to its constituent amino acids with subsequent recycling of the amino acids in the body pool. No clinically significant drug-drug interaction with T20 has been identified to date. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Enhancing PK enhancing is a strategy used in ARV treatment to increase the exposure of an ARV by concomitantly administering a drug that inhibits the specific drug metabolizing enzymes for which the ARV is a substrate.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents L-3Currently two agents are used in clinical practice as PK enhancers: RTV and COBI. RTV is an HIV PI that is primarily used in clinical practice at a lower than approved dose (100 to 400 mg per day) as a PK enhancer for other PIs because of its inhibitory effects on CYP450, predominately CYP3A4 andP-glycoprotein (P-gp). RTV increases the trough concentration (C min) and prolongs the half-life of the active PIs.8The higher Cminallows for a greater Cmin: inhibitory concentration ratio, which reduces the risk that drug resistance will develop as a result of suboptimal drug exposure. The longer half-life of the PI allows forless frequent dosing, which may enhance medication adherence. Because RTV is a potent inhibitor, it mayresult in complex drug-drug interactions when used with PIs and with other ARVs or non ARVs. Tables 15a and 16a-c list interactions between RTV-containing PI regimens and other medications, as well as comments on the clinical management of these interactions. COBI is a specific, potent CYP3A inhibitor that has a weak to no effect on other CYP450 isoforms. COBI hasno ARV activity. The high water solubility of COBI allows for its co-formulation with other agents. 9COBI is currently available only as part of a fixed dose combination of EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC. COBI is used to increasethe plasma concentrations of EVG, INSTI. Like RTV , COBI has a interaction profile.COBI also is an inhibitor of P-gp-mediated transport, which appears to be the mechanism by which COBIincreases the systemic exposure to TDF. Table 15e lists interactions with COBI identified in PK studies conducted to date, projected interactions, and drugs that should not be co-administered with COBI. When using RTV- or COBI-containing regimens, clinicians should be vigilant in assessing the potential foradverse drug-drug interactions. This is especially important when prescribing CYP3A substrates for whichno Piscitelli SC, Gallicano KD. Interactions among drugs for HIV and opportunistic infections.

Therefore an alternative agent to rifapentine is recommended. dA high rate of Grade 4 serum transaminase elevation was seen when a higher dose of RTV was added to LPV/r or SQV or when double-dose LPV/r was used with rifampin to compensate for rifampin's induction effect and therefore, these dosing strategies should not be used. eThe manufacturer of cisapride has a limited-access protocol for patients who meet specific clinical eligibility criteria. fUse of oral midazolam is contraindicated. Parenteral midazolam can be used with caution as a single dose and can be given in a monitored situation for procedural sedation.

Each patient encounter offers the clinician an opportunity toreinforce HIV prevention messages, but multiple studies show that prevention counseling is frequentlyneglected in clinical practice. 4-5Although delivering effective prevention interventions in a busy practice setting may be challenging, clinicians should be aware that patients often look to their providers formessages about HIV prevention. Multiple approaches to prevention counseling are available, includingformal guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for incorporating HIVprevention into medical care settings. Such interventions have been demonstrated to be effective in changingsexual risk behavior 6-8and can reinforce self-directed behavior change early after diagnosis.9 CDC has identified several prevention interventions for individuals infected with HIV that meet stringentcriteria for efficacy and scientific rigor (http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/research/prs/index.htm ). The following three interventions have proven effective in treatment settings and can be delivered by providers asbrief messages during clinic visits: Partnership for Health (http://effectiveinterventions.org/en/Interventions/PfH.aspx ), Care\" campaign (http://www.actagainstaids.org/provider/pic/index.html ) helps providers (and members of a multidisciplinary care team) integrate simple methods to prevent transmission by HIV-infected individuals into routine care. These prevention interventions are designed toreduce the risk of secondary HIV transmission through sexual contact. The interventions are designed generallyfor implementation at the community or group level, but some can be adapted and administered in clinicalsettings by a multidisciplinary care team. Need for Screening for High-Risk Behaviors The primary care visit provides an opportunity to screen patients for ongoing high-risk drug and sexual behaviors for transmitting HIV infection. Routine screening and symptom-directed testing for and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), as recommended by CDC,10remain essential adjuncts to prevention counseling. Genital ulcers may facilitate HIV transmission and STDs may increase HIV viral load in plasma and genital secretions.7, 11-13They also provide objective evidence of unprotected sexual activity, which should prompt prevention counseling. The contribution of substance and alcohol use to HIV risk behaviors and transmission has been well established in multiple populations;14-18therefore, effective counseling for injection and noninjection drug users is essential to prevent HIV transmission. Identifying the substance(s) of use is important because HIVGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents M-2prevalence, transmission risk, risk behaviors, transmission rates, and potential for pharmacologic intervention all vary according to the type of substance used.19-21Risk-reduction strategies for injection drug users (IDUs), in addition to condom use, include needle exchange and instructions on cleaning drugparaphernalia. Evidence supporting the efficacy of interventions to reduce injection drug use risk behavioralso exists. Interventions include both behavioral strategies 14-15, 22and opiate substitution treatment with methadone or buprenorphine.23-24No successful pharmacologic interventions have been found for cocaine and methamphetamine users; cognitive and behavioral interventions demonstrate the greatest effect onreducing the risk behaviors of these users. 25-27Given the significant impact of cocaine and methamphetamine on sexual risk behavior, reinforcement of sexual risk-reduction strategies is important.14-18, 28 Antiretroviral Therapy as Prevention ART can play an important role in preventing HIV transmission. Lower levels of plasma HIV RNA havebeen associated with decreases in the concentration of virus in genital secretions. 29-32Observational studies have demonstrated the association between low serum or genital HIV RNA and a decreased rate of HIVtransmission among serodiscordant heterosexual couples. 29, 33-34Ecological studies of communities with relatively high concentrations of men who have sex with men (MSM) and IDUs suggest increased use ofART is associated with decreased community viral load and reduced rates of new HIV diagnoses. 35-37These data suggest that the risk of HIV transmission is low when an individual's viral load is below 400copies/mL, 35, 38but the threshold below which transmission of the virus becomes impossible is unknown. Furthermore, to be effective at preventing transmission it is assumed that: (1) ART is capable of durably andcontinuously suppressing viremia; (2) adherence to an effective ARV regimen is high; and (3) there is anabsence of a concomitant STD. Importantly, detection of HIV RNA in genital secretions has beendocumented in individuals with controlled plasma HIV RNA and data describing a differential inconcentration of most ARV drugs in the blood and genital compartments exist. 30, 39At least one case of HIV transmission from a patient with suppressed plasma viral load to a monogamous uninfected sexual partnerhas been reported. 40 In the HPTN 052 trial in HIV-discordant couples, the HIV-infected partners who were ART naive and hadCD4 counts between 350 and 550 cells/mm 3were randomized to initiate or delay ART. In this study, those who initiated ART had a 96% reduction in HIV transmission to the uninfected partners.3Almost all of the participants were in heterosexual relationships, all participants received risk-reduction counseling, and theabsolute number of transmission events was low: 1 among ART initiators and 27 among ART delayers. Overthe course of the study virologic failure rates were less than 5%, a value much lower than generally seen inindividuals taking ART for their own health. These low virologic failure rates suggest high levels ofadherence to ART in the study, which may have been facilitated by the frequency of study follow-up (studyvisits were monthly) and by participants' sense of obligation to protect their uninfected partners. Therefore, caution is indicated when interpreting the extent to which ART for the HIV-infected partner protects seronegative partners in contexts where adherence and, thus, rates of continuous viral suppression, may be lower. Furthermore, for HIV-infected MSM and IDUs, biological and observational data suggest suppressive ART also should protect against transmission, but the actual extent of protection has not been established. Rates of HIV risk behaviors can increase coincidently with the availability of potent combination ART, in some cases almost doubling compared with rates in the era prior to highly effective therapy. 9A meta-analysis demonstrated that the prevalence of unprotected sex acts was increased in HIV-infected individuals who believed that receiving ART or having a suppressed viral load protected against transmitting HIV .41 Attitudinal shifts away from safer sexual practices since the availability of potent ART underscore the role of provider-initiated HIV prevention counseling. With wider recognition that effective treatment decreases the risk of HIV transmission, it is particularly important for providers to help patients understand that a sustained viral load below the limits of detection will dramatically reduce but does not absolutely assure the absence ofGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents M-3HIV in the genital and blood compartments and, hence, the inability to transmit HIV to others.41-42 Maximal suppression of viremia not only depends on the potency of the ARV regimen used but also on the patient's adherence to prescribed therapy. Suboptimal adherence can lead to viremia that not only harms thepatient but also increases his/her risk of transmitting HIV (including drug-resistant strains) via sex or needlesharing. Screening for and treating behavioral conditions that can impact adherence, such as depression andalcohol and substance use, improve overall health and reduce the risk of secondary transmission. Summary Consistent and effective use of ART resulting in a sustained reduction in viral load in conjunction withconsistent condom usage, safer sex and drug use practices, and detection and treatment of STDs are essentialtools for prevention of sexual and blood-borne transmission of HIV . Given these important considerations,medical visits provide a vital opportunity to reinforce HIV prevention messages, discuss sex- and drug-related risk behaviors, diagnose and treat intercurrent STDs, review the importance of medication adherence,and foster open communication between provider and patient.

The Panel appreciates that HIV care is highly complex and rapidlyevolving. Guidelines are never fixed and must always be individualized. Where possible, the Panel has basedrecommendations on the best evidence from prospective trials with defined endpoints. When such evidencedoes not yet exist, the Panel attempted to reflect reasonable options in its conclusions. HIV care requires, as always, partnerships and open communication. The provider can make recommendations most likely to lead to positive outcomes only if the patient's own point of view and socialcontext are well known. Guidelines are only a starting point for medical decision making. They can identifysome of the boundaries of high-quality care but cannot substitute for sound judgment. As further research is conducted and reported, guidelines will be modified. The Panel anticipates continued progress in the simplicity of regimens, improved potency and barrier to resistance, and reduced toxicity. ThePanel hopes the guidelines are useful and is committed to their continued adjustment and improvement.Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents O-1Appendix A: Key to Acronyms (Last updated February 12, 2012; last reviewed February 12, 2012) Drug Name Abbreviations Abbreviation Full Name Full Name ACTG AIDS Clinical Trials Group AIDS acquired immune deficiency syndrome ALT alanine aminotransferase ART antiretroviral therapy ART-CC ART Cohort Collaboration ARV antiretroviral AST aspartate aminotransferase AUC area under the curve A V atrioventricular bDNA branched DNA BID twice daily BMD bone mineral density BMI body mass index BUN blood urea nitrogen cap capsule CAPD chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis CBC complete blood count CCB calcium channel blocker CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CI confidence interval CKD chronic kidney disease Cmax maximum plasma concentration CME continuing medical educationGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents O-3Cmin minimum plasma concentration CMV cytomegalovirus CNICS Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems CNS central nervous system COC combined oral contraceptives P D/M dual or mixed (tropic) D:A:D Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs Study DILI drug-induced liver injury DM diabetes mellitus DMPA depot medroxyprogesterone acetate DOT directly observed therapy DR delayed release DXA dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry EBV Epstein-Barr virus EI entry inhibitor EIA enzyme immunoassay FDA Food and Drug FI fusion inhibitor GHB gamma-hydroxybutyrate GI gastrointestinal HAD HIV-associated dementia HA V hepatitis A virus HBeAg hepatitis B e antigen HBsAg hepatitis B surface antigen HBV hepatitis B virus HCV hepatitis C virus HD hemodialysis HDL high-density lipoproteinGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents O-4HELLP hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (syndrome) HHS Department of Health and Human Services HHV human herpes virus HHV-8 human herpes virus-8 HIV human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HIV-2 human immunodeficiency virus type 2 HIV AN HIV-associated nephropathy HLA human leukocyte antigen HPV human papilloma virus HR hazard ratio HRSA Resource Administration high-sensitivity C-reactive human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 HTLV-2 human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 IAS-USA International Antiviral Society-USA IC inhibitory concentration IDU normalized ratio INSTI integrase strand transfer inhibitor IQ inhibitory quotient IRB Institutional Review Board IRIS immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome IUD intrauterine device IV Intravenous LDL low-density lipoprotein LTBI latent tuberculosis infectionGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents O-5MAC Mycobacterium avium MDR multidrug-resistant MDRD modification of diet in renal disease histocompatability complex MI myocardial infarction msec Mycobacterium tuberculosis MTCT mother-to-child transmission NA-ACCORD The North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design NIH National Institutes of Health NNRTI non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor NRTI Office of AIDS Research OARAC Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council OI opportunistic infection PAH pulmonary arterial hypertension PCP system PO orally PPI proton pump inhibitor PR protease prothrombin corrected for heart rate RT reverse transcriptase (gene)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents O-6RT-PCR reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction SJS Stevens-Johnson syndrome soln solution SPT skin patch test STD sexually transmitted disease SVR sustained virologic response SWP suggested wholesale price t\u00bdhalf-life tab tablet TAM thymidine analogue mutation TB tuberculosis TCA tricyclic antidepressant TDM therapeutic drug monitoring TEN toxic epidermal necrosis TG triglyceride the Panel Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents TID three times daily TST valproic acid WBC white blood cell WHO World Health Organization WITS Women and Infants Transmission Study XDR extensively drug-resistant XR extended releaseGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents P-1Generic Name (Abbreviation)/ Trade NameFormulationsDosing Recommendations (For dosage adjustment in renal or hepatic insufficiency, see Appendix B, Table 7 .)EliminationSerum/ see 13 .)
